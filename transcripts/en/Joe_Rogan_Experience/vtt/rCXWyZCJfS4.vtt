<v Speaker 1>The first fight is,</v>

110
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>we've got to sync this up so you guys know we're watching the fights and doing</v>

111
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>commentary sort of,</v>

112

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

113
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>we're not really doing commentary,</v>

114
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>but we're watching the fights and doing a podcast at the same time.</v>

115
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea behind these.</v>

150
00:04:00.351 --> 00:04:01.170
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

151
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.380
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to talk to that show round forever.</v>

152
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Do that.</v>

00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:07.244
<v Speaker 2>That means you're gay.</v>

155
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.143
<v Speaker 2>The rainbow,</v>

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.220
<v Speaker 2>that's different.</v>

157
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.401
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

158
00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:11.181

00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:12.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a UFC thing.</v>

160
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:13.070
<v Speaker 2>The camera's on you.</v>

161
00:04:13.071 --> 00:04:13.904
<v Speaker 2>You got your thing.</v>

162
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.571
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

163
00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:15.770
<v Speaker 2>like the CIC referee,</v>

164
00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:16.850
<v Speaker 2>what's her name with the blonde hair?</v>

165
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.511
<v Speaker 2>She goes like this.</v>

166
00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

167
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.753
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

168
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.100
<v Speaker 2>She goes like both.</v>

169
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.280
<v Speaker 2>But that's box and,</v>

170
00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 2>and she,</v>

171
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.430
<v Speaker 2>she could be the mills lane of a MMA,</v>

172
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.760
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

173
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.350
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a octagon girl,</v>

174
00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:28.700
<v Speaker 2>you gotta do something right.</v>

175
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 2>You just can't wave y'all do something.</v>

176
00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:31.580
<v Speaker 2>You know what Herb Dean,</v>

177
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:33.110
<v Speaker 2>he just calls whatever.</v>

178
00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:33.944
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

179
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.113
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want it.</v>

180
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's like,</v>

181
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.250
<v Speaker 2>cause that's our moment.</v>

182
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.971
<v Speaker 2>The referee,</v>

183
00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 2>that's their moment where they're in the spotlight right now.</v>

184
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.210
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do something,</v>

185
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Mario Yamasaki said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hand size.</v>

195
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Never been a guy like Bruce buffer that you could talk into doing a ThreeSixty</v>

196
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.930
<v Speaker 2>pretty agile.</v>

197
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.690
<v Speaker 2>He did a three 60 used to do the one 80.</v>

198
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.910
<v Speaker 2>We were all sitting there a fucking three 60 it was the greatest thing ever.</v>

199
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.710
<v Speaker 2>We blew his knee out.</v>

200
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.341
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

201
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:07.461
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

202
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:07.611
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

203
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:08.720
<v Speaker 2>He blows me out jumping.</v>

204
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.973
<v Speaker 2>He was jumping,</v>

205
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.311
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

206
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him in the gym with cables doing the Bruce Buffer</v>

207
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 2>resistance training and telling you why he's doing it to fucking staring into</v>

208
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.641
<v Speaker 2>the gym.</v>

209
00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I hear a commitment,</v>

210
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.360
<v Speaker 2>a hybrid in front of everyone,</v>

211
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:28.340
<v Speaker 2>like oh for sure relaxed man.</v>

212
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.330
<v Speaker 2>He's doing resistant bay.</v>

213
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:30.800
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

214
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I bet a little spot for sure.</v>

215
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:34.980
<v Speaker 2>It'd be took a little cup of water and that would help as well cause he's Kinda</v>

216
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 2>doing copper wire.</v>

217
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.011
<v Speaker 2>So meanwhile,</v>

218
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:41.810
<v Speaker 2>not to be disrespectful to these gentlemen that are engaging in mortal combat</v>

219
00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:42.644
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

220
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Homeboy on top was a minus 1000 when's the last time saw?</v>

221
00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:48.140
<v Speaker 2>It might it's 1000 what does that mean?</v>

222
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.040
<v Speaker 2>That means a,</v>

223
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.690
<v Speaker 2>he's a heavy favorite to win the fight heavy,</v>

224
00:05:53.691 --> 00:05:53.961
<v Speaker 2>heavy.</v>

225
00:05:53.961 --> 00:05:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Favorite 1000 is like 10 to one right?</v>

226
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he was?</v>

227
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Who made these odds?</v>

228
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.773
<v Speaker 2>Sean Shelby.</v>

229
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.891
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

230
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:01.724
<v Speaker 2>It makes it,</v>

231
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.051
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't know.</v>

232
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

233
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're way off.</v>

234
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

235
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

236
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.210
<v Speaker 2>I like tough to bed.</v>

237
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I've hooked Aubrey up a bunch of times where I was like that line is crazy.</v>

238
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Like you got a guy coming in from somewhere else and people might not know and</v>

239
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.600
<v Speaker 2>the Vegas guys might have never seen him fight before.</v>

240
00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 2>He like get the fuck Outta here with this line.</v>

241
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 2>This line is ridiculous.</v>

242
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 2>You got to wonder who's making those.</v>

243
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:20.781
<v Speaker 2>They probably,</v>

244
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 2>they're not too educated.</v>

245
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

246
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Like especially on the undercard is there's been some ones in the past.</v>

247
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.781
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

248
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 2>like when Wonderboy Thompson was fighting</v>

249
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.853
<v Speaker 2>was he?</v>

250
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

251
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.811
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't wonderful.</v>

252
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 2>It was another Rick,</v>

253
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 2>really good striker.</v>

254
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll remember as a punk.</v>

255
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 2>And I mentioned Sean Shelby because not because like he's an idiot.</v>

256
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

257
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I only said that because he would,</v>

258
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 2>he's the only one who would know the thousand minus a thousand.</v>

259
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know these guys,</v>

260
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I would just say it's even right.</v>

261
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 2>But if you really know like Sha only a guy like Shawn shelving studies,</v>

262
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>these guys would go do the bad guy's terrible.</v>

263
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:54.810
<v Speaker 2>And this other guys that are running,</v>

264
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 2>who knows everybody.</v>

265
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in all the records.</v>

266
00:06:58.671 --> 00:06:58.821

<v Speaker 2>No one knows more about.</v>

271
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.330

272
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.770
<v Speaker 2>like how to execute things are where things are gone.</v>

273
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It's that funded as far as how many like guys who know fighters and know who's</v>

274
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:19.220
<v Speaker 2>fighting and winning.</v>

275
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Joe Silva knows more than anybody.</v>

276
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 2>No one to make your heart drop more than when you on your cell phone,</v>

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I was doing</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's one of those old like old TV footage.</v>

345
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 3>It looks like an old Muhammad Ali type.</v>

346
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:13.854
<v Speaker 3>Just old,</v>

347
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 3>but you could see my face is purple where you got to go out.</v>

348
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:21.651
<v Speaker 3>When I was about to go out there and then I didn't want to show any weakness,</v>

349
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.240
<v Speaker 3>so I stood up really quick and like I got looking like I was going to shoot,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're going to shoot,</v>

351
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.960
<v Speaker 3>but meanwhile I'm drunk as fuck.</v>

353
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 3>you just pretend like nothing's wrong.</v>

354
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 3>I was like taking shots and shit.</v>

355
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.460

<v Speaker 3>But that's how purple my head was.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

371
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Even though Weidman in Belfort was that the match,</v>

372
00:10:14.451 --> 00:10:15.284
<v Speaker 3>if there was canceled,</v>

373
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.960
<v Speaker 3>even though that,</v>

374
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 3>that would have been a great fucking match.</v>

375
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Any match said Weidman in any match.</v>

376
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 3>That part is great,</v>

377
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.913
<v Speaker 3>but seriously,</v>

378
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 3>I love watching Ronda cause you know a million percent.</v>

379
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 3>She's going to come after.</v>

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.313
<v Speaker 3>She's from the,</v>

381
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>I think she gets hypnotized,</v>

382
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.463
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

383
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.230
<v Speaker 3>I think she's the only one that's listening to Mike Tyson.</v>

384
00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson told everybody,</v>

385
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.410
<v Speaker 3>everybody on Howard Stern,</v>

386
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:38.244
<v Speaker 3>he told everybody,</v>

387
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 3>he said custom model was really into hypnotizing me at before every one of those</v>

388
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 3>big fights in the day I was sitting at ties.</v>

389
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.380
<v Speaker 3>He brought in a real witness.</v>

390
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.180
<v Speaker 3>He said because the model was actually an amateur hypnotists himself,</v>

391
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 3>but he brought in a real legit guy before every fight they hypnotize shit and he</v>

392
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.700
<v Speaker 3>stopped getting into ties after customer don't get its own to hit and tells me</v>

394
00:10:56.941 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 3>how can learn?</v>

395
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's getting it straight.</v>

396
00:10:58.501 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 3>The conditioning coach,</v>

397
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.091
<v Speaker 3>they're going to need it.</v>

398
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 3>You get to coach a wrestling coach,</v>

399
00:11:01.141 --> 00:11:03.580
<v Speaker 3>striking coach and a hypnotist whose written the test dummies.</v>

400
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

401
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get to that point eventually when people realize or as Mike Tyson</v>

402
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 3>bat shit crazy.</v>

406
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't it make sense?</v>

407
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 3>You have to accept it like if you're resistant.</v>

408
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 3>We know Joe Schilling.</v>

<v Speaker 2>puts them to sleep face plants cause fucking chaos.</v>

437
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Then he fights Wayne Barrett to do to also had beat him before.</v>

438
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Beats him by decision.</v>

439
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Barrett's a bad motherfucker.</v>

440
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Then he goes into the main event and fights are Levin.</v>

441
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Who's if it shillings not the best leavens the best.</v>

442
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.681
<v Speaker 2>It's like those two.</v>

443
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Cause Schilling had already beat 11 you know,</v>

444
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.010
<v Speaker 2>he dropped him and hit him with a knee on the way down.</v>

445
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.840
<v Speaker 2>A devastating fight for 11 but Schilling and 11 oh they're like fucking right</v>

446
00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:53.020
<v Speaker 2>there man.</v>

447
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean eleven's a piece we asked to fight leaven in the fucking finals.</v>

448
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's insane for fucking rounds with Simon [inaudible] Bruce kickboxing.</v>

449
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.541
<v Speaker 2>It's same,</v>

450
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

451
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Three times in the night is insane.</v>

452
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Speaker 2>So someone could easily die from like something like that.</v>

453
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.890
<v Speaker 2>He's got to stop that and we were talking about this the time.</v>

454
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:11.951
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

455
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 2>he's doing that now.</v>

456
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 2>This guy Vinny sharp.</v>

457
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Everyone isn't getting hypnotized.</v>

458
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.870
<v Speaker 2>What's going on baby?</v>

459
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I'll call smear about code.</v>

460
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.270
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

461
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 2>you have heard like Randy couture talk about the importance of having a sports</v>

462
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:24.844
<v Speaker 2>psychologist.</v>

463
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's just a nice way of saying like maybe Randy couture was hypnotized</v>

464
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 2>because when he came out then he seemed like he had zero fear.</v>

465
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Randy couture came.</v>

466
00:13:32.731 --> 00:13:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll never showed an ounce of fear.</v>

467
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 2>My tie thing came out,</v>

468
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.610
<v Speaker 2>never showed an ounce of fear.</v>

469
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 2>He came from the ghetto.</v>

470
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Granite Catuit came from white people neighborhoods.</v>

471
00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:42.244
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

472
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

473
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.160
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

474
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.160
<v Speaker 2>So are you came out with zero theater but Randy couture had that captain America</v>

475
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 2>added.</v>

476
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.570
<v Speaker 2>They made Mike Tyson had that attitude like I'm gonna fucking Rachel.</v>

477
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Andy said the reason he wasn't nervous cause he accepted losing.</v>

478
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:55.781
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

479
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

480
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 2>They make different white people in Oregon.</v>

481
00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:58.541
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

482
00:13:58.541 --> 00:13:59.590
<v Speaker 2>They make different white people.</v>

483
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.483
<v Speaker 2>Doris,</v>

484
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:03.931
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

488
00:14:08.371 --> 00:14:09.204
<v Speaker 2>right arm.</v>

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:10.470
<v Speaker 2>How do you like to do this?</v>

490
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Just so many different ways to close this off.</v>

491
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:13.590
<v Speaker 2>How do you like to do a hook?</v>

492
00:14:13.591 --> 00:14:15.150
<v Speaker 2>That top leg with your right leg,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the top leg did left leg,</v>

494
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 2>hip champion neckties love the Japanese.</v>

495
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.770
<v Speaker 2>The Japanese necktie to me seems stronger than some guys.</v>

496
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.231
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

497

<v Speaker 2>carotid arteries or whatever it is.</v>

00:14:29.731 --> 00:14:34.200

517
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Gives him that feeling of getting that gets heat on in the mountain.</v>

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I got Lavard Johnson's,</v>

522

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I had it locked up and I was,</v>

526
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:17.871
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

527
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:17.961
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

528
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 2>this one's over and he's going laughing,</v>

529
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.320
<v Speaker 2>laughing as it's on and punching me in the face.</v>

530
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Just so much fucking muscle just did not.</v>

531
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.090
<v Speaker 2>It did not.</v>

532
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:28.923
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

533
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 2>He pissed hot for that fight.</v>

534
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:30.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

535
00:15:30.541 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 2>we ain't got cut right after that.</v>

536
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Who's this guy?</v>

537
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Lavard Johnson.</v>

538
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Lavard Johnson is not the most skillful guy,</v>

539
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 2>but let me tell you something.</v>

540
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:41.210
<v Speaker 2>He hits as hard as any human being I've ever seen hit someone in the heavyweight</v>

541
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:41.810
<v Speaker 2>division.</v>

542
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.600
<v Speaker 2>He hits so fucking hard when he at Pat Barry,</v>

543
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

544
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ and Pat Barry.</v>

545
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 2>That was the first guy.</v>

546
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.550
<v Speaker 2>What check Congo was the first guy to Cayo with him owed Pat Barry.</v>

547
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.900
<v Speaker 2>But the Lavar Johnson fight was a little more shocking to me because I was like,</v>

548
00:15:56.901 --> 00:15:57.111
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

549
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I thought that Barry would be able to out technique.</v>

550
00:15:59.061 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 2>This dude.</v>

551
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I thought there would be a lot of that heavy right leg kick that he throws and</v>

552
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

553
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.933
<v Speaker 2>Pat Barry was,</v>

554
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 2>you know like a Shane del Rosario fight.</v>

555
00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:09.110
<v Speaker 2>He had good success against really high level kickboxers.</v>

556
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.711
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

557
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be a hard on,</v>

558
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.260
<v Speaker 2>but lavar hitch,</v>

559
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:16.190
<v Speaker 2>so fucking hard upper cut dude.</v>

560
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.080
<v Speaker 2>He's got some life changing,</v>

561
00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:18.914
<v Speaker 2>punching power,</v>

562
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.373
<v Speaker 2>not even close.</v>

563
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.190
<v Speaker 2>He's got that life changing,</v>

564
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:23.030
<v Speaker 2>punching power.</v>

565
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking such a meathead.</v>

566
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.590
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

567
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Who's such a me?</v>

568
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 2>The lavar who has bars especially which car when his due,</v>

569
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:33.050
<v Speaker 2>he said you're going to get a hypnotist.</v>

570
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I might have to man maybe.</v>

571
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:36.381
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

572
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

573
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 2>How come more people who are on the shit,</v>

574
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 2>my tiny going is telling you he's the only guy in the history of fighting who</v>

575
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 2>went out there scared the living bejesus bejesus out of his opponents.</v>

576
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:52.270
<v Speaker 2>No fighter in history had a lineup of opponents that were visibly terrified in</v>

577
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:53.780
<v Speaker 2>the rink.</v>

578
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.411

<v Speaker 2>She knows that's where he lives right there.</v>

637
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.950
<v Speaker 2>When you transitioned that you kind of get a free Shin to the face too,</v>

638
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Adam guys,</v>

642
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 2>a good Kamora grip.</v>

643
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:52.981
<v Speaker 2>If it's solid,</v>

644
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 2>it takes a long time to master just holding onto that grip.</v>

645
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not really about the Camorra these days.</v>

646
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 2>It's more about just getting the grip to get better positions.</v>

647
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:02.670
<v Speaker 2>You can get the back from there.</v>

648
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.331
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

649
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:04.081

656
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.390
<v Speaker 2>As soon as the left arm was free,</v>

657
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 2>he popped it right behind his back.</v>

658
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

659

<v Speaker 2>very nice.</v>

660
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 2>It could be.</v>

661
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying the cooler is not possible.</v>

662
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.501
<v Speaker 2>Obvious as possible,</v>

663
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's Ah,</v>

664
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 2>generally now it's an art in itself.</v>

665
00:19:20.641 --> 00:19:25.641
<v Speaker 2>You can put a whole DDB out on jumping on a Cora grip in every position and how</v>

666
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.430

675
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 2>That could be,</v>

676
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.820
<v Speaker 2>it could be it's own style.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And then into deep waters cause hobbies known for his cardio and that's like his</v>

725
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:00.791
<v Speaker 4>style.</v>

00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 4>He likes to wear her out.</v>

727
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

732
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:08.591
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't do that at all.</v>

733
00:21:08.591 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 4>He went after him ruin after Gary Tonin but it's so hard.</v>

734
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.820
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to tap out Gary toner.</v>

735
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 4>That's tough.</v>

736
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:17.590
<v Speaker 4>Tough.</v>

737
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 4>You know what I was really impressed with?</v>

738
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was really impressed with Gary Torrin's triangle,</v>

739
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.030
<v Speaker 4>but hobbies,</v>

740
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 4>defense is insane.</v>

741
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:24.161
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

742
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:25.030
<v Speaker 4>He defended all,</v>

743
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:25.990
<v Speaker 4>Gary told his leg locks.</v>

744
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:27.170
<v Speaker 4>That's what Gary's known for.</v>

745
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.070
<v Speaker 4>Gary's on for known for leg locks to do it.</v>

746
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:31.691
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

747
00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:33.940
<v Speaker 4>I just try with lister and he says he didn't get near my feet.</v>

748
00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.530
<v Speaker 4>It was a real good there.</v>

749
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

750
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 4>He or he already had amazing leg lock defense.</v>

751
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:43.440
<v Speaker 4>He trained with Erik Paul send down at CSW like hobby was very hard,</v>

752
00:21:43.441 --> 00:21:44.240
<v Speaker 4>a leg lock.</v>

753
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.830
<v Speaker 4>I was going to be a hard thing to do and he,</v>

754
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:52.020
<v Speaker 4>he spent a lot of extra time with leg locked defense because that's Gary's go to</v>

755
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:52.541
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

756
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:53.560
<v Speaker 4>But he got kind of a triangle.</v>

757
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.020
<v Speaker 4>Gary.</v>

758
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 4>Tony got all kinds of games.</v>

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.893
<v Speaker 4>He's got everything.</v>

760
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:56.853
<v Speaker 4>He's got everything.</v>

761
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.450
<v Speaker 4>That triangle is so beautiful to,</v>

762
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 4>to set it up on a guy like Havi from your side like that,</v>

763
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.630
<v Speaker 4>lock it in and then just go through like every step of the way.</v>

764
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 4>It's like hobby couldn't stop it.</v>

765
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

766
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:06.611
<v Speaker 4>he's just,</v>

767
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:07.000
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>

768
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.930
<v Speaker 4>he won his match.</v>

769
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.321
<v Speaker 4>Gary.</v>

770
00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Title one is matching Polaris.</v>

771
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.040
<v Speaker 4>He beat Marcy and he leg locked him.</v>

772
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:13.130
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

773
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 4>before that Metamorris against uh,</v>

774
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 4>Zach Maxwell.</v>

775
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 4>You leg locked him and then before that,</v>

776
00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 4>the other metamorris he did against Kit Dale.</v>

777
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.110
<v Speaker 4>Guillotine him.</v>

778
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.760
<v Speaker 4>He's not just leg locks.</v>

779
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:25.960
<v Speaker 4>His leg locks are vicious.</v>

780
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Does he do and Nogi or just g?</v>

781
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

782
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.960
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't do as well.</v>

783
00:22:29.961 --> 00:22:31.160
<v Speaker 4>And the gay because uh,</v>

784
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 4>he's just not a points guy.</v>

785
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:33.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a whole different game.</v>

786
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.120
<v Speaker 4>There's a points style and then there's a submission only style.</v>

787
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.890
<v Speaker 4>Two different completely like the way you were trained for those tournaments.</v>

788
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:42.724
<v Speaker 4>It's totally different.</v>

789
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:43.571
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

790
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 4>no one gives a shit about the points.</v>

791
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:45.580
<v Speaker 4>Only ones.</v>

792
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 4>They don't care if it's points only and it doesn't go to a submission.</v>

793
00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:51.160
<v Speaker 4>It just feels like it feels kind of fucked up.</v>

794
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 4>But when you're watching these fights like these fights,</v>

795
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 4>integration nationals,</v>

796
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.660

797
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.131

799
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Then Abi,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you'll get your kitchen good.</v>

817
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 4>You could catch it.</v>

818
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.070
<v Speaker 4>You might not get to the end,</v>

819
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.620
<v Speaker 4>but it's not going to be at a 16 man tournament.</v>

820
00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Can take an hour and a half or it could take two hours and a half.</v>

821
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.780
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

822
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

823
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 1>like a Badass documentary.</v>

824
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't know the first eight matches,</v>

825
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 1>the preliminary is by the time you get to the finals,</v>

826
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to know those finalists very,</v>

827
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>

828
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.050
<v Speaker 1>so when you go see a 60 man tournament,</v>

829
00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 1>each match one at a time,</v>

830
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 1>it really is like a documentary.</v>

831
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:01.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like UFC too.</v>

832
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:02.803
<v Speaker 1>Remember that Shit.</v>

833
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.660
<v Speaker 1>You got to see it all unfold where you don't really get to see that much.</v>

834
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Where do you get to see that?</v>

835
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Where do you get to see a tournament unfold like that and Laurie glory.</v>

836
00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:12.590

838
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

839
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.881
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

840
00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:14.031
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

841
00:24:14.031 --> 00:24:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Was that last insane?</v>

842
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

843
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the only other place I think they should stop that.</v>

844
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.633
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

845
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big Fan of glory.</v>

846
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Glory to be successful.</v>

847
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 1>You just use different tones.</v>

848
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.533
<v Speaker 1>You can do</v>

849
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.260
<v Speaker 1>100% that's very different.</v>

850
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean for glory.</v>

851
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.650
<v Speaker 1>But for a straight kickboxing is,</v>

852
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:34.700
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about that Ben?</v>

853
00:24:34.701 --> 00:24:35.590
<v Speaker 1>You're active fighter.</v>

854
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.490
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about like pull up that microphone man.</v>

855
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.190
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the idea of fighting like that?</v>

856
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Like a Gloria event?</v>

857
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Like it's Kinda dangerous,</v>

858
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:42.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

859
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Three times in a night.</v>

860
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's definitely dangerous,</v>

861
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:45.231
<v Speaker 5>but it's also,</v>

862
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:46.070
<v Speaker 5>if you're doing it,</v>

863
00:24:46.071 --> 00:24:47.600
<v Speaker 5>you're doing it as like,</v>

864
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:49.723
<v Speaker 5>that's the,</v>

865
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 5>that's the goal is it's so crazy how many people are really willing to</v>

866
00:24:54.351 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Speaker 5>participate in this and really go try to become the champion of that night.</v>

867
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what got me in the fight and when I saw the UFC back in the day,</v>

868
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:04.390
<v Speaker 5>it was tournament's.</v>

869
00:25:04.391 --> 00:25:04.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

870
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.140
<v Speaker 5>Tournament's all in one night.</v>

871
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.010
<v Speaker 5>It was nuts.</v>

872
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 5>There's so much circumstance and I guess there could be luck.</v>

873
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:12.561
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

874
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 5>you can win with a head kick,</v>

875
00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:14.720
<v Speaker 5>Butt break your foot.</v>

876
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.480
<v Speaker 5>Right now you're going along,</v>

877
00:25:17.481 --> 00:25:17.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

878
00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:20.200
<v Speaker 5>either of trying to fight through it or you,</v>

879
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.350
<v Speaker 5>you have to bow out.</v>

880
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:23.470
<v Speaker 5>And that's like Steve Genom.</v>

881
00:25:23.471 --> 00:25:25.760
<v Speaker 5>Remember when Steve Genom one cause Hawaii's couldn't go on.</v>

882
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.313
<v Speaker 5>Steve Gentleman,</v>

883
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.690
<v Speaker 5>no one really remembers him.</v>

884
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.320
<v Speaker 5>Those new changes versus like the pride tournament's when it's like</v>

885
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.590
<v Speaker 1>this month they're going to fight,</v>

886
00:25:34.591 --> 00:25:35.760
<v Speaker 1>then we'll have the next thing,</v>

887
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.650
<v Speaker 1>but to have it all in one night.</v>

888
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.281
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

889
00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

890
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.823
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do it.</v>

891
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I love the pride style.</v>

892
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I think we know price point.</v>

893
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I think we know too much about like getting damaged and then cooling off and</v>

894
00:25:48.041 --> 00:25:49.650
<v Speaker 1>then going back and getting more damaged.</v>

895
00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:50.671
<v Speaker 1>We know what that's like.</v>

896
00:25:50.671 --> 00:25:52.500
<v Speaker 1>The ramifications are like multiplied,</v>

897
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.800
<v Speaker 1>like you're getting all these concussions and then you're going to go and have</v>

898
00:25:55.801 --> 00:25:56.730
<v Speaker 1>another fight.</v>

899
00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.900
<v Speaker 1>How much are those boys getting paid over and glory?</v>

900
00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

901
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Does anyone know what they did?</v>

902
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.530
<v Speaker 1>A great,</v>

903
00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:05.820
<v Speaker 1>great zero idea.</v>

904
00:26:05.821 --> 00:26:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to speculate,</v>

905
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.290
<v Speaker 1>but they're walking by a calm,</v>

906
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.550
<v Speaker 1>but my take is this could work because they're on Viacom.</v>

907
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.600
<v Speaker 1>They're on fucking spike TV and spike TV's making Friday night just combat</v>

908
00:26:18.601 --> 00:26:19.300
<v Speaker 1>sports night.</v>

909
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Bella tour one time,</v>

910
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.160
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing at a time to do in golden glory boxing.</v>

911
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.143
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be great,</v>

912
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.240
<v Speaker 1>but if people just pay attention,</v>

913
00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Gloria is going to be huge.</v>

914
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.311
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those,</v>

915
00:26:29.311 --> 00:26:30.150
<v Speaker 1>it can't mess.</v>

916
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.020
<v Speaker 1>They just have to do like what the UFC did is the UFC put the ultimate fighter</v>

917
00:26:34.021 --> 00:26:38.490
<v Speaker 1>together and they spent $44 million in losses before the ultimate fighter became</v>

918
00:26:38.491 --> 00:26:38.820
<v Speaker 1>a hit.</v>

919
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.800
<v Speaker 1>So it was like they were real close to getting out.</v>

920
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Gloria's got to do the same thing.</v>

921
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.460
<v Speaker 1>If glory can out how,</v>

922
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

923
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.240
<v Speaker 3>hang in there,</v>

924
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.860
<v Speaker 3>that fucking thing could take off.</v>

925
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 3>It's exciting.</v>

926
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 3>It's shit man.</v>

927
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

928
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody wants to see stand up fighting people.</v>

929
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 3>If everybody fought the way Gary tonin fights or the way Marcella Garcia fights,</v>

930
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 3>people would love to see Nogi Jujitsu too.</v>

931
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Just like people love to see boxing too,</v>

932
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 3>but you want to talk about like pure excitement,</v>

933
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.110
<v Speaker 3>like kickboxing is right up there with MMA.</v>

934
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like high level kickboxer with the best guys are going at it.</v>

935
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 3>It's some wild shit goes down that fucking Raymond Daniels Dude with those wild</v>

936
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 3>three 60 in the air spin kicks like a fucking video game.</v>

937
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.610
<v Speaker 3>He talks dude's out with like video game shit.</v>

938
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.460
<v Speaker 3>He threw a jumping sidekick.</v>

939
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.720
<v Speaker 3>Eddie touched the guy in the chest and then spun with a spinning back kick to</v>

940
00:27:27.721 --> 00:27:29.160
<v Speaker 3>his face in the air.</v>

941
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Speaker 3>It was insane.</v>

942
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 3>It was some fucking literally some video cam shit.</v>

943
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.680
<v Speaker 3>Well he was a bad ass point fighter.</v>

944
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.240
<v Speaker 3>He was a bad ass points.</v>

945
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:40.074
<v Speaker 3>Herati fighter.</v>

946
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:40.770
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>

947
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.600
<v Speaker 3>it was taekwondo or karate.</v>

948
00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean whatever it is,</v>

949
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.050
<v Speaker 3>the lines are getting blurry with all those.</v>

950
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.131
<v Speaker 3>They're getting real.</v>

951
00:27:47.131 --> 00:27:48.750
<v Speaker 3>The techniques are going to real close.</v>

952
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a tough fight,</v>

953
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.180
<v Speaker 3>which Zingano.</v>

954
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:51.661
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be,</v>

955
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:53.360
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be Rhonda stuff is challenged,</v>

956
00:27:53.361 --> 00:27:54.870
<v Speaker 3>but I think she'll pass the test.</v>

957
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:56.910
<v Speaker 3>What if you just rip right through her again?</v>

958
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:57.670
<v Speaker 3>She's just like,</v>

959
00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:01.230
<v Speaker 3>everybody is a new challenge for Ronda and then she just fucks him all up,</v>

960
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

961
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's probably,</v>

962
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

963
00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.630
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a crazy fight.</v>

964
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I believe I'm here to say that I believe Rhonda gets hypnotized before she</v>

965
00:28:09.661 --> 00:28:10.494
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>

966
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying.</v>

967
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.030
<v Speaker 3>What'd you clarify those she might,</v>

968
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.740
<v Speaker 3>she gets,</v>

969
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.573
<v Speaker 3>she comes eyes.</v>

970
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Look at the way she comes up and you know,</v>

971
00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:16.980

980
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I'll keep it nice and lessons together.</v>

00:28:31.381 --> 00:28:32.760
<v Speaker 3>They got the blue belts together.</v>

989
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:47.850
<v Speaker 3>She could go on a three week binge,</v>

990
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:48.684
<v Speaker 3>no sleep.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

997
00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:56.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying she is.</v>

998
00:28:56.941 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying she could.</v>

999
00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.280
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't saying that in all right.</v>

1000
00:28:59.281 --> 00:29:00.114
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

1001
00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.383
<v Speaker 3>You know what you mean?</v>

1002
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:04.891
<v Speaker 3>You know what man,</v>

1003
00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 3>it's really about Cyborg.</v>

1004
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Drop it down to one 35 unless we mean we don't know man and gone or you look at</v>

1005
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 3>that combination she finished me should take with,</v>

1006
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.570
<v Speaker 3>she's fucking ferocious slow has got more competition that all those girls</v>

1007
00:29:18.871 --> 00:29:19.590
<v Speaker 3>combined.</v>

1008
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.450
<v Speaker 3>So like when she walks up with that stare like she's,</v>

1009
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.000
<v Speaker 3>she's been down that pole.</v>

1010
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.970
<v Speaker 3>She's been walking in that aisle for fucking years and are striking.</v>

1011
00:29:26.971 --> 00:29:27.850
<v Speaker 3>It's getting good now.</v>

1012
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.350
<v Speaker 3>You gotta worry about that shit now.</v>

1013
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1014
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.200
<v Speaker 3>And touch them.</v>

1015
00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.093
<v Speaker 3>She bought there.</v>

1016
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.880
<v Speaker 3>She's not the girl every thought she grounded poner out and then they go,</v>

1017
00:29:35.881 --> 00:29:36.131
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

1018
00:29:36.131 --> 00:29:36.810

1019
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:37.111
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1020
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:38.310
<v Speaker 3>it was the thrill bullshit.</v>

1021
00:29:38.311 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>She hit her and knocked her out and then need her so quickly and then through</v>

1022
00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 3>her before anybody knew she was out.</v>

1023
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.910
<v Speaker 3>She landed that before she does that.</v>

1024
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 3>The code.</v>

1025
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.101
<v Speaker 3>Who Was it?</v>

1026
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Sarah McMahon that she fucked up with the meat before that mean Jessamine.</v>

1027
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Duke was telling me weeks before she's killing what the knee she's,</v>

1028
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 3>she like dropped jasmine Duke with the knee,</v>

1029
00:29:56.411 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 3>like in training to jasmine said she's got crazy needs.</v>

1030
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.730
<v Speaker 3>Ron has gotten and I whoa</v>

1031
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:04.323
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>

1032
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.321
<v Speaker 3>the girls that,</v>

1033
00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:06.154
<v Speaker 3>her friends,</v>

1034
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.650
<v Speaker 3>their roommates and she said she really wasn't training with them.</v>

1035
00:30:08.651 --> 00:30:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Should beat him up so bad.</v>

1036
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:10.541
<v Speaker 3>The coach was like,</v>

1037
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:10.711
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1038
00:30:10.711 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 3>we need,</v>

1039
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.220
<v Speaker 3>we need dudes up in there.</v>

1040
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.940
<v Speaker 3>We need some fucking dude's.</v>

1041
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.700
<v Speaker 3>You imagine though that the uncommon woman,</v>

1042
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.030
<v Speaker 3>the pressure of that kind of training all the three,</v>

1043
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.553
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

1044
00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.800
<v Speaker 3>That's why she's just as an ultra winner.</v>

1045
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.910
<v Speaker 3>You know it's going to take another ultra winter but marina then she tried with</v>

1046
00:30:27.911 --> 00:30:30.130
<v Speaker 3>her still or no shit.</v>

1047
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Your guess is as good as mine.</v>

1048
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.280
<v Speaker 3>You know it'd be bad ass if Ron has said,</v>

1049
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:34.263
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1050
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck about the steroids.</v>

1051
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Let that bitch just,</v>

1052
00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.510
<v Speaker 3>steroids are still fine.</v>

1053
00:30:38.511 --> 00:30:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Her steroids or not,</v>

1054
00:30:39.461 --> 00:30:41.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm still going to know or want to say that man.</v>

1055
00:30:41.141 --> 00:30:41.910
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to say that,</v>

1056
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:42.001
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1057
00:30:42.001 --> 00:30:43.690
<v Speaker 3>you need to loss and Gina Carano fight.</v>

1058
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:44.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1059
00:30:44.101 --> 00:30:45.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1060
00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:46.701
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

1061
00:30:46.701 --> 00:30:47.011
<v Speaker 3>Would it be,</v>

1062
00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:50.710
<v Speaker 3>and she said she came out and said that that would be the most gangster thing</v>

1063
00:30:50.711 --> 00:30:53.830
<v Speaker 3>that CyBorD gene kratos elevator shit.</v>

1064
00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:54.551
<v Speaker 3>They was just like,</v>

1065
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:55.150
<v Speaker 3>dear God,</v>

1066
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.590
<v Speaker 3>someone fighters in the UFC are doing like you have an opponent,</v>

1067
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.590
<v Speaker 3>you know the guys roid into the guilty,</v>

1068
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.330
<v Speaker 3>but you don't say like,</v>

1069
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:04.901
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1070
00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:05.810
<v Speaker 3>You don't bring that out,</v>

1071
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.390
<v Speaker 3>can't you just like you accept it.</v>

1072
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:07.691
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1073
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:08.620
<v Speaker 3>of course he is.</v>

1074
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Look at the guy we're going to fight.</v>

1075
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.190
<v Speaker 3>You don't even bring up the steroids.</v>

1076
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.850
<v Speaker 3>A couple of people like Chad Mendez brought it up or someone brought it up.</v>

1077
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.721
<v Speaker 3>A couple of guys do.</v>

1078
00:31:16.721 --> 00:31:18.400
<v Speaker 3>But you generally,</v>

1079
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.020
<v Speaker 3>you know that there's a good,</v>

1080
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.730
<v Speaker 3>there's a good chance that your opponent,</v>

1081
00:31:21.731 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 3>it's probably on some shit,</v>

1082
00:31:22.871 --> 00:31:23.051
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1083
00:31:23.051 --> 00:31:23.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1084
00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:26.130
<v Speaker 3>but this is a guy can do.</v>

1085
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.220
<v Speaker 3>It would be like if you've got to weigh in from Rogan,</v>

1086
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:30.551
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1087
00:31:30.551 --> 00:31:34.090
<v Speaker 3>Yo homeboy homeboy was on the soft course of course.</v>

1088
00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:35.590
<v Speaker 3>For the line and your mind,</v>

1089
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.420
<v Speaker 3>you're assuming that he probably is.</v>

1090
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Let me prepare for several who's probably roided right?</v>

1091
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1092
00:31:40.841 --> 00:31:41.880
<v Speaker 3>but there's a big difference.</v>

1093
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.210
<v Speaker 3>She's someone who's probably roided and someone like Cyborg who's a girl taking</v>

1094
00:31:46.211 --> 00:31:47.170
<v Speaker 3>male hormones.</v>

1095
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.440
<v Speaker 3>That's a different argument is that she positive tested pas did steroid.</v>

1096
00:31:53.571 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 3>She'd be huge.</v>

1097
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Let's have the debate right now.</v>

1098
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.473
<v Speaker 3>He's in a while.</v>

1099
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.960
<v Speaker 3>You know she looks a lot different now you're looking at Cyborg now she looks a</v>

1100
00:32:07.961 --> 00:32:08.261
<v Speaker 3>lot like,</v>

1101
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:09.740
<v Speaker 3>and that's the answer you give someone else.</v>

1102
00:32:09.741 --> 00:32:10.240
<v Speaker 3>If you do,</v>

1103
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.721
<v Speaker 3>you go dude,</v>

1104
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:12.250
<v Speaker 3>if I did roids that'd be huge.</v>

1105
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1106
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.580
<v Speaker 3>You're not denying it or anything or just you know the real argument.</v>

1107
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 3>You are huge though.</v>

1108
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

1109
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.270
<v Speaker 3>look at me.</v>

1110
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.130
<v Speaker 3>Look at me dude.</v>

1111
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:23.973
<v Speaker 3>Look at me.</v>

1112
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Think about that.</v>

1113
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for the compliment.</v>

1114
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 3>The real argument with a chick like heard though is that how long was she doing</v>

1115
00:32:30.941 --> 00:32:34.420
<v Speaker 3>at four and did she permanently alter her physique?</v>

1116
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.793
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1117
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.000
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're introducing,</v>

1118
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 3>if you look at like you ever those women answer</v>

1119
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and all that good.</v>

1120
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:41.751
<v Speaker 1>Well those women,</v>

1122
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 1>they used to be like Miss Olympia has,</v>

1123
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I know one of those ladies and she just looks different now.</v>

1124
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Like she juiced up guaranteed and she just looks different now.</v>

1125
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 1>She's in her fifties now and it's like,</v>

1126
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:53.120
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1127
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.781
<v Speaker 1>like what do you mean?</v>

1128
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:56.180
<v Speaker 1>She looks like she thinks it's pretty obvious.</v>

1129
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.890
<v Speaker 1>She did some fucking male hormones.</v>

1130
00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.753
<v Speaker 1>What's she doing?</v>

1131
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.860
<v Speaker 1>She was Miss Olympia bodybuilding,</v>

1132
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.550
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding or one of those Mr Olympia or Miss Universe or whatever.</v>

1133
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:05.384
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't shy.</v>

1134
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:10.250
<v Speaker 1>You those speeds with the big thighs and you think they do rides with the big,</v>

1135
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I would think that a lot of professional athletes to steroids.</v>

1136
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 1>A lot of damage.</v>

1137
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that since the Lance Armstrong situation happened,</v>

1138
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 1>do you think cyclists are still doing all that shale?</v>

1139
00:33:23.181 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.610
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing changed.</v>

1141
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:24.980
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1142
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1143
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.960
<v Speaker 1>He got busted.</v>

1144
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Nothing part of the game.</v>

1145
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.713
<v Speaker 1>What happened with that?</v>

1146
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:29.211
<v Speaker 1>The next,</v>

1147
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:34.211
<v Speaker 1>the next guy that didn't piss hot would have been like the 22nd 15 it was 1515</v>

1148
00:33:34.851 --> 00:33:35.900
<v Speaker 1>to 16 place.</v>

1149
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:42.040

1229
00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:38.460

1230
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 7>versus fucking Frankie Edgar</v>

1231
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 7>crazy Philippines,</v>

1232
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 7>Philippines main event for the Philippines.</v>

1233
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:45.900
<v Speaker 7>Is that a 45?</v>

1234
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:46.763
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

1235
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.633
<v Speaker 7>So gnarly,</v>

1236
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.560
<v Speaker 7>gnarly fight your,</v>

1237
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.680
<v Speaker 7>I'd like to ride favor 45 because he could have all that energy,</v>

1238
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.633
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1239
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.400
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1240
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:54.820
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

1241
00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.670
<v Speaker 7>he cuts to get to one 35.</v>

1242
00:35:56.671 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 7>I think it's really rough on them.</v>

1243
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.090
<v Speaker 7>And I think even especially as you get older,</v>

1244
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 7>it might benefit him to fight one 45 because he's still gonna cut a little,</v>

1245
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 7>you know like they're very similar in size,</v>

1246
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.540
<v Speaker 7>but it might be the first fight everywhere.</v>

1247
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.870
<v Speaker 7>Frankie Edgar's the bigger guy.</v>

1248
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.290
<v Speaker 7>I think every UFC fighter could learn something from your I favor.</v>

1249
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 7>No one's capitalize as far as business wise opportunity then you're at favor.</v>

1250
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.220
<v Speaker 7>These tree though,</v>

1251
00:36:20.221 --> 00:36:24.390
<v Speaker 7>he makes it comes to business house real estate that he owns.</v>

1252

1259
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.060

1260
00:36:39.061 --> 00:36:40.590

00:37:33.631 --> 00:37:35.100
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's a lot of good stuff.</v>

1295
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.031

1298
00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:39.954

1299
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.830
<v Speaker 7>the torque is like,</v>

1303
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:45.901
<v Speaker 7>For me.</v>

1304
00:37:45.901 --> 00:37:46.950
<v Speaker 7>It's all about risk support.</v>

1305
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:48.210
<v Speaker 7>Me and my wrists are jacked.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Don't do anything with a weak link.</v>

1315

1318
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.190
<v Speaker 7>I fucked up my wrist once and it never literally never got better.</v>

1319
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:21.180
<v Speaker 7>I never got an Mri and never found out what was wrong with it would click like</v>

<v Speaker 7>no matter what I did,</v>

1321
00:38:21.941 --> 00:38:25.230
<v Speaker 7>it would click and it would be in pain every time I worked out flight 10 years.</v>

1322
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:26.150
<v Speaker 7>That's me.</v>

1323
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.821
<v Speaker 7>But you know what?</v>

1324
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:31.821
<v Speaker 7>I got prolotherapy I got that prolotherapy shit where they inject the like they</v>

1325
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:33.830
<v Speaker 7>stick glucose into your vape,</v>

1326
00:38:33.831 --> 00:38:34.860
<v Speaker 7>your tenants?</v>

1327
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1328
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Speaker 1>it's different things like one of them you do for joints,</v>

1329
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 1>like where the tendons are loose and you have ish dude,</v>

1330
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 1>it fixed it.</v>

1331
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd never hear about something getting fixed.</v>

1332
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone has a chronic something for 10 years,</v>

1333
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:47.651
<v Speaker 1>it's always like,</v>

1334
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1335
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:48.041
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1336
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:49.270
<v Speaker 1>that's some shit you got to deal with,</v>

1337
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.340
<v Speaker 1>but no by risk got fixed.</v>

1338
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 1>They injected all these these fucking needles into it hurt like a fuck.</v>

1339
00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually the rest.</v>

1340
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.720
<v Speaker 1>It feels like fire fire.</v>

1341
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.183
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1342
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 1>It's sore and then it sore as fuck and they're like,</v>

1343
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1344
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:04.060
<v Speaker 1>no Ibuprofen.</v>

1345
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't we want the swelling?</v>

1346
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Just sit with her for a long tomotherapy.</v>

1347
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1348
00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:12.340
<v Speaker 1>What it does is it makes your tendons physically thicker.</v>

1349
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Like it can make it as much as 40% thicker that the someone knew someone.</v>

1350
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to say,</v>

1351
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.761
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it,</v>

1352
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Scotty from on the Mat,</v>

1353
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:25.110
<v Speaker 1>one of his buddies was getting prolo on his elbows and his knees just to</v>

1354
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 1>strengthen them from Jiu Jitsu does.</v>

1355
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:28.751
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even,</v>

1356
00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:32.080
<v Speaker 1>didn't even have an issues was getting it just injected in.</v>

1357
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a great idea.</v>

1358
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.220
<v Speaker 1>It literally strengthens your tenants.</v>

1359
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:36.970
<v Speaker 1>It hurt so bad,</v>

1360
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.350
<v Speaker 1>but allegedly,</v>

1361
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wanna I want to make sure that this is,</v>

1362
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you should Google it before you go out and do.</v>

1363
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:45.760
<v Speaker 1>It was years ago and he was like a purple belt.</v>

1364
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:46.594
<v Speaker 1>The John Jocks,</v>

1365
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.930
<v Speaker 1>he tweaked his knee in Jujitsu really,</v>

1366
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:50.764
<v Speaker 1>really bad.</v>

1367
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:55.030
<v Speaker 1>And you immediately call the people from pro though from John jocks and they</v>

1368
00:39:55.031 --> 00:39:55.510
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1369
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

1370
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.430
<v Speaker 1>come on over now.</v>

1371
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:58.810
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1372
00:39:58.811 --> 00:40:00.000
<v Speaker 1>you had your NFX.</v>

1373
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1374
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 1>and I remember he couldn't drive,</v>

1375
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.820
<v Speaker 1>so I had a driver's NSX and I've never driven a high power sports car before.</v>

1376
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.620
<v Speaker 1>So I was kind of like grinding the gears here,</v>

1377
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.550
<v Speaker 1>here that he was so mad.</v>

1378
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.830
<v Speaker 1>He was fucked up and he was</v>

1379
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.123
<v Speaker 1>killing,</v>

1380
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:20.530
<v Speaker 1>he was already keyed.</v>

1381
00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Imagine he's in the worst mood.</v>

1382
00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:23.080
<v Speaker 1>He can be in his knee.</v>

1383
00:40:23.081 --> 00:40:23.914
<v Speaker 1>Just pop.</v>

1384
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm rushing them to prolotherapy doc so that we can avoid surgery perhaps.</v>

1385
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1386
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And he's so mad at me.</v>

1387
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:31.774
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget,</v>

1388
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.060
<v Speaker 1>you can't fucking drive with shit,</v>

1389
00:40:34.061 --> 00:40:34.530
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1390
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.190
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking killing my gears.</v>

1391
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.480
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

1392
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.890
<v Speaker 1>He and he was panicking.</v>

1393
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.963
<v Speaker 1>I'm like</v>

1394
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 1>the pressure slowly.</v>

1395
00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard car to drive,</v>

1396
00:40:46.181 --> 00:40:46.720
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1397
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.880
<v Speaker 1>You have to practice six chef cars to drive.</v>

1398
00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:52.480
<v Speaker 1>It's different man could ever drive.</v>

1399
00:40:52.481 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the smoothest,</v>

1400
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.310
<v Speaker 1>easiest cars.</v>

1401
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:59.310
<v Speaker 1>A Mecca driving is like come on Nolan for being in a car to drive.</v>

1402
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It was very powerful man.</v>

1403
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I had a stick shift,</v>

1404
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Pinto station wagon.</v>

1405
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I was used to that shit.</v>

1406
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Well the one that you drove was the best one I ever owned two cars.</v>

1407
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.110
<v Speaker 1>It was supercharged.</v>

1408
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I put a supercharger on that one and the prolotherapy.</v>

1409
00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:15.580
<v Speaker 1>This was like 15 years ago,</v>

1410
00:41:15.581 --> 00:41:16.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1411
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Back then they didn't have the results they have now.</v>

1412
00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1413
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.330
<v Speaker 1>The scientific data.</v>

1414
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1415
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.500
<v Speaker 1>what happened to my knee was I had a bucket handle tear of the meniscus,</v>

1416
00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:25.330
<v Speaker 1>so prolotherapy wouldn't have fixed that.</v>

1417
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I had to get some surgery done.</v>

1418
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:31.310
<v Speaker 1>There was a big opening in the meniscus where would flip over and lock it would</v>

1419
00:41:31.311 --> 00:41:31.720
<v Speaker 1>like to,</v>

1420
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 1>the meniscus was torn and like if my</v>

1421
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 7>knee got tweak sideways,</v>

1422
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.781
<v Speaker 7>it would,</v>

1423
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:36.120
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

1424
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.080
<v Speaker 7>the torn part would tuck under and it would literally lock my leg out.</v>

1425
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:40.993
<v Speaker 7>It was rough,</v>

1426
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.490
<v Speaker 7>so they had to go in there and scoop that shit out and fix it.</v>

1427
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.850
<v Speaker 7>But the prolotherapy is really good for if you have any,</v>

1428
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 7>like they just had to take some of it out.</v>

1429
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:50.660
<v Speaker 7>They'd take some of it out,</v>

1430
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.800
<v Speaker 7>but they fixed it.</v>

1431
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:52.250
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1432
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.190

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.340
<v Speaker 7>Are they really stopping or are they trying to be more careful?</v>

1498
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:20.250
<v Speaker 7>Can you really train that hard?</v>

1499
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.130
<v Speaker 7>It's been consistent with the pop.</v>

1500
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:25.430
<v Speaker 7>Then they'll just fuck guys are just figure ways around it.</v>

1501
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 7>You gotta wonder.</v>

1502
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.921
<v Speaker 7>It's part.</v>

1503
00:43:27.921 --> 00:43:29.150
<v Speaker 7>It's part of professional sports.</v>

1504
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:31.610
<v Speaker 7>It's not a UFC prompts professional sports problem.</v>

1505
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 7>Just UFC guys get cotton.</v>

1506
00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:36.200
<v Speaker 7>It's bigger.</v>

1507
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:37.550
<v Speaker 7>It makes a bigger scene.</v>

1508
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 7>Nfl guys get caught all the time.</v>

1509
00:43:39.201 --> 00:43:39.980
<v Speaker 7>What do you think about it?</v>

1510
00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.750
<v Speaker 7>We can't talk over each and every year.</v>

1511
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:42.721
<v Speaker 7>Every year.</v>

1512
00:43:42.721 --> 00:43:43.270
<v Speaker 7>NFL,</v>

1513
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.103
<v Speaker 7>every year they renew.</v>

1514
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:45.350
<v Speaker 7>Every year there's a year.</v>

1515
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.640
<v Speaker 7>There's NFL players.</v>

1516
00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 7>They get pop nonstop.</v>

1517
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 7>The number,</v>

1518
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:49.071
<v Speaker 7>the amount.</v>

1519
00:43:49.071 --> 00:43:50.510
<v Speaker 7>How many a year on average?</v>

1520
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:51.620
<v Speaker 7>Way more than the UFC.</v>

1521
00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:53.600
<v Speaker 7>Not even close and granted there's more players.</v>

1522
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.490
<v Speaker 7>10 15 a year are way more,</v>

1523
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.400
<v Speaker 7>probably more,</v>

1524
00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.590
<v Speaker 7>more shirt,</v>

1525
00:43:57.591 --> 00:44:00.100
<v Speaker 7>but they don't even announce it or they don't because it's just what it is.</v>

1526
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.770
<v Speaker 7>Let it go.</v>

1527
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 7>Cause they don't have to,</v>

1528
00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 7>cause the commission's announcing it,</v>

1529
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:07.430
<v Speaker 7>the number one team that got banned the most had the most players test positive.</v>

1530
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.660
<v Speaker 7>And we don't know whether it's,</v>

1531
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.580
<v Speaker 7>it could be for a Ad Rock,</v>

1532
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:11.960
<v Speaker 7>could be for steroids.</v>

1533
00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:12.561
<v Speaker 7>We don't know.</v>

1534
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:13.580
<v Speaker 7>They don't tell you that.</v>

1535
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 7>But the number one team who had the most players to as positive was the Seattle</v>

1536
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.770
<v Speaker 7>Seahawks who won the Superbowl.</v>

1537
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.451
<v Speaker 7>Make sense?</v>

1538
00:44:20.451 --> 00:44:20.811
<v Speaker 7>So what,</v>

1539
00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:24.660
<v Speaker 7>why is it the baseball goes in front of Congress and football,</v>

1540
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:25.461
<v Speaker 7>basketball,</v>

1541
00:44:25.461 --> 00:44:26.360
<v Speaker 7>all these other sports.</v>

1542
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.580
<v Speaker 7>It's just a fine or it's an internal problem.</v>

1543
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:29.001
<v Speaker 7>Why is it,</v>

1544
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:29.301
<v Speaker 7>wait a minute,</v>

1545
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:30.650
<v Speaker 7>didn't the Patriots win the Superbowl?</v>

1546
00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:31.260
<v Speaker 7>My bad.</v>

1547
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1548
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 7>Last</v>

1549
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:32.800
<v Speaker 3>to get cloud.</v>

1550
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.990
<v Speaker 3>Don't even know my bat last year.</v>

1551
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.010
<v Speaker 3>And I love football game.</v>

1552
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.240
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1553
00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.230
<v Speaker 3>No football fanatic one.</v>

1554
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 3>The more I got into the UFC that more,</v>

1555
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:50.160
<v Speaker 3>I stopped watching football and I barely watch football every now and then I,</v>

1556
00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:50.680
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1557
00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.600
<v Speaker 3>I keep track of it.</v>

1558
00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck about the patriots or the Seahawks,</v>

1559
00:44:53.821 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 3>but I watched the Superbowl and holy shit,</v>

1560
00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.090
<v Speaker 3>it was getting hosting.</v>

1561
00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Craziest game.</v>

1562
00:44:58.690 --> 00:44:59.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1563
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:00.743
<v Speaker 3>the end.</v>

1564
00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:05.980
<v Speaker 3>And that catch the craziest catch football history right there at the very end.</v>

1565
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 3>It just bounces off.</v>

1566
00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:12.710
<v Speaker 3>The dude's Pauline's still give you a football man.</v>

1567
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.553
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't think that.</v>

1568
00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:13.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1569
00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:15.000
<v Speaker 3>the Superbowl was crazy.</v>

1570
00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:19.230
<v Speaker 3>And then they threw an interception right after that and then the games over.</v>

1571
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1572
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 3>how bout the Katy Perry Rod and the lion part?</v>

1573
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not mad at that either.</v>

1574
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get to see that.</v>

1575
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.020
<v Speaker 3>She's a talented chick man.</v>

1576
00:45:28.021 --> 00:45:28.441

00:49:50.021 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 3>Also known as a snitch.</v>

1721
00:49:51.251 --> 00:49:52.084
<v Speaker 3>Too late.</v>

1722
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.013
<v Speaker 3>It's too late.</v>

1723
00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:56.620
<v Speaker 3>It's too late.</v>

1724
00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:57.350
<v Speaker 3>It's already fed.</v>

1725
00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:58.450
<v Speaker 3>The painters fricking.</v>

1726
00:49:58.451 --> 00:49:59.110
<v Speaker 3>He left town.</v>

1727
00:49:59.110 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 3>It's gun he's got,</v>

1728
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.240
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have that gig anymore.</v>

1729
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.133
<v Speaker 3>And then what happened?</v>

1730
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:03.080
<v Speaker 3>So Brian Kelly,</v>

1731
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:03.933
<v Speaker 3>how did he know?</v>

1732
00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:06.251
<v Speaker 3>Saw wigs,</v>

1733
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:08.230
<v Speaker 3>all like full man sized dresses,</v>

1734
00:50:08.231 --> 00:50:11.760
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of stuff with his name on it.</v>

1735
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like the most unlikely story ever dressed</v>

1736
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:20.650
<v Speaker 3>out for a drink with them as well.</v>

1737
00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.253
<v Speaker 3>What's his house?</v>

1738
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Look at this Kevin Lee.</v>

1739
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:26.194
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1740
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 3>It's this preservice dude's getting</v>

1741
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 1>tired and Kevin Lee's not Kevin Lee's all over a man.</v>

1742
00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:37.080
<v Speaker 1>He hit him with some fucking sick elbows to the head of the clench too.</v>

1743
00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:38.101
<v Speaker 1>He's all right.</v>

1744
00:50:38.101 --> 00:50:38.934
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

1745
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.250
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

1746
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:44.550
<v Speaker 1>do you think it'll take on a new name that nobody's done?</v>

1747
00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.080
<v Speaker 1>That his lungs are dying.</v>

1748
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:46.980
<v Speaker 1>He's just given up,</v>

1749
00:50:46.981 --> 00:50:47.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1750
00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the Bruce Jenner will take on a new name?</v>

1751
00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:50.183
<v Speaker 1>Hell No.</v>

1752
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.431
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1753
00:50:50.431 --> 00:50:52.620
<v Speaker 1>could there be a more manly named them burrows?</v>

1754
00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.483
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

1755
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like the gay name.</v>

1756
00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:59.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like the game is just gangster.</v>

1757
00:50:59.101 --> 00:51:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Bruce Lee.</v>

1758
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee is not gay.</v>

1759
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.013
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

1760
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Bruce is not gay.</v>

1761
00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1762
00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:07.320
<v Speaker 1>he's certainly not.</v>

1763
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Certainly everyone got all serious.</v>

1764
00:51:10.471 --> 00:51:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Hell no man.</v>

1765
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.891
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1766
00:51:13.891 --> 00:51:15.180
<v Speaker 1>It's going for that shit.</v>

1767
00:51:15.181 --> 00:51:15.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1768
00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.670
<v Speaker 1>he's going for that leg log with the legs crossed.</v>

1769
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:18.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

1770
00:51:18.271 --> 00:51:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Lee's trying to form a real naked choke.</v>

1771
00:51:20.341 --> 00:51:20.791
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1772
00:51:20.791 --> 00:51:21.624
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

1773
00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Crushing that jaw right now.</v>

1774
00:51:23.011 --> 00:51:25.340
<v Speaker 1>He's got this dude's back because Pizarros got tired.</v>

1775
00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:26.430
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do it.</v>

1776
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh Damn,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

1779
00:51:30.391 --> 00:51:31.171
<v Speaker 1>The Brazilian one,</v>

1780
00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:31.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1781
00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:31.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>is that guy resilient?</v>

1783
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1784
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:34.090
<v Speaker 1>He just ended up</v>

1785
00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:34.923
<v Speaker 6>fight on that note.</v>

1786
00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Did that guy is tired of muscular.</v>

1787
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1788
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:42.940
<v Speaker 1>he's tired as fuck.</v>

1789
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:46.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1790
00:51:46.931 --> 00:51:49.450
<v Speaker 1>You would think that like if he does transition to beat a woman,</v>

1791
00:51:49.451 --> 00:51:49.900
<v Speaker 1>he's won.</v>

1792
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.130
<v Speaker 1>He's going to want to change his name.</v>

1793
00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:52.960
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to stick with Bruce.</v>

1794
00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:53.690
<v Speaker 1>What's it?</v>

1795
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.980
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

1796
00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:54.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1797
00:51:54.221 --> 00:51:54.971
<v Speaker 1>what do you do man?</v>

1798
00:51:54.971 --> 00:51:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows you're fucking Bruce get changed name.</v>

1799
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

1800
00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

1801
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Girls do that all the time.</v>

1802
00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.360
<v Speaker 1>When they become a woman,</v>

1803
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.081
<v Speaker 1>when they were,</v>

1804
00:52:02.081 --> 00:52:05.140
<v Speaker 1>they used to be a man and they get a sex change that much.</v>

1805
00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1806
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:06.611
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1807
00:52:06.611 --> 00:52:08.980
<v Speaker 1>It must be kind of fun picking on the whole new name.</v>

1808
00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:09.311
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1809
00:52:09.311 --> 00:52:10.240
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

1810
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Once someone has transitioned,</v>

1811
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:15.130
<v Speaker 1>you're not even supposed to say they used to be a man.</v>

1812
00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1813
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1814
00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.980
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to say they were always a woman.</v>

1815
00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Like because they're a woman in their mind and it's cruel to say that there are</v>

1816
00:52:21.461 --> 00:52:22.300
<v Speaker 1>one time a man,</v>

1817
00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:23.860
<v Speaker 1>even if they're a man,</v>

1818
00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:27.070
<v Speaker 1>like it's wrong to state reality,</v>

1819
00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.210
<v Speaker 1>that they had a penis.</v>

1820
00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:29.200
<v Speaker 1>They function as a man,</v>

1821
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.360
<v Speaker 1>even had sex with women and had babies,</v>

1822
00:52:31.361 --> 00:52:33.010
<v Speaker 1>so you just have to pretend that never happened,</v>

1823
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:33.281
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1824
00:52:33.281 --> 00:52:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with this woman and she on Twitter and she actually said</v>

1825
00:52:37.061 --> 00:52:37.781
<v Speaker 1>that I go,</v>

1826
00:52:37.781 --> 00:52:41.860
<v Speaker 1>so he wasn't a man when he had sex with a woman and got her pregnant,</v>

1827
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.790
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a man.</v>

1828
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:43.151
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1829
00:52:43.151 --> 00:52:43.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1830
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.470
<v Speaker 1>not even then,</v>

1831
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.340
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

1832
00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.001
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1833
00:52:46.001 --> 00:52:46.630
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1834
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I think we're done.</v>

1835
00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:47.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1836
00:52:47.741 --> 00:52:48.010
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

1837
00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1838
00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1839
00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:49.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1840
00:52:49.181 --> 00:52:50.190
<v Speaker 1>this conversation's over.</v>

1841
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.350
<v Speaker 1>This conversation just took a left turn down la La land.</v>

1842
00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that mean?</v>

1843
00:52:54.731 --> 00:52:56.800
<v Speaker 1>A woman fucked a woman and got her pregnant?</v>

1844
00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>

1845
00:52:57.970 --> 00:52:58.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1846
00:52:58.151 --> 00:52:59.890
<v Speaker 1>it's just she's a woman physically,</v>

1847
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:02.290
<v Speaker 1>but in reality he was a dude that fuck the woman.</v>

1848
00:53:02.291 --> 00:53:05.590
<v Speaker 1>She's just saying he felt like a woman even though he's fucking a woman as a</v>

1849
00:53:05.591 --> 00:53:05.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1850
00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:08.230
<v Speaker 1>You know what the problem with that kind of logic is?</v>

1851
00:53:08.231 --> 00:53:09.310
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>

1852
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:10.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're already a woman,</v>

1853
00:53:10.331 --> 00:53:10.991
<v Speaker 1>you have a penis.</v>

1854
00:53:10.991 --> 00:53:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Keep your God damn penis.</v>

1855
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1856
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.863
<v Speaker 1>Keep your balls.</v>

1857
00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:14.580
<v Speaker 1>You heal.</v>

1858
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Your body will work better.</v>

1859
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:16.211
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1860
00:53:16.211 --> 00:53:18.070
<v Speaker 1>like this idea that you're already a woman.</v>

1861
00:53:18.071 --> 00:53:19.330
<v Speaker 1>If you are already a woman,</v>

1862
00:53:19.331 --> 00:53:22.660
<v Speaker 1>why are you getting the sex change then you're not already a woman.</v>

1863
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:23.201
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1864
00:53:23.201 --> 00:53:24.610
<v Speaker 1>You were a man on point in time.</v>

1865
00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:26.490
<v Speaker 1>You're not helping anybody</v>

1866
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:30.270
<v Speaker 3>by twisting the reality of the situation and you're just making it more</v>

1867
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 3>confusing and harder for people to accept.</v>

1868
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:35.850
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what's tougher to go from being a man to woman or woman to man.</v>

1869
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:38.010
<v Speaker 3>I would say the Dick's going to be challenged.</v>

1870
00:53:38.011 --> 00:53:38.950
<v Speaker 3>I want to see a woman.</v>

1871
00:53:38.951 --> 00:53:39.391
<v Speaker 3>It's a man.</v>

1872
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:42.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like impossible because they built dicks out of the inside of pussies.</v>

1873
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:43.831
<v Speaker 3>What does that look like?</v>

1874
00:53:43.831 --> 00:53:44.560
<v Speaker 3>Can you pull that up?</v>

1875
00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.393
<v Speaker 3>Jen?</v>

1876
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.433
<v Speaker 3>Can you pull it up?</v>

1877
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:50.080
<v Speaker 3>They make dicks out of the inside of pussy trying to get</v>

1878
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.553
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>

1879
00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:56.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see it like think Jamie.</v>

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:10.791
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1893
00:54:10.791 --> 00:54:15.791

1894
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:18.600

1900
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:28.390
<v Speaker 3>My reaction happen I took,</v>

1901
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.000
<v Speaker 3>cause I know in his peripheral he thought he looked at me with,</v>

2296
01:04:16.361 --> 01:04:17.500
<v Speaker 9>I know he was on a roll.</v>

2297
01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:17.840
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2298
01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.673
<v Speaker 9>And the last one,</v>

2299
01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:18.890
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>

2300
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:21.170
<v Speaker 9>I think you might've Lost Rashad got hurt again.</v>

2301
01:04:21.171 --> 01:04:22.004
<v Speaker 9>You see that?</v>

2302
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.983
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:26.990
<v Speaker 9>They said it didn't accept the ACL or something like that.</v>

2304
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.070
<v Speaker 9>I don't know why.</v>

2305
01:04:28.071 --> 01:04:29.240
<v Speaker 9>You know why that happens?</v>

2306
01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:31.330
<v Speaker 9>I would like to talk to a surgeon about what,</v>

2307
01:04:31.331 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 9>what is the issue with Acl,</v>

2308
01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.900
<v Speaker 9>with a lot of UFC fighters in particular,</v>

2309
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.360
<v Speaker 9>the graphs below or they don't work well.</v>

2310
01:04:38.361 --> 01:04:39.920
<v Speaker 9>A lot of times they use a,</v>

2311
01:04:39.921 --> 01:04:40.754
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2312
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:42.830
<v Speaker 9>some parts from a cadaver,</v>

2313
01:04:42.831 --> 01:04:43.250
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

2314
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:43.551
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:04:43.551 --> 01:04:45.220
<v Speaker 9>Well that's the ones that don't exist.</v>

2316
01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.870
<v Speaker 9>Sometimes the body rejects it.</v>

2317
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.810
<v Speaker 9>I don't think they know.</v>

2318
01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:48.950
<v Speaker 9>I think it depends on the body.</v>

2319
01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:49.221
<v Speaker 9>Correct.</v>

2320
01:04:49.221 --> 01:04:51.420
<v Speaker 9>So just like some people were able to take some,</v>

2321
01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.520
<v Speaker 9>it does it just like,</v>

2322
01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.630
<v Speaker 9>just like Dominick Cruz.</v>

2323
01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:54.800
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

2324
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.240
<v Speaker 9>But there's also people that like,</v>

2325
01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:56.660
<v Speaker 9>they're,</v>

2326
01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:00.410
<v Speaker 9>they don't give it enough time and they were already training and they blow it</v>

2327
01:05:00.411 --> 01:05:01.040
<v Speaker 9>out again.</v>

2328
01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.060
<v Speaker 9>That does happen.</v>

2329
01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:02.590
<v Speaker 9>Of course.</v>

2330
01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:03.423
<v Speaker 9>You now,</v>

2331
01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.210
<v Speaker 9>I think Ed Herman did that.</v>

2332
01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:06.800
<v Speaker 9>I think other guys have done that too.</v>

2333
01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:07.821
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

2334
01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:10.670
<v Speaker 9>you don't know when they say your body rejected it?</v>

2335
01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:11.510
<v Speaker 9>Are you sure?</v>

2336
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.841
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

2337
01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:15.890
<v Speaker 9>I don't know exactly what's going on because what happens when you do a,</v>

2338
01:05:15.891 --> 01:05:16.340
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2339
01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 9>a cadaver is</v>

2340
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:22.840
<v Speaker 7>that it's like a scaffolding and so it's not that cadaver graft.</v>

2341
01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:24.700
<v Speaker 7>It actually becomes your ACL.</v>

2342
01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:29.770
<v Speaker 7>It's like that ACL allows your body to proliferate new tissue into it until it</v>

2343
01:05:29.771 --> 01:05:30.820
<v Speaker 7>becomes solid again.</v>

2344
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.190
<v Speaker 7>But you don't really take the tissue.</v>

2345
01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.930
<v Speaker 7>It's like it doesn't stay forever.</v>

2346
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:35.381
<v Speaker 7>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2347
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:35.710
<v Speaker 7>Like this,</v>

2348
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:38.920
<v Speaker 7>the cadaver graft apparently as it's been explained to me,</v>

2349
01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:43.900
<v Speaker 7>it just acts as a place for your own tissue to grow livery system for your</v>

2350
01:05:43.901 --> 01:05:47.710
<v Speaker 7>tissue to sort of like a little bridge so the tendons will grow again.</v>

2351
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:48.580
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2352
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.141
<v Speaker 7>Well you,</v>

2353
01:05:49.141 --> 01:05:49.860
<v Speaker 7>you sort of,</v>

2354
01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.693
<v Speaker 7>you use,</v>

2355
01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:52.680
<v Speaker 7>it grows in that graft.</v>

2356
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:53.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2357
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.390
<v Speaker 7>How long ago did he have the surgery?</v>

2358
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:56.201
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2359
01:05:56.201 --> 01:05:56.981
<v Speaker 7>I mean Dominick Cruz,</v>

2360
01:05:56.981 --> 01:06:00.250
<v Speaker 7>I think he did it like in like nine months after the first surgery.</v>

2361
01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:02.330
<v Speaker 7>He blew it out and then now he,</v>

2362
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.480
<v Speaker 7>he blew it out when he blew it out.</v>

2363
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.270
<v Speaker 7>He got surgery was rehabbing,</v>

2364
01:06:07.271 --> 01:06:07.961
<v Speaker 7>was training,</v>

2365
01:06:07.961 --> 01:06:09.010
<v Speaker 7>blew it out again,</v>

2366
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.040
<v Speaker 7>and then he had to go through a whole new surgery.</v>

2367
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:12.911
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>

2368
01:06:12.911 --> 01:06:14.620
<v Speaker 7>that's why he was out for almost three years.</v>

2369
01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.510
<v Speaker 7>Then he just blew out his right knee.</v>

2370
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.080
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't pushed up to your face.</v>

2371
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:20.890
<v Speaker 7>What are they saying?</v>

2372
01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:25.630
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't properly like the new one is a totally new injury.</v>

2373
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:27.280
<v Speaker 7>It's a new [inaudible] all of that.</v>

2374
01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.900
<v Speaker 7>But the other one in triple like that,</v>

2375
01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:32.650
<v Speaker 7>like the psychic injury that's there that he's going to be nervous every shot he</v>

2376
01:06:32.651 --> 01:06:36.220
<v Speaker 7>takes every time there's a court like that can fuck a dude up.</v>

2377
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:36.521
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2378
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:37.240
<v Speaker 7>it could,</v>

2379
01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.320
<v Speaker 7>but he bounced back better than ever last five year later.</v>

2380
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:42.060
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2381
01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.640
<v Speaker 7>It's like dudes are moving at light speed getting,</v>

2382
01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:45.251
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

2383
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 7>The evolution of the sport is so fast,</v>

2384
01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:49.060
<v Speaker 7>so he fucked [inaudible] up though.</v>

2385
01:06:49.061 --> 01:06:50.920
<v Speaker 7>Man Destroys his style,</v>

2386
01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:51.600
<v Speaker 7>his footwork,</v>

2387
01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:51.871
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2388
01:06:51.871 --> 01:06:56.190
<v Speaker 7>and you need those needs to be that quick and change the directions.</v>

2389
01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.151
<v Speaker 7>Tell you what though,</v>

2390
01:06:58.151 --> 01:06:59.620
<v Speaker 7>the last cruise though,</v>

2391
01:06:59.621 --> 01:07:03.160
<v Speaker 7>he's a beast as far as being an analyst on UFC tonight.</v>

2392
01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:04.720
<v Speaker 7>He says he is a man.</v>

2393
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:05.531
<v Speaker 7>He's really,</v>

2394
01:07:05.531 --> 01:07:06.370
<v Speaker 7>really good at though.</v>

2395
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.480
<v Speaker 7>He's got the glasses now to let's,</v>

2396

2529
01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.200

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2531

2533
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.480

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2535
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:52.780
<v Speaker 2>because the tournament's were happening so fast that I don't even think,</v>

2536
01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:53.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2537
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:57.190
<v Speaker 2>they had planned out what they were going to do as far as where's the venue,</v>

2538
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:58.740
<v Speaker 2>where's the next local wow.</v>

2543
01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes it was like just making it,</v>

2582
01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:56.030
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2583
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:59.720
<v Speaker 7>it'll be way more comfortable environment over there and maybe they'll get some</v>

2584
01:11:59.721 --> 01:12:01.160
<v Speaker 7>good fights and I like,</v>

2585
01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:02.030
<v Speaker 7>I think it's good.</v>

2586
01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:04.880
<v Speaker 7>I think competition is very important for the athletes.</v>

2587
01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.700
<v Speaker 7>I think it's the most important thing when it comes to bargaining power.</v>

2588
01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.060
<v Speaker 7>So all it's going to do is force everybody to step their game up.</v>

2589
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.690
<v Speaker 7>And ultimately I believe it will make MMA more popular.</v>

2590
01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.070
<v Speaker 7>And that's the key.</v>

2591
01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.080
<v Speaker 7>The key is Megan and more popular,</v>

2592
01:12:18.081 --> 01:12:22.670
<v Speaker 7>making it to the point where everybody makes a lot of money and it's really</v>

2593
01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:23.410
<v Speaker 7>close to,</v>

2594
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:24.260
<v Speaker 7>to becoming that.</v>

2595
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:27.980
<v Speaker 7>And the way it's going to become that is if there's a bunch of fucking players</v>

2596
01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:29.001
<v Speaker 7>and everybody's like,</v>

2597
01:12:29.001 --> 01:12:29.211
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'll give you x for a well,</v>

2599
01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.780
<v Speaker 7>I'll give you y and z.</v>

2600
01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:33.410

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:34.700

2602
01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.151
<v Speaker 7>Damn,</v>

2603
01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:35.984
<v Speaker 7>you're lucky bitch.</v>

2604
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.531
<v Speaker 7>And I like,</v>

2605
01:12:36.531 --> 01:12:36.681
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

2606
01:12:36.681 --> 01:12:37.790
<v Speaker 7>that's how it's got to be.</v>

2607
01:12:37.791 --> 01:12:40.820
<v Speaker 7>That's the only way the money gets tossed around adequately.</v>

2608
01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:41.511
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

2609
01:12:41.511 --> 01:12:43.280
<v Speaker 7>It's like we need competition.</v>

2610
01:12:43.281 --> 01:12:45.110
<v Speaker 7>It's the only way the talent pool gets bigger too,</v>

2611
01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:45.330
<v Speaker 7>isn't it?</v>

2612
01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:45.411
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

2613
01:12:45.411 --> 01:12:46.850
<v Speaker 7>You have a lot of different varieties.</v>

2614
01:12:46.851 --> 01:12:47.780

2616
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:51.410
<v Speaker 7>Or if you only have this one place where a guy's got to come up on the tough</v>

2617
01:12:51.411 --> 01:12:52.244
<v Speaker 7>show and then he's got,</v>

2620
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:58.660
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2621
01:12:58.660 --> 01:12:58.910
<v Speaker 7>Bar.</v>

2622
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:59.451

<v Speaker 7>So Yup.</v>

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.450
<v Speaker 7>In all ways of evolution,</v>

2627
01:13:05.451 --> 01:13:06.440
<v Speaker 7>it's gotta be like that.</v>

2628
01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.753
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2629
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:08.241
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>

2630
01:13:08.241 --> 01:13:09.410
<v Speaker 7>It's just how it is,</v>

2631
01:13:09.411 --> 01:13:09.651
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2632
01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.480
<v Speaker 7>It's just how it is with with everything,</v>

2633
01:13:11.481 --> 01:13:11.661
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2634
01:13:11.661 --> 01:13:12.560
<v Speaker 7>You need competition.</v>

2635
01:13:12.561 --> 01:13:13.161
<v Speaker 7>It's good.</v>

2636
01:13:13.161 --> 01:13:14.150
<v Speaker 7>It makes everybody better.</v>

2637
01:13:14.151 --> 01:13:14.571
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing.</v>

2638
01:13:14.571 --> 01:13:15.530
<v Speaker 7>The problem with compensation,</v>

2639
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.760
<v Speaker 7>people get scared of the competition.</v>

2640
01:13:16.761 --> 01:13:17.511
<v Speaker 7>What the competition is,</v>

2641
01:13:17.511 --> 01:13:19.520
<v Speaker 7>the best God damn thing that could happen to him.</v>

2642
01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:19.970
<v Speaker 7>It really,</v>

2643
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:20.511
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's the,</v>

2644
01:13:20.511 --> 01:13:21.890
<v Speaker 7>it's the fundamental thing.</v>

2645
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:23.030
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean anybody's mad at you.</v>

2646
01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:23.781
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean any of that.</v>

2647
01:13:23.781 --> 01:13:25.370
<v Speaker 7>It means everybody's going to get better together.</v>

2648
01:13:25.371 --> 01:13:27.260
<v Speaker 7>Like you felt that you don't have any,</v>

2649
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.861
<v Speaker 7>not only that,</v>

2650
01:13:27.861 --> 01:13:30.410
<v Speaker 7>you don't cancel each other out and didn't get,</v>

2651
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:33.050
<v Speaker 7>get into this because you're a fan of fighting in the first place.</v>

2652
01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.360
<v Speaker 7>What is someone making money somehow or another,</v>

2653
01:13:35.361 --> 01:13:36.200
<v Speaker 7>you're not making money.</v>

2654
01:13:36.201 --> 01:13:37.280
<v Speaker 7>Is that really what's going on?</v>

2655
01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:38.210
<v Speaker 7>Cause I don't think it is.</v>

2656
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:41.270
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about someone's making money and you're making money from a</v>

2657
01:13:41.271 --> 01:13:43.130
<v Speaker 7>fighter standpoint and competition's great.</v>

2658
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.790
<v Speaker 7>Dana.</v>

2659
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:44.121
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>

2660
01:13:44.121 --> 01:13:46.880
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it makes everybody more money.</v>

2661
01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:47.900
<v Speaker 7>I really believe so.</v>

2662
01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.100
<v Speaker 7>I believe everybody,</v>

2663
01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:52.040
<v Speaker 7>it gets more money if the sport gets more popular.</v>

2664
01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:54.080
<v Speaker 7>I think if you've got two giant promotions,</v>

2665
01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:54.951
<v Speaker 7>have you got one?</v>

2666
01:13:54.951 --> 01:13:59.030
<v Speaker 7>Say Floyd Mayweather promotion at one Manny Pacquiao promotion and everybody on</v>

2667
01:13:59.031 --> 01:13:59.691
<v Speaker 7>one side what the,</v>

2668
01:13:59.691 --> 01:14:04.691
<v Speaker 7>you bring them together and you make fucking 1.5 million pay per view buys like</v>

2669
01:14:04.911 --> 01:14:06.200
<v Speaker 7>those guys will probably do.</v>

2670
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:08.690
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's how everybody gets money given up.</v>

2671
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.890
<v Speaker 7>But think about that.</v>

2672
01:14:09.891 --> 01:14:11.940
<v Speaker 7>That's like each one is 50</v>

2673
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:12.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2674
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:14.350
<v Speaker 2>How often do pay per views in the UFC hit?</v>

2675
01:14:14.351 --> 01:14:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Seven 50 they don't that often.</v>

2676
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:17.820
<v Speaker 2>If it's not George Saint Pierre,</v>

2677
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.090
<v Speaker 2>if it's not Brock Lesnar,</v>

2678
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.860
<v Speaker 2>you know it's hard to get those big numbers,</v>

2679
01:14:20.861 --> 01:14:21.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2680
01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:22.270
<v Speaker 2>because times are hard.</v>

2681
01:14:22.271 --> 01:14:26.220
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to pony up that kind of money on a regular basis who are</v>

2682
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:27.700
<v Speaker 2>watching this fight for free.</v>

2683
01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:28.610
<v Speaker 2>But he loves,</v>

2684
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:30.370
<v Speaker 2>see Alex torn UFC.</v>

2685
01:14:30.371 --> 01:14:31.204
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2686
01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Everything else is like their,</v>

2687
01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:37.580
<v Speaker 2>their feet are organizations which UFC top three he left sees ever.</v>

2688
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:38.734
<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar,</v>

2689
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar number that brought us was number one.</v>

2690
01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Never had a Brock Lesnar.</v>

2691
01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:46.210
<v Speaker 2>He fucked US healed again.</v>

2692
01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.073
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

2707
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2708
01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.470
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of talk,</v>

2709
01:15:14.471 --> 01:15:14.741
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2710
01:15:14.741 --> 01:15:14.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2711
01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:15.950
<v Speaker 2>I had heard a lot of talk,</v>

2712
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Bronto papers because we can't talk over each other.</v>

2713
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:22.760
<v Speaker 2>People will listen and there's no way this is going to work with,</v>

2714
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:24.050
<v Speaker 2>we were listening on headphones this,</v>

2715
01:15:24.051 --> 01:15:24.701
<v Speaker 2>it'd be way better,</v>

2716
01:15:24.701 --> 01:15:26.020
<v Speaker 2>but I want to avoid their headphones.</v>

2717
01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:27.520
<v Speaker 2>We just gotta be careful of that shit.</v>

2718
01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I think you guys are all doing great.</v>

2719
01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.270
<v Speaker 2>What were you saying about Gina Carano though?</v>

2720
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2721
01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Gina Carano was supposed to come back.</v>

2722
01:15:33.881 --> 01:15:34.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was the talk.</v>

2723
01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I kept hearing it.</v>

2724
01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I heard it from like agents.</v>

2725
01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I heard like there was negotiations.</v>

2726
01:15:38.891 --> 01:15:40.630
<v Speaker 2>I heard a lot of shit and then nothing happened.</v>

2727
01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.040
<v Speaker 2>So you don't know.</v>

2728
01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:44.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the Brock Lesnar thing has gotten that far,</v>

2729
01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.930
<v Speaker 2>but all I'm hearing is roamers everybody's tight lipped.</v>

2730
01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.040
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2731
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.050
<v Speaker 2>you're hearing people saying that Brock has been training,</v>

2732
01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:51.070
<v Speaker 2>that he's losing weight,</v>

2733
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:52.170
<v Speaker 2>he's slimming down.</v>

2734
01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I took some heat,</v>

2735
01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I took some heat people.</v>

2736
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:57.220
<v Speaker 2>If I called Brock Lesnar out and I did it,</v>

2737
01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.061
<v Speaker 2>not even close.</v>

2738
01:15:58.061 --> 01:15:58.731
<v Speaker 2>What happened to you?</v>

2739
01:15:58.731 --> 01:15:59.564
<v Speaker 2>A text with that?</v>

2740
01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:01.000

2742
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.951
<v Speaker 2>Sick.</v>

2743
01:16:02.951 --> 01:16:04.720
<v Speaker 2>This is old to six months ago,</v>

2744
01:16:04.721 --> 01:16:06.370
<v Speaker 2>I did an interview with the UFC.</v>

2745
01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.870
<v Speaker 2>It was 20 questions.</v>

2746
01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 2>One was like a,</v>

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Ketchup or mustard?</v>

2749
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:13.960
<v Speaker 2>We're this will kind of bullshit.</v>

2750
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:15.220
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about 20 questions,</v>

2751
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.330
<v Speaker 2>ketchup or mustard.</v>

2752
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.841
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2753
01:16:16.841 --> 01:16:19.120
<v Speaker 2>anyone who says mustard is part of Isis.</v>

2754
01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Like every American's gonna choose fucking catch up and you're like joking</v>

2755
01:16:22.361 --> 01:16:23.020
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

2756
01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Then question number 15 goes,</v>

2757
01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.050

2760
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2761
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:29.501

2765
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:34.780
<v Speaker 2>I'd love if Brock lesbian came back.</v>

2766
01:16:34.781 --> 01:16:36.130
<v Speaker 2>He's the biggest star we've ever had.</v>

2767
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.970
<v Speaker 2>And they'd go,</v>

2768
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:37.121
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2769

2778
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Six months later.</v>

2779
01:16:45.371 --> 01:16:48.670
<v Speaker 2>What about you saying about sending them go back to playing grab ass?</v>

2843
01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:45.360

2844
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:46.280
<v Speaker 7>they would all come out,</v>

2845
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:47.360
<v Speaker 7>they would all come out and watch them.</v>

2846
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:48.400
<v Speaker 7>There's a whole front line of,</v>

2847
01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:48.890
<v Speaker 7>they're like,</v>

2848
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:49.341
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2849
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:51.830
<v Speaker 7>like stone cold and Goldberg and all those guys right there.</v>

2850
01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.040
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2851
01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 7>Brock's a monster man.</v>

2852
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.521
<v Speaker 7>He's a beast.</v>

2853
01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:54.560
<v Speaker 7>He's great for this board.</v>

2854
01:18:54.561 --> 01:18:54.981
<v Speaker 7>Be Great.</v>

2855
01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:57.680
<v Speaker 7>If it came back well I really still to this day,</v>

2856
01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.960
<v Speaker 7>oh nice left hand by Kelly.</v>

2857
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:01.430
<v Speaker 7>I still to this day think that it,</v>

2858
01:19:01.431 --> 01:19:03.350
<v Speaker 7>Brock Lesnar did it the right way,</v>

2859
01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:06.410
<v Speaker 7>like a Brock Lesnar went and instead of,</v>

2860
01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:06.711
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2861
01:19:06.711 --> 01:19:11.711
<v Speaker 7>doing WWE for all those years and not striking and you know,</v>

2862
01:19:12.231 --> 01:19:15.140
<v Speaker 7>and then going into the UFC and immediately fighting the best guys,</v>

2863
01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:16.700
<v Speaker 7>the world after one professional fight.</v>

2864
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:21.080
<v Speaker 7>If they took Brock Lesnar and brought him to like an American top team,</v>

2865
01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:22.940
<v Speaker 7>like one of those professional camps,</v>

2866
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:25.820
<v Speaker 7>whether or black Zillions or you know,</v>

2867
01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:26.541
<v Speaker 7>Aka,</v>

2868
01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 7>something like that,</v>

2869
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:30.050
<v Speaker 7>when they're going to take you and they're going to take you through every step</v>

2870
01:19:30.051 --> 01:19:30.470
<v Speaker 7>of the way.</v>

2871
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.030
<v Speaker 7>Like Matt Hume would have been the guy.</v>

2872
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.320
<v Speaker 7>I get a guy like Eric Paulson essentially did what he could when he had them,</v>

2873
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:38.290
<v Speaker 7>but I think a guy like Brock Lesnar's,</v>

2874
01:19:38.291 --> 01:19:39.620
<v Speaker 7>she'd been brought along slowly.</v>

2875
01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:40.370
<v Speaker 7>You should like,</v>

2876
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:43.610
<v Speaker 7>he's got the potential to be the heavyweight ever.</v>

2877
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.091
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2878
01:19:44.091 --> 01:19:44.691
<v Speaker 7>I know he did.</v>

2879
01:19:44.691 --> 01:19:45.381
<v Speaker 7>He did a lot of that,</v>

2880
01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:47.000
<v Speaker 7>but I'm saying do it over years.</v>

2881
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:48.110
<v Speaker 7>The other thing is is you know,</v>

2882
01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:53.210
<v Speaker 7>difficult it is to get training for a guy of that skill set in that size.</v>

2883
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:53.540
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2884
01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:54.051
<v Speaker 7>that's real.</v>

2885
01:19:54.051 --> 01:19:54.531
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

2886
01:19:54.531 --> 01:19:57.770
<v Speaker 7>It's like you almost need to condition them and get them tired before you would</v>

2887
01:19:57.771 --> 01:19:58.940
<v Speaker 7>train with a guy like that.</v>

2888
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.051
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>

2889
01:20:00.051 --> 01:20:00.884
<v Speaker 7>huge and it's big,</v>

2890
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:02.510
<v Speaker 7>but his issue is striking.</v>

2891
01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.370
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of big guys in Holland.</v>

2892
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.890
<v Speaker 7>You go down the hall and and spar with Daniel Geeta all day,</v>

2893
01:20:06.891 --> 01:20:09.420
<v Speaker 7>you know you're going to learn today that you can just do like,</v>

2894
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.790
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2895
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:14.100
<v Speaker 7>I'm a real believer in like if you already spiral a lot and then great,</v>

2896
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:14.371
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2897
01:20:14.371 --> 01:20:15.204
<v Speaker 7>you're tough already.</v>

2898
01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.670
<v Speaker 7>There's no need to do that twice a week.</v>

2899
01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2900
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.140
<v Speaker 7>Go ahead and hit mits,</v>

2901
01:20:19.141 --> 01:20:20.070
<v Speaker 7>get a good trainer,</v>

2902
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:21.210
<v Speaker 7>hit Mitts all the time.</v>

2903
01:20:21.211 --> 01:20:21.981
<v Speaker 7>Your fucking timing,</v>

2904
01:20:21.981 --> 01:20:23.490
<v Speaker 7>you be there and all that stuff.</v>

2905
01:20:23.491 --> 01:20:24.390
<v Speaker 7>Put that shit together.</v>

2906
01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.740
<v Speaker 7>We already know you're not afraid to get hit.</v>

2907
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:26.550
<v Speaker 7>Awesome.</v>

2908
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:28.320
<v Speaker 7>You know that's the best way to do it I think.</v>

2909
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:28.771
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2910
01:20:28.771 --> 01:20:32.430
<v Speaker 7>I think that the guys who are going to take you like Duane Ludwig style through</v>

2911
01:20:32.431 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 7>drills that stimulate each individual position that you're going to be in.</v>

2912
01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:38.460
<v Speaker 7>This is your response to that position.</v>

2913
01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:39.750
<v Speaker 7>This is how you get back.</v>

2914
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:40.140
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2915
01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:41.310
<v Speaker 7>this is your setup again.</v>

2916
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:41.701
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2917
01:20:41.701 --> 01:20:42.420
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

2918
01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 7>rob came in,</v>

2919
01:20:43.170 --> 01:20:46.320
<v Speaker 7>was really good about that brown bear when he first started training with rob</v>

2920
01:20:46.321 --> 01:20:51.321
<v Speaker 7>came in like you saw like rob in system and Brandon when he was fighting him.</v>

2921
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:53.670
<v Speaker 7>Dwayne I think a six gun,</v>

2922
01:20:53.671 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 7>Gibson [inaudible] and Mike Winkeljohn,</v>

2923
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:57.661
<v Speaker 7>Brandon Gibson,</v>

2924
01:20:57.661 --> 01:20:57.871
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2925
01:20:57.871 --> 01:20:58.621
<v Speaker 7>He's phenomenally.</v>

2926
01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:01.410
<v Speaker 7>See the video he did with the elbows with cow recently.</v>

2927
01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:06.420
<v Speaker 7>I mean he's so innovative and he's so thoughtful about it and all.</v>

2928
01:21:06.421 --> 01:21:07.171
<v Speaker 7>He's all,</v>

2929
01:21:07.171 --> 01:21:10.380
<v Speaker 7>he's got his love and care for those guys and then he puts that into him and he</v>

2930
01:21:10.381 --> 01:21:12.350
<v Speaker 7>puts the routines together.</v>

2931
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:13.231
<v Speaker 7>Man,</v>

2932
01:21:13.231 --> 01:21:14.730
<v Speaker 7>they're fucking fantastic.</v>

2933
01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:15.001
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2934
01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:16.470
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of good trainers out there,</v>

2935
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:17.010
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2936
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:18.810
<v Speaker 7>You know there's a lot of guys out there that are,</v>

2937
01:21:18.811 --> 01:21:19.201
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2938
01:21:19.201 --> 01:21:22.980
<v Speaker 7>shown guys a real high level stuff and you see seeing like striking</v>

2939
01:21:22.981 --> 01:21:23.611
<v Speaker 7>combinations.</v>

2940
01:21:23.611 --> 01:21:27.560
<v Speaker 7>Especially like if you look at like Tj Dillashaw versus Hanan Barao like when</v>

2941
01:21:27.561 --> 01:21:31.440
<v Speaker 7>one was a fucking last time we ever saw a guy go from being TJ Dosha on the</v>

2942
01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:33.720
<v Speaker 7>ultimate fighter to what two and a half,</v>

2943
01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:38.721
<v Speaker 7>three years later being this super fluid bad mother fucker kickboxer we can mean</v>

2944
01:21:38.731 --> 01:21:42.120
<v Speaker 7>you look at a moving around shuffle and switching stances,</v>

2945
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.320
<v Speaker 7>like popping them with straight laughs from the fucking southpaw stance and then</v>

2946
01:21:46.321 --> 01:21:48.120
<v Speaker 7>hitting them with an inside leg kick and you're like,</v>

2947
01:21:48.121 --> 01:21:48.840
<v Speaker 7>whoa,</v>

2948
01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:53.840
<v Speaker 7>this is literally not the same dude then he was three years ago and you're going</v>

2949
01:21:54.131 --> 01:21:55.200
<v Speaker 7>to see more and more of that.</v>

2950
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.660
<v Speaker 7>How much boy Duke Roufus cm punk dude,</v>

2951
01:21:57.930 --> 01:21:58.411
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>

2952
01:21:58.411 --> 01:22:00.690
<v Speaker 7>Duke Roufus did a great job with Tyron Woodley.</v>

2953
01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.340
<v Speaker 7>Woodley settled down.</v>

2954
01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:07.260
<v Speaker 7>He didn't dim empty his gas tank in his last fight with Kelvin,</v>

2955
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:08.780
<v Speaker 7>with Calvin gasoline.</v>

2956
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.863
<v Speaker 7>That one,</v>

2957
01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:10.800
<v Speaker 7>it was a good fight.</v>

2958
01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:10.981
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2959
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:12.300
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't the worst fight in the world.</v>

2960
01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:13.321
<v Speaker 7>It was a good fight.</v>

2961
01:22:13.321 --> 01:22:13.581
<v Speaker 7>He wouldn't,</v>

2962
01:22:13.581 --> 01:22:15.870
<v Speaker 7>they broke his foot in the first round and show that that's true.</v>

2963
01:22:15.871 --> 01:22:15.991
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2964
01:22:15.991 --> 01:22:17.550
<v Speaker 7>He broke just fucking foot in the first round.</v>

2965
01:22:17.551 --> 01:22:18.384
<v Speaker 7>You never knew it.</v>

2966
01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:18.840
<v Speaker 7>He just,</v>

2967
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.460
<v Speaker 7>he just moved around like nothing.</v>

2968
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:23.390
<v Speaker 7>But what I liked about it is he,</v>

2969
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.020
<v Speaker 7>he showed patients in that fight,</v>

2970
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:28.860
<v Speaker 7>like you've seen him in fights before we explodes and he empties the gas tank</v>

2971
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.190
<v Speaker 7>and the first round and then he has a hard time in the second and third.</v>

2972
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.500
<v Speaker 7>Like he was way more patient.</v>

2973
01:22:34.501 --> 01:22:36.630
<v Speaker 7>Like you could almost see Duke,</v>

2974
01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:37.110
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2975
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:38.340
<v Speaker 7>and Duke style,</v>

2976
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:39.950
<v Speaker 7>like influencing him slightly.</v>

2977
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.310
<v Speaker 7>How do you think cm punk is going to do?</v>

2978
01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:42.721
<v Speaker 7>I don't think,</v>

2979
01:22:42.721 --> 01:22:43.200
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2980
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.130
<v Speaker 7>we have any idea.</v>

2981
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 7>I don't think we have any idea.</v>

2982
01:22:45.650 --> 01:22:45.820
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2983
01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:49.470
<v Speaker 7>if I watched the guy do anything other than throw some kicks,</v>

2984
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.640
<v Speaker 7>which is all I've ever seen.</v>

2985
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000
<v Speaker 7>I saw him throw some kicks and I'm hoping with every fiber of my being that he</v>

2986
01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:59.730
<v Speaker 7>was just playing around and then he actually kicks better than that because</v>

2987
01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:00.210
<v Speaker 7>he's,</v>

2988
01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:04.380
<v Speaker 7>there's like some back stage WWE thing where he's thrown roundhouse kicks on</v>

2989
01:23:04.381 --> 01:23:07.300
<v Speaker 7>like a wrestling and I don't understand it.</v>

2990
01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.370
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's either he was playing around,</v>

2991
01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:10.720
<v Speaker 7>they were a good thing though.</v>

2992
01:23:10.721 --> 01:23:15.400
<v Speaker 7>He just started doing karate like a week ago or you don't understand it and he's</v>

2993
01:23:15.401 --> 01:23:16.330
<v Speaker 7>going to mystify people.</v>

2994
01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:20.920
<v Speaker 7>Well or he just fucking around because he's a Sheldon and that's,</v>

2995
01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:21.281
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2996
01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:22.770
<v Speaker 7>when he's doing those things backstage,</v>

2997
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:25.390
<v Speaker 7>she's not trying to show everybody he's the ultimate bad ass.</v>

2998
01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:26.070
<v Speaker 7>He's being,</v>

2999
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.903
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3000
01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.630
<v Speaker 7>is there any word on who is going to fight?</v>

3001
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.920
<v Speaker 7>No word,</v>

3002
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.860
<v Speaker 7>nor is there a word on a timetable like when he's going to fight,</v>

3003
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:33.641

<v Speaker 7>They did have an opponent for him.</v>

3005
01:23:35.141 --> 01:23:37.390
<v Speaker 7>The Guy who fought dot Mickey work last</v>

3006
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:39.880
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

3007
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:42.303
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

3008
01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:46.110
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I've know him so well.</v>

3009
01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:48.390
<v Speaker 3>I could see the laugh being suppressed.</v>

3010
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Joe Cm</v>

3011
01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:51.363
<v Speaker 7>punk.</v>

3012
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:52.343
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

3013
01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.220
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3014
01:23:53.221 --> 01:23:54.054
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3015
01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:55.523
<v Speaker 7>this is what I think.</v>

3016
01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:56.860
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it's good for the sport.</v>

3017
01:23:56.890 --> 01:24:01.570
<v Speaker 7>Just if he goes in there and you know he fights and people watch it cause he's</v>

3018
01:24:01.571 --> 01:24:02.290
<v Speaker 7>famous.</v>

3019
01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 7>I think people will pay attention,</v>

3020
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:07.090
<v Speaker 7>but it's not necessarily good for the sport if they're just paying attention</v>

3021
01:24:07.091 --> 01:24:08.050
<v Speaker 7>because you see him pump.</v>

3022
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:09.453
<v Speaker 7>However,</v>

3023
01:24:09.490 --> 01:24:14.490
<v Speaker 7>I think it is good for the sport if he truly has a real desire to become a</v>

3024
01:24:15.371 --> 01:24:17.110
<v Speaker 7>professional mixed martial arts fighter.</v>

3025
01:24:17.111 --> 01:24:18.790
<v Speaker 7>This isn't just a money making scam.</v>

3026
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.500
<v Speaker 7>This isn't just to publicity scam.</v>

3027
01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.150
<v Speaker 7>This isn't just a one time thing.</v>

3028
01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:26.320
<v Speaker 7>This is a guy who at x age 36 or whatever it is,</v>

3029
01:24:26.321 --> 01:24:26.891
<v Speaker 7>is decided.</v>

3030
01:24:26.891 --> 01:24:27.400

3033
01:24:30.611 --> 01:24:34.300

3034
01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:35.230
<v Speaker 7>I think that's what he's doing.</v>

3035

<v Speaker 7>I got advantage then it's good,</v>

3036
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:37.580

<v Speaker 4>I told them to stop with the fucking Tririga for a ranch</v>

3148
01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:35.653
<v Speaker 4>behind you.</v>

3149
01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Cause I like a domestic violence dispute.</v>

3150
01:27:41.331 --> 01:27:43.880
<v Speaker 4>What if that would you just fucked up?</v>

3151
01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that's a felony.</v>

3152
01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:48.050
<v Speaker 4>That check's going to come out of the woodwork.</v>

3153
01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.810
<v Speaker 4>It was 15 years ago.</v>

3154
01:27:50.811 --> 01:27:51.644
<v Speaker 4>I was appropriate.</v>

3155
01:27:51.730 --> 01:27:52.563
<v Speaker 4>What did I know?</v>

3156
01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.780
<v Speaker 4>The timeline.</v>

3157
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:57.143
<v Speaker 4>Vagina.</v>

3158
01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:59.540
<v Speaker 4>You do not give a timeline out.</v>

3159
01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.590
<v Speaker 4>Don't say when you sue sue hoists,</v>

3160
01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.450
<v Speaker 4>I think you met 20 years inspiration.</v>

3161
01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:04.551
<v Speaker 4>I never hit her.</v>

3162
01:28:04.551 --> 01:28:06.410
<v Speaker 4>I just use triangle escape.</v>

3163
01:28:07.710 --> 01:28:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3164
01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.220
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

3165
01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:11.133
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

3166
01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Well we weren't paying attention.</v>

3167
01:28:12.411 --> 01:28:13.540
<v Speaker 2>You didn't win.</v>

3168
01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:16.700
<v Speaker 4>He landed more strikes.</v>

3169
01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:18.230
<v Speaker 4>Did it?</v>

3170
01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:19.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3171
01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:21.630
<v Speaker 4>One 2189 you know what man?</v>

3172
01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:25.080
<v Speaker 4>How many that make us feel better?</v>

3173
01:28:25.081 --> 01:28:26.040
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see.</v>

3174
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.841
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

3175
01:28:27.841 --> 01:28:28.674
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

3176
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:30.600
<v Speaker 4>But that's the move of the fight.</v>

3177
01:28:31.230 --> 01:28:33.750
<v Speaker 4>The move of the fight is a half half a jab.</v>

3178
01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:35.250
<v Speaker 4>They move with the fight.</v>

3179
01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.080
<v Speaker 4>The fight is him getting hit.</v>

3180
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.943
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3181
01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:41.921
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>

3182
01:28:41.921 --> 01:28:43.120
<v Speaker 2>That was a tricky punch.</v>

3183
01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:43.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3184
01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:45.700
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what happened in that fight,</v>

3185
01:28:45.970 --> 01:28:46.690
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

3186
01:28:46.690 --> 01:28:50.410
<v Speaker 2>We really weren't watching that fight to watch the key moments in the beginning</v>

3187
01:28:50.411 --> 01:28:51.910
<v Speaker 2>where he was getting hit by right hooks.</v>

3188
01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Tate,</v>

3189
01:28:53.530 --> 01:28:54.040
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3190
01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:54.873
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3191
01:28:55.290 --> 01:28:57.910
<v Speaker 2>that's part of his success off of cats and God,</v>

3192
01:28:57.911 --> 01:28:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll use that for an argument.</v>

3193
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3194
01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:02.280

3195
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.070
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3196
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:04.410
<v Speaker 2>That's your stomping grounds.</v>

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:11.993
<v Speaker 2>pretty good,</v>

3200
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:13.280
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3201
01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.910
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to find more interesting now.</v>

3202
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:15.870
<v Speaker 2>One of her fights,</v>

3203
01:29:15.871 --> 01:29:17.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a clip of her when she wants,</v>

3204
01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:20.200
<v Speaker 2>she screamed and it's,</v>

3205
01:29:20.201 --> 01:29:24.360
<v Speaker 2>it's this fucking crime or roar that it's like,</v>

3206
01:29:24.361 --> 01:29:25.980
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the craziest screams.</v>

3207
01:29:25.981 --> 01:29:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I remember the gentleman's mouth.</v>

3208
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:28.703
<v Speaker 2>Can we find that?</v>

3209
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:30.241
<v Speaker 2>I bet it.</v>

3210
01:29:30.241 --> 01:29:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I bet if you just Google cat Zingano,</v>

3211
01:29:32.311 --> 01:29:33.001

3214
01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:34.501

3215
01:29:34.501 --> 01:29:35.430
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>

3216

<v Speaker 2>I don't take orders from you.</v>

3217

<v Speaker 2>It's sick.</v>

3222
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:44.143

<v Speaker 2>Cat Zingano around 10 I'm trying to scream.</v>

3229

<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

3230
01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Not motivated enough to look for it.</v>

3231
01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.231
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3232
01:30:11.231 --> 01:30:12.460
<v Speaker 2>You're the one who brought it up,</v>

3233
01:30:14.230 --> 01:30:15.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3234

3235
01:30:17.291 --> 01:30:18.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested man.</v>

3236
01:30:18.491 --> 01:30:19.000
<v Speaker 2>At work.</v>

3237
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Just talking about an instance after a fight where she screamed at the end of</v>

3238
01:30:23.111 --> 01:30:23.990
<v Speaker 2>every is a fight.</v>

3239
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3240
01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just like a 15 second clip.</v>

3241
01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:27.851
<v Speaker 2>It probably,</v>

3242
01:30:27.851 --> 01:30:31.120
<v Speaker 2>is it just not on youtube as cat Zingano scream yet?</v>

3243
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it will be now after this.</v>

3244
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:34.590
<v Speaker 2>It will be after this summer.</v>

3245
01:30:34.591 --> 01:30:35.424
<v Speaker 2>We'll probably hear,</v>

3246
01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll have faith and Jamie's going to find that motherfucking screen.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I remember remember who it was.</v>

3251
01:30:44.861 --> 01:30:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3252
01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:49.120
<v Speaker 2>it might have been a Amanda Nunez who was her last fight blood.</v>

3253
01:30:49.121 --> 01:30:49.811
<v Speaker 2>Once she won,</v>

3254
01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:51.160
<v Speaker 2>she fucking roared.</v>

3255
01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:54.580
<v Speaker 2>She roars like an animal.</v>

3256
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:56.591
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3257
01:30:56.591 --> 01:30:57.550
<v Speaker 2>she's an animal.</v>

3258
01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:58.960

<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

3344
01:32:55.241 --> 01:32:55.810
<v Speaker 3>cause if you have,</v>

3345
01:32:55.810 --> 01:32:57.040
<v Speaker 3>if you're born with small titties,</v>

3346
01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.530
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing you could do physically to grow those cities.</v>

3347
01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Get fake titties your ass just do some squats for a couple of years and watch</v>

3348
01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:05.044
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck you eat.</v>

3349
01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:06.390
<v Speaker 3>All is showing you that you're lazy.</v>

3350
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Girls can reshape her body.</v>

3351
01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:09.483
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

3352
01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.750
<v Speaker 3>If she did the romance,</v>

3353
01:33:11.210 --> 01:33:12.220
<v Speaker 3>it's genetics.</v>

3354
01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:12.850
<v Speaker 3>You do ask,</v>

3355
01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:13.100
<v Speaker 3>watch.</v>

3356
01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 3>You want,</v>

3357
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:15.070
<v Speaker 3>if you have a flat ass like Mr. Burns,</v>

3358
01:33:15.071 --> 01:33:16.210
<v Speaker 3>you ain't getting a bubble.</v>

3359
01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:17.650
<v Speaker 3>But with the PR,</v>

3360
01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.520
<v Speaker 3>the correct squads and Tau Song,</v>

3361
01:33:22.290 --> 01:33:24.150
<v Speaker 3>attention to nutrition,</v>

3362
01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:25.480
<v Speaker 3>power lifting some shit.</v>

3363
01:33:25.690 --> 01:33:27.550
<v Speaker 3>I think you could do like who's to say,</v>

3364
01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:32.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean if this bitch went ham on a crossfit program is squats and nutrients shot</v>

3365
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.270
<v Speaker 3>testosterone right into the glutes.</v>

3366
01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Well now directly,</v>

3367
01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:36.870
<v Speaker 3>directly.</v>

3368
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I need some alternate that might do it.</v>

3369
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:40.020
<v Speaker 3>Ask the trainers,</v>

3370
01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:40.853
<v Speaker 3>the stripe.</v>

3371
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:43.960
<v Speaker 3>If I bring a girl with a straight flat ass Mr. Burns style,</v>

3372
01:33:43.961 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 3>you can give her a bubble.</v>

3373
01:33:45.011 --> 01:33:45.440
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3374
01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.660
<v Speaker 3>cause there's different body types and now there's like active more fit girl.</v>

3375
01:33:50.530 --> 01:33:55.330
<v Speaker 3>Is that before and after for just butts like flatness and curvature and all</v>

3376
01:33:55.331 --> 01:33:55.450
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3377
01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:55.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3378
01:33:55.691 --> 01:33:55.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3379
01:33:55.881 --> 01:33:59.560
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen some pretty crazy before and after shots for sure.</v>

3380
01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:01.260
<v Speaker 3>Based on base on Yay.</v>

3381
01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3382
01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:03.250
<v Speaker 3>ass and hips to waist ratio.</v>

3383
01:34:03.251 --> 01:34:04.084
<v Speaker 3>All that.</v>

3384
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:06.940
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing so good.</v>

3385
01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.660
<v Speaker 3>I agree with what her son die.</v>

3386
01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:13.170
<v Speaker 3>While you're eating chips on the mic,</v>

3387
01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:18.370
<v Speaker 3>you are just joining this chips though.</v>

3388
01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:20.163
<v Speaker 3>You're destroying those.</v>

3389
01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:20.401
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>

3390
01:34:20.401 --> 01:34:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

3391
01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:22.360
<v Speaker 3>I those are the salt and vinegar ones.</v>

3392
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:23.703
<v Speaker 3>Those are good.</v>

3393
01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I have the same ones here.</v>

3394
01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:27.490
<v Speaker 3>How does,</v>

3395
01:34:27.490 --> 01:34:29.320
<v Speaker 3>how does it feel when you,</v>

3396
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:32.350
<v Speaker 3>when you first started at not doing UFC?</v>

3397
01:34:32.351 --> 01:34:35.330
<v Speaker 3>Is that the first shows where they started branching out and using carelogic</v>

3398
01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.850
<v Speaker 3>watching it's better.</v>

3399
01:34:36.851 --> 01:34:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3400
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:38.043
<v Speaker 3>I like watching,</v>

3401
01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean I like commentary but I'm like watch them too.</v>

3402
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:46.000
<v Speaker 3>If for whatever reason I never worked for the UFC again.</v>

3403
01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I would probably watch this as many fights are pretty close.</v>

3404
01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:50.260
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't watch the prelims as much,</v>

3405
01:34:50.530 --> 01:34:54.610
<v Speaker 3>like the early prelims cause I just don't have six hours on most days to be</v>

3406
01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:55.840
<v Speaker 3>watching fights.</v>

3407
01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 3>But for purposes</v>

3408
01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:59.240
<v Speaker 10>like how much do I enjoy it?</v>

3409
01:34:59.241 --> 01:35:01.130
<v Speaker 10>I fucking love watching the fights on TV.</v>

3410
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:03.380
<v Speaker 10>I like the fact that I don't have to go anywhere.</v>

3411
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:05.930
<v Speaker 10>I'm home hanging out with my friends,</v>

3412
01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.100
<v Speaker 10>having a couple of beers,</v>

3413
01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:07.791
<v Speaker 10>watching fights.</v>

3414
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:08.624
<v Speaker 10>I love it.</v>

3415
01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:08.961
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

3416
01:35:08.961 --> 01:35:10.070
<v Speaker 10>I love working for the UFC,</v>

3417
01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:11.180
<v Speaker 10>but I love watching too.</v>

3418
01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.390
<v Speaker 10>I wouldn't mind it off.</v>

3419
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:13.243
<v Speaker 10>I didn't do it again.</v>

3420
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.660
<v Speaker 10>I'd rather do this and sit front row at any live event as a Chinese men all day.</v>

3421
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:19.573
<v Speaker 10>That's true.</v>

3422
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:22.160
<v Speaker 10>How often do you actually rewatch a show?</v>

3423
01:35:22.161 --> 01:35:25.220
<v Speaker 10>You just occasionally a watch,</v>

3424
01:35:25.221 --> 01:35:27.920
<v Speaker 10>like big fights or big moments,</v>

3425
01:35:27.921 --> 01:35:29.690
<v Speaker 10>like something that was like really special to me.</v>

3426
01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:31.580
<v Speaker 10>I just been some fights where I watched,</v>

3427
01:35:31.581 --> 01:35:32.210
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

3428
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:33.620
<v Speaker 10>I watched the same fight like two,</v>

3429
01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:35.000
<v Speaker 10>three times in a row just to,</v>

3430
01:35:35.001 --> 01:35:35.331
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3431
01:35:35.331 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 10>see like wild transitions or some shit,</v>

3432
01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:38.431
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

3433
01:35:38.431 --> 01:35:40.520

<v Speaker 10>Oh my God.</v>

3544
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:45.990
<v Speaker 10>This was right after I fought cro cop.</v>

3545
01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:49.020
<v Speaker 10>I had like 10 11 months left because of it.</v>

3546
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.910
<v Speaker 10>And then I fought Nogueira after that.</v>

3547
01:38:50.911 --> 01:38:54.270
<v Speaker 10>So you had a 10 11 month layout because of Oxycontin addiction?</v>

3548
01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:54.571
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

3549
01:38:54.571 --> 01:38:55.680
<v Speaker 10>because I had a nose job.</v>

3550
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:56.340
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>

3551
01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:58.410
<v Speaker 10>but how long did the Oxycontin addiction kicks in?</v>

3552
01:38:58.650 --> 01:38:59.760
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

3553
01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:00.931
<v Speaker 10>I was probably,</v>

3554
01:39:00.931 --> 01:39:03.120
<v Speaker 10>I was probably doing it hardcore for like four months.</v>

3555
01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.313
<v Speaker 10>Four months.</v>

3556
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:05.340
<v Speaker 10>Then I,</v>

3557
01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:08.400
<v Speaker 10>my my best friend Joe Cloth Einstein came over and took him from it.</v>

3558
01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:09.211
<v Speaker 10>What kind of stupid shit?</v>

3559
01:39:09.211 --> 01:39:09.841
<v Speaker 10>Where are you doing on it?</v>

3560
01:39:09.841 --> 01:39:11.160
<v Speaker 10>Where they had to intervene.</v>

3561
01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.200
<v Speaker 10>They just knew I was taking them nonstop.</v>

3562
01:39:13.290 --> 01:39:14.123
<v Speaker 10>Like what are we doing?</v>

3563
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:14.820

<v Speaker 10>They must have been.</v>

3565
01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:17.100
<v Speaker 10>Cause if you were just normal like this,</v>

3566
01:39:17.130 --> 01:39:17.970
<v Speaker 10>people wouldn't even notice.</v>

3567
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.150
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

3568
01:39:18.150 --> 01:39:20.070
<v Speaker 10>I was like this because I'm not,</v>

3569

3572
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:24.240
<v Speaker 10>Were you sleeping all day?</v>

3573
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:26.070
<v Speaker 10>I think I was just out of it all the time.</v>

3574

3611
01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:22.621
<v Speaker 10>Isn't it weird?</v>

<v Speaker 10>Like you don't have to go to them to get your pill.</v>

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:42.260
<v Speaker 9>he's not burning out any fast twitch muscle fibers.</v>

3717
01:42:42.261 --> 01:42:45.380
<v Speaker 9>He stays on you at like a 75% pace.</v>

3718
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:46.243
<v Speaker 9>Always.</v>

3719
01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:47.810
<v Speaker 9>His biggest thing is confidence,</v>

3720
01:42:47.811 --> 01:42:47.961
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

3721
01:42:47.961 --> 01:42:49.010
<v Speaker 9>He's getting more confident.</v>

3722
01:42:49.011 --> 01:42:50.120
<v Speaker 9>He's always had the skill.</v>

3723
01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:51.320
<v Speaker 9>It's just confidence.</v>

3724
01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:53.660
<v Speaker 9>The only thing that's missing with Neil Magni,</v>

3725
01:42:53.661 --> 01:42:56.120
<v Speaker 9>it's like knockout power is you know what's missing and he's just,</v>

3726
01:42:56.121 --> 01:42:57.170
<v Speaker 9>he's just not mean.</v>

3727
01:42:57.230 --> 01:42:57.801
<v Speaker 9>Neil's never,</v>

3728
01:42:57.801 --> 01:42:58.880
<v Speaker 9>he's not mean.</v>

3729
01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:01.130
<v Speaker 9>I nicknamed him the fucking Gazelle.</v>

3730
01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:01.880
<v Speaker 9>There's not,</v>

3731
01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:02.190
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

3732
01:43:02.190 --> 01:43:04.010
<v Speaker 9>Gizelle doesn't have an aggressive bone in his body.</v>

3733
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:05.490
<v Speaker 9>He nicknamed me like Gazelle,</v>

3734
01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:07.911
<v Speaker 9>but he's,</v>

3735
01:43:07.911 --> 01:43:09.580
<v Speaker 9>he's a very competent fighter.</v>

3736
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:11.990
<v Speaker 9>Like he definitely knows how to fight huge reach.</v>

3737
01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:12.853
<v Speaker 9>Good Cardio.</v>

3738
01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:13.790
<v Speaker 9>He's a beast man.</v>

3739
01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.350
<v Speaker 9>He's just smart fighters.</v>

3740
01:43:15.351 --> 01:43:15.621
<v Speaker 9>Fights.</v>

3741
01:43:15.621 --> 01:43:16.371
<v Speaker 9>Very smart.</v>

3742
01:43:16.371 --> 01:43:17.204
<v Speaker 9>Very smart.</v>

3743
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.401
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3744
01:43:19.401 --> 01:43:20.181
<v Speaker 9>He's one of those dudes.</v>

3745
01:43:20.181 --> 01:43:22.410
<v Speaker 9>It's on a win streak to know we're talking about no one talks.</v>

3746
01:43:22.411 --> 01:43:23.360
<v Speaker 9>So I think he's on a seven,</v>

3747
01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:23.781
<v Speaker 9>seven,</v>

3748
01:43:23.781 --> 01:43:24.350
<v Speaker 9>five,</v>

3749
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.921
<v Speaker 9>six,</v>

3750
01:43:24.921 --> 01:43:25.221
<v Speaker 9>six,</v>

3751
01:43:25.221 --> 01:43:26.090

3754
01:43:29.721 --> 01:43:30.890
<v Speaker 9>he's on the main card,</v>

3755
01:43:30.891 --> 01:43:32.100
<v Speaker 9>so someone's talking about it.</v>

3756
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.780

<v Speaker 9>like better guys.</v>

3769
01:43:44.361 --> 01:43:46.070
<v Speaker 9>What did you think about Nate's last fight?</v>

3770
01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.090
<v Speaker 9>Is that hard to watch?</v>

3771
01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.200
<v Speaker 9>Super hard to watch.</v>

3772
01:43:48.201 --> 01:43:49.610
<v Speaker 9>I sent him a text and said,</v>

3773
01:43:49.611 --> 01:43:49.731
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

3774
01:43:49.731 --> 01:43:51.140
<v Speaker 9>I need you to come in for a podcast.</v>

3775
01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.153
<v Speaker 9>Rogan.</v>

3776
01:43:52.350 --> 01:43:53.480
<v Speaker 10>I'm just kidding.</v>

3777
01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:54.481
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

3778
01:43:54.481 --> 01:43:55.940
<v Speaker 10>but for real.</v>

3779
01:43:55.941 --> 01:43:58.020
<v Speaker 10>So I don't think you'd be surprised.</v>

3780
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:03.700
<v Speaker 10>I've learned or evolved through this.</v>

3781
01:44:03.701 --> 01:44:04.220
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>

3782
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.070
<v Speaker 10>You know what though?</v>

3783
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:06.163
<v Speaker 10>Can you tell like,</v>

3784
01:44:06.170 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 10>I think it's time to go on Joe's podcast.</v>

3785
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:09.230
<v Speaker 10>That's what I tell him.</v>

3786
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:09.830
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

3787
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:10.680
<v Speaker 10>I wasn't doing,</v>

3788
01:44:10.710 --> 01:44:11.543
<v Speaker 10>unless I love them.</v>

3789
01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:12.980
<v Speaker 10>It's tough for me to watch,</v>

3790
01:44:12.981 --> 01:44:13.191
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

3791
01:44:13.191 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 10>We would need a specialty.</v>

3792
01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:15.510
<v Speaker 10>Nate was my hero.</v>

3793
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:16.611
<v Speaker 10>I missed that fight.</v>

3794
01:44:16.611 --> 01:44:16.991
<v Speaker 10>What happened?</v>

3795
01:44:16.991 --> 01:44:17.900
<v Speaker 10>He just looked bad,</v>

3796
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:22.910
<v Speaker 10>like as slow is looked really fucking good to not taking anything away from</v>

3797
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:24.620
<v Speaker 10>Nate.</v>

3798
01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.240
<v Speaker 10>I think Nate's a really good fighter,</v>

3799
01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:30.230
<v Speaker 10>but Brad to Varas is becoming like something special right now.</v>

3800
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:30.861
<v Speaker 10>I get that.</v>

3801
01:44:30.861 --> 01:44:31.694
<v Speaker 10>But Nate,</v>

3802
01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:32.061
<v Speaker 10>Nate,</v>

3803
01:44:32.061 --> 01:44:32.840
<v Speaker 10>more cart ne,</v>

3804
01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:33.710
<v Speaker 10>a young Nate.</v>

3805
01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:36.510
<v Speaker 10>Nate in his prime was a fuck B's.</v>

3806
01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:38.090
<v Speaker 10>You're the best ever.</v>

3807
01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:38.570
<v Speaker 10>Really.</v>

3808
01:44:38.570 --> 01:44:39.560
<v Speaker 10>He's a very good fighter.</v>

3809
01:44:39.561 --> 01:44:42.630
<v Speaker 10>If you watch the combination that he finished Tyron Woodley off with and strike</v>

3810
01:44:42.631 --> 01:44:44.420
<v Speaker 10>force when he won the title in straight.</v>

3811
01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:45.410
<v Speaker 10>Dude,</v>

3812
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:48.380
<v Speaker 10>that's some video combat ship spinning elbow.</v>

3813
01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:48.950
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

3814
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:49.850
<v Speaker 10>he looked beautiful.</v>

3815
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:50.271
<v Speaker 10>Look,</v>

3816
01:44:50.271 --> 01:44:50.590
<v Speaker 10>Nate,</v>

3817
01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:53.960
<v Speaker 10>it's been around a long time and a fight since he was 17 you know who gave me</v>

3818
01:44:53.961 --> 01:44:55.940
<v Speaker 10>insight into Nate is you?</v>

3819
01:44:56.150 --> 01:45:00.020
<v Speaker 10>When you told me that he was one of his main sparring partners was Shane Carwyn.</v>

3820
01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.240
<v Speaker 10>It was me and Shane and I.</v>

3821
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:03.490
<v Speaker 10>When is the only three of us everyday in the chill,</v>

3822
01:45:05.170 --> 01:45:09.150
<v Speaker 10>but just thinking someone fighting at one 70 who spars with shake car.</v>

3823
01:45:09.170 --> 01:45:11.120
<v Speaker 10>I mean maybe it was one of the five at the time,</v>

3824
01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:14.000
<v Speaker 10>but when Nate was fighting in [inaudible] 85 he wasn't really cutting any</v>

3825
01:45:14.001 --> 01:45:14.690
<v Speaker 10>weight.</v>

3826
01:45:14.690 --> 01:45:15.081
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

3827
01:45:15.081 --> 01:45:16.930
<v Speaker 10>he walked around like one 92 yeah,</v>

3828
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:18.260
<v Speaker 10>that's what he's fighting with me.</v>

3829
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:18.681
<v Speaker 10>Shane,</v>

3830
01:45:18.681 --> 01:45:20.780
<v Speaker 10>who was walking around at two 80 me.</v>

3831
01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:22.700
<v Speaker 10>I was too wise to just say what number,</v>

3832
01:45:22.701 --> 01:45:23.534
<v Speaker 10>what was that number?</v>

3833
01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:24.351
<v Speaker 10>She ain't,</v>

3834
01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:27.170
<v Speaker 10>Shane was assault to 80 that hurts my face.</v>

3835
01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:31.540
<v Speaker 10>That's like the greatest training partner to work on footwork.</v>

3836
01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:34.900
<v Speaker 10>But that's how I got all my,</v>

3837
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.681
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

3838
01:45:36.681 --> 01:45:38.240
<v Speaker 10>that's not good for your brain.</v>

3839
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:39.283
<v Speaker 10>Nope.</v>

3840
01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:40.820
<v Speaker 10>It's really not good for your brain.</v>

3841
01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:42.590
<v Speaker 10>I was saying it was the hardest he'd ever been.</v>

3842
01:45:42.610 --> 01:45:43.490
<v Speaker 10>He is like,</v>

3843
01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:47.650
<v Speaker 10>here's in a clinch and like he's got an under hook and they're hot and he says</v>

3844
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:48.703
<v Speaker 10>just this far away.</v>

3845
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:51.200
<v Speaker 10>And he's like,</v>

01:45:55.090 --> 01:45:55.923
<v Speaker 10>Dang.</v>

3849
01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:58.220
<v Speaker 10>He's used to stand and bang with Shane.</v>

3850
01:45:58.410 --> 01:45:59.930
<v Speaker 10>I'd like leave this dude.</v>

01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.010
<v Speaker 10>All of us are just punks.</v>

3855
01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.040
<v Speaker 10>Just stop and think about everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 10>That's Shane Carlin is sparred with</v>

3857
01:46:14.230 --> 01:46:17.090
<v Speaker 10>Shane Carwyn like his hands are so stupid.</v>

3858
01:46:17.091 --> 01:46:18.020
<v Speaker 10>Big Dead.</v>

3859
01:46:18.021 --> 01:46:19.850
<v Speaker 10>Literally like lunchboxes.</v>

3860
01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:22.760
<v Speaker 10>They'll like some fucking Thor lunchbox shit.</v>

3861
01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:25.250
<v Speaker 10>Some hammer at the end of his wrist.</v>

3862
01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:26.520
<v Speaker 10>What does he wear at four XL?</v>

3863
01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:27.410
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

3864
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:28.450
<v Speaker 10>glove glove.</v>

3865
01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:30.740
<v Speaker 10>Ever bigger gloves then</v>

3866
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:33.890
<v Speaker 10>change bigger than Brock.</v>

3867
01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:34.990
<v Speaker 10>That's what people don't understand.</v>

3868
01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.260
<v Speaker 10>Brock's lower leg.</v>

3869
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:38.780
<v Speaker 10>He lowered Kate body part isn't that big.</v>

3870
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.641
<v Speaker 10>Like his ass.</v>

3871
01:46:39.641 --> 01:46:40.450
<v Speaker 10>His quads.</v>

3872
01:46:40.450 --> 01:46:40.730
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

3873
01:46:40.730 --> 01:46:41.930
<v Speaker 10>His calves aren't that big.</v>

3874
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:44.210
<v Speaker 10>Shane's like a fucking Mack truck.</v>

3875
01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:45.350
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

3876
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:46.760
<v Speaker 10>Shane is a big fucking you.</v>

3877
01:46:46.761 --> 01:46:48.380
<v Speaker 10>Do you know what?</v>

3878
01:46:48.381 --> 01:46:51.000
<v Speaker 10>I would've loved to seen what happened with Shane if he didn't have all those</v>

3879
01:46:51.001 --> 01:46:53.850
<v Speaker 10>injuries from football because football and wrestling,</v>

3880
01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.080
<v Speaker 10>both of those,</v>

3881
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:59.300
<v Speaker 10>but they're back injuries to those back into that spinal.</v>

3882
01:46:59.301 --> 01:46:59.940
<v Speaker 10>It's fucked up.</v>

3883
01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.260
<v Speaker 10>All that stuff is just,</v>

3884
01:47:01.261 --> 01:47:03.000
<v Speaker 10>that's so debilitating.</v>

3885
01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:03.460
<v Speaker 10>That's,</v>

3886
01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:05.960
<v Speaker 10>it removes so much athleticism.</v>

3887
01:47:05.970 --> 01:47:07.320
<v Speaker 10>So much explosion.</v>

3888
01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:11.190
<v Speaker 10>Like a fighter becomes so different when they have a back neck injury.</v>

3889
01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:11.580
<v Speaker 10>Rowan,</v>

3890
01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:12.230
<v Speaker 10>Shane Fug,</v>

3891
01:47:12.230 --> 01:47:13.040
<v Speaker 10>frank mayor.</v>

3892
01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 10>We're in the same camp.</v>

3893
01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:14.760
<v Speaker 10>Obviously.</v>

3894
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.160
<v Speaker 10>When I forget who I was getting ready for,</v>

3895
01:47:16.170 --> 01:47:17.560
<v Speaker 10>maybe cro cop or no guy,</v>

3896
01:47:17.561 --> 01:47:18.270
<v Speaker 10>I forget,</v>

3897
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:21.660
<v Speaker 10>but Shane maybe hit mits three times.</v>

3898
01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:23.520
<v Speaker 10>Maybe training and not much.</v>

3899
01:47:23.521 --> 01:47:24.360
<v Speaker 10>Man rolled him,</v>

3900
01:47:24.361 --> 01:47:25.710
<v Speaker 10>beat the brakes off.</v>

3901
01:47:25.711 --> 01:47:27.360
<v Speaker 10>Frank didn't no flux given,</v>

3902
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:30.300
<v Speaker 10>well he hit the gas from the opening round.</v>

3903
01:47:30.301 --> 01:47:31.140
<v Speaker 10>We got an under hook.</v>

3904
01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:31.980
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

3905
01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:35.250
<v Speaker 10>he got him tied up and he was hitting him with left upper cuts that just looked</v>

3906
01:47:35.251 --> 01:47:39.120
<v Speaker 10>like he might've sparred literally three or four times at camp.</v>

3907
01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:41.460
<v Speaker 10>What was perfect cause you know that wasn't sparring.</v>

3908
01:47:41.461 --> 01:47:42.450
<v Speaker 10>That was an ass whooping.</v>

3909
01:47:42.810 --> 01:47:43.590
<v Speaker 10>I mean he just,</v>

3910
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:46.110
<v Speaker 10>he grabbed a hold of them and beat the fuck out of him.</v>

3911
01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:46.870
<v Speaker 10>It was,</v>

3912
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:48.810
<v Speaker 10>it was a hard one to watch because that one,</v>

3913
01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:51.990
<v Speaker 10>I think he took way too many shots and not fight me or did,</v>

3914
01:47:51.991 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 10>I mean I think that could have been stopped earlier.</v>

3915
01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:59.360
<v Speaker 10>Just Shane's short powerful punches were just ruthless in that fight.</v>

3916
01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:04.080
<v Speaker 10>He seemed a little too relaxed in the clinch against the cage.</v>

3917
01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:05.370
<v Speaker 10>Well Frank's coach frank,</v>

3918
01:48:05.371 --> 01:48:05.881
<v Speaker 10>coach goes,</v>

3919
01:48:05.881 --> 01:48:06.840
<v Speaker 10>relax here.</v>

3920
01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:07.741
<v Speaker 10>Relax here.</v>

3921
01:48:07.741 --> 01:48:08.670
<v Speaker 10>You're doing fine.</v>

3922
01:48:08.671 --> 01:48:12.000
<v Speaker 10>I'll have caught one that hell no,</v>

3923
01:48:12.001 --> 01:48:13.040
<v Speaker 10>you ain't doing fine.</v>

3924
01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:13.381
<v Speaker 10>Yes.</v>

3925
01:48:13.381 --> 01:48:13.620
<v Speaker 10>Shane.</v>

3926
01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:13.920
<v Speaker 10>Carmen,</v>

3927
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:14.753
<v Speaker 10>the under hook.</v>

3928
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:15.391
<v Speaker 10>That's it.</v>

3929
01:48:15.391 --> 01:48:16.740
<v Speaker 10>That's where he makes his living.</v>

3930
01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.600
<v Speaker 10>Everyone knows Shankar meets under like,</v>

3931
01:48:18.601 --> 01:48:19.950
<v Speaker 10>you better get the fuck out,</v>

3932
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.290
<v Speaker 10>get the fuck out outside.</v>

3933
01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:23.940
<v Speaker 10>She even like no wrestle either.</v>

3934
01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:25.260
<v Speaker 10>He didn't want to wrestle ever.</v>

3935
01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.820
<v Speaker 10>What is your insight with a guy like Cain Velasquez continually getting injured?</v>

3936
01:48:30.150 --> 01:48:31.350
<v Speaker 10>What do you think that's about?</v>

3937
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.620
<v Speaker 10>Listen,</v>

3938
01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:34.170
<v Speaker 10>w w with the wrestling and he,</v>

3939
01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:35.490
<v Speaker 10>how long has he been competing for?</v>

3940
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.080
<v Speaker 10>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3941
01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.350
<v Speaker 10>And blessing and now he's been getting ready for forever for MMA.</v>

3942
01:48:40.351 --> 01:48:41.250
<v Speaker 10>Went straight into it.</v>

3943
01:48:41.251 --> 01:48:43.020
<v Speaker 10>I just think his body's never had a break.</v>

3944
01:48:43.170 --> 01:48:44.150
<v Speaker 10>Finally the body's like,</v>

3945
01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:44.640
<v Speaker 10>you know what man,</v>

3946
01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.600
<v Speaker 10>we can't do this anymore.</v>

3947
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:46.980
<v Speaker 10>We just can't do this anymore.</v>

3948
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.570
<v Speaker 10>You leave,</v>

3949
01:48:47.570 --> 01:48:49.050
<v Speaker 10>you guys like junior dos Santos to,</v>

3950
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:53.610
<v Speaker 10>I mean anyone here thinks Joe Santos from those two fights with Kane is the same</v>

3951
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:54.630
<v Speaker 10>as fucking crazy.</v>

3952
01:48:54.810 --> 01:48:58.260
<v Speaker 10>That dude like he's just not the same and now he just had surgery on his hand</v>

3953
01:48:58.270 --> 01:48:59.103
<v Speaker 10>and knee.</v>

3954
01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:02.520
<v Speaker 10>So junior did he just after,</v>

3955
01:49:02.521 --> 01:49:03.331
<v Speaker 10>after Steve Bay,</v>

3956
01:49:03.331 --> 01:49:06.240
<v Speaker 10>he had another surgery and he had surgery before that fight.</v>

3957
01:49:06.690 --> 01:49:09.390
<v Speaker 10>So your body's telling you something and eventually your body's just like,</v>

3958
01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:10.360
<v Speaker 10>we can't do.</v>

3959
01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:12.090
<v Speaker 10>You can't compete at this level anymore.</v>

3960
01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.490
<v Speaker 10>When you see this deep bay fight,</v>

3961
01:49:14.491 --> 01:49:16.490
<v Speaker 10>do you think that that was just steep,</v>

3962
01:49:16.491 --> 01:49:18.750
<v Speaker 10>a just getting better and better and better?</v>

3963
01:49:19.170 --> 01:49:22.080
<v Speaker 10>Do you think it was junior sliding off a little bit or do think it was a</v>

3964
01:49:22.081 --> 01:49:23.070
<v Speaker 10>combination of both?</v>

3965
01:49:23.071 --> 01:49:24.090
<v Speaker 10>Combination of both.</v>

3966
01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:27.390
<v Speaker 10>I think Steve Bay is that the better I've seen Steve.</v>

3967
01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:29.610
<v Speaker 10>Steve Bay used to be a training partner of mine.</v>

3968
01:49:29.611 --> 01:49:31.380
<v Speaker 10>I used to fly steep bay in to Denver.</v>

3969
01:49:31.650 --> 01:49:32.400
<v Speaker 10>He's a beast.</v>

3970
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 10>Steve [inaudible].</v>

3971
01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:34.290
<v Speaker 10>Steve Bay is a tough guy.</v>

3972
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:35.760
<v Speaker 10>He looked very good in that fight too,</v>

3973
01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:37.170
<v Speaker 10>but I rose up a look better.</v>

3974
01:49:37.171 --> 01:49:38.700
<v Speaker 10>I think that really,</v>

3975
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:40.910
<v Speaker 10>I thought that was the best performance of steep based career.</v>

3976
01:49:40.911 --> 01:49:41.744
<v Speaker 10>I thought he rose up.</v>

3977
01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:42.940
<v Speaker 10>I mean I thought his,</v>

3978
01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:44.670
<v Speaker 10>his timing was super sharp.</v>

3979
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:48.250
<v Speaker 10>His boxing look good in the first round you do let your know.</v>

3980
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:50.980
<v Speaker 9>He did take some shots but in the first running let junior know like,</v>

3981
01:49:50.981 --> 01:49:51.161
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

3982
01:49:51.161 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 9>this is going to be some shit for sure.</v>

3983
01:49:52.721 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 9>Going through some shit,</v>

3984
01:49:53.950 --> 01:49:54.191
<v Speaker 9>like,</v>

3985
01:49:54.191 --> 01:49:55.120
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if you thought like,</v>

3986
01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:55.301
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>

3987
01:49:55.301 --> 01:49:56.650
<v Speaker 9>I'm not fighting Cain Velasquez.</v>

3988
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:57.560
<v Speaker 9>This is going to be nice.</v>

3989
01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:58.760
<v Speaker 9>We get a little bit of a break then.</v>

3990
01:49:58.770 --> 01:49:59.020
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

3991
01:49:59.020 --> 01:49:59.853
<v Speaker 9>no breaks.</v>

3992
01:49:59.890 --> 01:50:00.723
<v Speaker 9>I'm trying to kill you.</v>

3993
01:50:01.050 --> 01:50:01.691
<v Speaker 9>I had a man,</v>

3994
01:50:01.691 --> 01:50:02.530
<v Speaker 9>it was beautiful.</v>

3995
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.570
<v Speaker 9>I don't think juniors the same anymore.</v>

3996
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 9>I don't think.</v>

3997
01:50:05.710 --> 01:50:08.290
<v Speaker 9>I mean you can't get your ass whooped for that for 10 rounds.</v>

3998
01:50:08.291 --> 01:50:08.950
<v Speaker 9>It'd be the same.</v>

3999
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:10.390
<v Speaker 9>You just can't think that's just what it is.</v>

4000
01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.260
<v Speaker 9>Yup.</v>

4001
01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:13.330
<v Speaker 9>I think you only have so many rounds in your career.</v>

4002
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:15.630
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't matter whether you do it in one fight.</v>

4003
01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:16.840
<v Speaker 9>If you do five in one fight,</v>

4004
01:50:16.841 --> 01:50:18.970
<v Speaker 9>if you do one here to win this fight,</v>

4005
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:21.970
<v Speaker 9>there's only a certain amount where your body just says shuts it down.</v>

4006
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:23.740
<v Speaker 9>There's a certain amount where your body shuts it down,</v>

4007
01:50:23.741 --> 01:50:25.090
<v Speaker 9>but zero period and time,</v>

4008
01:50:25.091 --> 01:50:27.610
<v Speaker 9>which it starts declining obviously.</v>

4009
01:50:27.850 --> 01:50:31.150
<v Speaker 9>Like do you see it declining and then they still fight for five,</v>

4010
01:50:31.151 --> 01:50:32.120
<v Speaker 9>six more years.</v>

4011
01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:33.113
<v Speaker 9>100% right.</v>

4012
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:35.411
<v Speaker 9>Of course.</v>

4013
01:50:35.411 --> 01:50:35.660
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

4014
01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:37.930
<v Speaker 9>Especially with junior because he's making serious bank.</v>

4015
01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:39.310
<v Speaker 9>Good shit going on right now.</v>

4016
01:50:39.670 --> 01:50:40.240
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4017
01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.073
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4018
01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:44.240
<v Speaker 9>Tr trying to get his guard pass,</v>

4019
01:50:44.241 --> 01:50:45.640
<v Speaker 9>but you just take,</v>

4020
01:50:45.641 --> 01:50:45.771
<v Speaker 9>that's,</v>

4021
01:50:45.771 --> 01:50:47.770
<v Speaker 9>it's just a battle of the guard pass right here.</v>

4022
01:50:49.590 --> 01:50:49.950
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

4023
01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:50.341
<v Speaker 9>Now Eddie,</v>

4024
01:50:50.341 --> 01:50:53.850
<v Speaker 9>when you know all the Goto Shit from half guard that you know,</v>

4025
01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:57.150
<v Speaker 9>when you see dudes just kinda hanging on in these positions,</v>

4026
01:50:57.390 --> 01:50:58.800
<v Speaker 9>when you see guys on the bottom,</v>

4027
01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:03.090
<v Speaker 9>does that frustrate you when you see guys that don't attack or does it like,</v>

4028
01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:05.340
<v Speaker 9>does it like open you up to possibilities?</v>

4029
01:51:05.341 --> 01:51:05.701
<v Speaker 9>Like wait,</v>

4030
01:51:05.701 --> 01:51:07.320
<v Speaker 9>hey my students get in a situation,</v>

4031
01:51:07.321 --> 01:51:08.310
<v Speaker 9>you're gonna see some shit.</v>

4032
01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:09.061
<v Speaker 9>Like how do you,</v>

4033
01:51:09.061 --> 01:51:11.520
<v Speaker 9>like when you look at this and you see like all these,</v>

4034
01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:14.820
<v Speaker 9>like if you look at what you would be doing in this situation,</v>

4035
01:51:14.970 --> 01:51:18.690
<v Speaker 4>I would never have the balls to get it in the cage and do any of this shit</v>

4036
01:51:18.691 --> 01:51:19.030
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

4037
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.220
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

4038
01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:19.620
<v Speaker 9>let me just,</v>

4039
01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:20.600
<v Speaker 9>that's very beautiful.</v>

4040
01:51:20.601 --> 01:51:20.710
<v Speaker 9>I've,</v>

4041
01:51:20.710 --> 01:51:21.110
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

4042
01:51:21.110 --> 01:51:22.040
<v Speaker 9>but I mean when you say,</v>

4043
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:23.600
<v Speaker 9>just from a technical aspect,</v>

4044
01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:27.090
<v Speaker 9>if you see guys on the ground and they're there in,</v>

4045
01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:30.260
<v Speaker 9>in positions in the garden and you see like sloppy guard work,</v>

4046
01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:32.600
<v Speaker 9>does that frustrate you or does it make you think like,</v>

4047
01:51:32.601 --> 01:51:32.871
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

4048
01:51:32.871 --> 01:51:33.141
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

01:51:33.141 --> 01:51:33.381
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>

4050
01:51:33.381 --> 01:51:34.700
<v Speaker 9>this is just great for,</v>

4051
01:51:34.730 --> 01:51:34.971
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4052
01:51:34.971 --> 01:51:35.330
<v Speaker 9>my,</v>

4053
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:37.550
<v Speaker 9>my fighters guys like Ben Saunders that are trained.</v>

4054
01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.050
<v Speaker 9>Oh yeah.</v>

4055
01:51:38.050 --> 01:51:38.320
<v Speaker 9>They go,</v>

4056
01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.890
<v Speaker 9>oh shit and he'll magnet going off.</v>

4057
01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:40.550
<v Speaker 9>Yup.</v>

4058
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.821
<v Speaker 9>He's like,</v>

4059
01:51:40.821 --> 01:51:41.880
<v Speaker 9>I don't like being on the bottom.</v>

4060
01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:43.530
<v Speaker 9>Does that fucking cardio?</v>

4061
01:51:43.610 --> 01:51:44.271
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

4062
01:51:44.271 --> 01:51:44.811
<v Speaker 9>slipped,</v>

4063
01:51:44.811 --> 01:51:45.644
<v Speaker 9>slipped on a knee.</v>

4064
01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:47.930
<v Speaker 9>But still you're their cardio Neil magnate.</v>

4065
01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:48.460
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4066
01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:48.850
<v Speaker 9>Go,</v>

4067
01:51:48.850 --> 01:51:49.110
<v Speaker 9>go,</v>

4068
01:51:49.110 --> 01:51:49.943
<v Speaker 9>go.</v>

4069
01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:53.160
<v Speaker 9>If we just get a main street,</v>

4070
01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:54.020
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

4071
01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:56.660
<v Speaker 4>there's just so much to train when you're,</v>

4072
01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:59.180
<v Speaker 4>when you're fighting MMA and um,</v>

4073
01:51:59.330 --> 01:52:00.290
<v Speaker 4>it's a really,</v>

4074
01:52:00.291 --> 01:52:04.940
<v Speaker 4>really smart thing to do when you first start getting into MMA to get your</v>

4075
01:52:04.941 --> 01:52:05.900
<v Speaker 4>striking together.</v>

4076
01:52:05.901 --> 01:52:09.620
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's the worst possible thing that can happen is you get your fucking,</v>

4077
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:11.780
<v Speaker 4>you get knocked the fuck out.</v>

4078
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:13.520
<v Speaker 4>That's way worse than getting choked out.</v>

4079
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:14.570
<v Speaker 4>Getting,</v>

4080
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:17.030
<v Speaker 4>getting put in a rear naked choke is kind of humiliating.</v>

4081
01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're a striker.</v>

4082
01:52:18.191 --> 01:52:18.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like fuck,</v>

4083
01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:23.120
<v Speaker 4>but nothing's worse than getting shut off and doing the fish.</v>

4084
01:52:23.150 --> 01:52:23.631
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

4085
01:52:23.631 --> 01:52:24.860
<v Speaker 4>that's the worst nightmare.</v>

4086
01:52:24.861 --> 01:52:29.861
<v Speaker 4>So you have to spend so much time on your feet to make sure that shit don't</v>

4087
01:52:31.431 --> 01:52:35.060
<v Speaker 4>happen because these guys are animals that there's not that much time to really</v>

4088
01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:38.450
<v Speaker 4>do get the super technical with your Jujitsu.</v>

4089
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:39.261
<v Speaker 4>They're just,</v>

4090
01:52:39.261 --> 01:52:40.280
<v Speaker 4>there's not that much time.</v>

4091
01:52:40.281 --> 01:52:41.150
<v Speaker 4>So when I see,</v>

4092
01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:42.373
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4093
01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 4>just vanilla Jujitsu or you want to call it from,</v>

4094
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:46.911
<v Speaker 4>from fighters,</v>

4095
01:52:46.911 --> 01:52:47.450
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4096
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:47.730
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4097
01:52:47.730 --> 01:52:48.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4098
01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:49.550
<v Speaker 4>that's what I expect.</v>

4099
01:52:49.551 --> 01:52:51.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like they don't have the time.</v>

4100
01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:52.400
<v Speaker 4>I understand that they're,</v>

4101
01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:55.610
<v Speaker 4>they're spending most of their time with their striking shit.</v>

4102
01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:57.020
<v Speaker 4>If I was,</v>

4103
01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.750
<v Speaker 4>if I had a gun to my head and something someone said I have to do MMA,</v>

4104
01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:04.870
<v Speaker 4>I'd be spending my time striking all day trying to avoid that.</v>

4105
01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:06.320
<v Speaker 4>The worst case scenario,</v>

4106
01:53:06.321 --> 01:53:07.370
<v Speaker 4>just getting shut off,</v>

4107
01:53:07.371 --> 01:53:07.671
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4108
01:53:07.671 --> 01:53:10.220
<v Speaker 4>So there's just some emit so many hours in the day.</v>

4109
01:53:10.221 --> 01:53:11.450
<v Speaker 4>You just can't train everything.</v>

4110
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:12.833
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4111
01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:14.690
<v Speaker 4>Neil magni beaten this.</v>

4112
01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:17.541
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

4113
01:53:17.541 --> 01:53:19.270
<v Speaker 4>I think you broke that left.</v>

4114
01:53:19.650 --> 01:53:20.930
<v Speaker 4>I think he's breaking them in now.</v>

4115
01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:21.290
<v Speaker 4>Tuesday,</v>

4116
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:22.430
<v Speaker 4>getting 20 seconds though.</v>

4117
01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.090
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4118
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:27.890
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you let them get to the round.</v>

4119
01:53:28.710 --> 01:53:29.960
<v Speaker 4>Herb's the best in the business.</v>

4120
01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4121
01:53:33.531 --> 01:53:34.770
<v Speaker 4>I think you might've been able to lie.</v>

4122
01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:37.310
<v Speaker 4>He might've been at the doorway there about 15 seconds ago.</v>

4123
01:53:37.930 --> 01:53:38.940
<v Speaker 4>We would have been a bad call.</v>

4124
01:53:38.941 --> 01:53:39.500
<v Speaker 4>Cause looking at me,</v>

4125
01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:39.621
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4126
01:53:39.621 --> 01:53:42.060
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying if Neil could have landed more shots,</v>

4127
01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.350
<v Speaker 4>that's a tough sport,</v>

4128
01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:45.531
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4129
01:53:45.531 --> 01:53:46.310
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>

4130
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.701
<v Speaker 4>ever,</v>

4131
01:53:46.701 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 4>ever had a dream to do and a man just not like a barbarian.</v>

4132
01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:51.710
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

4133
01:53:51.710 --> 01:53:56.360
<v Speaker 4>I would've done it if my back was against the wall if I had to.</v>

4134
01:53:56.390 --> 01:54:00.080
<v Speaker 4>Luckily I did some things in Jujitsu where I didn't have to fight,</v>

4135
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:01.213
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

4136
01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:04.400
<v Speaker 4>if my back was against the wall and I had to work at a regular job,</v>

4137
01:54:04.401 --> 01:54:06.530
<v Speaker 4>waking up at five 30 in the morning or MMA,</v>

4138
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.573
<v Speaker 4>I would do them in a,</v>

4139
01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:08.900
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't be happy about it.</v>

4140
01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4141
01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:09.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>

4142
01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:10.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>

4143
01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:11.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that guy.</v>

4144
01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:14.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm not that guy like Ben and Brendan,</v>

4145
01:54:14.961 --> 01:54:16.730
<v Speaker 4>you guys are fucking animals,</v>

4146
01:54:16.731 --> 01:54:17.001
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4147
01:54:17.001 --> 01:54:20.750
<v Speaker 4>To fucking want to do it and want the big fights and want to do it in front of</v>

4148
01:54:20.751 --> 01:54:21.584
<v Speaker 4>the whole world.</v>

4149
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:25.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm like 99.9999% of the population.</v>

4150
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:26.960
<v Speaker 4>We don't have the balls.</v>

4151
01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:28.640
<v Speaker 4>There's only a tiny percentage of guys.</v>

4152
01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm not one of those guys.</v>

4153
01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:30.980
<v Speaker 4>I like Jujitsu.</v>

4154
01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:32.990
<v Speaker 4>It's as close as I'll get and uh,</v>

4155
01:54:32.991 --> 01:54:33.950
<v Speaker 4>if I had a gun to my head,</v>

4156
01:54:33.951 --> 01:54:34.221
<v Speaker 4>I would do,</v>

4157
01:54:34.221 --> 01:54:34.611
<v Speaker 4>I'm in my,</v>

4158
01:54:34.611 --> 01:54:35.011
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not,</v>

4159
01:54:35.011 --> 01:54:36.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a barbarian.</v>

4160
01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:37.850
<v Speaker 4>Jitsu is fucking nerve wracking too,</v>

4161
01:54:37.851 --> 01:54:38.121
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4162
01:54:38.121 --> 01:54:42.140
<v Speaker 4>When I did that Metamorris I really didn't think my nerves would get to me like</v>

4163
01:54:42.141 --> 01:54:42.760
<v Speaker 4>a fight,</v>

4164
01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:44.090
<v Speaker 4>like shop,</v>

4165
01:54:44.091 --> 01:54:44.361
<v Speaker 4>you're up.</v>

4166
01:54:44.361 --> 01:54:44.601
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4167
01:54:44.601 --> 01:54:45.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit.</v>

4168
01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:45.981
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4169
01:54:45.981 --> 01:54:47.750
<v Speaker 4>but that's an ego thing really.</v>

4170
01:54:47.751 --> 01:54:51.410
<v Speaker 4>That's just pure MMA is ego and physical.</v>

4171
01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:54.260
<v Speaker 4>It's nonphysical hand physical,</v>

4172
01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.030
<v Speaker 4>all manifested into one.</v>

4173
01:54:56.210 --> 01:54:57.043
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

4174
01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:00.620
<v Speaker 4>That's why the glory is so beautiful when you win that glory when you,</v>

4175
01:55:00.710 --> 01:55:02.540
<v Speaker 4>I've never knocked anybody out in the UFC,</v>

4176
01:55:02.541 --> 01:55:02.940
<v Speaker 4>but I see,</v>

4177
01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:03.591
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

4178
01:55:03.591 --> 01:55:07.500
<v Speaker 4>And I could feel it when chuck little Dell knock someone out and he does that.</v>

4179
01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:12.200
<v Speaker 4>He knows right now the whole world is watching and he's thinking about the after</v>

4180
01:55:12.201 --> 01:55:13.130
<v Speaker 4>party and all that shit.</v>

4181
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:13.620
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

4182
01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:15.790
<v Speaker 4>ah man,</v>

4183
01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:16.633
<v Speaker 4>who's my man?</v>

4184
01:55:21.710 --> 01:55:22.543
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4185
01:55:22.610 --> 01:55:27.610
<v Speaker 4>That's why the glory is so beautiful because we're losing fuels the worst ever.</v>

4186
01:55:27.711 --> 01:55:30.980
<v Speaker 4>So most of that glory is the ultimate.</v>

4187
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:31.260
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4188
01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:32.450
<v Speaker 4>everybody wants that glory,</v>

4189
01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:34.520
<v Speaker 4>but the risk of going the other way.</v>

4190
01:55:34.610 --> 01:55:35.210
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

4191
01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:36.043
<v Speaker 4>too risky.</v>

4192
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:37.280
<v Speaker 4>So most people don't have the balls.</v>

4193
01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.061
<v Speaker 4>You guys are like,</v>

01:55:39.201 --> 01:55:41.690
<v Speaker 4>like we're going to fucking do it and you're happy about it.</v>

4197
01:55:41.691 --> 01:55:44.510
<v Speaker 4>He can't wait to train Ben Saunders fucking,</v>

01:55:45.150 --> 01:55:48.630
<v Speaker 4>she loves every aspect of fighting.</v>

<v Speaker 4>had many conversations with Ben then this is one of the coolest.</v>

4201
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:58.520

<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

4262
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:38.400
<v Speaker 4>I've been backstage and talk to so many fighters in the UFC for so many years</v>

4263
01:57:38.401 --> 01:57:39.091
<v Speaker 4>and King of the case,</v>

4264
01:57:39.091 --> 01:57:43.050
<v Speaker 4>I've been in the business making money for a long time backstage watching their</v>

4265
01:57:43.051 --> 01:57:45.840
<v Speaker 4>lives and the more I worked backstage is the more,</v>

4266
01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:46.201
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

4267
01:57:46.201 --> 01:57:46.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4268
01:57:46.650 --> 01:57:48.630
<v Speaker 4>that's too much pressure for me.</v>

4269

<v Speaker 4>I see what these guys are going through and all these guys go into not only the</v>

4270
01:57:54.211 --> 01:57:57.750
<v Speaker 4>fighters but like the apparel brands and everyone's trying to start their own</v>

<v Speaker 4>they put all their money because we're going to do what MMA is getting big.</v>

4280
01:58:12.091 --> 01:58:15.510
<v Speaker 4>I got a clothing line and you just see them come and go.</v>

4281
01:58:15.511 --> 01:58:19.080
<v Speaker 4>So after a while you see the UFC fighters coming through and like the tough</v>

4282
01:58:19.081 --> 01:58:21.330
<v Speaker 4>fighters and doing it for so many years.</v>

4283
01:58:21.331 --> 01:58:21.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4284
01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:24.750
<v Speaker 4>the odds that you're going to be around in two years or so,</v>

4285
01:58:24.751 --> 01:58:25.584
<v Speaker 4>not good.</v>

4286
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:26.453
<v Speaker 4>They're not good.</v>

4287
01:58:27.090 --> 01:58:27.750
<v Speaker 4>I like talking.</v>

4288
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:28.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4289
01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:28.891
<v Speaker 4>you're loving life.</v>

4290
01:58:28.891 --> 01:58:30.640
<v Speaker 4>I now enjoy that shit when</v>

4291
01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:33.460
<v Speaker 4>people weren't lasting.</v>

4292
01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:33.750
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

4293
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:35.280
<v Speaker 4>you look at the UFC eight years ago,</v>

4294
01:58:35.370 --> 01:58:35.881
<v Speaker 4>you put on it,</v>

4295
01:58:35.881 --> 01:58:36.630
<v Speaker 4>you have to clean.</v>

4296
01:58:36.630 --> 01:58:37.463
<v Speaker 4>These fighters aren't,</v>

4297
01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:40.260
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard.</v>

4298
01:58:40.261 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 4>You know the average is a year and a half.</v>

4299
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.903
<v Speaker 11>Exactly.</v>

4300
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.400
<v Speaker 11>Average career in the NFLs three and a half years when you,</v>

4301
01:58:45.401 --> 01:58:47.230
<v Speaker 11>if you know this right away,</v>

4302
01:58:47.231 --> 01:58:48.550
<v Speaker 11>it's like a scared straight program.</v>

4303
01:58:48.551 --> 01:58:51.430
<v Speaker 11>All of these little kids that want to be a fucking MMA fighters,</v>

4304
01:58:51.490 --> 01:58:54.640
<v Speaker 11>you put them through a scared straight and you have him sit down and fucking,</v>

4305
01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.470
<v Speaker 11>I don't want to say any names,</v>

4306
01:58:56.471 --> 01:58:59.680
<v Speaker 11>but I mean there's guys that are just fucking broken from it.</v>

4307
01:58:59.681 --> 01:59:00.221
<v Speaker 11>You know what I mean?</v>

4308
01:59:00.221 --> 01:59:01.054
<v Speaker 11>You say Joe,</v>

4309
01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:03.243
<v Speaker 11>we're going to say ted.</v>

4310
01:59:03.450 --> 01:59:03.761
<v Speaker 11>I don't know.</v>

4311
01:59:03.761 --> 01:59:07.510
<v Speaker 11>I think that's a life that's a string of the guy going,</v>

4312
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:11.020
<v Speaker 11>I want to make my living as a fighter and I want to be like,</v>

4313
01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:12.310
<v Speaker 11>I'm looking at the lights and I go,</v>

4314
01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:12.551
<v Speaker 11>Ooh,</v>

4315
01:59:12.551 --> 01:59:15.400
<v Speaker 11>I want to be George Saint Pierre or something as opposed to dudes that are real</v>

4316
01:59:15.401 --> 01:59:16.540
<v Speaker 11>mother fuckers that are going,</v>

4317
01:59:16.810 --> 01:59:18.040
<v Speaker 11>I just liked this.</v>

4318
01:59:18.190 --> 01:59:19.120
<v Speaker 11>I like to do this.</v>

4319
01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:20.073
<v Speaker 11>Whether there was money,</v>

4320
01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.780
<v Speaker 11>whether there's money or not.</v>

4321
01:59:21.850 --> 01:59:26.170
<v Speaker 11>My heart needs this expression in this venue and I want to feel that pressure</v>

4322
01:59:26.171 --> 01:59:27.520
<v Speaker 11>and see who I am under that.</v>

4323
01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:29.340
<v Speaker 11>Like that's a whole different kind of time.</v>

4324
01:59:29.341 --> 01:59:29.451
<v Speaker 11>I,</v>

4325
01:59:29.451 --> 01:59:30.284
<v Speaker 11>one guy</v>

4326
01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:34.390
<v Speaker 9>I wanted to ask you was what do you think about all this?</v>

4327
01:59:34.391 --> 01:59:36.790
<v Speaker 9>A class action lawsuit stuff that's going on.</v>

4328
01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:39.760
<v Speaker 9>I couldn't believe that recently.</v>

4329
01:59:39.761 --> 01:59:43.360
<v Speaker 9>I couldn't believe that Mac Danzig and gave Ruediger became a part of it.</v>

4330
01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:46.080
<v Speaker 9>There's a new class action lawsuit goes back me up.</v>

4331
01:59:46.410 --> 01:59:47.800
<v Speaker 9>What's crazy?</v>

4332
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:48.251
<v Speaker 9>What is,</v>

4333
01:59:48.251 --> 01:59:48.880
<v Speaker 9>what is it?</v>

4334
01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:49.691
<v Speaker 9>What does it mean?</v>

4335
01:59:49.691 --> 01:59:50.680
<v Speaker 9>Like what are they doing?</v>

4336
01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:55.780
<v Speaker 9>I'm not understanding what a guy who's like a gay Ruediger like what could it be</v>

4337
01:59:55.781 --> 01:59:56.411
<v Speaker 9>suing for?</v>

4338
01:59:56.411 --> 01:59:56.970
<v Speaker 9>I'm not,</v>

4339
01:59:56.970 --> 01:59:57.230
<v Speaker 9>I've,</v>

4340
01:59:57.230 --> 01:59:57.530
<v Speaker 9>I've,</v>

4341
01:59:57.530 --> 01:59:58.120
<v Speaker 9>I honestly,</v>

4342
01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:00.190
<v Speaker 9>I don't know the details and what they're suing for.</v>

4343
02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:05.040
<v Speaker 9>I just know that they want the fighters to have more of a say and,</v>

4344
02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:06.340
<v Speaker 9>and get paid better.</v>

4345
02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:10.270
<v Speaker 9>That's what the aim of class action lawsuit and concussions and nothing.</v>

4346
02:00:10.650 --> 02:00:11.170
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4347
02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:11.321
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

4348
02:00:11.321 --> 02:00:12.580
<v Speaker 9>but what do they possibly,</v>

4349
02:00:12.581 --> 02:00:13.390
<v Speaker 9>what's the,</v>

4350
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:14.890
<v Speaker 9>what are they saying in the cloud?</v>

4351
02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:15.860
<v Speaker 9>Did you know?</v>

4352
02:00:15.861 --> 02:00:16.440
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>

4353
02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:18.220
<v Speaker 9>I like coming up to you several times.</v>

4354
02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:19.153
<v Speaker 9>Damn.</v>

4355
02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:21.100
<v Speaker 9>Not touching it.</v>

4356
02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:22.120
<v Speaker 9>Just for the record of course.</v>

4357
02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:26.290
<v Speaker 9>Well I feel like a very good living messing with the UFC.</v>

4358
02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:29.980
<v Speaker 9>I feel like it's a bunch of people that are like,</v>

4359
02:00:29.981 --> 02:00:32.020
<v Speaker 9>especially lawyers that are getting involved in this,</v>

4360
02:00:32.021 --> 02:00:33.790
<v Speaker 9>they recognize that there's blood in the water.</v>

4361
02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:35.290
<v Speaker 9>There was a guy that called me,</v>

4362
02:00:36.930 --> 02:00:37.571
<v Speaker 9>called me and goes,</v>

4363
02:00:37.571 --> 02:00:39.130
<v Speaker 9>do you know anybody that wants to get involved in this?</v>

4364
02:00:39.131 --> 02:00:41.350
<v Speaker 9>And he's just some random lawyer from fucking Texas.</v>

4365
02:00:41.351 --> 02:00:42.850
<v Speaker 9>That was like two weeks ago.</v>

4366
02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.160
<v Speaker 9>Do you think grosser and Grosser,</v>

4367
02:00:45.190 --> 02:00:48.790
<v Speaker 9>do you think a guy like Gabe Ruediger or a guy like Mac Dansik who had Mac had</v>

4368
02:00:48.791 --> 02:00:49.330
<v Speaker 9>already,</v>

4369
02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:50.320
<v Speaker 9>even when I got a good career,</v>

4370
02:00:50.321 --> 02:00:52.090
<v Speaker 9>won the ultimate fighter and you know,</v>

4371
02:00:52.091 --> 02:00:56.350
<v Speaker 9>had decided he wasn't taking shots well anymore and it brought a very eloquent</v>

4372
02:00:56.351 --> 02:00:58.450
<v Speaker 9>piece about it and I respect Mac a lot.</v>

4373
02:00:58.480 --> 02:00:59.410
<v Speaker 9>He's a very smart,</v>

4374
02:00:59.411 --> 02:01:00.060
<v Speaker 9>great dude.</v>

4375
02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:01.660
<v Speaker 9>When I see him that he's in it,</v>

4376
02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:02.051
<v Speaker 9>I go,</v>

4377
02:01:02.051 --> 02:01:02.261
<v Speaker 9>wow,</v>

4378
02:01:02.261 --> 02:01:02.770
<v Speaker 9>this is,</v>

4379
02:01:02.770 --> 02:01:03.910
<v Speaker 9>I wonder what this is.</v>

4380
02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:05.200
<v Speaker 9>And I wonder like,</v>

4381
02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:07.510
<v Speaker 9>I mean total speculation I would have to ask,</v>

4382
02:01:07.511 --> 02:01:09.730
<v Speaker 9>but if some guys are like,</v>

4383
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:10.001
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4384
02:01:10.001 --> 02:01:10.151
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

4385
02:01:10.151 --> 02:01:11.290
<v Speaker 9>this is the end of my career.</v>

4386
02:01:11.291 --> 02:01:14.050
<v Speaker 9>I'm not fighting anymore so I don't have to worry about pissing them off.</v>

4387
02:01:14.210 --> 02:01:15.790
<v Speaker 9>I don't want them to hire me again.</v>

4388
02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:16.750
<v Speaker 9>That's what do you think?</v>

4389
02:01:16.751 --> 02:01:17.800
<v Speaker 9>You can get me some money,</v>

4390
02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:19.113
<v Speaker 9>let's do it.</v>

4391
02:01:19.630 --> 02:01:20.463
<v Speaker 9>I think it's company,</v>

4392
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:24.940
<v Speaker 9>he's combination is some dudes being like the sport needs to change and it does.</v>

4393
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.870
<v Speaker 9>Dana knows this.</v>

4394
02:01:25.871 --> 02:01:27.040
<v Speaker 9>Everyone in this room knows this.</v>

4395
02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:28.420
<v Speaker 9>Certain things have to change.</v>

4396
02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:30.250
<v Speaker 9>If the fighters had a union,</v>

4397
02:01:30.251 --> 02:01:31.540
<v Speaker 9>there's no reason we shouldn't.</v>

4398
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:33.150
<v Speaker 9>There's no reason we shouldn't.</v>

4399
02:01:33.190 --> 02:01:34.870
<v Speaker 9>The UV under major leagues do.</v>

4400
02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:35.200
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4401
02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:37.090
<v Speaker 9>The unions that exist in other sports,</v>

4402
02:01:37.091 --> 02:01:39.470
<v Speaker 9>they benefit the players for sure.</v>

4403
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:40.580
<v Speaker 9>But it,</v>

4404
02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:42.040
<v Speaker 9>I think the,</v>

4405
02:01:42.041 --> 02:01:45.240
<v Speaker 9>the difference being that there's a bunch of different teams like say if Seattle</v>

4406
02:01:45.241 --> 02:01:47.210
<v Speaker 9>doesn't want you anymore and then Boston wants you,</v>

4407
02:01:47.211 --> 02:01:48.390
<v Speaker 9>there's like New England wants you,</v>

4408
02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:52.220
<v Speaker 9>you can travel around and be a part of different teams and that's where most of</v>

4409
02:01:52.221 --> 02:01:53.450
<v Speaker 9>the negotiation takes place.</v>

4410
02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:54.650
<v Speaker 9>With the UFC.</v>

4411
02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:57.270
<v Speaker 9>The issue that people have is that there's a new,</v>

4412
02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:57.381
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4413
02:01:57.381 --> 02:01:58.041
<v Speaker 9>UFC,</v>

4414
02:01:58.041 --> 02:01:58.910
<v Speaker 9>there's no teams.</v>

4415
02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:01.910
<v Speaker 9>It's just like everybody's playing for the same team because one fucking team</v>

4416
02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:02.930
<v Speaker 9>that team's the UFC,</v>

4417
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:07.040
<v Speaker 9>it's not the NFL because the NFL comprised is comprised of a bunch of different</v>

4418
02:02:07.041 --> 02:02:07.760
<v Speaker 9>businesses.</v>

4419
02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.650
<v Speaker 9>People own the Seattle Seahawks,</v>

4420
02:02:09.651 --> 02:02:11.360
<v Speaker 9>they own the Miami Dolphins,</v>

4421
02:02:11.361 --> 02:02:12.560
<v Speaker 9>they owned the Raiders,</v>

4422
02:02:12.561 --> 02:02:14.030
<v Speaker 9>but they're all under one branch.</v>

4423
02:02:14.150 --> 02:02:18.260
<v Speaker 9>You can do the NFL umbrella and they're all under the NFL and umbrella.</v>

4424
02:02:18.261 --> 02:02:20.630
<v Speaker 9>And part of this union is when,</v>

4425
02:02:20.631 --> 02:02:20.990
<v Speaker 9>when,</v>

4426
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:23.060
<v Speaker 9>so these just for then fl,</v>

4427
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:26.690
<v Speaker 9>these NFL players are destroying their bodies,</v>

4428
02:02:26.691 --> 02:02:29.330
<v Speaker 9>destroying the brains for whatever the average Chris,</v>

4429
02:02:29.331 --> 02:02:30.164
<v Speaker 9>three and a half years.</v>

4430
02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:32.450
<v Speaker 9>So they're saying for those three and a half years,</v>

4431
02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:33.710
<v Speaker 9>what we've given you,</v>

4432
02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:35.720
<v Speaker 9>we should be compensated for down the road,</v>

4433
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:36.710
<v Speaker 9>which is 100%.</v>

4434
02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:37.101
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

4435
02:02:37.101 --> 02:02:37.491
<v Speaker 9>there's,</v>

4436
02:02:37.491 --> 02:02:39.320
<v Speaker 9>there's without a doubt there's some merit in that.</v>

4437
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:40.730
<v Speaker 9>There's definitely some merit if,</v>

4438
02:02:40.731 --> 02:02:41.060
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4439
02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:42.770
<v Speaker 9>if they were ignorant to the facts,</v>

4440
02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:44.390
<v Speaker 9>but now the facts had been exposed,</v>

4441
02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:44.661
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4442
02:02:44.661 --> 02:02:48.580
<v Speaker 9>which is the claim about concussions and NFL and him.</v>

4443
02:02:48.581 --> 02:02:49.220
<v Speaker 9>And I mean,</v>

4444
02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:51.470
<v Speaker 9>I think this goes with box saying it goes to the MMA,</v>

4445
02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:52.493
<v Speaker 9>it goes to everything.</v>

4446
02:02:52.670 --> 02:02:53.300
<v Speaker 9>Once you,</v>

4447
02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:56.570
<v Speaker 9>once it's all out in a table and like the medical facts and everything were in</v>

4448
02:02:56.571 --> 02:02:57.610
<v Speaker 9>order like you,</v>

4449
02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:58.730
<v Speaker 9>you've got to say,</v>

4450
02:02:58.760 --> 02:02:59.480
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

4451
02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:01.430
<v Speaker 9>you didn't know and they didn't know.</v>

4452
02:03:01.431 --> 02:03:02.600
<v Speaker 9>But now you do know.</v>

4453
02:03:02.630 --> 02:03:03.021
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>

4454
02:03:03.021 --> 02:03:06.860
<v Speaker 9>so now if you do know you have a certain amount of responsibility to take care</v>

4455
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:08.780
<v Speaker 9>of the people that are under our protection.</v>

4456
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:12.260
<v Speaker 9>So what does it entail to have CTE?</v>

4457
02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:15.920
<v Speaker 9>What are the issues that these athletes can possibly be dealing with?</v>

4458
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:19.430
<v Speaker 9>So you've got to mitigate whatever the issues that come along with those,</v>

4459
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:20.750
<v Speaker 9>those athletes being,</v>

4460
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:21.200
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4461
02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:22.490
<v Speaker 9>concussed on a regular basis.</v>

4462
02:03:22.491 --> 02:03:23.390
<v Speaker 9>You've got to mitigate that.</v>

4463
02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:25.160
<v Speaker 9>You've got to mitigate it by management.</v>

4464
02:03:25.330 --> 02:03:27.470
<v Speaker 9>You've got to mitigate it by counseling,</v>

4465
02:03:27.471 --> 02:03:28.370
<v Speaker 9>whether it's a,</v>

4466
02:03:28.371 --> 02:03:28.701
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4467
02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:30.560
<v Speaker 9>having someone who's a sports psychologist,</v>

4468
02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.360
<v Speaker 9>having someone who's a neurosurgeon or a neuroscientist rather,</v>

4469
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:36.050
<v Speaker 9>that can give them examinations,</v>

4470
02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:37.280
<v Speaker 9>cat scans,</v>

4471
02:03:37.281 --> 02:03:38.114
<v Speaker 9>all that jazz.</v>

4472
02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:41.390
<v Speaker 9>They should check you out on a regular basis and that's great.</v>

4473
02:03:41.690 --> 02:03:45.620
<v Speaker 9>But those guys should also be compensated down the road for risk in their life</v>

4474
02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:47.000
<v Speaker 9>being entertainers.</v>

4475
02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:47.721
<v Speaker 9>Certainly.</v>

4476
02:03:47.721 --> 02:03:48.800
<v Speaker 9>How about how we'll serve</v>

4477
02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.680
<v Speaker 9>peanuts for the rest of my life.</v>

4478
02:03:51.681 --> 02:03:52.550
<v Speaker 9>Peanuts up.</v>

4479
02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:55.640
<v Speaker 9>Then you start all that though.</v>

4480
02:03:55.641 --> 02:03:56.510
<v Speaker 9>But like what about,</v>

4481
02:03:56.511 --> 02:03:57.170
<v Speaker 9>what about that?</v>

4482
02:03:57.170 --> 02:03:58.680
<v Speaker 9>Any kid that goes into a,</v>

4483
02:03:58.681 --> 02:04:01.880
<v Speaker 9>into a football like you're playing,</v>

4484
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:04.290
<v Speaker 9>you're playing football throughout,</v>

4485
02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.233
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4486
02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.380
<v Speaker 9>throughout junior high school and high school are those parents are subject to</v>

4487
02:04:09.381 --> 02:04:12.410
<v Speaker 9>child abuse then cause you're putting your kid in a position where they're</v>

4488
02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:13.260
<v Speaker 9>hitting can cost study.</v>

4489
02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:15.350
<v Speaker 9>I think you got a good point,</v>

4490
02:04:15.351 --> 02:04:15.561
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

4491
02:04:15.561 --> 02:04:16.640
<v Speaker 9>I think that's a real good point.</v>

4492
02:04:16.770 --> 02:04:20.150
<v Speaker 9>[inaudible] kids aren't dedicated their lives to football.</v>

4493
02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:22.880
<v Speaker 9>They are not really.</v>

4494
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:23.900
<v Speaker 9>Some of them are men.</v>

4495
02:04:23.901 --> 02:04:24.800
<v Speaker 9>Some of them are.</v>

4496
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:25.730
<v Speaker 9>Some of them are.</v>

4497

4498
02:04:26.211 --> 02:04:26.450

4501
02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:30.980
<v Speaker 9>Their parents realize it.</v>

4502

<v Speaker 9>You've got a big kid like say Brennan Shop.</v>

02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's a small fine.</v>

4592
02:06:44.490 --> 02:06:46.320
<v Speaker 1>He only fights once every two years anyway.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well it's not big deal.</v>

4594
02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's no big deal.</v>

4595
02:06:48.841 --> 02:06:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think it's stupid.</v>

4596
02:06:49.831 --> 02:06:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Unless he's fighting,</v>

4597
02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:52.403
<v Speaker 1>it's his third.</v>

4598
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid law.</v>

4599
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Unless he's fine.</v>

4600
02:06:56.250 --> 02:06:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4601
02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4602
02:06:56.780 --> 02:06:59.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm my concern always with,</v>

4603
02:06:59.241 --> 02:06:59.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4604
02:06:59.530 --> 02:07:00.720
<v Speaker 1>with these kinds of things.</v>

4605
02:07:00.721 --> 02:07:02.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like what are they doing that's helping them fight?</v>

4606
02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:03.600
<v Speaker 1>It could,</v>

4607
02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:07.770
<v Speaker 1>could there be an argument that the smoking weed helps his Jujitsu and that it</v>

4608
02:07:07.771 --> 02:07:09.930
<v Speaker 1>helps us training and helps us cardio when he trains.</v>

4609
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4610
02:07:10.201 --> 02:07:11.034
<v Speaker 1>There can be an argument.</v>

4611
02:07:11.050 --> 02:07:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday is,</v>

4612
02:07:11.770 --> 02:07:16.770
<v Speaker 1>there was a recent argument about a ultra marathoners ultra marathoners were</v>

4613
02:07:17.250 --> 02:07:19.260
<v Speaker 1>there were just talk about how they're able to,</v>

4614
02:07:19.261 --> 02:07:19.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4615
02:07:19.650 --> 02:07:22.770
<v Speaker 1>they run ultra marathons way easier when they get high.</v>

4616
02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:22.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4617
02:07:22.831 --> 02:07:24.060
<v Speaker 1>They run in a straight line.</v>

4618
02:07:24.090 --> 02:07:24.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4619
02:07:24.451 --> 02:07:26.010
<v Speaker 1>these guys are running over hills.</v>

4620
02:07:26.011 --> 02:07:28.140
<v Speaker 1>They do have other still running straight but go that way.</v>

4621
02:07:28.230 --> 02:07:28.741
<v Speaker 1>But it is,</v>

4622
02:07:28.741 --> 02:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

4623
02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4624
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:30.510
<v Speaker 1>it's hard man.</v>

4625
02:07:30.690 --> 02:07:31.120
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

4626
02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:32.510
<v Speaker 1>what's happening with the,</v>

4627
02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:37.600
<v Speaker 1>the marijuana is it reduces inflammation and it allows you to numb the pain.</v>

4628
02:07:37.871 --> 02:07:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not thinking about it.</v>

4629
02:07:39.190 --> 02:07:42.070
<v Speaker 1>You Ain't going to fuck your ceiling yet knocked out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4636
02:07:43.930 --> 02:07:44.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4637
02:07:44.141 --> 02:07:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't say it's my stops performance enhancing it is for Jujitsu.</v>

4638
02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Unless again,</v>

4639
02:07:49.570 --> 02:07:50.590
<v Speaker 1>unless it's bullshit,</v>

4640
02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:55.690
<v Speaker 1>it has been written that marijuana actually opens lung passageways actually</v>

4641
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:56.590
<v Speaker 1>opens your lungs.</v>

4642
02:07:56.650 --> 02:07:57.170
<v Speaker 1>What are you standing?</v>

4643
02:07:57.170 --> 02:07:57.561
<v Speaker 1>How fast?</v>

4644
02:07:57.561 --> 02:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>But Jamie,</v>

4645
02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:59.320
<v Speaker 1>but that's what they're saying.</v>

4646
02:07:59.530 --> 02:08:00.880
<v Speaker 1>They're saying that that's what happens.</v>

4647
02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

4648
02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:03.910
<v Speaker 1>What basketball performance enhancing.</v>

4649
02:08:04.290 --> 02:08:05.230
<v Speaker 1>They test for it.</v>

4650
02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:07.060
<v Speaker 1>They don't test for it,</v>

4651
02:08:07.090 --> 02:08:09.310
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's almost enhancing when people do it.</v>

4652
02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4653
02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:15.040
<v Speaker 1>no it does makes it fit.</v>

4654
02:08:15.041 --> 02:08:15.281
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4655
02:08:15.281 --> 02:08:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what it works with,</v>

4656
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:17.831
<v Speaker 1>but that whole thing,</v>

4657
02:08:17.831 --> 02:08:18.311
<v Speaker 1>that time,</v>

4658
02:08:18.311 --> 02:08:19.144
<v Speaker 1>dilation,</v>

4659
02:08:19.190 --> 02:08:20.280
<v Speaker 1>real concentration,</v>

4660
02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:22.450
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff about being into the zone.</v>

4661
02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:27.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of studies that you guys can't talk over each other.</v>

4662
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:30.640
<v Speaker 1>There's this book called the rise of Superman that they went into all these</v>

4663
02:08:30.641 --> 02:08:31.630
<v Speaker 1>studies about the zone,</v>

4664
02:08:31.631 --> 02:08:35.650
<v Speaker 1>about being in that flow and about time dilation and we'd like cannabis does</v>

4665
02:08:35.651 --> 02:08:36.520
<v Speaker 1>that for people.</v>

4666
02:08:36.650 --> 02:08:38.500
<v Speaker 1>It gets you into that state quicker.</v>

4667
02:08:38.501 --> 02:08:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Where do you become a heightened more alert animal?</v>

4668
02:08:41.770 --> 02:08:42.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4669
02:08:42.101 --> 02:08:43.150
<v Speaker 1>it can for some people,</v>

4670
02:08:43.151 --> 02:08:44.350
<v Speaker 1>like Nick Diaz loves it,</v>

4671
02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:46.550
<v Speaker 1>so I bet if you let nick Diaz smoke weed,</v>

4672
02:08:46.551 --> 02:08:47.800
<v Speaker 1>he probably fight better on weight,</v>

4673
02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:48.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4674
02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:50.290
<v Speaker 1>and it helps your cardio,</v>

4675
02:08:50.291 --> 02:08:50.531
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4676
02:08:50.531 --> 02:08:51.191
<v Speaker 1>It just does.</v>

4677
02:08:51.191 --> 02:08:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't want to admit that,</v>

4678
02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:55.240
<v Speaker 1>but marathon waters report that the report,</v>

4679
02:08:55.241 --> 02:08:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it makes it easier for them to go hard longer.</v>

4680
02:08:57.940 --> 02:08:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4681
02:08:58.700 --> 02:08:59.170
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

4682
02:08:59.170 --> 02:09:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it does all this shit.</v>

4683
02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

4684
02:09:01.931 --> 02:09:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva was on some anabolic,</v>

4685
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:06.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4686
02:09:06.070 --> 02:09:06.903
<v Speaker 1>That's illegal.</v>

4687
02:09:06.970 --> 02:09:10.140
<v Speaker 1>We know for a fact that helps for that.</v>

4688
02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Now there's no argument there.</v>

4689
02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:12.400
<v Speaker 1>There's no argument there.</v>

4690
02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:13.450
<v Speaker 1>The real question is,</v>

4691
02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:16.120
<v Speaker 1>is it helping nick during his training?</v>

4692
02:09:16.330 --> 02:09:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Like is it a performance enhancer?</v>

4693
02:09:17.891 --> 02:09:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Does it allow him to train and a better way in some,</v>

4694
02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.270
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

4695
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:23.231
<v Speaker 1>Guess what though?</v>

4696
02:09:23.231 --> 02:09:23.730

4700
02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:31.410
<v Speaker 1>So does creotine oil.</v>

4701
02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a lot of shit that bothers me.</v>

4702
02:09:34.070 --> 02:09:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Make wheat elite.</v>

4706
02:09:38.530 --> 02:09:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I got a question for you,</v>

4707
02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

4708
02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:41.463
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

4709
02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:45.250
<v Speaker 1>If they decided to just legalize steroids,</v>

4710
02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:46.180
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

4711
02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:47.013
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>

4712
02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:49.060
<v Speaker 1>would we see fighters,</v>

4713
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4714
02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:52.490
<v Speaker 1>jumping up in weight or staying right on the father?</v>

4715
02:09:52.490 --> 02:09:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Act like fucking Alster Overeem is serious cells in 12 right now.</v>

4716
02:09:56.951 --> 02:09:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Seriously fucking legal.</v>

4717
02:09:59.711 --> 02:10:00.544
<v Speaker 1>You would</v>

4718
02:10:02.250 --> 02:10:03.520
<v Speaker 1>probably get bigger.</v>

4719
02:10:03.850 --> 02:10:04.683
<v Speaker 1>You'd want to get bigger?</v>

4720
02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:05.441
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4721
02:10:05.441 --> 02:10:05.831
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4722
02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:06.410
<v Speaker 1>What other,</v>

4723
02:10:06.410 --> 02:10:07.061
<v Speaker 1>what'd you get bigger?</v>

4724
02:10:07.061 --> 02:10:07.601
<v Speaker 1>If it was legal,</v>

4725
02:10:07.601 --> 02:10:08.434
<v Speaker 1>would you use it?</v>

4726
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4727
02:10:09.790 --> 02:10:13.750
<v Speaker 1>They said we're going to legalize it because he could go away at that point I'd</v>

4728
02:10:13.751 --> 02:10:14.740
<v Speaker 1>say show me the money.</v>

4729
02:10:15.130 --> 02:10:15.401
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4730
02:10:15.401 --> 02:10:16.221
<v Speaker 1>If I've got to go up,</v>

4731
02:10:16.221 --> 02:10:17.500
<v Speaker 1>they get the money and it's legal.</v>

4732
02:10:17.650 --> 02:10:18.191
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4733
02:10:18.191 --> 02:10:20.620
<v Speaker 1>So most people would just stay the same,</v>

4734
02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:21.603
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4735
02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:21.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4736
02:10:21.791 --> 02:10:22.960
<v Speaker 1>But you're talking to heavyweight.</v>

4737
02:10:22.961 --> 02:10:27.961
<v Speaker 1>I would look like then step up on that micro quince for you though,</v>

4738
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:31.420
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't really be effective to add more muscle mass.</v>

4739
02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:34.730
<v Speaker 1>You're optimized physically for frame at one seven eight do you agree?</v>

4740
02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:35.930
<v Speaker 1>I would say so.</v>

4741
02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:40.520
<v Speaker 1>So if you were going to go to one 85 like a few like say you want to do it,</v>

4742
02:10:40.521 --> 02:10:41.570
<v Speaker 1>but if you wanted to do it,</v>

4743
02:10:41.571 --> 02:10:44.780
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at it like super objectively with no desperation at all,</v>

4744
02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:45.141
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

4745
02:10:45.141 --> 02:10:46.160
<v Speaker 1>what's the most,</v>

4746
02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:49.610
<v Speaker 1>what's the most intelligent way to plan that out?</v>

4747
02:10:49.730 --> 02:10:53.840
<v Speaker 1>How long do you think you would take to put on that kind of mass and keep and be</v>

4748
02:10:53.841 --> 02:10:55.570
<v Speaker 1>comfortable to go to heavyweight?</v>

4749
02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4750
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4751
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:56.110
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4752
02:10:56.110 --> 02:10:56.741
<v Speaker 1>One 85.</v>

4753
02:10:56.741 --> 02:10:56.990
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4754
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:59.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go to one 85 and you really decided I'm going to be a</v>

4755
02:10:59.901 --> 02:11:02.990
<v Speaker 1>middleweight fighter now I'm going to abandon this idea of cutting weight and</v>

4756
02:11:02.991 --> 02:11:06.410
<v Speaker 1>staying lean and restricting my calories and dehydrated myself.</v>

4757
02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:08.000
<v Speaker 1>How big would you want to get?</v>

4758
02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:09.393
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

4759
02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:13.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'd roughly just tried to do the same thing I'm doing for one 70.</v>

4760
02:11:13.811 --> 02:11:17.290
<v Speaker 5>Just obviously we're dealing with 15 pounds heavier,</v>

4761
02:11:17.590 --> 02:11:17.831
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

4762
02:11:17.831 --> 02:11:18.591
<v Speaker 1>but what would you do,</v>

4763
02:11:18.591 --> 02:11:18.731
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

4764
02:11:18.731 --> 02:11:20.170
<v Speaker 1>would you give yourself a year?</v>

4765
02:11:20.171 --> 02:11:20.531
<v Speaker 1>Like two,</v>

4766
02:11:20.531 --> 02:11:21.130
<v Speaker 1>like if someone,</v>

4767
02:11:21.130 --> 02:11:21.963
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4768
02:11:22.450 --> 02:11:23.640
<v Speaker 5>how much time can I start?</v>

4769
02:11:23.641 --> 02:11:25.240
<v Speaker 5>I my first four fights where,</v>

4770
02:11:25.241 --> 02:11:27.130
<v Speaker 5>what w one 81 85.</v>

4771
02:11:27.131 --> 02:11:30.130
<v Speaker 5>But I was stepping on the scale with my jeans,</v>

4772
02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:31.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4773
02:11:31.570 --> 02:11:32.403
<v Speaker 5>Like lower level.</v>

4774
02:11:34.170 --> 02:11:34.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4775
02:11:34.450 --> 02:11:37.230
<v Speaker 5>like four fights you're saying if I was in the UFC and items like that,</v>

4776
02:11:38.530 --> 02:11:39.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4777
02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:39.521
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

4778
02:11:39.521 --> 02:11:42.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the science behind my body type and how long it would take me to</v>

4779
02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:44.230
<v Speaker 5>produce that much,</v>

4780
02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:45.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4781
02:11:45.310 --> 02:11:46.143
<v Speaker 5>additional muscles.</v>

4782
02:11:46.210 --> 02:11:47.860
<v Speaker 1>But it's something that you would have to really consider,</v>

4783
02:11:47.861 --> 02:11:48.694
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4784
02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:49.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4785
02:11:49.631 --> 02:11:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was going up to one 85 I don't know if I was going up,</v>

4786
02:11:53.410 --> 02:11:54.550
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't even do it.</v>

4787
02:11:54.890 --> 02:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4788
02:11:55.150 --> 02:11:55.361
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4789
02:11:55.361 --> 02:11:55.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4790
02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:56.353
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4791
02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:57.161
<v Speaker 1>The same.</v>

4792
02:11:57.161 --> 02:11:57.994
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4793
02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:58.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4794
02:11:58.151 --> 02:12:02.980
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I was asking was one reason is because Henderson's tonight just</v>

4795
02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>fought at one 55 like a month ago,</v>

4796
02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:10.860
<v Speaker 1>and now he's stepping in here tonight and he's fighting fache who is a giant</v>

4797
02:12:10.901 --> 02:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>fucking welterweight,</v>

4798
02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:12.540
<v Speaker 1>walked around that.</v>

4799
02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:12.881
<v Speaker 1>He'll be,</v>

4800
02:12:12.881 --> 02:12:14.320
<v Speaker 1>he'll be one 90 in the cage.</v>

4801
02:12:14.350 --> 02:12:15.190
<v Speaker 1>He's a big boy.</v>

4802
02:12:15.390 --> 02:12:20.390
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] he's long lean and he's super aggressive.</v>

4803
02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:21.273
<v Speaker 1>Great strikers.</v>

4804
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:24.163
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4805
02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:28.540
<v Speaker 1>one 70 that's what he was when he was cutting a 55 but since then,</v>

4806
02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I bet he probably can't.</v>

4807
02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:30.640
<v Speaker 1>It's only a month ago.</v>

4808
02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I bet against gain five pounds.</v>

4809
02:12:32.801 --> 02:12:33.611
<v Speaker 1>So maybe he's like,</v>

4810
02:12:33.611 --> 02:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4811
02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:34.571
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

4812
02:12:34.571 --> 02:12:34.780
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4813
02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:37.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be better at one 70 where he's not dehydrated them.</v>

4814
02:12:37.661 --> 02:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you'd be like a rumble Johnson types of Jewish don't don't you think</v>

4815
02:12:40.931 --> 02:12:45.931
<v Speaker 1>like steroids and p Dee's benefit really wanting 85 and above because those</v>

4816
02:12:46.511 --> 02:12:49.050
<v Speaker 1>bladder guys really then maybe they're using EPO,</v>

4817
02:12:49.090 --> 02:12:49.750
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

4818
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:52.510
<v Speaker 1>but they're really not going to use the antibiotics cause they can't put on them</v>

4819
02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:56.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe more prevalent at the higher weight class.</v>

4820
02:12:56.940 --> 02:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>It would help for recovery during training,</v>

4821
02:12:59.550 --> 02:13:04.550
<v Speaker 1>but they got to cut weight for a little bit for recovery growth and a little</v>

4822
02:13:05.171 --> 02:13:08.920
<v Speaker 1>test all the time to stay recovered and do two a days all the way through and</v>

4823
02:13:08.921 --> 02:13:11.800
<v Speaker 1>not suffer overtraining as much and then get clean.</v>

4824
02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:13.500
<v Speaker 1>You ain't going to get in that much like that.</v>

4825
02:13:13.501 --> 02:13:14.500
<v Speaker 1>That Belko dude man,</v>

4826
02:13:14.501 --> 02:13:15.670
<v Speaker 1>he was interesting as fuck.</v>

4827
02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4828
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:17.740
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating guy.</v>

4829
02:13:17.741 --> 02:13:18.491
<v Speaker 1>And you know what man,</v>

4830
02:13:18.491 --> 02:13:22.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he's been saying over and over again is that these testing</v>

4831
02:13:22.001 --> 02:13:25.480
<v Speaker 1>techniques are ineffective and that these urine tests are given.</v>

4832
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Fighters are just,</v>

4833
02:13:26.610 --> 02:13:26.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4834
02:13:26.911 --> 02:13:28.450
<v Speaker 1>and everybody was calling bullshit on him.</v>

4835
02:13:28.630 --> 02:13:29.530
<v Speaker 1>He was saying they were just,</v>

4836
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:31.420
<v Speaker 1>these are just intelligent test.</v>

4837
02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4838
02:13:31.730 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4839
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:32.791
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>

4840
02:13:32.791 --> 02:13:33.820
<v Speaker 3>What's Bunko cat's name?</v>

4841
02:13:33.821 --> 02:13:34.654
<v Speaker 3>Victor contents.</v>

4842
02:13:35.070 --> 02:13:36.320
<v Speaker 3>But I had them on the podcast,</v>

4843
02:13:36.321 --> 02:13:37.154
<v Speaker 3>the interesting cat,</v>

4844
02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:41.220
<v Speaker 3>but after it's all over Maine now he looks vindicated in my opinion.</v>

4845
02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:41.701
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4889
02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to be able to do what he does,</v>

4906
02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:10.860
<v Speaker 3>I believe leg locks are going to come back in a big way in MMA.</v>

4907
02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh sweet.</v>

4917
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he should punch right and I think she would defend the leg lock</v>

4918
02:16:27.031 --> 02:16:30.310
<v Speaker 3>can get out of the cute guys usually get tapped out when they go to punch strike</v>

5062
02:20:55.930 --> 02:20:57.380
<v Speaker 10>a horrible spot.</v>

5063
02:20:57.440 --> 02:20:59.630
<v Speaker 10>They'll stop it way better than what I imagine.</v>

5064
02:20:59.631 --> 02:21:00.470
<v Speaker 10>That's a big cut,</v>

02:21:00.471 --> 02:21:01.304
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

5066
02:21:02.010 --> 02:21:02.843
<v Speaker 10>It's not that big.</v>

5067
02:21:02.850 --> 02:21:03.120
<v Speaker 10>It's the,</v>

5068
02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:04.580
<v Speaker 10>I look at the top of the eyebrow.</v>

5069
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:07.790
<v Speaker 10>I'm looking at the blood coming down the corner and I was assuming that that</v>

5070
02:21:07.791 --> 02:21:08.460
<v Speaker 10>whole thing was kind.</v>

5071
02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:11.110
<v Speaker 10>I don't think that was my first referee.</v>

5072
02:21:11.890 --> 02:21:13.610
<v Speaker 10>The referee said they keep going,</v>

5073
02:21:13.611 --> 02:21:13.970
<v Speaker 10>but he's,</v>

5074
02:21:13.970 --> 02:21:14.390
<v Speaker 10>he said,</v>

5075
02:21:14.390 --> 02:21:15.650
<v Speaker 10>you got to clean my eye,</v>

5076
02:21:16.060 --> 02:21:17.480
<v Speaker 10>so what's it going in my eyes?</v>

5077
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.790
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

5078
02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:20.940
<v Speaker 10>Did they bring somebody around waving it off to me he was,</v>

5079
02:21:21.770 --> 02:21:21.920
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

5080
02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:22.360
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

5081
02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:22.670
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

5082
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:23.420
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

5083
02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:24.710
<v Speaker 10>but he's not going to clean it off.</v>

5084
02:21:24.711 --> 02:21:25.670
<v Speaker 10>I don't understand that.</v>

5085
02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:28.580
<v Speaker 10>Then what did they do?</v>

5086
02:21:28.581 --> 02:21:29.151
<v Speaker 10>Did they don't,</v>

5087
02:21:29.151 --> 02:21:30.200
<v Speaker 10>they usually cleaned it off.</v>

5088
02:21:30.201 --> 02:21:32.600
<v Speaker 10>If there's a headbutt like a cut like that,</v>

5089
02:21:32.601 --> 02:21:33.470
<v Speaker 10>they have to look at it.</v>

5090
02:21:33.471 --> 02:21:35.510
<v Speaker 10>Doctor come in or someone come in and look at it.</v>

5091
02:21:35.511 --> 02:21:36.560
<v Speaker 10>Yet they usually,</v>

5092
02:21:36.650 --> 02:21:37.910
<v Speaker 10>that's where I would think they would do.</v>

5093
02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:40.750
<v Speaker 10>It's only if the fighter can't see those don't affect him,</v>

5094
02:21:40.751 --> 02:21:41.331
<v Speaker 10>his eyesight,</v>

5095
02:21:41.331 --> 02:21:42.360
<v Speaker 10>but it is right now.</v>

5096
02:21:42.361 --> 02:21:42.560
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>

5097
02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:43.400
<v Speaker 10>it's affecting his eyes.</v>

5098
02:21:43.401 --> 02:21:44.900
<v Speaker 10>Said he's trying to wipe it out of his eye,</v>

5099
02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:46.280
<v Speaker 10>but only if it's in the eye.</v>

5100
02:21:46.310 --> 02:21:47.071
<v Speaker 10>If it's going around,</v>

5101
02:21:47.071 --> 02:21:47.220
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>

5102
02:21:47.220 --> 02:21:48.021
<v Speaker 10>they don't stop it.</v>

5103
02:21:48.021 --> 02:21:48.854
<v Speaker 10>If it's in the eye,</v>

5104
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:52.250
<v Speaker 10>then the doctor though the referee brothers coming over to talk to him,</v>

5105
02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:53.630
<v Speaker 10>he gets five minutes,</v>

5106
02:21:53.631 --> 02:21:54.050
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

5107
02:21:54.050 --> 02:21:54.591
<v Speaker 10>Five minutes.</v>

5108
02:21:54.591 --> 02:21:54.770
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

5109
02:21:54.770 --> 02:21:55.221
<v Speaker 10>So he's saying,</v>

5111
02:21:55.581 --> 02:21:56.414

02:21:56.930 --> 02:21:57.763

5114
02:21:59.721 --> 02:22:01.100
<v Speaker 10>This could be the change in the match.</v>

5115
02:22:01.101 --> 02:22:01.670
<v Speaker 10>You know what I'm saying?</v>

5116
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:02.391

5120
02:22:08.211 --> 02:22:09.080
<v Speaker 10>He's from the south.</v>

5121
02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:14.450
<v Speaker 10>Cole Miller can scrap these scraps.</v>

5122
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:16.740
<v Speaker 10>Is that inside leg kick?</v>

5123
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.600
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 10>they're different.</v>

5149
02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:49.230

5181
02:23:39.470 --> 02:23:40.730
<v Speaker 10>I bought an Alienware computer,</v>

<v Speaker 10>they covered the whole instep.</v>

02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:07.130
<v Speaker 10>There's little,</v>

5199
02:24:07.130 --> 02:24:10.160
<v Speaker 10>it's kind of like padding to tie pads or the Shit,</v>

5200
02:24:10.161 --> 02:24:10.520
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

<v Speaker 10>I would.</v>

5205
02:24:18.530 --> 02:24:20.120
<v Speaker 10>My tricep should be burning up,</v>

5208
02:24:25.930 --> 02:24:27.410
<v Speaker 10>It's a long time.</v>

5209
02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:28.580
<v Speaker 10>Came in twice.</v>

5210
02:24:30.090 --> 02:24:30.923
<v Speaker 10>Anything knows.</v>

5211
02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:32.720
<v Speaker 10>That's how bad it looks.</v>

5212
02:24:32.721 --> 02:24:33.554
<v Speaker 10>Bad,</v>

5213
02:24:33.650 --> 02:24:35.600
<v Speaker 10>bad place shaped like a head.</v>

02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:36.001
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

5215
02:24:36.001 --> 02:24:36.231
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

02:24:36.231 --> 02:24:37.064
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>

5217
02:24:37.170 --> 02:24:38.003
<v Speaker 10>Cool.</v>

5218
02:24:38.050 --> 02:24:38.630
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

5219
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:39.290
<v Speaker 10>terrible.</v>

5220
02:24:39.290 --> 02:24:40.040
<v Speaker 10>I think it's cold.</v>

5221
02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:40.950
<v Speaker 10>Oh my God.</v>

5222
02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:41.960
<v Speaker 10>It's huge.</v>

5223
02:24:43.430 --> 02:24:44.370
<v Speaker 10>I think it's a great idea,</v>

5224
02:24:46.250 --> 02:24:47.083
<v Speaker 10>son.</v>

5225
02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:48.350
<v Speaker 10>Dude did you see the cut?</v>

5226
02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:49.213
<v Speaker 10>It got bigger.</v>

5227
02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:54.220
<v Speaker 10>I think it got bigger and big caught his final punch when he was in the guard</v>

5228
02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:57.110
<v Speaker 10>right before the bell was right on the button again.</v>

5229
02:24:57.170 --> 02:24:58.003
<v Speaker 10>Oh really?</v>

5230
02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:59.540
<v Speaker 10>See that's kind of fucked up,</v>

5231
02:24:59.541 --> 02:24:59.780
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

5232
02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:00.950
<v Speaker 10>Oh look at this.</v>

5233
02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:01.580
<v Speaker 10>Nope.</v>

5234
02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:03.170
<v Speaker 10>That's nothing right.</v>

5235
02:25:03.171 --> 02:25:04.760
<v Speaker 10>They're terrible highlight.</v>

5236
02:25:04.970 --> 02:25:05.810
<v Speaker 10>But it's not like a hat,</v>

5237
02:25:05.811 --> 02:25:08.810
<v Speaker 10>but it's just like he's rubbing it like he's just going to die,</v>

5238
02:25:08.940 --> 02:25:09.773
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

5239
02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:10.310
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

5240
02:25:10.310 --> 02:25:11.930
<v Speaker 10>It's unfortunate that your eyes fuck up,</v>

5241
02:25:11.931 --> 02:25:13.400
<v Speaker 10>but well the mind,</v>

5242
02:25:13.410 --> 02:25:17.000
<v Speaker 10>the amount of known it was a little fucked up when he's grabbing his head in</v>

5243
02:25:17.001 --> 02:25:17.834
<v Speaker 10>there.</v>

5244
02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:18.980
<v Speaker 10>Let's be honest though,</v>

5245
02:25:18.981 --> 02:25:19.520
<v Speaker 10>for sure.</v>

5246
02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:19.840
<v Speaker 10>I mean he's,</v>

5247
02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:22.640
<v Speaker 10>he's aware his head hitting the cut.</v>

5248
02:25:23.290 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 10>It's pretty bad though.</v>

5249
02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:26.670
<v Speaker 10>It's a lot worse than I thought it was cool to feel in drag.</v>

5250
02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:27.850
<v Speaker 10>Drop it in front of his eye.</v>

5251
02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:29.051
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

5252
02:25:29.051 --> 02:25:32.980
<v Speaker 10>But when a company like high Bussa like take something like tie pads that have</v>

5253
02:25:32.981 --> 02:25:37.480
<v Speaker 10>existed forever and just makes an improvement like that where you know you could</v>

5254
02:25:37.481 --> 02:25:38.890
<v Speaker 10>absorb harder kicks with them.</v>

5255
02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:41.950
<v Speaker 10>There was a way they can make their cushioning,</v>

5256
02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:42.933
<v Speaker 10>whatever it is,</v>

5257
02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:45.370
<v Speaker 10>he doesn't hurt nearly as hard when someone's kicking that.</v>

5258
02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:49.350
<v Speaker 10>Have you ever had blood in you on the spot?</v>

5259
02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.030
<v Speaker 10>Cause the oil,</v>

5260
02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:52.893
<v Speaker 10>the oil,</v>

5261
02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:55.060
<v Speaker 10>you can swipe it just doesn't go away.</v>

5262
02:25:55.090 --> 02:25:58.420
<v Speaker 10>It's like having a film of straight motor oil in your eye.</v>

5263
02:25:58.480 --> 02:25:59.620
<v Speaker 10>You just can't get it off.</v>

5264
02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:00.880
<v Speaker 10>It sucks man.</v>

5265
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:02.890
<v Speaker 10>Everything's blurry up Coles.</v>

5266
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.851
<v Speaker 10>He's in trouble,</v>

5267
02:26:03.851 --> 02:26:04.684
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

5268
02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:08.110
<v Speaker 10>Max Holloway is a tough kid,</v>

5269
02:26:08.111 --> 02:26:08.830
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

5270
02:26:08.830 --> 02:26:11.020
<v Speaker 10>And he's had some tough fucking fights in the UFC,</v>

<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

5273
02:26:12.461 --> 02:26:14.250
<v Speaker 10>he fought Conor when he,</v>

5274
02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:18.400
<v Speaker 10>he made a decision because kind of blew his ankle or his ACL out and I met up</v>

5275
02:26:18.401 --> 02:26:19.211
<v Speaker 10>with Connor yesterday.</v>

5276
02:26:19.211 --> 02:26:20.044
<v Speaker 10>He was in Venice.</v>

5277
02:26:20.050 --> 02:26:21.910
<v Speaker 10>He's a big ass dude.</v>

5278
02:26:22.510 --> 02:26:23.081

<v Speaker 10>He's big.</v>

5280
02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:25.330
<v Speaker 10>Conor McGregor is,</v>

5281
02:26:26.050 --> 02:26:28.750
<v Speaker 10>I get to one 45 like a professional fuck.</v>

5282
02:26:28.751 --> 02:26:29.030
<v Speaker 10>He's,</v>

5283
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.900
<v Speaker 10>he's a genius.</v>

5284
02:26:32.570 --> 02:26:35.920
<v Speaker 10>He's got to get by Josie Aldo.</v>

5285
02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:37.560

5288
02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:40.540
<v Speaker 10>a tall drink.</v>

5289
02:26:41.530 --> 02:26:41.981

5292
02:26:45.851 --> 02:26:47.260
<v Speaker 10>Think about fucking Matt.</v>

5293
02:26:47.530 --> 02:26:48.340
<v Speaker 10>I agree.</v>

5294
02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:49.030
<v Speaker 10>He's not going to,</v>

5295
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:50.680
<v Speaker 10>that's going to be a different fight for Conor,</v>

5296
02:26:50.681 --> 02:26:50.831
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

5297

5302
02:26:56.530 --> 02:26:57.460

5315
02:27:11.390 --> 02:27:11.950
<v Speaker 10>That kid,</v>

5316
02:27:11.950 --> 02:27:12.250
<v Speaker 10>he's,</v>

5317
02:27:12.250 --> 02:27:13.420
<v Speaker 10>I think he's our biggest star.</v>

5318
02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:14.130
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

5319
02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:14.620
<v Speaker 10>easily.</v>

5320
02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:16.900
<v Speaker 10>I love Frankie Edgar meet you.</v>

5321
02:27:16.901 --> 02:27:18.220
<v Speaker 10>Love Conor McGregor too.</v>

5322
02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:22.750
<v Speaker 10>I don't want to pick a side because there's part of me that was so I love Cub</v>

5323
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:23.890
<v Speaker 10>Swanson to WHO's cuddlers caught?</v>

5324
02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:24.251
<v Speaker 10>Pardon me?</v>

5325
02:27:24.251 --> 02:27:27.790
<v Speaker 10>That was so impressed with Frankie after the cubs wants and fight.</v>

5326
02:27:27.791 --> 02:27:30.310
<v Speaker 10>I think it's a crime to not get my title shot after to that.</v>

5327
02:27:30.370 --> 02:27:30.701
<v Speaker 10>I agree.</v>

5328
02:27:30.701 --> 02:27:31.420
<v Speaker 10>I agree.</v>

5329
02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:32.260
<v Speaker 10>I think it's a crime.</v>

5330
02:27:32.350 --> 02:27:33.490
<v Speaker 10>The defense team beaten cub,</v>

5331
02:27:33.491 --> 02:27:36.220
<v Speaker 10>Swanson like that and beaten Dennis Seaver at the end of his rope.</v>

5332
02:27:36.250 --> 02:27:37.210
<v Speaker 10>Is it just totally,</v>

5333
02:27:37.211 --> 02:27:38.290
<v Speaker 10>you know why it took time?</v>

5334
02:27:38.291 --> 02:27:40.240
<v Speaker 10>Because think about what Frankie's gone through.</v>

5335
02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:41.820
<v Speaker 10>Think about Frankie's robe,</v>

5336
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:42.400
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

5337
02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:46.150
<v Speaker 10>But the thing is if you get Frankie Connor Union destroy to superstar,</v>

5338
02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:47.793
<v Speaker 10>do that man.</v>

5339
02:27:48.190 --> 02:27:48.551
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

5340
02:27:48.551 --> 02:27:49.384
<v Speaker 10>you gotta</v>

5341
02:27:50.900 --> 02:27:51.570
<v Speaker 10>give this,</v>

5342
02:27:51.570 --> 02:27:53.010
<v Speaker 10>you can give it a you.</v>

5343
02:27:53.410 --> 02:27:55.830
<v Speaker 10>Although that is key.</v>

5344
02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:57.070
<v Speaker 10>The fight with Aldo.</v>

5345
02:27:57.220 --> 02:27:58.053
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

5346
02:27:58.270 --> 02:27:59.680
<v Speaker 10>Whoever wins that fight,</v>

5347
02:27:59.770 --> 02:28:00.940
<v Speaker 10>then Connor fights that.</v>

5348
02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:02.470
<v Speaker 10>That's how I would do it.</v>

5349
02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:04.800
<v Speaker 10>I give common one more warm up.</v>

5350
02:28:05.770 --> 02:28:07.580
<v Speaker 10>Most of Connor fighting Aldo.</v>

5351
02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:08.890
<v Speaker 10>If he wins.</v>

5352
02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:09.640
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

5353
02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:10.440
<v Speaker 10>Diverse.</v>

5354
02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:11.021
<v Speaker 10>Goddamn.</v>

5355
02:28:11.021 --> 02:28:12.220
<v Speaker 10>That's I like,</v>

5356
02:28:12.250 --> 02:28:13.510
<v Speaker 10>I like seeing Aldo,</v>

5357
02:28:13.511 --> 02:28:13.871
<v Speaker 10>Josie,</v>

5360
02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:16.720
<v Speaker 10>I love it.</v>

5361
02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:18.280
<v Speaker 10>Exactly that UFC note,</v>

5362
02:28:18.310 --> 02:28:18.701
<v Speaker 10>Connor,</v>

5363
02:28:18.701 --> 02:28:19.031
<v Speaker 10>Josie,</v>

5364
02:28:19.031 --> 02:28:21.860
<v Speaker 10>all the right and the Ui and he knows that</v>

5365
02:28:24.430 --> 02:28:27.290
<v Speaker 4>that's the way the matchmaking Japan,</v>

5366
02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:30.190
<v Speaker 4>they think of a fucking match up and they do it well.</v>

5367
02:28:30.210 --> 02:28:31.760
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to build up the shit.</v>

5368
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:32.271
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

5369
02:28:32.271 --> 02:28:34.160
<v Speaker 4>let's make it happen right now.</v>

5370
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:36.980
<v Speaker 4>I just feel happy about it as common as management.</v>

5371
02:28:36.981 --> 02:28:37.341
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

5372
02:28:37.341 --> 02:28:37.581
<v Speaker 4>Bro,</v>

5373
02:28:37.581 --> 02:28:39.380
<v Speaker 4>let's get one more it.</v>

5374
02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:41.390
<v Speaker 4>You're in a fight kind of a grappler wrestler,</v>

5375
02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:42.530
<v Speaker 4>cause don't get it twisted.</v>

5376
02:28:42.531 --> 02:28:43.610
<v Speaker 4>All those a black belt,</v>

5377
02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:45.140
<v Speaker 4>it goes to the ground.</v>

5378
02:28:45.141 --> 02:28:47.180
<v Speaker 4>There's gonna be some issues there and he can wrestle.</v>

5379
02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:49.160
<v Speaker 4>He's hard as fuck to take down to,</v>

5380
02:28:49.430 --> 02:28:52.910
<v Speaker 4>I say you give him one more match up with kind of a grappler guy who's going to</v>

5381
02:28:52.911 --> 02:28:53.750
<v Speaker 4>try and take him down.</v>

5382
02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:55.490
<v Speaker 4>I think Conor is going to,</v>

5383
02:28:57.470 --> 02:28:59.030
<v Speaker 4>I think Conor is going to hurt him standing.</v>

5384
02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:02.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's going to go to the ground and then he really hits that hard.</v>

5385
02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:04.730
<v Speaker 4>How many more minutes do we have to see?</v>

5386
02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:05.901
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

5387
02:29:05.901 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 4>You know why he's so confident is I really think that everyone that he's</v>

5388
02:29:08.811 --> 02:29:09.680
<v Speaker 4>training with this going,</v>

5389
02:29:09.681 --> 02:29:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

5390
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.991
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>

5391
02:29:11.991 --> 02:29:12.651
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard,</v>

5392
02:29:12.651 --> 02:29:12.981
<v Speaker 4>and he's like,</v>

5393
02:29:12.981 --> 02:29:13.910
<v Speaker 4>fucking everybody up.</v>

5394
02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:15.050
<v Speaker 4>That's the confidence he has.</v>

5395
02:29:15.890 --> 02:29:16.940
<v Speaker 4>He's proving it.</v>

5396
02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:18.080
<v Speaker 4>He's hurt.</v>

5397
02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:20.430
<v Speaker 4>He hit Dennis Cbre with a couple shots in dentistry.</v>

5398
02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:21.740
<v Speaker 4>We started buckling quick.</v>

5399
02:29:21.890 --> 02:29:26.810
<v Speaker 4>If was system power as Joel get shy came stiff once he thought the power.</v>

5400
02:29:26.811 --> 02:29:29.210
<v Speaker 4>Now he was stiff from when he flew in on Tuesday.</v>

5401
02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:29.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5402
02:29:29.421 --> 02:29:29.901
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

5403
02:29:29.901 --> 02:29:31.280
<v Speaker 4>knocked out Dustin poray.</v>

5404
02:29:31.281 --> 02:29:33.950
<v Speaker 4>Nobody ever did that before and I'm saying I'm on the top of his head.</v>

5405
02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:35.000
<v Speaker 4>I think he really,</v>

5406
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:39.980
<v Speaker 4>he's so confident because he knows that these guys at 45 can't take his power</v>

5407
02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:41.240
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

5408
02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:43.280
<v Speaker 4>He's not saying the guy's at 55 could take his power.</v>

5409
02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:46.610
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be surprised if if like let's say he'd be Josie,</v>

5410
02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:47.300
<v Speaker 4>I was on his end.</v>

5411
02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:48.510

5444
02:30:33.150 --> 02:30:35.000
<v Speaker 4>He's very good on the ground.</v>

5445
02:30:35.001 --> 02:30:38.760
<v Speaker 4>He's a finisher and the way he throws a stretch so powerful with no wind up,</v>

5446
02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:41.840
<v Speaker 4>he just doesn't wind up right.</v>

5447
02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:43.250
<v Speaker 4>He throws some taekwondo styles.</v>

5448
02:30:43.251 --> 02:30:43.401
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5449
02:30:43.401 --> 02:30:45.260

5451
02:30:47.061 --> 02:30:48.920
<v Speaker 4>I think though it's going to be a tough fight,</v>

5452
02:30:48.921 --> 02:30:49.431
<v Speaker 4>but well,</v>

5460
02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:04.880
<v Speaker 4>Is he going to fight that guy?</v>

5461

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5467
02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:16.730
<v Speaker 4>It's great to be gangster,</v>

5468
02:31:16.731 --> 02:31:18.350
<v Speaker 4>but a certain point in his management needs to be like,</v>

5469
02:31:18.351 --> 02:31:18.650

<v Speaker 1>Cabo will be around for as long as he can,</v>

5475
02:31:23.071 --> 02:31:23.731
<v Speaker 1>which is great.</v>

5476
02:31:23.731 --> 02:31:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Which is great.</v>

5477
02:31:24.210 --> 02:31:25.800
<v Speaker 1>If I'm as business business manager,</v>

5478
02:31:25.801 --> 02:31:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying you wait for the title shot,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't want me.</v>

5489
02:31:40.711 --> 02:31:43.200
<v Speaker 1>And how many managers stories have you heard?</v>

02:31:48.781 --> 02:31:49.860
<v Speaker 1>You've done all this work.</v>

5494
02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:51.450
<v Speaker 1>We're in a great opportunity.</v>

5495
02:31:51.451 --> 02:31:52.440
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get a title shot.</v>

5496
02:31:52.441 --> 02:31:53.274
<v Speaker 1>Let's wait.</v>

5497
02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:54.233
<v Speaker 1>Don't fight.</v>

5498
02:31:54.330 --> 02:31:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It might have to wait a long time though.</v>

5499
02:31:57.241 --> 02:31:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Habib's ahead of him in line.</v>

5500
02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:00.113
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5501
02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:02.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fights out there.</v>

5502
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might have to wait a while.</v>

5503
02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:05.700
<v Speaker 1>You wait.</v>

5504
02:32:05.700 --> 02:32:06.301
<v Speaker 1>Title shots.</v>

5505
02:32:06.301 --> 02:32:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Think about how hard is to get a towel chat one people,</v>

5506
02:32:10.570 --> 02:32:12.450
<v Speaker 1>are they denying fights?</v>

5507
02:32:13.330 --> 02:32:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Vitara that happens every now and then.</v>

5508
02:32:15.121 --> 02:32:17.210
<v Speaker 1>But generally Dana white offers a fighter.</v>

5509
02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Joe Silva and you fucking just,</v>

5510
02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:20.700
<v Speaker 1>it your Donald Cerrone and you're fucking,</v>

5511
02:32:20.701 --> 02:32:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean him and Dana Command,</v>

5512
02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:24.630
<v Speaker 1>he could command fights or fucking,</v>

5513
02:32:24.631 --> 02:32:25.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like stepbrothers.</v>

5514
02:32:25.650 --> 02:32:25.791
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

5515
02:32:25.791 --> 02:32:26.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're boys.</v>

5516
02:32:26.821 --> 02:32:27.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5517
02:32:27.031 --> 02:32:28.560
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure he can be like,</v>

5518
02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:30.300
<v Speaker 1>and think how much he fought for him.</v>

5519
02:32:30.570 --> 02:32:32.130
<v Speaker 1>He thought Ben on a fucking,</v>

5520
02:32:32.131 --> 02:32:32.371
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

5521
02:32:32.371 --> 02:32:32.711
<v Speaker 1>two week?</v>

5522
02:32:32.711 --> 02:32:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Three week notice you're fucking hanging out with and you win seven in a row.</v>

5523
02:32:36.930 --> 02:32:37.940
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't second row.</v>

5524
02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5525
02:32:38.610 --> 02:32:41.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll cowboy wants to fight a lot.</v>

5526
02:32:41.311 --> 02:32:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I think he feels more comfortable when he fights a lot.</v>

5527
02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:45.270
<v Speaker 1>He gets better when he fights a lot.</v>

5528
02:32:45.620 --> 02:32:47.520
<v Speaker 1>I did not go with that advice.</v>

5529
02:32:47.820 --> 02:32:48.653
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know.</v>

5530
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:52.550
<v Speaker 1>No for immediate title shot if he was in live for it.</v>

5531
02:32:52.551 --> 02:32:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Immediate title shot,</v>

5532
02:32:53.431 --> 02:32:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's good advice.</v>

5533
02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:55.621
<v Speaker 1>Wait it out.</v>

5534
02:32:55.621 --> 02:32:56.340
<v Speaker 1>But he's not.</v>

5535
02:32:56.340 --> 02:32:57.600
<v Speaker 1>There's other guys that had of him,</v>

5536
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:58.890
<v Speaker 1>this shit could take a year.</v>

5537
02:32:59.010 --> 02:33:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Look what a pedes hurts himself again.</v>

5538
02:33:01.140 --> 02:33:01.471
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5539
02:33:01.471 --> 02:33:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Pedes hurt himself with Gilbert.</v>

5540
02:33:03.060 --> 02:33:04.110
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were saying,</v>

5541
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:06.060
<v Speaker 1>but that interim fights,</v>

5542
02:33:06.061 --> 02:33:06.894

5543
02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:08.050
<v Speaker 1>But when Pedis,</v>

5544
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:09.900
<v Speaker 1>champ pedis hurt himself,</v>

5545
02:33:09.901 --> 02:33:11.310
<v Speaker 1>how to get to go through surgery,</v>

5546
02:33:11.370 --> 02:33:14.520
<v Speaker 1>he's got through at least two surgeries and there was rumor that he hurt his</v>

5547
02:33:14.521 --> 02:33:16.380
<v Speaker 1>hand or something after the,</v>

5548
02:33:16.381 --> 02:33:16.711

5550
02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:19.260
<v Speaker 1>the fight with Gil and it turned out that wasn't true.</v>

5551
02:33:19.261 --> 02:33:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Or if it was hurt,</v>

5552
02:33:20.401 --> 02:33:21.480
<v Speaker 1>it was okay.</v>

5553
02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:23.310
<v Speaker 1>He could rest it and it'll be fine.</v>

5554
02:33:23.311 --> 02:33:25.410
<v Speaker 1>But anything could happen.</v>

5555
02:33:25.411 --> 02:33:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Look at the fucking heavyweight division.</v>

5556
02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:29.760
<v Speaker 1>They had to have an interim title because at a certain point in time it's like</v>

5557
02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:31.050
<v Speaker 1>canes gone through another service.</v>

5558
02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

5559
02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And when you can't wait around for a title shot,</v>

5560
02:33:35.821 --> 02:33:39.270
<v Speaker 1>if that's a situation cause you can go dry as cowboy fight so much better when</v>

5561
02:33:39.271 --> 02:33:39.751
<v Speaker 1>he's active.</v>

5562
02:33:39.751 --> 02:33:40.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good.</v>

5563
02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:40.861
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

5564
02:33:40.861 --> 02:33:41.521
<v Speaker 1>General Advice,</v>

5565
02:33:41.521 --> 02:33:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying,</v>

5566
02:33:42.421 --> 02:33:45.190
<v Speaker 1>but like cowboy foot so much better in his head is locked.</v>

5567
02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Like his head is in,</v>

5568
02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:47.820
<v Speaker 1>in to the lot better.</v>

5569
02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.030
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to see if fight could be,</v>

5570
02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:51.001
<v Speaker 1>the thing is he,</v>

5571
02:33:51.001 --> 02:33:54.390
<v Speaker 1>so he takes off six months or whatever it is and he comes back,</v>

5572
02:33:54.450 --> 02:33:55.890
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to get a tune up fight.</v>

5573
02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:58.260
<v Speaker 1>He's going to fight somebody that's a fucking savage.</v>

5574
02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:01.230
<v Speaker 1>It's almost better for him to stay in the fucking woods,</v>

5575
02:34:01.290 --> 02:34:01.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5576
02:34:01.890 --> 02:34:02.311
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>

5577
02:34:02.311 --> 02:34:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5578
02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:02.901
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

5579
02:34:02.901 --> 02:34:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5580
02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's bad or good.</v>

5581
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:08.390
<v Speaker 1>It's good to stay in act to stay.</v>

5582
02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:09.771
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

5583
02:34:09.771 --> 02:34:10.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5584
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:10.860
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

5585
02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:12.600
<v Speaker 1>a guy like Norma Madoff is,</v>

5586
02:34:12.650 --> 02:34:13.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5587
02:34:13.070 --> 02:34:18.070
<v Speaker 1>an elite grappler and it'll show you where cowboys defenses and</v>

5588
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:19.390
<v Speaker 9>where his back game is.</v>

5589
02:34:19.391 --> 02:34:22.390
<v Speaker 9>Cause Cowboy has a very nasty triangle that people forget about God.</v>

5590
02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:23.680
<v Speaker 9>He's got a nasty game,</v>

5591
02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:26.740
<v Speaker 9>was badly super finished with very nasty off his back.</v>

5592
02:34:26.741 --> 02:34:27.071
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

5593
02:34:27.071 --> 02:34:27.271
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

5594
02:34:27.271 --> 02:34:30.620
<v Speaker 9>I wouldn't say that he couldn't beat Namaka met off and if he did beat normally</v>

5595
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:31.180
<v Speaker 9>come out off,</v>

5596
02:34:31.180 --> 02:34:33.670
<v Speaker 9>especially if you fucking showed his versatility by submitting them.</v>

5597
02:34:33.850 --> 02:34:34.001
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

5598
02:34:34.001 --> 02:34:35.770
<v Speaker 9>you would think if cowboy is going to win,</v>

5599
02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:38.230
<v Speaker 9>like most people would say probably by knock out right?</v>

5600
02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:39.160
<v Speaker 9>Like normal gum it off,</v>

5601
02:34:39.161 --> 02:34:39.580
<v Speaker 9>hand up.</v>

5602
02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:40.110
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5603
02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:41.200
<v Speaker 9>He'd had kicked him or something.</v>

5604
02:34:41.201 --> 02:34:41.530
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5605
02:34:41.530 --> 02:34:42.341
<v Speaker 9>But man,</v>

5606
02:34:42.341 --> 02:34:43.780
<v Speaker 9>if he caught him with something on the ground,</v>

5607
02:34:43.781 --> 02:34:43.991
<v Speaker 9>man,</v>

5608
02:34:43.991 --> 02:34:45.910
<v Speaker 9>that would be even more impressive in my opinion.</v>

5609
02:34:45.911 --> 02:34:49.690
<v Speaker 9>Me Catch him in his own realm when they're a Madoff is the elite grappler.</v>

5610
02:34:49.930 --> 02:34:52.120
<v Speaker 9>Whether he could do that or not is a big,</v>

5611
02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:55.450
<v Speaker 9>if you know like a guy like nick or Madoff's 50 doing combat,</v>

5612
02:34:55.451 --> 02:35:00.451
<v Speaker 9>sambo combat sambo world champion and you watch him fight dos Anjos it's pretty</v>

5613
02:35:01.421 --> 02:35:06.421
<v Speaker 9>obvious his grappling his on some next level shit cause he just took that dude</v>

5614
02:35:06.791 --> 02:35:07.360
<v Speaker 9>to the ground.</v>

5615
02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:12.280
<v Speaker 9>Anytime you want it to rag Dalton zoom or pounded on his face,</v>

5616
02:35:12.310 --> 02:35:15.290
<v Speaker 9>elbowed him and he'd be design Joe Sanchez beat Donald.</v>

5617
02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:18.570
<v Speaker 9>Any beat Ben as well.</v>

5618
02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:19.960
<v Speaker 9>Like a Conor McGregor.</v>

5619
02:35:19.961 --> 02:35:21.820
<v Speaker 9>He's not fighting these elite grapplers.</v>

5620
02:35:21.850 --> 02:35:22.480
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5621
02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:25.740
<v Speaker 9>So why does cowboy I have to fight this boy.</v>

5622
02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:27.030
<v Speaker 9>I think he's the one that too.</v>

5623
02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:29.050
<v Speaker 9>I think he wants to and if he wins,</v>

5624
02:35:29.051 --> 02:35:30.190
<v Speaker 9>God damn dude.</v>

5625
02:35:30.370 --> 02:35:31.270
<v Speaker 9>If he wins,</v>

5626
02:35:31.271 --> 02:35:31.840
<v Speaker 9>I mean think about it.</v>

5627
02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:34.180
<v Speaker 9>He took the Benson fight with two weeks notice.</v>

5628
02:35:34.470 --> 02:35:36.040
<v Speaker 9>A lot of people think he didn't win.</v>

5629
02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:37.510
<v Speaker 9>It was a very close,</v>

5630
02:35:37.511 --> 02:35:38.650
<v Speaker 9>controversial decision.</v>

5631
02:35:38.651 --> 02:35:41.140
<v Speaker 9>I thought personally I thought Henderson was going to get the nod.</v>

5632
02:35:41.350 --> 02:35:42.670
<v Speaker 9>I didn't rewatch the fights.</v>

5633
02:35:42.671 --> 02:35:43.031
<v Speaker 9>I didn't,</v>

5634
02:35:43.031 --> 02:35:44.880
<v Speaker 9>I'm not committed to that.</v>

5635
02:35:44.881 --> 02:35:45.671
<v Speaker 9>I'm not married to that.</v>

5636
02:35:45.671 --> 02:35:46.420
<v Speaker 9>But I thought like,</v>

5637
02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:48.040
<v Speaker 9>I think Benson was more effective.</v>

5638
02:35:48.041 --> 02:35:48.880
<v Speaker 9>He did more shit,</v>

5639
02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:52.540
<v Speaker 9>got more things off and I knew cowboy was pretty banged up going into that fight</v>

5640
02:35:52.541 --> 02:35:52.990
<v Speaker 9>too,</v>

5641
02:35:52.990 --> 02:35:54.520
<v Speaker 9>especially if the way it was kicking miles,</v>

5642
02:35:54.521 --> 02:35:55.740
<v Speaker 9>juries legs when he was taboo.</v>

5643
02:35:55.740 --> 02:35:56.710
<v Speaker 9>I didn't look good in that.</v>

5644
02:35:56.711 --> 02:35:57.610
<v Speaker 9>But yeah,</v>

5645
02:35:57.611 --> 02:36:00.400
<v Speaker 9>he looked like a guy who just fought two weeks ago.</v>

5646
02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:00.890
<v Speaker 9>You know what I mean?</v>

5647
02:36:00.890 --> 02:36:01.721
<v Speaker 9>You still look good,</v>

5648
02:36:01.721 --> 02:36:04.960
<v Speaker 9>but it took a head kicked in and fucking played it off.</v>

5649
02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:06.970
<v Speaker 9>He got head kicked at one point in time by,</v>

5650
02:36:07.330 --> 02:36:10.540
<v Speaker 9>by Ben and played it off well like you could see him stiffen up though.</v>

5651
02:36:10.541 --> 02:36:11.320
<v Speaker 9>Like he got,</v>

5652
02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:12.160
<v Speaker 9>he got wrong.</v>

5653
02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:13.990
<v Speaker 9>It's tough man.</v>

5654
02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:15.460
<v Speaker 9>You fight and then you fight.</v>

5655
02:36:15.461 --> 02:36:17.980
<v Speaker 9>Two weeks later you're going to be busted up.</v>

5656
02:36:18.010 --> 02:36:18.540
<v Speaker 9>But she couldn't,</v>

5657
02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:19.460
<v Speaker 9>that weight there,</v>

5658
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:23.020
<v Speaker 9>there has to be some sort of point of no return where your body's just like,</v>

5659
02:36:23.021 --> 02:36:23.231
<v Speaker 9>dude,</v>

5660
02:36:23.231 --> 02:36:24.080
<v Speaker 9>we can't keep doing this.</v>

5661
02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:25.010
<v Speaker 9>But then you see the show.</v>

5662
02:36:25.020 --> 02:36:28.120
<v Speaker 9>So you look at Nirimba Madoff and he's been out for a long time.</v>

5663
02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:32.380
<v Speaker 9>He's had a knee surgery and then I think he fucked something up again.</v>

5664
02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:32.591
<v Speaker 9>Like,</v>

5665
02:36:32.591 --> 02:36:34.150
<v Speaker 9>I think he hurt his knee and then,</v>

5666
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:36.640
<v Speaker 9>and then retrained too quick or something like that.</v>

5667
02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:38.170
<v Speaker 9>He's been out for a long time,</v>

5668
02:36:38.410 --> 02:36:41.610
<v Speaker 9>so he's trying to get back on the men because they,</v>

5669
02:36:41.770 --> 02:36:43.660
<v Speaker 9>the reason why they gave gill the title shot,</v>

5670
02:36:43.661 --> 02:36:43.901
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

5671
02:36:43.901 --> 02:36:45.550
<v Speaker 9>I think Gil was supposed to get the title shot,</v>

5672
02:36:45.551 --> 02:36:49.350
<v Speaker 9>but they were going to have Norma Madoff was in the mix and they tried to offer</v>

5673
02:36:49.351 --> 02:36:49.991
<v Speaker 9>him a big fight,</v>

5674
02:36:49.991 --> 02:36:52.090
<v Speaker 9>but he couldn't take it because his name was fucked up.</v>

5675
02:36:52.270 --> 02:36:53.860
<v Speaker 9>And that was like about six months ago.</v>

5676
02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:55.420
<v Speaker 9>I forget what fight he couldn't take,</v>

5677
02:36:55.780 --> 02:36:56.081
<v Speaker 9>but,</v>

5678
02:36:56.081 --> 02:36:58.990
<v Speaker 9>so he's been out for awhile too.</v>

5679
02:36:59.050 --> 02:37:01.600
<v Speaker 9>So it's not a bad time for cowboy to catch him,</v>

5680
02:37:01.810 --> 02:37:02.021
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5681
02:37:02.021 --> 02:37:04.340
<v Speaker 9>if you want it to look to you going to catch up if you're going to catch them,</v>

5682
02:37:04.341 --> 02:37:05.174
<v Speaker 9>it's not a bad time.</v>

5683
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:06.460
<v Speaker 9>Or they both Greg Jackson,</v>

5684
02:37:07.210 --> 02:37:09.760
<v Speaker 9>they both trained no</v>

5685
02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:12.490
<v Speaker 9>roofs.</v>

5686
02:37:12.490 --> 02:37:14.590
<v Speaker 9>Tom Hobby love these jobs.</v>

5687
02:37:15.710 --> 02:37:16.880
<v Speaker 9>A lot of those crazy Russians</v>

5688
02:37:18.450 --> 02:37:20.150
<v Speaker 9>and a Benson beet root.</v>

5689
02:37:20.151 --> 02:37:21.130
<v Speaker 9>Some hobby love.</v>

5690
02:37:21.170 --> 02:37:22.003
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5691
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:22.481
<v Speaker 9>So that,</v>

5692
02:37:22.481 --> 02:37:23.630
<v Speaker 9>that was a big win for him.</v>

5693
02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:26.140
<v Speaker 9>That fucking lightweight division is filled with murderers,</v>

5694
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.480
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

5695
02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:27.041
<v Speaker 9>Just murder.</v>

5696
02:37:27.041 --> 02:37:27.330
<v Speaker 9>Murder.</v>

5697
02:37:27.330 --> 02:37:28.163
<v Speaker 9>Oh man,</v>

5698
02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:29.760
<v Speaker 9>so many audios.</v>

5699
02:37:29.890 --> 02:37:32.360
<v Speaker 9>They got a really good shot of beating Padis.</v>

5700
02:37:32.950 --> 02:37:33.180
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

5701
02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:33.640
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5702
02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:34.430
<v Speaker 9>got the best shot.</v>

5703
02:37:34.430 --> 02:37:34.970
<v Speaker 9>He's got a,</v>

5704
02:37:34.970 --> 02:37:36.680
<v Speaker 9>he's got a strong grappling game.</v>

5705
02:37:36.681 --> 02:37:37.730
<v Speaker 9>He's very physically strong.</v>

5706
02:37:37.731 --> 02:37:38.564
<v Speaker 9>He looked at Nate,</v>

5707
02:37:38.750 --> 02:37:39.710
<v Speaker 9>Nate Diaz fight.</v>

5708
02:37:39.890 --> 02:37:41.330
<v Speaker 9>His grappling game is very strong.</v>

5709
02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:42.800
<v Speaker 9>He's very fucking big.</v>

5710
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:43.700
<v Speaker 9>He's very fit.</v>

5711
02:37:43.850 --> 02:37:45.870
<v Speaker 9>His leg kicks her nasty shit.</v>

5712
02:37:45.890 --> 02:37:46.520
<v Speaker 9>Kickboxing.</v>

5713
02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:46.731
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5714
02:37:46.731 --> 02:37:48.290
<v Speaker 9>So it's like he's not a,</v>

5715
02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:49.100
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

5716
02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:50.690
<v Speaker 9>like an easy out on the feet.</v>

5717
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:51.583
<v Speaker 9>It's not like,</v>

5718
02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:52.220
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5719
02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:53.810
<v Speaker 9>pedis could just light them up on the feet.</v>

5720
02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:54.651
<v Speaker 9>You know?</v>

5721
02:37:54.651 --> 02:37:56.620
<v Speaker 9>I think it's just a strong too,</v>

5722
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:58.250
<v Speaker 9>I think it's to be on the feet.</v>

5723
02:37:58.251 --> 02:38:00.020
<v Speaker 9>It'd be interesting to see if pedis can get off.</v>

5724
02:38:00.050 --> 02:38:04.020
<v Speaker 9>Pedis is definitely quicker and it's definitely more experienced against world</v>

5725
02:38:04.021 --> 02:38:05.750
<v Speaker 9>class competition and being successful.</v>

5726
02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:06.141
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

5727
02:38:06.141 --> 02:38:08.030
<v Speaker 9>pedis knocked out cowboy,</v>

5728
02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:08.601
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5729
02:38:08.601 --> 02:38:08.930
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

5730
02:38:08.930 --> 02:38:09.740
<v Speaker 9>pedis is,</v>

5731
02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:10.760
<v Speaker 9>he's something special.</v>

5732
02:38:10.761 --> 02:38:11.594
<v Speaker 9>He really is.</v>

5733
02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:13.280
<v Speaker 9>But at the South Pole,</v>

5734
02:38:13.310 --> 02:38:14.143
<v Speaker 9>it's going to be interesting.</v>

5735
02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:19.280
<v Speaker 9>It's going to be really hard for anybody to stand with Pettis.</v>

5736
02:38:19.490 --> 02:38:20.300
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>

5737
02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:21.350
<v Speaker 9>He's too scary.</v>

5738
02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:25.370
<v Speaker 9>He doesn't get hit so hard with all this,</v>

5739
02:38:25.580 --> 02:38:26.930
<v Speaker 9>the unorthodox stuff.</v>

5740
02:38:26.931 --> 02:38:27.141
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

5741
02:38:27.141 --> 02:38:28.130
<v Speaker 9>he has the craziest kick.</v>

5742
02:38:28.131 --> 02:38:30.080
<v Speaker 9>Love to see Conor Aldo do it.</v>

5743
02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:31.671
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5744
02:38:31.671 --> 02:38:32.391
<v Speaker 9>I wanted to see,</v>

5745
02:38:32.391 --> 02:38:34.520
<v Speaker 9>although versus Pettis and they were trying to set that up.</v>

5746
02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:34.921
<v Speaker 9>Where are you?</v>

5747
02:38:34.921 --> 02:38:35.601
<v Speaker 9>And let me tell you something.</v>

5748
02:38:35.601 --> 02:38:37.460
<v Speaker 9>Pedes was ready to go down to one 45.</v>

5749
02:38:37.490 --> 02:38:38.420
<v Speaker 9>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

5750
02:38:38.421 --> 02:38:38.631
<v Speaker 9>He's like,</v>

5751
02:38:38.631 --> 02:38:39.530
<v Speaker 9>I want to fight that dude.</v>

5752
02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:40.251
<v Speaker 9>He goes,</v>

5753
02:38:40.251 --> 02:38:41.540
<v Speaker 9>I think I can beat that motherfucker.</v>

5754
02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:42.470
<v Speaker 9>That's when he hurt his knee.</v>

5755
02:38:42.471 --> 02:38:42.760
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

5756
02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:43.260
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

5757
02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:45.710
<v Speaker 9>Imagine pennys going to remember they were setting that up.</v>

5758
02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:49.010
<v Speaker 9>They were setting up that Superfight pet is going down to one 45 and fighting</v>

5759
02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:50.570
<v Speaker 9>Aldo would be fucking crazy.</v>

5760
02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:53.330
<v Speaker 9>Looking at those two guys facing off against each other.</v>

5761
02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:55.040
<v Speaker 9>That would be insane.</v>

5762
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:57.980
<v Speaker 9>The Funny Eric Silva break him down.</v>

5763
02:38:58.610 --> 02:38:59.950
<v Speaker 9>Eric Silva is a,</v>

5764
02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:01.520
<v Speaker 9>a very aggressive dude.</v>

5765
02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:03.380
<v Speaker 9>He's a very tough guy.</v>

5766
02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:05.330
<v Speaker 9>Like you look at his fight with Matt Brown.</v>

5767
02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:05.981
<v Speaker 9>He,</v>

5768
02:39:05.981 --> 02:39:10.981
<v Speaker 9>he's a a ferocious dude for like the first round or so round two rounds.</v>

5769
02:39:11.690 --> 02:39:13.970
<v Speaker 9>I've never seen him do like,</v>

5770
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.420
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

5771
02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:17.280
<v Speaker 9>like a normal combat bed off type fight or uh,</v>

5772
02:39:17.930 --> 02:39:19.010
<v Speaker 9>dos Anjos fight.</v>

5773
02:39:19.011 --> 02:39:23.480
<v Speaker 9>I just don't sign just the way he ground down Nate Diaz for three rounds get</v>

5774
02:39:23.481 --> 02:39:23.751
<v Speaker 9>dumped.</v>

5775
02:39:23.751 --> 02:39:24.800
<v Speaker 9>Took her down and smashed him,</v>

5776
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:26.750
<v Speaker 9>constantly work and constantly working.</v>

5777
02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:27.980
<v Speaker 9>Eric Silva,</v>

5778
02:39:28.310 --> 02:39:30.170
<v Speaker 9>I think especially earlier in his career,</v>

5779
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:31.790
<v Speaker 9>it tended to run out of gas,</v>

5780
02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:33.440
<v Speaker 9>like John Fitch outfits to them.</v>

5781
02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:37.190
<v Speaker 9>John Fitch just kind of took them down Malden and stayed on him and warm out.</v>

5782
02:39:37.250 --> 02:39:38.330
<v Speaker 9>He's just got worn out.</v>

5783
02:39:38.450 --> 02:39:40.250
<v Speaker 9>He's not the same guy towards the end of the fight.</v>

5784
02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:41.360
<v Speaker 9>And Matt Brown,</v>

5785
02:39:41.361 --> 02:39:42.011
<v Speaker 9>that's Matt Brown,</v>

5786
02:39:42.011 --> 02:39:42.844
<v Speaker 9>his world,</v>

5787
02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:43.161
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5788
02:39:43.161 --> 02:39:43.451
<v Speaker 9>he's,</v>

5789
02:39:43.451 --> 02:39:44.720
<v Speaker 9>he's in a drown in bitches.</v>

5790
02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:46.610
<v Speaker 9>Matt Brown drowns motherfuckers.</v>

5791
02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:47.503
<v Speaker 9>That's what he does,</v>

5792
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:48.201
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5793
02:39:48.201 --> 02:39:49.670
<v Speaker 9>and Eric heard him,</v>

5794
02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:51.140
<v Speaker 9>he heard him in the first round.</v>

5795
02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:52.850
<v Speaker 9>He hit him with a nasty body kick.</v>

5796
02:39:52.851 --> 02:39:54.740
<v Speaker 9>He's got a real good left kick to the liver.</v>

5797
02:39:55.010 --> 02:39:58.250
<v Speaker 9>He throws that kick and throw it like a front kick to throw it that way too.</v>

5798
02:39:58.490 --> 02:40:00.370
<v Speaker 9>He's really good with his,</v>

5799
02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:02.840
<v Speaker 9>his distance was kicks is super aggressive.</v>

5800
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.711
<v Speaker 9>His ground game,</v>

5801
02:40:03.711 --> 02:40:04.550
<v Speaker 9>his real solid,</v>

5802
02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:05.420
<v Speaker 9>but he's just,</v>

5803
02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:05.670
<v Speaker 9>he,</v>

5804
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:09.760
<v Speaker 9>he to me it's like he's emotional or something or it too,</v>

5805
02:40:09.790 --> 02:40:11.210
<v Speaker 9>too much adrenaline or something,</v>

5806
02:40:11.330 --> 02:40:13.010
<v Speaker 9>but it doesn't seem to hold a,</v>

5807
02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:14.310
<v Speaker 9>that he could sustain.</v>

5808
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:16.380
<v Speaker 9>And if you get in there with a guy like Matt Brown,</v>

5809
02:40:16.381 --> 02:40:19.350
<v Speaker 9>like you gotta know when to lay off the gas man,</v>

5810
02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:21.040
<v Speaker 9>you got to know when to recruit.</v>

5811
02:40:21.090 --> 02:40:22.680
<v Speaker 9>You got to know what kind of shape you're in.</v>

5812
02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:23.970
<v Speaker 9>And Matt Brown,</v>

5813
02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:24.391
<v Speaker 9>Look,</v>

5814
02:40:24.391 --> 02:40:27.280
<v Speaker 9>Matt Brown exposes people he did to Wonderboy.</v>

5815
02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:28.500
<v Speaker 9>He exposed Wonderboy,</v>

5816
02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:28.950
<v Speaker 9>not,</v>

5817
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:31.000
<v Speaker 9>I'm not saying this in a negative way towards Wonderboy.</v>

5818
02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:31.970
<v Speaker 9>I think Wonderboy,</v>

5819
02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:33.690
<v Speaker 9>what was exposed in that fight,</v>

5820
02:40:33.691 --> 02:40:37.350
<v Speaker 9>according to my conversation with one voice that he overtrained he said just he</v>

5821
02:40:37.351 --> 02:40:40.980
<v Speaker 9>was really trying to deal with the cardio and the shift that Matt Brown was</v>

5822
02:40:40.981 --> 02:40:41.380
<v Speaker 9>thrown out on.</v>

5823
02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:44.220
<v Speaker 9>But he said he might overdid it cause he was just like real flat.</v>

5824
02:40:44.370 --> 02:40:45.091
<v Speaker 9>And then you know,</v>

5825
02:40:45.091 --> 02:40:45.780
<v Speaker 9>Matt,</v>

5826
02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:46.320
<v Speaker 9>you can't,</v>

5827
02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:48.690
<v Speaker 9>you can't have an off day when you're fighting Matt Brown rice guys.</v>

5828
02:40:48.691 --> 02:40:48.931
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

5829
02:40:48.931 --> 02:40:49.920
<v Speaker 9>His pace breaks.</v>

5830
02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:52.320
<v Speaker 9>Dude's [inaudible] Silva.</v>

5831
02:40:52.470 --> 02:40:54.010
<v Speaker 9>I think Matt eventually broke them.</v>

5832
02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:55.080
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

5833
02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:55.861
<v Speaker 9>is this just like,</v>

5834
02:40:55.861 --> 02:40:56.694
<v Speaker 9>what the fuck?</v>

5835
02:40:56.700 --> 02:40:58.200
<v Speaker 9>He's not saying it's ferocious.</v>

5836
02:40:58.201 --> 02:40:59.430
<v Speaker 9>Round is going to be a beast.</v>

5837
02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:00.293
<v Speaker 9>He's not laying off.</v>

5838
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:03.343
<v Speaker 9>Got My book,</v>

5839
02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:04.321
<v Speaker 9>I got my boy killed.</v>

5840
02:41:04.321 --> 02:41:06.260
<v Speaker 9>It'd be all day canceled.</v>

5841
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:09.420
<v Speaker 9>So unusual,</v>

5842
02:41:09.540 --> 02:41:09.811
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

5843
02:41:09.811 --> 02:41:13.220
<v Speaker 9>and the more you concentrate on training with this motherfucker,</v>

5844
02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:14.190
<v Speaker 9>you're to me or like,</v>

5845
02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:16.500
<v Speaker 9>like I've been waiting for someone to come along,</v>

5846
02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:18.270
<v Speaker 9>I'll others outside of Aoki,</v>

5847
02:41:18.271 --> 02:41:18.831
<v Speaker 9>but of course I,</v>

5848
02:41:18.831 --> 02:41:19.030
<v Speaker 9>okay.</v>

5849
02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:21.180
<v Speaker 9>You always have those crazy tights on and it's like,</v>

5850
02:41:21.210 --> 02:41:21.441
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>

5851
02:41:21.441 --> 02:41:26.441
<v Speaker 9>it's so hard to find someone in MMA that understands that guard correctly and to</v>

5852
02:41:27.211 --> 02:41:29.160
<v Speaker 9>be able to have the kind of flexibility,</v>

5853
02:41:29.161 --> 02:41:30.930
<v Speaker 9>dexterity you have in rap guys up,</v>

5854
02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:32.670
<v Speaker 9>you're going to see you get into positions.</v>

5855
02:41:32.671 --> 02:41:35.330
<v Speaker 9>Like Jason Day was when he fought um,</v>

5856
02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:36.273
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

5857
02:41:37.050 --> 02:41:38.760
<v Speaker 9>Alan Belcher in Canada.</v>

5858
02:41:38.910 --> 02:41:42.590
<v Speaker 9>He wrapped him up in that mission control and drop some bows on it,</v>

5859
02:41:42.591 --> 02:41:42.990
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

5860
02:41:42.990 --> 02:41:45.180
<v Speaker 9>And you realize like if someone is good at this position,</v>

5861
02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:47.490
<v Speaker 9>you leave someone incredibly vulnerable,</v>

5862
02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:49.080
<v Speaker 9>incredibly vulnerable.</v>

5863
02:41:49.180 --> 02:41:51.930
<v Speaker 9>It's just that position is there all day.</v>

5864
02:41:52.110 --> 02:41:56.400
<v Speaker 9>The position to lock up arm's mission control in order to get to like a good</v>

5865
02:41:56.401 --> 02:42:00.930
<v Speaker 9>place of completely controlling a guy in a way that you rarely see and closed</v>

5866
02:42:00.931 --> 02:42:01.530
<v Speaker 9>guard.</v>

5867
02:42:01.530 --> 02:42:01.861
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>

5868
02:42:01.861 --> 02:42:04.260
<v Speaker 9>the technique is around in grappling.</v>

5869
02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:05.730
<v Speaker 9>I mean you see it in grappling,</v>

5870
02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:07.320
<v Speaker 9>but in MMA it's,</v>

5871
02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:08.190
<v Speaker 9>it's fairly,</v>

5872
02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:09.870
<v Speaker 9>and it's not because it doesn't work,</v>

5873
02:42:10.050 --> 02:42:11.670
<v Speaker 9>but to me it's like wheel kicks.</v>

5874
02:42:11.671 --> 02:42:14.400
<v Speaker 9>Like for the longest time we just didn't see him and everybody didn't think they</v>

5875
02:42:14.401 --> 02:42:15.060
<v Speaker 9>work.</v>

5876
02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:19.710
<v Speaker 9>And then Barbosa lands that fucking nuclear weapon on Terry Edom and everybody's</v>

5877
02:42:19.711 --> 02:42:20.544
<v Speaker 9>spinning now.</v>

5878
02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:21.413
<v Speaker 9>Veit tours,</v>

5879
02:42:21.430 --> 02:42:22.263
<v Speaker 9>winning,</v>

5880
02:42:22.410 --> 02:42:22.861
<v Speaker 9>spinning,</v>

5881
02:42:22.861 --> 02:42:23.610
<v Speaker 9>heel kicks,</v>

5882
02:42:23.610 --> 02:42:24.121
<v Speaker 9>knocks out.</v>

5883
02:42:24.121 --> 02:42:26.640
<v Speaker 9>Luke Rockhold was a fucking spinning junior.</v>

5884
02:42:26.641 --> 02:42:28.320
<v Speaker 9>Dos Santos hits Mark Hunt with it.</v>

5885
02:42:28.350 --> 02:42:29.183
<v Speaker 9>I mean it's,</v>

5886
02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:33.180
<v Speaker 9>I think that once someone sees what a guy like you is capable off of his back,</v>

5887
02:42:33.181 --> 02:42:37.980
<v Speaker 9>it opens up so much defensive possibilities and so much authentic possibilities</v>

5888
02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:38.490
<v Speaker 9>too.</v>

5889
02:42:38.490 --> 02:42:42.690
<v Speaker 9>Like your way safer defensively and you're all fence off your back in positions</v>

5890
02:42:42.691 --> 02:42:44.520
<v Speaker 9>that people don't think they're vulnerable for.</v>

5891
02:42:45.030 --> 02:42:45.251
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

5892
02:42:45.251 --> 02:42:47.700
<v Speaker 9>like I get what he puts her fucking hands on the mat in the UFC.</v>

5893
02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:48.170
<v Speaker 9>Everyone,</v>

5894
02:42:48.170 --> 02:42:49.003
<v Speaker 9>everyone does.</v>

5895
02:42:49.050 --> 02:42:49.883
<v Speaker 9>Everyone does.</v>

5896
02:42:49.890 --> 02:42:52.650
<v Speaker 9>You put your hands on the mat at his school and you're going to have an elbow</v>

5897
02:42:52.651 --> 02:42:53.080
<v Speaker 9>problem.</v>

5898
02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:56.540
<v Speaker 9>Do you do your scanning of your shit snapped or you're going to get snapped?</v>

5899
02:42:57.030 --> 02:42:58.440
<v Speaker 9>He was in cold Miller's corner.</v>

5900
02:42:58.580 --> 02:42:58.711
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

5901
02:42:58.711 --> 02:42:59.220
<v Speaker 9>okay.</v>

5902
02:42:59.220 --> 02:42:59.461
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

5903
02:42:59.461 --> 02:43:00.840
<v Speaker 9>he's a no,</v>

5904
02:43:00.841 --> 02:43:05.841
<v Speaker 9>Gucci is a great thing about Ben is that I get,</v>

5905
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:09.480
<v Speaker 9>I've had so many MMA fighters come through and,</v>

5906
02:43:09.550 --> 02:43:09.870
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

5907
02:43:09.870 --> 02:43:10.703
<v Speaker 9>and uh,</v>

5908
02:43:11.250 --> 02:43:12.083
<v Speaker 9>I</v>

5909
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:17.160
<v Speaker 4>try to add the rubber guard or other techniques to their MMA game.</v>

5910
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:20.343
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5911
02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:25.090
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes some more to come and they're striking will be really bad.</v>

5912
02:43:25.091 --> 02:43:26.530
<v Speaker 4>They got really good Jiu Jitsu.</v>

5913
02:43:26.531 --> 02:43:27.670
<v Speaker 4>They want to do MMA.</v>

5914
02:43:28.060 --> 02:43:29.980
<v Speaker 4>They just started striking six months ago.</v>

5915
02:43:29.981 --> 02:43:31.480
<v Speaker 4>They want to add rubber guard and I'm like,</v>

5916
02:43:31.481 --> 02:43:32.200
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5917
02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:33.670
<v Speaker 4>we're going to add rubber guard of a man.</v>

5918
02:43:33.671 --> 02:43:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Like you got along way to go with your striking,</v>

5919
02:43:36.340 --> 02:43:36.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5920
02:43:36.851 --> 02:43:39.880
<v Speaker 4>or a guy will come from a wrestling background.</v>

5921
02:43:39.881 --> 02:43:40.750
<v Speaker 4>Really good wrestler.</v>

5922
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:43.660
<v Speaker 4>Not that good striking just started Jujitsu.</v>

5923
02:43:43.690 --> 02:43:44.261
<v Speaker 4>He wants to do,</v>

5924
02:43:44.261 --> 02:43:45.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm in May.</v>

5925
02:43:45.050 --> 02:43:46.300
<v Speaker 4>We got a lot to work.</v>

5926
02:43:46.301 --> 02:43:46.511
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5927
02:43:46.511 --> 02:43:47.181
<v Speaker 4>we got to work on it.</v>

5928
02:43:47.181 --> 02:43:50.230
<v Speaker 4>A lot of other Jujitsu than Robert go and I'm just going to work on rubber</v>

5929
02:43:50.231 --> 02:43:50.501
<v Speaker 4>guard.</v>

5930
02:43:50.501 --> 02:43:52.030
<v Speaker 4>We've got to get your passing together.</v>

5931
02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:54.130
<v Speaker 4>We got to get your guard retention together.</v>

5932
02:43:54.340 --> 02:43:56.710
<v Speaker 4>We got to get so much other stuff together.</v>

5933
02:43:57.090 --> 02:43:58.390
<v Speaker 4>Like this is a longterm project,</v>

5934
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:59.020
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>

5935
02:43:59.020 --> 02:43:59.681
<v Speaker 4>they're awesome.</v>

5936
02:43:59.681 --> 02:44:00.910
<v Speaker 4>They're awesome people.</v>

5937
02:44:01.170 --> 02:44:01.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5938
02:44:01.421 --> 02:44:02.254
<v Speaker 4>they're awesome people.</v>

5939
02:44:02.350 --> 02:44:06.610
<v Speaker 4>And then sometimes you have a tremendous striker coming to me and that I want to</v>

5940
02:44:06.611 --> 02:44:07.480
<v Speaker 4>learn some rubber guard.</v>

5941
02:44:07.630 --> 02:44:11.500
<v Speaker 4>Mike has zero wrestling and as you Jitsu his blue belt level,</v>

5942
02:44:11.620 --> 02:44:12.490
<v Speaker 4>and the same with them,</v>

5943
02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:13.720
<v Speaker 4>you have tremendous striking.</v>

5944
02:44:13.721 --> 02:44:14.590
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>

5945
02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:15.581
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>

5946
02:44:15.581 --> 02:44:18.340
<v Speaker 4>Dude's gonna try to take you down and you've got to have garner attention</v>

5947
02:44:18.341 --> 02:44:19.174
<v Speaker 4>skills.</v>

5948
02:44:19.260 --> 02:44:24.190
<v Speaker 4>You got to have so much other pieces of the game that it's not just rubber</v>

5949
02:44:24.191 --> 02:44:24.431
<v Speaker 4>guard.</v>

5950
02:44:24.431 --> 02:44:26.530
<v Speaker 4>So it's a lot of things that you've got to work on.</v>

5951
02:44:26.860 --> 02:44:28.030
<v Speaker 4>But when Ben came to me,</v>

5952
02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:31.210
<v Speaker 4>he came to me with UFC experience.</v>

5953
02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:34.840
<v Speaker 4>He came to me as a black belt from Ricardo laboriel.</v>

5954
02:44:34.841 --> 02:44:37.000
<v Speaker 4>So I don't have to really work on anything else,</v>

5955
02:44:37.001 --> 02:44:38.650
<v Speaker 4>but just really,</v>

5956
02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:39.513
<v Speaker 4>and he's,</v>

5957
02:44:39.550 --> 02:44:42.130
<v Speaker 4>he got tremendously long legs for his size.</v>

5958
02:44:42.130 --> 02:44:42.491
<v Speaker 4>He's six,</v>

5959
02:44:42.491 --> 02:44:42.910
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

5960
02:44:42.910 --> 02:44:43.211
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

5961
02:44:43.211 --> 02:44:43.361
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

5962
02:44:43.361 --> 02:44:43.601
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

5963
02:44:43.601 --> 02:44:45.610
<v Speaker 4>three but he's got the legs of the dude that six,</v>

5964
02:44:45.611 --> 02:44:47.470
<v Speaker 4>eight and they're super flexible.</v>

5965
02:44:47.890 --> 02:44:49.190
<v Speaker 4>He's super flex weed and,</v>

5966
02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:50.440
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of guys that come to me,</v>

5967
02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:51.461
<v Speaker 4>they're ready,</v>

5968
02:44:51.461 --> 02:44:52.151
<v Speaker 4>they're ready to find,</v>

5969
02:44:52.151 --> 02:44:52.691
<v Speaker 4>they're doing pretty good,</v>

5970
02:44:52.691 --> 02:44:53.950
<v Speaker 4>but they don't have the flexibility.</v>

5971
02:44:53.951 --> 02:44:55.200
<v Speaker 4>We got to get the flexibility again,</v>

5972
02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:56.500
<v Speaker 4>that could take a year,</v>

5973
02:44:56.600 --> 02:44:57.520
<v Speaker 4>that could take two years,</v>

5974
02:44:57.580 --> 02:44:58.450
<v Speaker 4>that could take three years,</v>

5975
02:44:58.510 --> 02:45:01.870
<v Speaker 4>that could take two months depending on how much time they're willing to put in</v>

5976
02:45:02.050 --> 02:45:02.920
<v Speaker 4>to their flexibility.</v>

5977
02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:04.020
<v Speaker 4>So would it be,</v>

5978
02:45:04.270 --> 02:45:07.020
<v Speaker 4>Ben came to me already a black belt from MacArthur.</v>

5979
02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:10.710
<v Speaker 4>Laborio already had his flexibility already was playing uh,</v>

5980
02:45:11.010 --> 02:45:11.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5981
02:45:11.570 --> 02:45:12.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5982
02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:13.330
<v Speaker 4>versions of the rubber guard.</v>

5983
02:45:13.331 --> 02:45:15.850
<v Speaker 4>He was already bringing his legs up on and,</v>

5984
02:45:16.270 --> 02:45:18.970
<v Speaker 4>and he's an amazing striker.</v>

5985
02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:20.140
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

5986
02:45:20.290 --> 02:45:20.771
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

5987
02:45:20.771 --> 02:45:21.910
<v Speaker 4>it's really easy for me.</v>

5988
02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Like he wants to stand up.</v>

5989
02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:25.300
<v Speaker 4>He don't even want to take it to the ground,</v>

5990
02:45:25.301 --> 02:45:30.301
<v Speaker 4>but it just seems like at least his last two opponents in the UFC wanted to take</v>

5991
02:45:30.401 --> 02:45:31.030
<v Speaker 4>him down.</v>

5992
02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.650
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5993
02:45:31.650 --> 02:45:32.471
<v Speaker 4>w what was his name?</v>

5994
02:45:32.471 --> 02:45:33.304
<v Speaker 4>Seth Heatherly.</v>

5995
02:45:33.460 --> 02:45:34.293
<v Speaker 4>Chris Heatherly.</v>

5996
02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:34.811
<v Speaker 4>Chris,</v>

5997
02:45:34.811 --> 02:45:35.980
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to take you down.</v>

5998
02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:38.050
<v Speaker 4>He saw your tape when you look at the tape.</v>

5999
02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:39.190
<v Speaker 4>And to be honest with you,</v>

6000
02:45:40.390 --> 02:45:41.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm so buried,</v>

6001
02:45:42.030 --> 02:45:42.863
<v Speaker 4>had been buried,</v>

6002
02:45:42.940 --> 02:45:44.350
<v Speaker 4>which just life,</v>

6003
02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:48.400
<v Speaker 4>the last few years I haven't kept up with MMA like I want to,</v>

6004
02:45:48.401 --> 02:45:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I just don't have the time.</v>

6005
02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:49.961
<v Speaker 4>And I kind of,</v>

6006
02:45:49.961 --> 02:45:54.010
<v Speaker 4>and I never watched Beltre when Ben went to Bella tour,</v>

6007
02:45:54.190 --> 02:45:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I kind of lost track.</v>

6008
02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:56.890
<v Speaker 4>I saw one or two fights.</v>

6009
02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:57.970
<v Speaker 4>I lost track.</v>

6010
02:45:58.030 --> 02:45:58.863
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

6011
02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:02.200
<v Speaker 4>So be kick you just through what happened.</v>

6012
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:06.230
<v Speaker 4>He's a hell of warm and not to just through a wicked fucking around Casper.</v>

6013
02:46:06.270 --> 02:46:06.910
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

6014
02:46:06.910 --> 02:46:09.220
<v Speaker 4>he says in the Serena,</v>

6015
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:11.390
<v Speaker 10>all this fight coming up,</v>

6016
02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:12.920
<v Speaker 10>all his fights were in this arena.</v>

6017
02:46:12.921 --> 02:46:15.050
<v Speaker 10>This is what I'll say about anything else.</v>

6018
02:46:15.051 --> 02:46:16.490
<v Speaker 10>It's wrap it up before we get real quick.</v>

6019
02:46:16.491 --> 02:46:17.241
<v Speaker 10>I just wanted to finish.</v>

6020
02:46:17.241 --> 02:46:18.980
<v Speaker 10>What I was saying about Ben is,</v>

6021
02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:20.033
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

6022
02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:23.460
<v Speaker 10>he came to me and I really didn't know how good of a striker he was.</v>

6023
02:46:23.790 --> 02:46:24.591
<v Speaker 10>Hit not the letter,</v>

6024
02:46:24.591 --> 02:46:26.330
<v Speaker 10>I'm just the one that came up to me and said,</v>

6025
02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:26.890
<v Speaker 10>do you,</v>

6026
02:46:26.890 --> 02:46:27.640
<v Speaker 10>have you seen?</v>

6027
02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:28.130
<v Speaker 10>And you know,</v>

6028
02:46:28.130 --> 02:46:28.950
<v Speaker 10>what do you know about a strike?</v>

6029
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:29.601
<v Speaker 10>I know he's pretty good.</v>

6030
02:46:29.601 --> 02:46:30.291
<v Speaker 10>He's got good knees,</v>

6031
02:46:30.291 --> 02:46:30.650
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

6032
02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:31.940
<v Speaker 10>I remember like the killer knees.</v>

6033
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.451
<v Speaker 10>He goes,</v>

6034
02:46:32.451 --> 02:46:32.721
<v Speaker 10>dude,</v>

6035
02:46:32.721 --> 02:46:34.220
<v Speaker 10>go watch him on Youtube.</v>

6036
02:46:34.221 --> 02:46:36.860
<v Speaker 10>This guy is fucking super killer.</v>

6037
02:46:37.130 --> 02:46:40.700
<v Speaker 10>So I went and I watched the highlight reel of Ben Saunders and when you watch a</v>

6038
02:46:40.701 --> 02:46:41.270
<v Speaker 10>highlight reel,</v>

6039
02:46:41.270 --> 02:46:41.450
<v Speaker 10>like,</v>

6040
02:46:41.450 --> 02:46:42.283
<v Speaker 10>oh shit,</v>

6041
02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:46.610
<v Speaker 10>it's a highlight reel of him fucking starching dudes and fucking him up with all</v>

6042
02:46:46.611 --> 02:46:47.310
<v Speaker 10>sorts of shit.</v>

6043
02:46:47.310 --> 02:46:49.010
<v Speaker 10>Jimmy's head kicks,</v>

6044
02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:50.120
<v Speaker 10>spinning back,</v>

6045
02:46:50.121 --> 02:46:50.450
<v Speaker 10>fist,</v>

6046
02:46:50.450 --> 02:46:51.180
<v Speaker 10>elbows,</v>

6047
02:46:51.180 --> 02:46:52.490
<v Speaker 10>boom man.</v>

6048
02:46:52.491 --> 02:46:52.821
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>

6049
02:46:52.821 --> 02:46:53.540
<v Speaker 10>it's uh,</v>

6050
02:46:53.540 --> 02:46:55.880
<v Speaker 10>it makes it easier to teach someone when they,</v>

6051
02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:56.540
<v Speaker 10>they're,</v>

6052
02:46:56.540 --> 02:46:58.850
<v Speaker 10>they're already coming as a killer teen killer bee.</v>

6053
02:46:58.940 --> 02:46:59.773
<v Speaker 10>What do you think,</v>

6054
02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:03.860
<v Speaker 10>what do you think Benson Henderson is Wayne right now as he gets into the</v>

6055
02:47:03.861 --> 02:47:04.580
<v Speaker 10>octagon?</v>

6056
02:47:04.580 --> 02:47:05.930
<v Speaker 10>Like how much do you think he was cutting?</v>

6057
02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:07.370
<v Speaker 10>What do you think he probably weighs right now?</v>

6058
02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:08.270
<v Speaker 10>One 75.</v>

6059
02:47:08.271 --> 02:47:12.590
<v Speaker 10>180170170 one.</v>

6060
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.440
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

6061
02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:16.100
<v Speaker 10>so you think that that's all he weighed before he started his cut down to one</v>

6062
02:47:16.101 --> 02:47:16.934
<v Speaker 10>55.</v>

6063
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:19.460
<v Speaker 10>One seven one which is not much bigger than just spot.</v>

6064
02:47:19.850 --> 02:47:20.690
<v Speaker 10>It's hard to put that.</v>

6065
02:47:20.700 --> 02:47:25.250
<v Speaker 10>He just bought a Brandon's thatches head coach leaser bowling wrestle in college</v>

6066
02:47:25.251 --> 02:47:27.800
<v Speaker 10>with Ben Henderson and they're super close.</v>

6067
02:47:28.010 --> 02:47:28.640
<v Speaker 10>And he,</v>

6068
02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:29.451
<v Speaker 10>that's what he was saying.</v>

6069
02:47:29.451 --> 02:47:30.380
<v Speaker 10>The advantages,</v>

6070
02:47:30.530 --> 02:47:32.330
<v Speaker 10>Ben walks around at may one 70,</v>

6071
02:47:32.331 --> 02:47:33.140
<v Speaker 10>barely.</v>

6072
02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:36.650
<v Speaker 10>And we know that on a strict diet lean is,</v>

6073
02:47:36.651 --> 02:47:37.160
<v Speaker 10>fuck,</v>

6074
02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:40.970
<v Speaker 10>we'll enter the octagon tonight at one 90 which is crazy,</v>

6075
02:47:40.971 --> 02:47:41.390
<v Speaker 10>man.</v>

6076
02:47:41.390 --> 02:47:42.080
<v Speaker 10>Wow.</v>

6077
02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:43.760
<v Speaker 10>So it was a big difference in the size.</v>

6078
02:47:44.090 --> 02:47:45.050
<v Speaker 10>So you're talking about,</v>

6079
02:47:45.051 --> 02:47:47.180
<v Speaker 10>we're probably looking at a 15 pound plus difference.</v>

6080
02:47:47.390 --> 02:47:48.680
<v Speaker 10>There's your board Joe rigs,</v>

6081
02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:50.601
<v Speaker 10>15 pounds.</v>

6082
02:47:50.601 --> 02:47:51.950
<v Speaker 10>And you're talking about a dude who,</v>

6083
02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:55.680
<v Speaker 10>who's a Kale artists too at one 70 that's a shit.</v>

6084
02:47:55.690 --> 02:47:56.110
<v Speaker 10>Looks the,</v>

6085
02:47:56.110 --> 02:47:57.030
<v Speaker 10>and he doesn't look good.</v>

6086
02:47:57.080 --> 02:47:58.160
<v Speaker 10>Grappling is different,</v>

6087
02:47:58.550 --> 02:48:00.110
<v Speaker 10>but grappling will be the difference.</v>

6088
02:48:00.140 --> 02:48:01.040
<v Speaker 10>What I was gonna say is his,</v>

6089
02:48:01.041 --> 02:48:04.880
<v Speaker 10>he ever fought somebody at this level has Benson is at a very high level.</v>

6090
02:48:04.910 --> 02:48:05.390
<v Speaker 10>I agree.</v>

6091
02:48:05.390 --> 02:48:05.601
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

6092
02:48:05.601 --> 02:48:06.434
<v Speaker 10>he has it.</v>

6093
02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:09.020
<v Speaker 10>This is like the biggest Paulo Thiago in Brazil.</v>

6094
02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:09.771
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

6095
02:48:09.771 --> 02:48:10.161
<v Speaker 10>But Paul,</v>

6096
02:48:10.161 --> 02:48:12.410
<v Speaker 10>Tiago is nowhere as good as Benson Henderson is.</v>

6097
02:48:12.500 --> 02:48:12.900
<v Speaker 10>I know.</v>

6098
02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:13.733
<v Speaker 10>All due respect,</v>

6099
02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:14.890
<v Speaker 10>the highest level he's fought.</v>

6100
02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:17.330
<v Speaker 10>And it was in Brazil against him.</v>

6101
02:48:17.530 --> 02:48:19.190
<v Speaker 10>You mean supplement wise?</v>

6102
02:48:19.730 --> 02:48:20.563
<v Speaker 10>Yes.</v>

6103
02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:22.680
<v Speaker 10>I love it.</v>

6104
02:48:22.681 --> 02:48:23.514
<v Speaker 10>He said yes.</v>

6105
02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:24.650
<v Speaker 10>Just kidding.</v>

6106
02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:26.180
<v Speaker 10>Well I wonder how many guys,</v>

6107
02:48:26.181 --> 02:48:26.630
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>

6108
02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:29.630
<v Speaker 10>how many guys did get the fucking free pass from the doctor,</v>

6109
02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:30.230
<v Speaker 10>my friend.</v>

6110
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:31.370
<v Speaker 10>Don't worry about this.</v>

6111
02:48:31.940 --> 02:48:33.950
<v Speaker 10>I got the right your and for you and this one,</v>

6112
02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:39.860
<v Speaker 10>I mean it had to have happened somewhere along the line in some country where a</v>

6113
02:48:39.861 --> 02:48:42.590
<v Speaker 10>local guy got a free pass,</v>

6114
02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:43.940
<v Speaker 10>a drug test.</v>

6115
02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:46.100
<v Speaker 10>That would be a giant scandal.</v>

6116

<v Speaker 3>corn flakes?</v>

6137
02:49:23.310 --> 02:49:23.911
<v Speaker 3>Bruce Buffer.</v>

6138
02:49:23.911 --> 02:49:24.780
<v Speaker 3>More airtime.</v>

02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:31.500
<v Speaker 3>people were more into what he does now.</v>

6142
02:49:31.501 --> 02:49:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Like even the,</v>

6143
02:49:32.341 --> 02:49:32.431
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6144
02:49:32.431 --> 02:49:34.110
<v Speaker 3>the UFC appreciates it now.</v>

6145
02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Like these wacky moves they used to be embarrassed by his whiskey moves.</v>

6146
02:49:39.390 --> 02:49:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it true that Eddie Bravo gave him the idea and the inspiration for the</v>

6147
02:49:43.591 --> 02:49:43.861
<v Speaker 3>buffer?</v>

6148
02:49:43.861 --> 02:49:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Three 60 no,</v>

6149
02:49:44.970 --> 02:49:45.151
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6150
02:49:45.151 --> 02:49:45.331
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6151
02:49:45.331 --> 02:49:45.451
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6152
02:49:45.451 --> 02:49:45.621
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

6153
02:49:45.621 --> 02:49:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I was not the buffer.</v>

6154
02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:47.573
<v Speaker 3>The Matrix,</v>

6155
02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:50.160
<v Speaker 3>the matrix buffer was a different one.</v>

6156
02:49:50.161 --> 02:49:51.450
<v Speaker 3>He never ran with it.</v>

6157
02:49:51.540 --> 02:49:52.590
<v Speaker 3>It was too hard though.</v>

6158
02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:55.370
<v Speaker 3>The three 60 it was too hard cause there was one way we wait.</v>

6159
02:49:55.380 --> 02:49:56.191
<v Speaker 3>Don't say it was too hard.</v>

6160
02:49:56.191 --> 02:50:00.090
<v Speaker 3>Say the fans when he phones weren't ready for this move where instead of just</v>

6161
02:50:00.091 --> 02:50:01.680
<v Speaker 3>going like that are spinning and going like that.</v>

6162
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Like him going like this,</v>

6163
02:50:03.810 --> 02:50:06.720
<v Speaker 3>keeping icon coming through like that.</v>

6164

6165
02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:08.140

6166
02:50:08.140 --> 02:50:08.941
<v Speaker 3>You have to practice.</v>

6167
02:50:08.941 --> 02:50:10.050
<v Speaker 3>But the idea is like,</v>

6168
02:50:11.250 --> 02:50:11.800
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

6169

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

6170
02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:14.930
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to do you gotta have some good back flexibility</v>

6171
02:50:17.930 --> 02:50:21.330
<v Speaker 3>right there and keep an eye contact,</v>

6172
02:50:21.390 --> 02:50:22.410
<v Speaker 3>keep eye contact,</v>

6173
02:50:22.411 --> 02:50:23.220

6179
02:50:28.291 --> 02:50:32.250

<v Speaker 2>we literally just watch them just destroy cats with knees,</v>

<v Speaker 11>Did a seminar with the power that the people with the strongest woman in the</v>

6407
02:56:51.331 --> 02:56:52.680
<v Speaker 11>world and her husband and shit.</v>

6408
02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:54.300
<v Speaker 11>And it's fucking phenomenal.</v>

6409
02:56:54.330 --> 02:56:55.460
<v Speaker 11>Like it's,</v>

6410
02:56:55.461 --> 02:56:56.281
<v Speaker 11>it's awesome shit.</v>

6411
02:56:56.281 --> 02:56:56.511
<v Speaker 11>And it,</v>

6412
02:56:56.511 --> 02:56:59.460
<v Speaker 11>and really it's something that all fighters like as far as like when you see</v>

6413
02:56:59.461 --> 02:57:02.490
<v Speaker 11>guys lose knockout power dudes that you used to have it starch and dudes and</v>

6414
02:57:02.491 --> 02:57:03.031
<v Speaker 11>then they don't,</v>

6415
02:57:03.031 --> 02:57:03.810
<v Speaker 11>and they're just like,</v>

6416
02:57:03.810 --> 02:57:06.180
<v Speaker 11>it's like they're just happened dudes now I feel like their,</v>

6417
02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:09.320
<v Speaker 11>their training has been misused in a way.</v>

6418
02:57:09.410 --> 02:57:09.961
<v Speaker 11>Why is you're saying?</v>

6419
02:57:09.961 --> 02:57:10.291
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

6420
02:57:10.291 --> 02:57:10.531
<v Speaker 11>and they,</v>

6421
02:57:10.531 --> 02:57:10.801
<v Speaker 11>and they,</v>

6422
02:57:10.801 --> 02:57:12.950
<v Speaker 11>and they actually lose that power because it's,</v>

6423
02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:13.501
<v Speaker 11>it's weird.</v>

6424
02:57:13.501 --> 02:57:13.800
<v Speaker 11>It's like,</v>

6425
02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:14.250
<v Speaker 11>it's like what,</v>

6426
02:57:14.250 --> 02:57:15.510
<v Speaker 11>Jujitsu is the same thing.</v>

6427
02:57:15.511 --> 02:57:18.330
<v Speaker 11>Like were we didn't see a lot of rubber guard for a long time and now it's like</v>

6428
02:57:18.331 --> 02:57:19.650
<v Speaker 11>creeping in and all that kind of stuff.</v>

6429
02:57:19.651 --> 02:57:20.484
<v Speaker 11>But that's like,</v>

6430
02:57:20.670 --> 02:57:25.350
<v Speaker 11>there's a time in Emma in MMA where there was nobody that was,</v>

6431
02:57:25.740 --> 02:57:26.573
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

6432
02:57:27.230 --> 02:57:28.160
<v Speaker 11>it was pushing a guard game.</v>

6433
02:57:28.170 --> 02:57:28.381
<v Speaker 11>They're like,</v>

6434
02:57:28.381 --> 02:57:29.130
<v Speaker 11>stand up and,</v>

6435
02:57:29.130 --> 02:57:30.000
<v Speaker 11>and scrap again.</v>

6436
02:57:30.001 --> 02:57:30.290
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

6437
02:57:30.290 --> 02:57:30.670
<v Speaker 11>And the,</v>

6438
02:57:30.670 --> 02:57:33.510
<v Speaker 11>and that's because the coaches didn't know any better.</v>

6439
02:57:33.570 --> 02:57:37.530
<v Speaker 11>And now like a lot of guys like Duane Ludwig's or the world that are like actual</v>

6440
02:57:37.531 --> 02:57:39.930
<v Speaker 11>fighters that came out and now they can put that together.</v>

6441
02:57:40.170 --> 02:57:42.120
<v Speaker 11>But that's changing the whole face of it,</v>

6442
02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:43.151
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

6443
02:57:43.151 --> 02:57:43.451
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

6444
02:57:43.451 --> 02:57:45.580
<v Speaker 2>So you mean like now we've seen that with strength and conditioning.</v>

6445
02:57:45.581 --> 02:57:47.470
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying now we're seeing that with strength and conditioning as</v>

6446
02:57:47.471 --> 02:57:47.620
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

6447
02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:47.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6448
02:57:47.831 --> 02:57:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Well you never forget.</v>

6449
02:57:49.481 --> 02:57:50.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of people that don't know.</v>

6450
02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I hooked by Benson that Marv Marinovich camps,</v>

6451
02:57:53.741 --> 02:57:58.000
<v Speaker 2>those Marmar Mark Marinovich camps at Bj went through for the best performances</v>

6452
02:57:58.001 --> 02:57:58.834
<v Speaker 2>of his career.</v>

6453
02:57:58.900 --> 02:57:59.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6454
02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:00.160
<v Speaker 2>he hated doing it,</v>

6455
02:58:00.161 --> 02:58:00.701

02:58:06.001 --> 02:58:07.200
<v Speaker 7>He was doing all that USC.</v>

<v Speaker 7>He was doing all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

6464
02:58:09.901 --> 02:58:10.111
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

02:58:11.700 --> 02:58:13.110
<v Speaker 7>He said he was so tired at night.</v>

6467
02:58:13.111 --> 02:58:14.460
<v Speaker 7>He couldn't even pick up his baby.</v>

6468
02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:15.211

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6492
02:58:47.141 --> 02:58:48.460
<v Speaker 7>Bj was a beast man.</v>

6493
02:58:48.940 --> 02:58:50.020
<v Speaker 7>There's leaster bowling,</v>

6494
02:58:50.410 --> 02:58:51.280
<v Speaker 7>Christian Allen,</v>

6495
02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:53.670
<v Speaker 7>the masterminds behind Brandon Thatch.</v>

6496
02:58:57.530 --> 02:58:58.430
<v Speaker 7>Oh Nice.</v>

6497
02:58:59.850 --> 02:59:01.830
<v Speaker 7>Now do you think that's just starting to slow down?</v>

6498
02:59:01.980 --> 02:59:02.221
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

6499
02:59:02.221 --> 02:59:02.761
<v Speaker 7>it looks like it,</v>

6500
02:59:02.761 --> 02:59:03.120
<v Speaker 7>doesn't it?</v>

6501
02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:03.341
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

6502
02:59:03.341 --> 02:59:03.911
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting.</v>

6503
02:59:03.911 --> 02:59:05.550
<v Speaker 7>A theft in the third and fourth round man.</v>

6504
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:06.510
<v Speaker 7>Well that's,</v>

6505
02:59:06.510 --> 02:59:06.721
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

6506
02:59:06.721 --> 02:59:08.790
<v Speaker 7>how about the fifth if he gets into that,</v>

6507
02:59:08.791 --> 02:59:09.510
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

6508
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:12.360
<v Speaker 7>But what is the knock on him as far as his conditioning?</v>

6509
02:59:12.690 --> 02:59:13.040
<v Speaker 7>He's,</v>

6510
02:59:13.040 --> 02:59:13.561
<v Speaker 7>he's really,</v>

6511
02:59:13.561 --> 02:59:15.240
<v Speaker 7>it was knocking everyone out in the first round.</v>

6512
02:59:15.241 --> 02:59:16.200
<v Speaker 7>So we really don't know.</v>

6513
02:59:16.230 --> 02:59:16.531
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

6514
02:59:16.531 --> 02:59:17.041
<v Speaker 7>I'm training,</v>

6515
02:59:17.041 --> 02:59:20.600
<v Speaker 7>he's always been obese cause as long as this is all standup,</v>

6516
02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:24.150
<v Speaker 7>he can do 10 rounds as if Ben starts grappling with them.</v>

6517
02:59:24.151 --> 02:59:26.490
<v Speaker 7>I think Brandon's going to be in some trouble.</v>

6518
02:59:26.550 --> 02:59:29.280
<v Speaker 7>Do you think maybe a Benson might know that?</v>

6519
02:59:29.281 --> 02:59:32.460
<v Speaker 7>It might be like looking to stand with them with the first couple of rounds and</v>

6520
02:59:32.461 --> 02:59:34.200
<v Speaker 7>then where I'm down to third,</v>

6521
02:59:34.201 --> 02:59:36.930
<v Speaker 7>fourth and fifth and then start taking them down if you had a be in his corner.</v>

6522
02:59:36.960 --> 02:59:37.171
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

6523
02:59:37.171 --> 02:59:38.700
<v Speaker 7>that's exactly what I'd say to do.</v>

6524
02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:40.110
<v Speaker 7>Well the thing is is like I said,</v>

6525
02:59:40.111 --> 02:59:43.230
<v Speaker 7>at least her bowling is really good friends with Ben and Ben's head coach</v>

6538
03:00:02.941 --> 03:00:05.940
<v Speaker 7>he's going to throw a right kick and then he sets up the left or left kick and</v>

6539
03:00:05.941 --> 03:00:06.774
<v Speaker 7>he says it with the right.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Or maybe just things to do is too big.</v>

6548
03:00:21.930 --> 03:00:23.100
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't want to fuck with that.</v>

6549
03:00:23.430 --> 03:00:27.240
<v Speaker 7>Oh that's a high level grappler wrestler.</v>

6550
03:00:27.270 --> 03:00:29.130
<v Speaker 7>That's a beautiful fucking jab.</v>

6551
03:00:29.131 --> 03:00:30.630
<v Speaker 7>Right hand or jab left hand.</v>

6552
03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:32.370
<v Speaker 7>But then Ben just went for a leg.</v>

6553
03:00:32.820 --> 03:00:34.170
<v Speaker 7>But that might be to keep them honest.</v>

6554
03:00:34.171 --> 03:00:34.740
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

6555
03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:36.000
<v Speaker 7>I think Ben needs a switch.</v>

6556
03:00:36.001 --> 03:00:36.811
<v Speaker 7>It up can get,</v>

6557
03:00:36.811 --> 03:00:37.650
<v Speaker 7>I'm guessing man.</v>

6558
03:00:38.130 --> 03:00:39.830
<v Speaker 7>Ben is thrown a lot of right hooks.</v>

6559
03:00:39.850 --> 03:00:40.280
<v Speaker 7>The body.</v>

6560
03:00:40.280 --> 03:00:41.110
<v Speaker 7>Oh yes.</v>

6561
03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:42.490
<v Speaker 7>Oh it was that.</v>

6562
03:00:42.500 --> 03:00:44.190
<v Speaker 7>Oh he loses his balance right there.</v>

6563
03:00:44.440 --> 03:00:44.700
<v Speaker 7>Nah,</v>

6564
03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:45.310
<v Speaker 7>it looks like right.</v>

6565
03:00:45.310 --> 03:00:47.520
<v Speaker 7>Then I'll come back and try to press him on the fence.</v>

6566
03:00:47.521 --> 03:00:49.200
<v Speaker 7>If you could hold a little rock,</v>

6567
03:00:49.201 --> 03:00:52.980
<v Speaker 7>but his legs being pinned against the fence by him would be death.</v>

6568
03:00:55.070 --> 03:00:55.903
<v Speaker 7>Ooh,</v>

6569
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.863
<v Speaker 7>good body shots.</v>

6570
03:00:57.080 --> 03:00:58.190
<v Speaker 7>I bet he goes up top soon.</v>

6571
03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:01.821
<v Speaker 9>Good move.</v>

6572
03:01:01.821 --> 03:01:03.950
<v Speaker 9>I'm moving these main event fights to five rounds.</v>

6573
03:01:03.951 --> 03:01:04.784
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

6574
03:01:04.980 --> 03:01:06.590
<v Speaker 9>He might have for the fighters.</v>

6575
03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:11.720
<v Speaker 9>So much more entertaining used for the players in camp.</v>

6576
03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:12.260
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

6577
03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:12.531
<v Speaker 9>Ooh,</v>

6578
03:01:12.531 --> 03:01:12.861
<v Speaker 9>Nice.</v>

6579
03:01:12.861 --> 03:01:13.670
<v Speaker 9>Straight left.</v>

6580
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:16.040
<v Speaker 9>It is a great to watch,</v>

6581
03:01:16.070 --> 03:01:18.940
<v Speaker 9>but you got to think they can't like steep meo chicken.</v>

6582
03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:19.310
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

6583
03:01:19.310 --> 03:01:20.270
<v Speaker 9>junior dos Santos.</v>

6584
03:01:20.840 --> 03:01:22.580
<v Speaker 9>Like how many of those can you do?</v>

6585
03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:26.120
<v Speaker 9>Oh Damn.</v>

6586
03:01:27.350 --> 03:01:28.760
<v Speaker 9>He needs to not stay down here though.</v>

6587
03:01:28.940 --> 03:01:29.510
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>

6588
03:01:29.510 --> 03:01:30.880
<v Speaker 9>He just tossed back.</v>

6589
03:01:33.920 --> 03:01:34.400
<v Speaker 9>What happened?</v>

6590
03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:35.390
<v Speaker 9>I poked their something.</v>

6591
03:01:35.391 --> 03:01:36.830
<v Speaker 9>Something happened maybe.</v>

6592
03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:37.400
<v Speaker 9>Wow.</v>

6593
03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:38.181
<v Speaker 9>I love that show.</v>

6594
03:01:38.181 --> 03:01:39.560
<v Speaker 9>Respect in the middle of combat.</v>

6595
03:01:39.561 --> 03:01:40.490
<v Speaker 9>Those guys just hugged.</v>

6596
03:01:40.880 --> 03:01:42.140
<v Speaker 9>No one's even talking about it.</v>

6597
03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:45.711
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

6598
03:01:45.711 --> 03:01:46.221
<v Speaker 9>beautiful.</v>

6599
03:01:46.221 --> 03:01:47.770
<v Speaker 9>Jab and then switches.</v>

6600
03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:48.401
<v Speaker 9>Stance.</v>

6601
03:01:48.401 --> 03:01:49.234
<v Speaker 9>Got Angles,</v>

6602
03:01:49.370 --> 03:01:49.851
<v Speaker 9>dude.</v>

6603
03:01:49.851 --> 03:01:50.240
<v Speaker 9>He's,</v>

6604
03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:52.280
<v Speaker 9>he's very creative man.</v>

6605
03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:54.410
<v Speaker 9>Very creative.</v>

6606
03:01:54.411 --> 03:01:55.010
<v Speaker 9>Look at that.</v>

6607
03:01:55.010 --> 03:01:55.843
<v Speaker 9>Rack</v>

6608
03:01:56.790 --> 03:01:57.480
<v Speaker 9>them up though.</v>

6609
03:01:57.480 --> 03:01:58.313
<v Speaker 9>Stay on their bed.</v>

6610
03:01:59.710 --> 03:02:02.290
<v Speaker 9>How about keep holding on that leg and kicking the shit out of it,</v>

6611
03:02:05.900 --> 03:02:06.733
<v Speaker 9>dude.</v>

6612
03:02:12.740 --> 03:02:13.573
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6613
03:02:14.310 --> 03:02:15.960
<v Speaker 9>I think if Ben's going to try and win this,</v>

6614
03:02:15.961 --> 03:02:18.200
<v Speaker 9>he needs to go for singles and get them.</v>

6615
03:02:18.330 --> 03:02:20.230
<v Speaker 9>I liked that right hook to the buyer.</v>

6616
03:02:20.290 --> 03:02:23.820
<v Speaker 9>Then stepping in with that is he's landed that a lot,</v>

6617
03:02:23.821 --> 03:02:24.061
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

6618
03:02:24.061 --> 03:02:25.290
<v Speaker 9>That's a nasty shot.</v>

6619
03:02:26.660 --> 03:02:26.881
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

6620
03:02:26.881 --> 03:02:27.990
<v Speaker 9>That's a nasty shot,</v>

6621
03:02:27.991 --> 03:02:28.824
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

6622
03:02:29.100 --> 03:02:30.720
<v Speaker 9>You might be trying to set up the up top,</v>

6623
03:02:30.721 --> 03:02:31.230
<v Speaker 9>right.</v>

6624
03:02:31.230 --> 03:02:36.150
<v Speaker 9>Get a guy to get used to cover covering that because he expects it and then go</v>

6625
03:02:36.151 --> 03:02:36.984
<v Speaker 9>over the top.</v>

6626
03:02:37.230 --> 03:02:39.030
<v Speaker 9>I think that just a number head kick,</v>

6627
03:02:39.031 --> 03:02:40.860
<v Speaker 9>he keeps going low into the body.</v>

6628
03:02:41.730 --> 03:02:41.881
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

6629
03:02:41.881 --> 03:02:44.430
<v Speaker 9>he would think that he would have an advantage in speed,</v>

6630
03:02:44.580 --> 03:02:46.340
<v Speaker 9>but what he might have an advantage is,</v>

6631
03:02:46.341 --> 03:02:46.830
<v Speaker 9>is,</v>

6632
03:02:46.830 --> 03:02:47.730
<v Speaker 9>is pace.</v>

6633
03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:50.610
<v Speaker 9>The ability to keep that pace up for five rounds.</v>

6634
03:02:50.611 --> 03:02:52.140
<v Speaker 9>He's done that so many times.</v>

6635
03:02:52.290 --> 03:02:56.610
<v Speaker 9>Like Benson is a master at understanding his own limitations as far as like</v>

6636
03:02:56.611 --> 03:02:57.360
<v Speaker 9>cardio.</v>

6637
03:02:57.360 --> 03:02:59.550
<v Speaker 9>Like he keeps a solid fucking pace.</v>

6638
03:02:59.580 --> 03:03:01.230
<v Speaker 9>He knows exactly how to red line and,</v>

6639
03:03:01.370 --> 03:03:02.880
<v Speaker 9>and he could read it for five rounds.</v>

6640
03:03:02.881 --> 03:03:05.160
<v Speaker 9>He knows his body real well in wars,</v>

6641
03:03:05.490 --> 03:03:06.120
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

6642
03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:07.870
<v Speaker 9>let you think of those Frankie Edgar fight.</v>

6643
03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:11.010
<v Speaker 9>He's got some hard five round fights.</v>

6644
03:03:11.070 --> 03:03:11.903
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

6645
03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:13.920
<v Speaker 9>that's a huge advantage.</v>

6646
03:03:14.130 --> 03:03:16.530
<v Speaker 9>Especially knowing you've been there,</v>

6647
03:03:16.531 --> 03:03:16.771
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

6648
03:03:16.771 --> 03:03:19.320
<v Speaker 9>the territory as opposed to thatch.</v>

6649
03:03:19.350 --> 03:03:21.240
<v Speaker 9>I think that's his biggest advantage in this fight.</v>

6650
03:03:21.241 --> 03:03:22.590
<v Speaker 9>And I don't feel like he's using it.</v>

6651
03:03:23.260 --> 03:03:24.900
<v Speaker 9>We're going into round three now.</v>

6652
03:03:24.990 --> 03:03:25.410
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

6653
03:03:25.410 --> 03:03:26.243
<v Speaker 9>this is right when he,</v>

6654
03:03:26.510 --> 03:03:27.343
<v Speaker 9>if you know,</v>

6655
03:03:27.630 --> 03:03:29.760
<v Speaker 9>you gotta think John Crouch his coach,</v>

6656
03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:31.560
<v Speaker 9>one of the geniuses of MMA.</v>

6657
03:03:31.770 --> 03:03:33.010
<v Speaker 9>There's like a handful of geniuses.</v>

6658
03:03:33.090 --> 03:03:34.980
<v Speaker 9>It's like Matt Hume for Rasa hobbies.</v>

6659
03:03:34.981 --> 03:03:35.814
<v Speaker 9>One of my favorite,</v>

6660
03:03:36.030 --> 03:03:38.370
<v Speaker 9>Greg Jackson has a lot of knowledge.</v>

6661
03:03:38.580 --> 03:03:39.090
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

6662
03:03:39.090 --> 03:03:41.580
<v Speaker 9>Ricardo Laborio is a genius of MMA.</v>

6663
03:03:41.581 --> 03:03:42.181
<v Speaker 9>There's like these,</v>

6664
03:03:42.181 --> 03:03:45.540
<v Speaker 9>these are a few Maestros John Danaher does a few of them.</v>

6665
03:03:45.710 --> 03:03:46.830
<v Speaker 9>John Crouch is one of them.</v>

6666
03:03:46.950 --> 03:03:49.590
<v Speaker 9>So when you're agreeing to fight a kid like this,</v>

6667
03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:50.610
<v Speaker 9>he's not dumb.</v>

6668
03:03:50.790 --> 03:03:52.980
<v Speaker 9>He knows this kid's a fucking giant savage.</v>

6669
03:03:53.190 --> 03:03:53.560
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

6670
03:03:53.560 --> 03:03:57.890
<v Speaker 9>there's gotta be some thought to what the proper strategy is.</v>

6671
03:03:57.891 --> 03:03:58.610
<v Speaker 9>And</v>

6672
03:03:58.610 --> 03:03:59.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6673
03:03:59.541 --> 03:04:01.730
<v Speaker 3>the kid is good as anybody and you,</v>

6674
03:04:01.731 --> 03:04:03.500
<v Speaker 3>your thoughts are third round,</v>

6675
03:04:03.501 --> 03:04:03.891
<v Speaker 3>fourth round.</v>

6676
03:04:03.891 --> 03:04:04.724
<v Speaker 3>Fifth round.</v>

6677
03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:06.033
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6678
03:04:06.250 --> 03:04:07.041
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] coach.</v>

6679
03:04:07.041 --> 03:04:07.521
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying all right,</v>

6680
03:04:07.521 --> 03:04:08.650
<v Speaker 3>now let's start mixing it up.</v>

6681
03:04:08.670 --> 03:04:09.201
<v Speaker 3>Grappling,</v>

6682
03:04:09.201 --> 03:04:10.960
<v Speaker 3>go for shots where his ass out.</v>

6683
03:04:11.480 --> 03:04:13.130
<v Speaker 3>It was clearly lost two rounds though.</v>

6684
03:04:13.610 --> 03:04:14.001
<v Speaker 3>Clearly.</v>

6685
03:04:14.001 --> 03:04:14.840
<v Speaker 3>Most likely.</v>

6686
03:04:14.841 --> 03:04:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6687
03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:16.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean in Denver.</v>

6688
03:04:17.060 --> 03:04:19.940
<v Speaker 3>And he had double under hooks at one time when they were transitioning out,</v>

6689
03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:20.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6690
03:04:20.630 --> 03:04:23.930
<v Speaker 3>on a failed spin and he didn't even try to take him down.</v>

6691
03:04:23.970 --> 03:04:25.030
<v Speaker 3>I thought he would have tried to dump them.</v>

6692
03:04:25.830 --> 03:04:26.663
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6693
03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:28.760
<v Speaker 3>That's his hometown.</v>

6694
03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:30.420
<v Speaker 3>And he felt it and it went away.</v>

6695
03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:31.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6696
03:04:31.370 --> 03:04:33.020
<v Speaker 3>But there was like 17 seconds left.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6699
03:04:35.610 --> 03:04:36.350
<v Speaker 3>He went front,</v>

6700
03:04:36.350 --> 03:04:37.550
<v Speaker 3>like round kick to the head.</v>

6701
03:04:37.551 --> 03:04:38.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't see that that often.</v>

6702
03:04:38.691 --> 03:04:39.320
<v Speaker 3>No switch.</v>

6703
03:04:39.320 --> 03:04:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I bet you see some take downs.</v>

03:04:43.221 --> 03:04:44.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was his initial background.</v>

6708
03:04:46.250 --> 03:04:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Well the thing is is we've seen two takedowns both from thatch.</v>

6709

6711
03:04:53.391 --> 03:04:55.010

6787
03:06:58.291 --> 03:06:59.350
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at it now.</v>

6788
03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:00.131
<v Speaker 1>It's slowly.</v>

6789
03:07:00.131 --> 03:07:00.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6790
03:07:00.371 --> 03:07:02.940
<v Speaker 1>you know how it is if you're not really a grappler,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So even if you don't submit them,</v>

6794
03:07:10.421 --> 03:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>here we are on this fourth round.</v>

6802
03:07:19.500 --> 03:07:19.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6803

6807
03:07:26.341 --> 03:07:29.250
<v Speaker 1>You know how when you see a guy started to pull on the guy's neck and you see</v>

6808
03:07:29.251 --> 03:07:29.731
<v Speaker 1>the guy in there.</v>

6809
03:07:29.731 --> 03:07:30.750

<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>

6813
03:07:37.350 --> 03:07:42.300
<v Speaker 1>It's tough with the gloves man to submitted guy for even if was body triangle by</v>

6814
03:07:42.301 --> 03:07:43.620
<v Speaker 1>triangle do to flatten them out.</v>

6815
03:07:44.080 --> 03:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Softening up man.</v>

03:07:45.540 --> 03:07:46.890
<v Speaker 1>He's got a minute 18 to go.</v>

6817
03:07:46.891 --> 03:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>This fight could be over right fucking minute.</v>

6818
03:07:48.840 --> 03:07:50.640
<v Speaker 1>18 is a long time.</v>

6819
03:07:50.700 --> 03:07:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time dude on your back and his eye swollen.</v>

6820
03:07:54.200 --> 03:07:59.040
<v Speaker 1>We got a good job of defending this long that tells me he's probably not going</v>

6821
03:07:59.041 --> 03:07:59.430
<v Speaker 1>to get them.</v>

6822
03:07:59.430 --> 03:08:00.490
<v Speaker 1>This is exhausting.</v>

6823
03:08:00.500 --> 03:08:01.560
<v Speaker 1>No match.</v>

6824
03:08:01.740 --> 03:08:03.240
<v Speaker 1>He can be very exhausting,</v>

6825
03:08:03.241 --> 03:08:03.600
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

6826

03:08:14.101 --> 03:08:16.200
<v Speaker 1>All he has to do to survive can be resting right here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6836
03:08:16.610 --> 03:08:17.760
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take a lot out of that.</v>

6837
03:08:17.890 --> 03:08:21.150
<v Speaker 1>That just never not like diversity out of them.</v>

6838
03:08:21.151 --> 03:08:24.960
<v Speaker 1>You got to realize all that all fetches wins where first round Kaos that body</v>

<v Speaker 1>It looks like his right eye.</v>

6841
03:08:27.691 --> 03:08:28.800
<v Speaker 1>It looks like she's riding them.</v>

6842
03:08:28.801 --> 03:08:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Both of them.</v>

6843

6854
03:08:46.920 --> 03:08:47.850
<v Speaker 1>He had to go for something,</v>

6855
03:08:47.851 --> 03:08:48.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6856

6865
03:08:55.891 --> 03:08:56.724
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

6866
03:08:56.850 --> 03:08:57.683
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

6867
03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:02.770
<v Speaker 1>He just wants to stay away.</v>

6868
03:09:02.770 --> 03:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>You have that round to Ben,</v>

6869
03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6870
03:09:04.020 --> 03:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6871
03:09:04.350 --> 03:09:04.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6872
03:09:04.591 --> 03:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>He gets it.</v>

6873
03:09:04.920 --> 03:09:07.010
<v Speaker 1>He got a two to one going back and forth to two.</v>

6874
03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>One go on the fourth and the grappling.</v>

6875
03:09:08.401 --> 03:09:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Some established that he's super dominant on the ground.</v>

6876
03:09:11.010 --> 03:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why I lost that position because he went for the arm.</v>

6877
03:09:13.321 --> 03:09:13.560
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

6878
03:09:13.560 --> 03:09:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll say this.</v>

6879
03:09:14.250 --> 03:09:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Who is more tired?</v>

6880
03:09:15.720 --> 03:09:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Benson or thatch.</v>

6881
03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:18.353
<v Speaker 1>That statue.</v>

6882
03:09:18.740 --> 03:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying defending that easy day,</v>

6883
03:09:20.970 --> 03:09:22.220
<v Speaker 1>trying to attack the basket.</v>

6884
03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm easy day if you're not a black belt,</v>

6885
03:09:24.210 --> 03:09:25.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're a blue belt,</v>

6886
03:09:25.231 --> 03:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>

6887
03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I would say that just probably a blue belt on the ground,</v>

6888
03:09:28.470 --> 03:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>

6889
03:09:28.950 --> 03:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>The type for one big explosion was the arm.</v>

6890
03:09:31.350 --> 03:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Other than that was just control.</v>

6891
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:33.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6892
03:09:33.271 --> 03:09:36.360
<v Speaker 1>when he's tight and when he's under the armpit and he's across the neck,</v>

6893
03:09:36.361 --> 03:09:37.470
<v Speaker 1>there was no commitment.</v>

6894
03:09:37.530 --> 03:09:40.170
<v Speaker 1>There was no real crazy day in the squeeze.</v>

6895
03:09:40.200 --> 03:09:40.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6896
03:09:40.351 --> 03:09:41.071
<v Speaker 1>but there's no luck.</v>

6897
03:09:41.071 --> 03:09:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Crazy like go,</v>

6898
03:09:41.820 --> 03:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you know the go for a guillotine.</v>

6899
03:09:43.500 --> 03:09:44.071
<v Speaker 1>Hail Mary.</v>

6900
03:09:44.071 --> 03:09:44.904
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work.</v>

6901
03:09:44.960 --> 03:09:46.290
<v Speaker 1>The guys arms cash out.</v>

6902
03:09:46.490 --> 03:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't none of that.</v>

6903
03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>There was an explosion to get to spider web,</v>

6904
03:09:50.191 --> 03:09:52.980
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that was one big burst.</v>

6905
03:09:53.020 --> 03:09:53.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6906
03:09:54.130 --> 03:09:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Other than that it was statue eight more energy because that's what's trying to</v>

6907
03:09:57.521 --> 03:09:58.900
<v Speaker 1>keep that guy off his neck.</v>

6908
03:09:59.050 --> 03:10:00.160
<v Speaker 1>He was uncomfortable.</v>

6909
03:10:00.161 --> 03:10:05.161
<v Speaker 1>He's got fuck in my hometown and getting choked Roald Dahl shores flat out with</v>

6910
03:10:05.681 --> 03:10:06.960
<v Speaker 1>a body triangle on its back.</v>

6911
03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Shit got real.</v>

6912
03:10:10.240 --> 03:10:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Both eyes are all swollen and shit.</v>

6913
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:14.500
<v Speaker 1>His braids all fucked up out the back.</v>

6914
03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:17.110
<v Speaker 1>He didn't fix his ponytail.</v>

6915
03:10:18.850 --> 03:10:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I shoot for that single leg if I'm Ben.</v>

6916
03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6917
03:10:23.980 --> 03:10:24.813
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

6918
03:10:24.850 --> 03:10:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Now he's thinking about to maybe mix up.</v>

6919
03:10:26.501 --> 03:10:28.090
<v Speaker 1>You shoot and hit him with a right hand.</v>

6920
03:10:28.190 --> 03:10:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6921
03:10:28.430 --> 03:10:31.780
<v Speaker 1>he also knows that he can dominate him on do it.</v>

6922
03:10:32.200 --> 03:10:32.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6923
03:10:32.471 --> 03:10:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just a fact of standing up so high.</v>

6924
03:10:34.391 --> 03:10:34.691
<v Speaker 1>It's still,</v>

6925
03:10:34.691 --> 03:10:38.560
<v Speaker 1>he's still got that high kick boxer stance and that was the reason he got</v>

6926
03:10:38.561 --> 03:10:42.040
<v Speaker 1>impatient in that scramble and wasn't smart defensively.</v>

6927
03:10:42.041 --> 03:10:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Wanted to just get back up to his feet instead of like minus p's and q's and</v>

6928
03:10:46.361 --> 03:10:48.550
<v Speaker 1>recognizing he's in a bad spot and that,</v>

6929
03:10:48.610 --> 03:10:48.940
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

6930
03:10:48.940 --> 03:10:50.140
<v Speaker 1>that recklessness,</v>

6931
03:10:50.260 --> 03:10:53.380
<v Speaker 1>carelessness and trying to get back up to his feet is where it gave us back.</v>

6932
03:10:53.381 --> 03:10:55.060
<v Speaker 1>That comes in grappling experience.</v>

6933
03:10:55.360 --> 03:10:56.590
<v Speaker 1>That's just not his background.</v>

6934
03:10:56.591 --> 03:10:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

6935
03:10:56.920 --> 03:10:58.190
<v Speaker 1>He just wants to get the fuck out of there.</v>

6936
03:10:58.191 --> 03:10:58.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

6937
03:10:58.600 --> 03:10:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to stay in this spot.</v>

6938
03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

6939
03:11:00.220 --> 03:11:01.150
<v Speaker 1>But in doing so,</v>

6940
03:11:01.151 --> 03:11:02.950
<v Speaker 1>he got to a way worst spot,</v>

6941
03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:03.821
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

6942
03:11:03.821 --> 03:11:04.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6943
03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:05.710
<v Speaker 1>really the essence of Jujitsu,</v>

6944
03:11:05.711 --> 03:11:06.070
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6945
03:11:06.070 --> 03:11:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Capitalizing on mistakes.</v>

6946
03:11:07.241 --> 03:11:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Even if that's loses this fight,</v>

6947
03:11:08.711 --> 03:11:11.860
<v Speaker 1>he's going to learn so much from this fight that's going to help him in the</v>

6948
03:11:11.861 --> 03:11:12.490
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

6949
03:11:12.490 --> 03:11:14.020
<v Speaker 1>This is because he's never fought a really,</v>

6950
03:11:14.021 --> 03:11:16.000
<v Speaker 1>really good grappler like crazy.</v>

6951
03:11:16.001 --> 03:11:19.060
<v Speaker 1>He's gone into deep waters with a world champion.</v>

6952
03:11:19.140 --> 03:11:21.100
<v Speaker 1>This is the best thing for Thatcher's career to ever happen.</v>

6953
03:11:21.130 --> 03:11:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Winter loose.</v>

6954
03:11:21.700 --> 03:11:21.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6955
03:11:21.971 --> 03:11:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you 100% and it's a smart way to do it too.</v>

6956
03:11:25.181 --> 03:11:27.880
<v Speaker 1>To go on a world champion coming up from a lower weight class.</v>

6957
03:11:27.881 --> 03:11:29.530
<v Speaker 1>So you have some advantages going in.</v>

6958
03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:30.581
<v Speaker 1>There you go,</v>

6959
03:11:30.581 --> 03:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Ben.</v>

6960
03:11:31.170 --> 03:11:31.330
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6961
03:11:31.330 --> 03:11:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Keep that hat on the inside.</v>

6962
03:11:32.490 --> 03:11:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Not going to happen either way.</v>

6963
03:11:34.421 --> 03:11:34.990
<v Speaker 1>This is wearing,</v>

6964
03:11:34.990 --> 03:11:35.471
<v Speaker 1>that's out.</v>

6965
03:11:35.471 --> 03:11:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I like this sprawl dude.</v>

6966
03:11:36.740 --> 03:11:37.573
<v Speaker 1>Sprawl</v>

6967
03:11:39.280 --> 03:11:40.130
<v Speaker 1>come up with a flat.</v>

6968
03:11:40.210 --> 03:11:40.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6969
03:11:40.451 --> 03:11:43.270
<v Speaker 1>let's make them defend and then go after it again.</v>

6970
03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6971
03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6972
03:11:44.230 --> 03:11:47.960
<v Speaker 1>He's throwing his striking off with those take down a sloth that just becoming</v>

6973
03:11:48.030 --> 03:11:51.760
<v Speaker 1>as stances like he stands so tall.</v>

6974
03:11:51.790 --> 03:11:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Nice knee to begin with.</v>

6975
03:11:54.930 --> 03:11:55.520
<v Speaker 1>This flow,</v>

6976
03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>that right hand to the body.</v>

6977
03:11:56.650 --> 03:11:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

6978
03:11:57.310 --> 03:11:59.950
<v Speaker 1>this plan only works if Ben's Cardio's on point.</v>

6979
03:12:00.220 --> 03:12:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Well it's most likely will be to me it looks like,</v>

6980
03:12:04.031 --> 03:12:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys are,</v>

6981
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:09.600
<v Speaker 1>it looks like fat just as fine and he's coming forward and he's,</v>

6982
03:12:09.820 --> 03:12:11.020
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely not the same fighter.</v>

6983
03:12:11.021 --> 03:12:15.220
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't the first two rounds but the fifth round at altitude you're in Denver</v>

6984
03:12:15.221 --> 03:12:15.850
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

6985
03:12:15.850 --> 03:12:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about it,</v>

6986
03:12:16.810 --> 03:12:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but that's what that's going to last year and the fifth round is going to be</v>

6987
03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:22.630
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>

6988
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Mental drains it out to two shows in our results of Ben's career was spent in</v>

6989
03:12:28.151 --> 03:12:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>

6990
03:12:28.810 --> 03:12:30.190
<v Speaker 1>John Crouch started in Denver,</v>

6991
03:12:30.370 --> 03:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>so this is nothing new to Ben.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But still I don't like just being on top man.</v>

7019

<v Speaker 3>Let's not do that.</v>

7029
03:13:40.130 --> 03:13:41.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a natural thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

7037
03:13:51.201 --> 03:13:51.431
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

7038
03:13:51.431 --> 03:13:53.100
<v Speaker 3>if you're training when the wild though,</v>

7039
03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.230
<v Speaker 3>this is the world of Benson Henderson right here.</v>

7040
03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:01.940
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

7041
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:06.170
<v Speaker 3>he got this shit</v>

7042
03:14:11.290 --> 03:14:12.123
<v Speaker 3>in</v>

7043
03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:17.520
<v Speaker 3>his mouth.</v>

7044
03:14:21.170 --> 03:14:22.160
<v Speaker 3>He fixed it in the last,</v>

7045
03:14:22.310 --> 03:14:24.710
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

7046
03:14:24.711 --> 03:14:24.981
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

7047
03:14:24.981 --> 03:14:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I pulled a tooth pick out of his mouth right after he tapped,</v>

7048
03:14:28.131 --> 03:14:29.630
<v Speaker 3>gets so fucked up.</v>

7049
03:14:29.660 --> 03:14:31.130
<v Speaker 3>You know he's gonna get in trouble for that.</v>

7050
03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:33.440
<v Speaker 3>They told them not to do that anymore.</v>

7051
03:14:34.220 --> 03:14:35.053
<v Speaker 3>No contest.</v>

7052
03:14:35.600 --> 03:14:36.650
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>

7053
03:14:36.651 --> 03:14:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Fight to the fucking toothpick in his mouth.</v>

7054
03:14:39.220 --> 03:14:40.190
<v Speaker 3>It gets suspended.</v>

7055
03:14:40.460 --> 03:14:41.360
<v Speaker 3>He just fought Brent.</v>

7056
03:14:41.390 --> 03:14:42.770
<v Speaker 3>That's some Charles Bronson ship.</v>

7057
03:14:42.920 --> 03:14:45.260
<v Speaker 3>He just fought Brendan Dash with a toothpick in it.</v>

7058
03:14:46.120 --> 03:14:46.953
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

7059
03:14:51.310 --> 03:14:51.850
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

7060
03:14:51.850 --> 03:14:54.540
<v Speaker 3>this is improved bigger Henderson fan now what?</v>

7061
03:14:54.570 --> 03:14:55.403
<v Speaker 3>Because nope,</v>

7062
03:14:55.880 --> 03:14:57.620
<v Speaker 3>that too for taking us in July.</v>

7063
03:14:57.650 --> 03:14:58.280
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

7064
03:14:58.280 --> 03:14:59.113
<v Speaker 3>that was awesome.</v>

7065
03:14:59.770 --> 03:15:00.411
<v Speaker 3>He didn't shoot.</v>

7066
03:15:00.411 --> 03:15:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Look how he finished it.</v>

7067
03:15:01.280 --> 03:15:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Look at the way you finished it.</v>

7068
03:15:02.390 --> 03:15:05.150
<v Speaker 3>You just see sort of,</v>

7069
03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:07.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's kind of like this,</v>

7070
03:15:07.430 --> 03:15:07.941
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

7071
03:15:07.941 --> 03:15:08.270
<v Speaker 3>domain.</v>

7072
03:15:08.270 --> 03:15:08.781
<v Speaker 3>Either way.</v>

7073
03:15:08.781 --> 03:15:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Brandon's gonna learn a ton from this.</v>

7074
03:15:10.521 --> 03:15:11.600
<v Speaker 3>This is best case scenario.</v>

7075
03:15:11.730 --> 03:15:12.920
<v Speaker 3>He wins either way,</v>

7076
03:15:14.090 --> 03:15:15.260
<v Speaker 3>it goes up to one set.</v>

7077
03:15:15.260 --> 03:15:17.480
<v Speaker 3>Dan Severn isn't just about,</v>

7078
03:15:17.620 --> 03:15:19.910
<v Speaker 3>he's what with the legs are doing.</v>

7079
03:15:20.790 --> 03:15:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Squeeze that down.</v>

7080
03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:23.780
<v Speaker 3>It's a oxymoron.</v>

7081
03:15:23.781 --> 03:15:24.614
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

7082
03:15:25.720 --> 03:15:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Dan's fancy.</v>

7083
03:15:26.861 --> 03:15:28.450
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

7084
03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:29.240
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

7085
03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:30.440
<v Speaker 3>he's world class man.</v>

7086
03:15:30.441 --> 03:15:31.071
<v Speaker 3>He's world class.</v>

7087
03:15:31.071 --> 03:15:32.090
<v Speaker 3>He fucked up that tooth.</v>

7088
03:15:32.100 --> 03:15:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Picto dude did.</v>

7089
03:15:33.061 --> 03:15:34.580
<v Speaker 3>She can't keep doing that man.</v>

7090
03:15:34.910 --> 03:15:35.743
<v Speaker 3>Can't keep doing that</v>

7091
03:15:37.850 --> 03:15:38.683
<v Speaker 3>fat</v>

7092
03:15:40.340 --> 03:15:41.000
<v Speaker 3>head kicked.</v>

7093
03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:41.721
<v Speaker 3>It's not the problem.</v>

7094
03:15:41.721 --> 03:15:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Like the athletic commissions can get in trouble if it turns out that toothpick</v>

7095
03:15:44.871 --> 03:15:47.630
<v Speaker 3>comes out and poke somebody in the eye and some strange world.</v>

7096
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:48.920
<v Speaker 3>We're Benson's on top,</v>

7097
03:15:48.990 --> 03:15:52.410
<v Speaker 3>he gets hit with an upkick pick comes down,</v>

7098
03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:54.230
<v Speaker 3>goes into the guy's eyeball.</v>

7099
03:15:55.310 --> 03:15:58.420
<v Speaker 3>The Guy who's doing pds fight in an APP to fight.</v>

7100
03:15:58.421 --> 03:15:58.611
<v Speaker 3>Be Like,</v>

7101
03:15:58.611 --> 03:15:58.741
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

7102
03:15:58.741 --> 03:16:00.230
<v Speaker 3>he was on beat was on,</v>

7103
03:16:00.310 --> 03:16:01.143
<v Speaker 3>on the podcast.</v>

7104
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:02.880
<v Speaker 3>It's called hold on.</v>

7105
03:16:02.881 --> 03:16:03.211
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

7106
03:16:03.211 --> 03:16:04.200
<v Speaker 3>is that what happened?</v>

7107
03:16:04.620 --> 03:16:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Did they know the test results before the fight?</v>

7108
03:16:08.100 --> 03:16:09.020
<v Speaker 3>They knew about uh,</v>

7109
03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:09.953
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones,</v>

7110
03:16:10.020 --> 03:16:10.950
<v Speaker 3>but that's coke.</v>

7111
03:16:12.060 --> 03:16:12.630
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

7112
03:16:12.630 --> 03:16:14.580
<v Speaker 3>Still petition.</v>

7113
03:16:14.640 --> 03:16:16.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not a performance enhancing drug.</v>

7114
03:16:16.530 --> 03:16:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I think if they knew that Anderson tested positive before,</v>

7115
03:16:19.891 --> 03:16:22.290
<v Speaker 3>it's way more damning than if they knew that John Jones did.</v>

7116
03:16:22.470 --> 03:16:23.310
<v Speaker 3>They knew that Jon Jones,</v>

7117
03:16:23.320 --> 03:16:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Johns Johns is doing something that's going to ruin the chances.</v>

7118
03:16:25.980 --> 03:16:27.300
<v Speaker 3>What about if you're doing coke?</v>

7119
03:16:27.330 --> 03:16:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Could just study youtube videos.</v>

03:16:53.650 --> 03:16:54.483
<v Speaker 3>The toothpick.</v>

7135
03:16:54.540 --> 03:16:55.171
<v Speaker 3>That is good.</v>

7136
03:16:55.171 --> 03:16:56.004
<v Speaker 3>But God damn old,</v>

7138
03:16:56.790 --> 03:16:58.590
<v Speaker 3>he can't fight with the fucking toothpick in your mouth.</v>

7139
03:16:58.980 --> 03:16:59.813
<v Speaker 3>You just can't.</v>

7140
03:16:59.820 --> 03:17:03.360
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy when when he stepped out and then pull the toothpick,</v>

7141
03:17:03.390 --> 03:17:04.530
<v Speaker 3>he's like flaunting it.</v>

7142
03:17:05.040 --> 03:17:05.671
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>

7143
03:17:05.671 --> 03:17:06.504
<v Speaker 3>He steps out.</v>

7144
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:11.630
<v Speaker 3>He's got the to pick out right away cause he's like Scott and rock dude that,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so he had a</v>

7146
03:17:17.820 --> 03:17:21.780
<v Speaker 3>toothpick in his mouth when pet his head kicked him and dropped a and that was</v>

7147
03:17:21.781 --> 03:17:22.890
<v Speaker 3>the side that he tucks it.</v>

7148
03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I think we'd more dangerous for himself.</v>

7149
03:17:25.441 --> 03:17:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

7150
03:17:26.050 --> 03:17:27.240
<v Speaker 3>It's very dangerous for him.</v>

7151
03:17:27.840 --> 03:17:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Choke on toothpicks,</v>

7152

7156
03:17:37.680 --> 03:17:38.760
<v Speaker 3>He's got a weird way.</v>

7157
03:17:39.870 --> 03:17:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Just get a weird way of talking to that thing in his mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That was a huge victory.</v>

7165
03:18:22.350 --> 03:18:24.190
<v Speaker 3>He essentially fought your game plan.</v>

7166
03:18:24.191 --> 03:18:25.680
<v Speaker 3>What you thought he should do that?</v>

7167
03:18:25.770 --> 03:18:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really what he did.</v>

7168
03:18:27.570 --> 03:18:32.050
<v Speaker 3>He hung with them on the feet for the first round last probably the first and</v>

7169
03:18:32.051 --> 03:18:34.780
<v Speaker 3>second round and then took them into some deep water.</v>

03:18:49.460 --> 03:18:50.293
<v Speaker 2>Type movie.</v>
