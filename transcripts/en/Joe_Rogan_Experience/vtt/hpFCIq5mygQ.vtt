00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.763
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you are in this,</v>

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>this position now with this film coming out to help a lot of people.</v>

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I think this film is not just going to tell your story and in an open up a lot</v>

5
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>of people's eyes as to,</v>

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.913
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>The AOL situation on it,</v>

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of people,</v>

9
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:23.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>you're such a powerful guy that I'm it from them.</v>

11
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

12
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you are.</v>

13
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

14
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

15
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.751
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

16
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:32.751
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't know how to find me or they will find me and I'll do what I can.</v>

17
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>some I give everybody as much of a chance as I can.</v>

19
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a line of what's sold to abuse survivors that I think is horse shit and</v>

21
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>that's basically they get quote unquote empowered.</v>

22
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>And I hate that word because it takes the strength of the word power.</v>

23
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>What's what sounds more like power power or empowered empires like sandy making</v>

24
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>wear birkenstocks or something,</v>

25
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:00.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

27
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not that big on empowered,</v>

28
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.853
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

29
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>like I did a,</v>

30
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.100
<v Speaker 1>my friend Sam,</v>

31
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a podcast a couple weeks back and he said,</v>

32
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give away with the movies.</v>

33
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:13.651
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

34
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:14.281
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

35
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not that kind of movie.</v>

36
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>And it hinges largely on the fact that I survived raped as a child.</v>

37
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:19.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

39
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I heard from several people said,</v>

40
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>you really should have had a trigger warning on there.</v>

42
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

43
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do you shake?</v>

44
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:30.651
<v Speaker 1>I was doing what the fuck do you think I was doing when I said it hinges largely</v>

45
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I was warning you that what it was about right there,</v>

46
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but someone has empowered you to,</v>

47
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.550
<v Speaker 1>to have a way to take issue with me because I'm not completely basing I,</v>

48
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>the whole world isn't based around me.</v>

50
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Even though I got raped when I was four years old.</v>

51
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Everybody shouldn't be thinking in terms of that all the time because they'd</v>

52
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>been through their own shit and they're dealing with their own shit and they're</v>

53
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>trying to survive.</v>

54
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>So if I could make them more sensitive to this issue,</v>

55
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>if I can show them that it matters to them that they deal with other people who</v>

56
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>have been through this kind of trauma and we want to reduce it as much as</v>

57
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>absolutely possible.</v>

58
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.853
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

59
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>But after that,</v>

60
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to find a way to set up a situation where I'm always the injured</v>

61
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>party and that prove again and again that I'm persecuted and no one's thinking</v>

62
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>in terms of me that I'm never going to get fucking healed.</v>

63
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to get fucking healed.</v>

64
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>So one I did was I went out and I try to help other people.</v>

65
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>When I help other people.</v>

66
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I realized how far along I've come and I realized there's really something in it</v>

67
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>for me to do that.</v>

68
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like I'm this altruistic guy.</v>

69
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm saving my own life.</v>

70
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:35.241
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

71
00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>like that aol investigation that took such courage to do it,</v>

72
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>know what would have taken courage was turning my back on those kids and walking</v>

73
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>away going like,</v>

74
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.081
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

75
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know what's going on in there.</v>

76
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

77
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>How would I live with that guy?</v>

78
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>How would I live with myself then?</v>

79
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

80
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:50.581
<v Speaker 1>like I is nice.</v>

82
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Everyone said,</v>

83
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.751
<v Speaker 1>Oh gee,</v>

84
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>that what he went through when he was doing that investigation.</v>

85
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>What about the kids in the fucking pictures?</v>

86
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want everyone to know about.</v>

87
00:02:58.021 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for caring me,</v>

88
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's the kids in the pictures I give a shit about.</v>

89
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>It's the kids that are suffering right now somewhere within the sound of my</v>

90
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

91
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Someone in this broadcast like where this is on,</v>

92
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.620
<v Speaker 1>someone in the next apartment or wherever some kid is going through this shit,</v>

93
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>have the courage to know about it.</v>

94
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>That's all I asked.</v>

95
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>You have the courage to know about it and save the contemporary children so you</v>

96
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:29.491
<v Speaker 1>don't have to deal with a bunch of fucking maniac abuse survivors up and anybody</v>

97
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>can diffuse the term soundscape.</v>

98
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Guys coming in now,</v>

99
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>if anybody can diffuse the term trigger warning,</v>

100
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>you're the fucking guy.</v>

101
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

102
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Christ,</v>

103
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.920
<v Speaker 1>stop [inaudible].</v>

104
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>We're going to develop a nation of permanent children.</v>

105
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Like if anybody can tell their story and doesn't need a fucking trigger warning,</v>

106
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:52.950
<v Speaker 1>it's you in this.</v>

107
00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:53.621
<v Speaker 1>This idea.</v>

108
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

109
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't need trigger warnings.</v>

110
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to show me something,</v>

111
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 1>show me something and if I don't want to see it,</v>

112
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.170
<v Speaker 1>let me know what it is before you show me,</v>

113
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>tell me what the.</v>

114
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.890
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

115
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 1>the documentary was about.</v>

116
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.970
<v Speaker 1>No need a goddamn triggered.</v>

117
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>This fucking term is disgusting.</v>

118
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a disgusting tournament.</v>

119
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Does damage.</v>

120
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>It just sets people up to stay in the pit,</v>

121
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.733
<v Speaker 1>to wallow.</v>

123
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>It's empowering them to wallow like we'll I've got hurt again because the whole</v>

124
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.220
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

125
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

126
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>sorry about that shit man,</v>

127
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you what,</v>

128
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I know you're in a pit of your own shit.</v>

129
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I know you're used to the temperature and the smell of it doesn't mean you're</v>

130
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>used to that and it doesn't bother you that much anymore,</v>

131
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>but when you stand up and they fucking hose you off and then you'd go in the</v>

132
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 1>house and take a real shower and put on some clean clothes,</v>

133
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to believe how much better you feel,</v>

134
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>so stop letting other people tell you that you have to expect the world to do</v>

135
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>the impossible and that's be the like telepathic about what the fuck you've been</v>

136
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

137
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Get to the point where you can stand up and tell them the story yourself when</v>

138
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>it's appropriate and don't put up with anybody who is truly being insensitive or</v>

139
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 1>snickering about any of this shit.</v>

140
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.781
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

141
00:04:58.781 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>People who tell me,</v>

142
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.640
<v Speaker 1>people walk up to me all the time and tell me like,</v>

143
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

144
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:02.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:03.990
<v Speaker 1>the good thing is those guys get arrested.</v>

146
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I am Bobo like you're endorsing rape to me.</v>

147
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking endorsing rape to me,</v>

148
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

149
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anyone raped,</v>

150
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:12.251
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

151
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Not even rapist.</v>

152
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Rape is illegal.</v>

153
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>How about making jails lawful places?</v>

154
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.531
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

155
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>For an idea,</v>

156
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 1>how about someone going to jail and realizing the law protects me sometime I'm</v>

157
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:23.321
<v Speaker 1>not going to be raped,</v>

158
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be menaced here.</v>

159
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to admit and maybe dale will start thinking about getting reformed,</v>

160
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>but Jesus Christ don't joke to me about right.</v>

161
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me you want them all killed and sweep them under that rug because I</v>

162
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>was born without blood on my hands.</v>

163
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking blood on my hands now man,</v>

164
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.470
<v Speaker 1>so don't guess these stupid ass fucking lightweight things and presume I'm going</v>

165
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 1>to sign off on them because I don't ever want anyone else ever raped and if it</v>

166
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

167
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>even if it's elbow rapist,</v>

168
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm opposed to it and I don't want them fucking killed either.</v>

169
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Now I want them to live with what they did.</v>

170
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a difficult.</v>

171
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>This is difficult thought and it's a difficult subject,</v>

172
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>but did you,</v>

173
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>after this is all said and done,</v>

174
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>are horrendous moment in your life,</v>

175
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>many moments in your life.</v>

176
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Did you try to figure out what would create a person like the guy who did that</v>

177
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:16.770
<v Speaker 1>to you?</v>

178
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you try how much time?</v>

179
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

180
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>and I can tell you what created him.</v>

181
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>He was taken out of an abusive home.</v>

182
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.080
<v Speaker 1>He was put into foster care and abused many more times and he was gone and he</v>

183
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:30.850
<v Speaker 1>was gone.</v>

184
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.850
<v Speaker 1>He was gone and he was succumbed by the agony I was put through by him.</v>

185
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I survived.</v>

186
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Somehow I made it so call me lucky.</v>

187
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:41.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

188
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't become him.</v>

189
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't become what I resisted.</v>

190
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:44.354
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

191
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I didn't pass along the poison.</v>

192
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I didn't in some ways when I was difficult or whatever,</v>

193
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 1>but mostly I didn't.</v>

194
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Mostly when I'm mad I'm mad because it's like Hendrick's a cry of love.</v>

195
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a cry of love that I make.</v>

196
00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a cry of love.</v>

197
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 1>My Act has been a cry of Levis.</v>

198
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want the innocent hurt anymore.</v>

199
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:08.381
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people victimized because of greed and cowardice and bullshit,</v>

200
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that and so I,</v>

202
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I do what I can to stand up to it.</v>

203
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 1>To.</v>

204
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Were there moments where you wanted to talk to him?</v>

205
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to talk to them?</v>

206
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I would love to talk to him to show him that I didn't become a monster like he</v>

207
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:21.870
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

208
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I W I would have.</v>

209
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I would have almost become an advocate for him in the sense that like,</v>

210
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:26.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

211
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe let me know if they're mistreating you in here,</v>

212
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but he died in prison.</v>

213
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:33.430
<v Speaker 1>No one claimed his body and I don't know where his grave is.</v>

214
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>If I knew her as grave as I go,</v>

215
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>put fucking flowers,</v>

216
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>not for him.</v>

217
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.303
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

218
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>the idea that someone could do that after someone did that to them seems</v>

219
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 1>insanely counterintuitive.</v>

220
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like if someone's.</v>

221
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that saves you but really saves you really is redemptive in</v>

222
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>really saves you to me</v>

223
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.960
<v Speaker 1>was one of the things that you covered in the film that I thought was really a</v>

224
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>very powerful moment where you talked about this thing that you didn't become</v>

225
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

226
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>that you maybe if your sister didn't come down there and Kevin Den,</v>

227
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you could have been dead.</v>

228
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.251
<v Speaker 1>It was close,</v>

229
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:10.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

230
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.350
<v Speaker 1>It was closed,</v>

231
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 1>but do you also that you could have been one of them?</v>

232
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:14.790
<v Speaker 1>You could have been someone who would.</v>

233
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Would be worse than death.</v>

234
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:17.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be a victim of thousand times on the perpetrator wants and that's not</v>

236
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>any bull shoe.</v>

237
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Contemplate the mechanism.</v>

238
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Did you try,</v>

239
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 1>have you tried to understand the mechanism that turns an abused person into an</v>

240
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:29.780
<v Speaker 1>abuser?</v>

241
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:29.941
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

242
00:08:29.941 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

243
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

244
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

245
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm as nuts and bolts because I listened to you and I know how</v>

246
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 1>much like how,</v>

247
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>what detail you go into.</v>

248
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So I understand how,</v>

249
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>how on what you're asking,</v>

250
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>but I can't be.</v>

251
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 1>There's enough of me that's been through enough that I can't be quite as</v>

252
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 1>thorough as you're asking me to be.</v>

253
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 1>To answer that.</v>

254
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I get as close as I can and I understand what happened.</v>

255
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 1>But then after point I,</v>

256
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.843
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

257
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not one of them and I can't go far enough to say,</v>

258
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 1>well then of course if you get past this point right here,</v>

259
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 1>then obviously this is that I can't do that.</v>

260
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It's that,</v>

261
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 1>that is what is too much for me.</v>

262
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.513
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

263
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons I was interested in making the movie was when,</v>

264
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.470
<v Speaker 1>when Barry,</v>

265
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:09:19.761 --> 00:09:21.680
<v Speaker 2>told me that the guy had died in prison.</v>

267
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.011
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

268
00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:23.000
<v Speaker 2>how that make you feel,</v>

269
00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:23.760
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

270
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.300
<v Speaker 2>he said it made me sad and I said,</v>

271
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.800
<v Speaker 2>because you didn't get any closure,</v>

272
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.270
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get to confront him.</v>

274
00:09:29.271 --> 00:09:29.751
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

275
00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:30.021
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

276
00:09:30.021 --> 00:09:30.890
<v Speaker 2>he died alone.</v>

277
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.703
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

278
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I was really blown away by that and I thought</v>

279
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I should really make a movie about this.</v>

280
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

281
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I thought that I thought,</v>

282
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

283
00:09:43.091 --> 00:09:43.780
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

284
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.130
