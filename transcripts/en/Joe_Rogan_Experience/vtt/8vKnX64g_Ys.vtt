1
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.140
What the fuck,
Andy Dick.
I brought my pussy.

2
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
Andy Dick has joined us.

3
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.010
Thanks so excited.
God Damn people.
The anticipation,

4
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.800
the buildup.
It's not my pussy.
It's the guy.
It's the guy who lives here.

5
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.060
It's a cat pussy cat guy.

6
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.540
It's this guy right here and he has to go there right away.

7
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.090
Just to make everybody feel comfortable to go to some dark places.

8
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.943
Put them at ease.

9
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.290
Immediately put everybody on edge.
Whoa.
Let's put at mitigates.

10
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.800
I feel like at that puts them at ease.
Talking about your pussy.
Yeah.

11
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.670
Or just being,
just being good old.
Landy.
It's me.
Get on the NTT.

12
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.520
It's good to see you,
man.
I haven't seen you in forever.
It's been years.
Well,

13
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:34.170
I ran into you at Improv,
right?
No,
I think,
well maybe I don't remember that.

14
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.740
Maybe I was drinking.
I remember running into you at um,
can't done that.

15
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.620
Cancer's Jerry's Deli.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I wouldn't know.
Was that,
you know,

16
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.880
it wasn't your girlfriend.
Don't know.
We ran into the,

17
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.660
I ran to you there when you were a couple of years ago.
Yeah.
You were with your,

18
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.640
I guess now why?
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
and then I ran into you,

19
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.490
I think more recently though was the Improv because there's a picture of it on

20
00:01:56.491 --> 00:02:00.920
my website.
I have a picture too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dave Foley on,
that's the pot.

21
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.160
That's the fleshlight.
Oh,
it's a flashlight.
Flashlight.
That's something you fuck.

22
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.240
Oh,
are you serious?
Ah,
you skied dot Andy.

23
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:12.210
Dick Barnes sober.

24
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.660
Andy's a totally different animal to him open now,
so I'm not,
yeah,

25
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:19.800
so I shouldn't,
sorry,
sponsor.
Oh,
so I need to hear no,
no.

26
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.790
Half for riser right here behind the flashlight before you're talking nightlight

27
00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:28.900
too.
If I am completely sober right now,
just so you know.
Yeah.

28
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.770
For how long,
you know,
it's only been,

29
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.910
I think it's creeping up on three months now,
which is,
but that's a long,

30
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.630
even a week for me.
No,
but not in that way.

31
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:43.440
But after a week I feel great.
And then another week I feel better.

32
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.310
And how long has it been since you've like cut everything out,

33
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.980
even just for a day or two?
I do it all the time.
Yeah.

34
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:52.530
You just smoke all the time?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's not what I mean.

35
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.380
Start off all the time.
You need to,
yeah,

36
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:58.160
I don't symptoms then I'll smoke pot for a week,
a week or two.
Oh okay.

37
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.980
So especially if I'm not performing because I'm

38
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.490
<v 2>not performing and I'm not writing.
Sometimes I just don't feel the need to know.</v>

39
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.170
I use it as a tool.
I use weed especially as a tool.

40
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.210
That's what I was trying to tell you back in the news radio days,

41
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.620
giving off mixed signals fellow.
Well you were giving off very,
very,

42
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:21.400
very strong signals that we're right on the money.

43
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.920
You would just scream in front of network executives.
You fucking freak.

44
00:03:25.921 --> 00:03:30.921
You're high right now when we would call me problems because we would try to do

45
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:34.680
a scene and we couldn't do the scene cause Andy literally couldn't do it cause I

46
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.490
was,
oh what are we doing here?
I was like Andy,

47
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:41.960
we have to go home.
Okay we've been here all day rehearsing.

48
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.980
We got to do this fucking scene and your big to the hills to the hills.

49
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.100
We would have fun and you know,

50
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.850
I would improvise a lot and now you see now you can't,
you can't get,

51
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.580
you can't get high and do rehearsals.
That's the problem.

52
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.450
You can't get high when you're waiting on other people.
I don't know.

53
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.360
We'll talk about that.
Well,
I mean I think it's just,

54
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:06.500
it's disrespectful to the people you work in with.
Oh,

55
00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:08.650
you're high right now and you're working with me.

56
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.500
So not the same thing because I'm not doing something where I have to remember

57
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:15.400
and recall things and do things in a certain order.
I always,
I was always good.

58
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:18.690
I can always remember my lines and I was always riding,
curling.

59
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.550
I was really professionally,
I don't know if you remember,

60
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.210
sometimes you weren't and a lot of times you and Paul Simms would would call me

61
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:29.800
out and you know,
it wasn't high.
That's possible.
I know my energy is so high.

62
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.210
I was trying wall.
Exactly.
It is like that.
I got sober.
These,

63
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.720
these Twitter followers calling saying,
I'm on cocaine right now.

64
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.120
You know Charlie Sheen,
what do you think Charlie Sheen's is doing right now?

65
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.890
What does he do it you're just drinking or is he doing rugs?
I,
well,

66
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.880
after some of,
I saw the one where I didn't see the machete thing.

67
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:54.520
What happened with them?
I don't know about the machete thing.
I saw the photo,

68
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:58.060
but I've been watching the stream.
I bet.
Can Machete in his hand.
I'm like,

69
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:01.960
what is going?
It's the weirdest train wreck ever though.

70
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.630
I lost the tracks into the woods.
Do you think he's okay?
No,
no,

71
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.660
no he's not.
But he's my favorite person in the world right now

72
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.260
because no matter how fucked up your life,

73
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.270
as you look at Charlie Sheen and you go,
I'm all right,

74
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.330
finally overshadowing me.

75
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.750
It actually helped me get completely stone cold.

76
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:27.730
So I was already sober when it started happening just like a month or maybe a

77
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.730
few weeks and it started happening and it's almost like God shoving me into my

78
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:35.980
feet,
like a mirror into my face because you know,

79
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.490
I have never gotten that because I don't really smoke crack and I don't do that.

80
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.760
I just drink beer and I drink wine by the way,
this morning.

81
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:46.180
And the reason I'm late,
I made it.
It really was me.
I was late.
My,

82
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.640
I didn't tell you that.
Maybe didn't tell him.
I did tell you,

83
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.570
my assistant showed up,
walked into my kitchen.
I'm like,
here,

84
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.120
let me get you some water or you're hungry.
I'll cook you some eggs.

85
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.810
And then I hear a boom and I turned and he's halfway onto the counter and I'm

86
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:01.730
like,
oh my God.
He's like fainting.
He's light headed.

87
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:06.140
I really need to feed this guy.
But then boom,
right onto the floor,
headfirst,

88
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.590
split his head open,
blood gushing all over.

89
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:14.480
Puddling up on my ex's kitchen floor in the main house.
Right.

90
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.000
You know,
I'm not,
I don't live there.
I live in the shed in the back.

91
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:19.910
You know my whole story right now.
Okay,
well we'll get into it,

92
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:24.911
but so blood and he's flopping around like a fish on the floor of the and him

93
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.360
and it's just me and him.
Thank God the kids weren't there.
There's four kids.

94
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.230
Think I lean.
It wasn't there.

95
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:33.770
They would have been even when I just recreated the story for Lena later that

96
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:37.520
she was the one that lives in the main house and owns it.
Um,
but you know,
I've,

97
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.240
I pay for it,
but uh,
you're welcome.

98
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.610
But any more kids to only two are mine.
But anyways,

99
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.850
the thing is,
is that she just me telling her the story,
she started crying.

100
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.340
She was crying and,
and I didn't know what to do,

101
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.420
but I had the foresight to grab a paper towel thing,

102
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.630
shove it under his head so he wouldn't keep boom,
boom,
boom.
And he was,

103
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.830
his eyes rolled back and called nine one one.

104
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.350
And I had my finger down his throat so it wouldn't swallow his tongue.

105
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.180
You've heard that and the right away,
they don't put anything in his mouth when,

106
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.940
okay.
Okay.
And we went on for like three minutes.
I'm like,

107
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:17.770
this guy's going to die right here and I gotta I gotta go on Joseph Plot.

108
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.280
So you just left him,
right?
No,
I waited.

109
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.370
The paramedics came and they say it's going to be fine.

110
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:27.210
He's in the hospital right now as we speak.
He's in the,

111
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.560
so is it an epileptic seizures?
No.

112
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.160
You know what it is and this is the honest to God's truth.
He said,
I made him,

113
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:38.270
so I said,
you can't work for me anymore because we used to drink together.

114
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:41.400
He was Abdi the porn awards with me and we,

115
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.350
and that was the pretty much one of the last times I,
the wheels came off.

116
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.040
I went nuts there.
Charlie Sheen was there.
They go.

117
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.050
Was this like three months ago?
Thank God.

118
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.680
And that's why they did a hair test and you know,

119
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.040
minimal traces of cocaine showed up cause this goes back six to nine months
hair.

120
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.000
But I wanted to prove that I was completely clean for at least a couple weeks.

121
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:07.250
So I did the urine test completely clean of all drugs.

122
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:11.480
You know this was on rumor,
fixed.com oh yeah,
I didn't know that.
They,
yeah,

123
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.680
I wanted to do it.
I said,
because these pictures came up of me doing cocaine.

124
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:16.790
I went,
those are old pictures.

125
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:19.040
They're putting them up and they're trying to pretend like it's happening right

126
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:19.520
now.

127
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.520
I can't continue to be silent about it because whenever shit comes up I'm like

128
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.810
whatever,
it'll blow over but I don't and I never tried to defend myself.

129
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.430
Well you have done so many things though.
That's just speculating,

130
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.940
you know as to you.
I mean also on us to do is bring them a photo and boom,

131
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:40.550
it's a story and they think it's happening that day.

132
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.640
Of course they would though you,
you understand how they would like,

133
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.100
it's not a grand conspiracy.
I know.
You're right.

134
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.850
So what is it like to be the God that they call when someone fucking hits the

135
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:53.660
wall?
Cause you're the God man.
Charlie,
she didn't hit the wall.

136
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:54.830
So I'm going to get Andy Dick on the line.

137
00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.660
<v 1>We're here.
It's Nancy grace.
We have Andy Dick.</v>

138
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.830
We have stopped our coverage on dead babies and Florida.

139
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.000
So the weekend concentrate on Andy deer.
There has,
there have been hitters.

140
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.380
We have found the bones of a two year old but that's coming lanes and Dick is in

141
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:20.520
the studio.
If there's a dead baby in Florida.
Nancy,
Nancy opine on it.

142
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.600
She's all that story.
I wonder if she's showing the babies to make,

143
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.390
to make a TV show.
She doesn't like me.
I'll never be white trash.
Meth.

144
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.920
She's horrible.
She's just an angry because she's a,

145
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.950
she doesn't seem like a pleasure filled happy,
fun person.

146
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.140
And there's subject matter is so God damn dark will show it's dead babies or she

147
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:46.800
talked about me once when the incident went down.

148
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.360
What'd she say at the Buffalo Wild Wings.
Buffalo wild.

149
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:53.430
Columbus,
Ohio.
But Hey,

150
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:56.900
that's your there with your family on the Columbus on Andy.

151
00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:02.010
Dick is drinking on the bar with his penis out in front of children.

152
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.920
That's not what happened.
What happened is I was,

153
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.550
I was drinking a lot and this isn't Temecula,
not calling.

154
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.760
That's a whole Columbus was get arrested for drinking and Temecula and you're

155
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:19.350
not an Indian.
You've done some crazy shit.
I was with an Indian,

156
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.940
I swear to God.

157
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.410
My drummer is an Indian American and drive it up here and a guy had a motorcycle

158
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:29.160
on,
he had a jacket and it said sober Indian on the back of his jacket.

159
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:34.140
They're rare.
Should've taken a picture of that.
They love the fire water.

160
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.430
It's unfortunate that it isn't really a,
supposedly this is how it goes,

161
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:39.720
but without being too ignorant,

162
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.620
it's not in their DNA because they didn't really drink it until white man came

163
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.890
and we got like Asians.
They can't metabolize the alcohol.
Right.

164
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.550
When Asian strength,
they turn,
I forget,

165
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:55.140
flat flushed up and throughout a lot of fucking drug agents,

166
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.330
but I'm around a while drunk white people,
drunk black people.

167
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.650
That's why they do some people get,
fuck,
I been fucked up.
We've all been,

168
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.610
yes I do.
I do.
I do shows.

169
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.870
At one time they had like 15 shots on stage in Vegas and I completely lost.

170
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.100
I couldn't moss all ability to communicate.
I wound up looking.

171
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:20.070
I lied on my back and I was looking around me and there's shot glasses.

172
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:22.230
All of the station,
I'm still talking to a microphone.

173
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.230
You're laying down on a completely ridiculous,

174
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.440
the problem that has those wild fucking shows are fun.
Great.

175
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.810
The and the audience loves it too because like this is really happening.

176
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.710
This theater of humanity,
this is real shit.

177
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.980
You're the only other person in the world where it's not good to do all the
time.

178
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.550
Not all the time,
but every once in a while to have a show.

179
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:51.840
That's when the wheels come off and that fucking car is in the woods hitting

180
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:54.010
trees,
bouncing rocks,
and you're,

181
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.510
<v 2>and you're the only one really laughing.</v>

182
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.350
You're laughing hysterically into the microphone trying to tell your stories and

183
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:03.790
everyone else is just like,
well,
that's not good if they're not laughing too.

184
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.850
I like going,
the wheels go off and everybody's wheels are off.

185
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.880
I want everybody to join me in this little fucked up part that happened to me in

186
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:13.810
Texas.
If you're more drunk than everybody else,
that's usually the issue.

187
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.150
Is there any states that you can't go to right now?
It's good golf Canada,

188
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.930
that's not as loud.
I was making a joke,

189
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.990
but I really am not allowed in Canada and the last time I went up I was going

190
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.110
to,
I was,
I had to work and a dog.

191
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.950
I was in line for customs to come in and a dog,

192
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.800
somebody had their dog with them and I'm like,
oh,
what a cute dot.

193
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:44.110
Me and I look up and the guy holding the leash was a police officer and he's

194
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:44.944
like,
come with me.

195
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:50.310
The dog just zeroed in right on me with his nose cause I just smelled like pot.

196
00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:52.030
I didn't even have it on me.

197
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.690
<v 1>Doug's harsh.
Can't even talk anymore.
That was dry humping me.</v>

198
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.990
No more barking.
Noise left.
And it's a little bar

199
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.760
barked itself horse.

200
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.510
They took me in the back room and,

201
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.140
<v 2>and it,
it was,
it was a slightly humiliating.</v>

202
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:24.280
It was a strip search and,
and then,
and then they found nothing had nothing.

203
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.610
And they then they gave you this pamphlet.
Why me?

204
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.790
Why me said that affected is basically why was I violated?

205
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.480
And you look and it's the way you were dressed.
It was the smell of the potty.

206
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.380
Goddamn dog.
But I'm saying it's like a rape joke.

207
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.150
She didn't dress like that,
shouldn't have dressed

208
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.031
like a hippie.

209
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:52.600
He's dressed like a stony slut and he smelled like weed to that poor little dog.

210
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.240
There's an update about my assistant,
but I guess I'll check and he's,

211
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.120
he's fine cause I've been talking,
I was talking to him the whole way here.

212
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:03.070
He's fine.
It's just,
it just had a seizure.

213
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:08.370
And so what you were trying to say is if you stopped drinking abruptly you will.

214
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:13.300
And this is true.
Every time I've gone into Rehab they,

215
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.290
they say you need to take this pill and it's called [inaudible].
And I'm like,

216
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:19.740
why I don't take pills.
I just don't take pills.
I don't belong.

217
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.340
I just don't like to some shit.

218
00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:23.890
They used to give people the bag and the cowboy days.

219
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.730
I don't know what that was like something that people would get addicted to back

220
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:29.410
then.
But I tried this allotted,

221
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:35.170
we'll either way you take it and you don't get,
you don't have seizures,

222
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.500
but if you don't take it or if you don't taper off,

223
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:43.501
like if you want to stop drinking and you're drinking heavily every day and you

224
00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:46.450
want to stop,
you've got to just taper off.

225
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:51.050
You got to like if you're drinking 20 a day,
then drink 15 then drink 10 yeah.

226
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.980
Oh yeah.
You're sorry you got it.
Or you got to go into it because you can,
no,
no,

227
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.610
you can die from the withdrawals.
My friend,

228
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.060
my assistant could have died.
He,
he hit his head so hard.

229
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:03.590
That alone could have killed him.
You,

230
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:07.900
you would have been freaking out and fucking weed is illegal.
I right,
right.

231
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.330
Can Cap credible.
It's just gone.
Damn incredible.
Yeah.

232
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.330
Cause if you had the choice between the two,
like if someone said,

233
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.060
do you want to have a drink or have some weed,

234
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.870
it's always we'd always one or the other.

235
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.960
Look at how calm you are and let me tell you,
let me,
can I tell you your fans,

236
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.670
how many of you have,
by the way,
on Twitter,

237
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.760
275,000 a mother fucker while I held a couple of them come over much.

238
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.220
They're loving it and people are saying,
you guys are fucking killing me.

239
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.080
That love.
And let me tell you guys something,

240
00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:40.700
because I know Joe Rogan from how many years ago was it?
1520 east.

241
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.530
This is not the job.
I love this guy.
He's almost practically cuddly.

242
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.540
I want to hug up on,

243
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:51.680
I'm in Schnug Ol up by a fire and let them read me a story,

244
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:56.330
but this is the guy that I worked with fifth.
Did you say 20 it's been,
yeah,

245
00:15:56.331 --> 00:16:00.140
I think it's been swollen nodes 96 do let them do the math.

246
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.410
1996 was in the middle of [inaudible].

247
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.860
17 years coming up on 20 years.
He was,

248
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:11.720
I don't know if you were taking creatine or steroids or you were jacked.
No,

249
00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:16.721
I was just being me and being him at that time was straight edged.

250
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.020
Just saying,
well,

251
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.460
I would drink every now and then thought you still weren't gencon.

252
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.200
I was just a couple of years away from my last fight,
so I had fun.

253
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.380
By the way,
I read something on Twitter that you've never lost a fight.
No,

254
00:16:30.381 --> 00:16:33.350
I lost it.
I lost the last one.
You never know.

255
00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:36.920
I lost a bunch of times and lost a bunch of times and taekwondo and my last

256
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:41.900
kickboxing fight,
I got fucked up.
But this is after you started smoking pot?
No,

257
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.220
no,
no,
no.
This was,
no,

258
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:47.510
I haven't fought since 1989 it was a long time.

259
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.480
So when we did news radio,
the 94 91 we went to go work out.
You took me.

260
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.100
He's like,
I want you to come out on one of my workouts.
This guy worked.

261
00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.970
This explains him back then.
First of all,
you were,

262
00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:04.310
I don't know how to describe it.
You were alive.
Wire.

263
00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.390
You didn't care what people thought.
You still down,
but now you're just more,

264
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.390
you're more intellectual about,
it's more cool.

265
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.710
Like I heard your whole thing about,
what's it called?
DMT.
And I was fascinated.

266
00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:18.020
I listened to the whole thing.
I actually asked you,

267
00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:22.310
can we do it on the air on this podcast?
And you said,
no,
it's too hardcore.

268
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:25.840
I'm going to do it on my own.
Then I'm looking at it.
It has tell him it has a,

269
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.180
the recovery rate for alcoholism.
People use.
Yeah.

270
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.540
And I was going to the Iowasca,
I lost my Alaska.

271
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:36.380
There's a guy in to right up the street from me that makes sense.
Who Does it?

272
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:38.120
I'm going to,
I'm going to do it,
folks.
I,

273
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.520
I'm going to do it cause I don't want to drink.
I don't want to,

274
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.770
I don't want to be flopping around on my kitchen floor,

275
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.060
cracking my head open and dying.
But anyways,
back then 20 you know,

276
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.860
17 years ago he was,

277
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.530
<v 3>you know what the word is?
Angry.</v>

278
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.840
You were so fucking angry.
It was hostile and you would,

279
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.580
you would attack everybody and anybody,
even Paul Sams and,
and,

280
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.450
but me or you'd,
the girls would run to their dressing rooms crying,
you know,

281
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.360
I'm not exaggerating,
crying.

282
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.780
I would run to the bathroom and punch holes in the wall.

283
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.480
We on the verge of crying and,

284
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.880
and you would always call me out for being high in front of people because you

285
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:23.140
were,
you were straight edged and,
and,
and,

286
00:18:23.141 --> 00:18:26.040
and the bottom line for my son just was how is high dude?

287
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:30.410
It was because you were stopping work.
No,
but it's true.
I never,

288
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.380
I was always having fun.
You,
I was afraid of,
I know you were having fun,

289
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:37.740
but oftentimes having fun at other people's expense.
I don't know about that.

290
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.240
It's true that I would get upset very easily at things every,

291
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.900
but it wasn't nothing.
It wasn't a,
you know,
real,
you always had a reason.

292
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.970
But my point is,
is I didn't want to even go to work,
so I was afraid of you.

293
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.490
Well,
a lot of people were upset at you,
Andy.
You know that,

294
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.860
you know that everybody was instead of you all the time.

295
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.160
It was a constant source of,
of,
of struggle.
I'd love you,
dude.

296
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:01.290
I think you're incredibly talented.
You're,

297
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.580
you're a a wild dude and you don't get that kind of comedy and less,

298
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:09.150
it comes from a real wild place,
you know?
And I love that about you.

299
00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:11.820
I think you're really fucking funny.
I've always said that.

300
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.860
But you got to understand that that comes at it.

301
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.500
It's a very selfish package a lot of times to be that wild person.

302
00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:22.620
And you oftentimes don't think about how other people are perceiving you.

303
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.090
But that was,
I'm guilty.

304
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.800
I've been guilty of that myself and I know that you have to write,
you know,

305
00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.060
I can't argue with snow environment like that where everybody's,

306
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.280
it's not like we were just partying.

307
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.580
We were supposed to be doing this show and if what you're doing disrupts what

308
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:38.790
other people are doing,
it becomes a problem and it's not that I don't love you,

309
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:40.370
it's not that I don't think you're talented something,

310
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.390
I want to be angry for no reason.

311
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:45.190
It's just I'm standing up for what I thought was right.
Yeah.

312
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.430
I hear what he's saying and when I first moved out here,

313
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:50.670
you're a different person.
You just seem very different.
You're so chill now.

314
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:54.440
You really are.
It's a lot of it is the tank.
Yeah.

315
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.720
Climate in the tank I want to get in a regular basis has made me reevaluate all

316
00:19:59.941 --> 00:20:00.180
the d.

317
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:05.160
There's a bunch of different paths that we go down in our personalities where we

318
00:20:05.161 --> 00:20:09.720
automatically,
let me just say that I am a different person too.

319
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.830
I'm sure he was 17 years.
I'm not stuck back there either.
Well,
you know,

320
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.540
like I'm a lot more,
I just,
I,
I'm just more chill too.

321
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.730
I think with intelligent now back then I'd be arguing with you,
but now I'm like,

322
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:25.500
you know,
you were right.
You maybe you wouldn't

323
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.040
come back and you would apologize and we'd hug it out or something.
You know,

324
00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:35.710
we had a strange relationship.
It was like,
it was like love hate man.
Yeah.

325
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.770
But we always made up.
We always never,

326
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:40.290
you know the point where I remember I walked into your dressing room cause I,

327
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.470
I saw it rocking and you know what if this,
if this trailer is rocking,

328
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:46.290
don't come knocking.
But I took it,
you know,
I went the other way.

329
00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:48.070
If this trailer's and I got to come in and see

330
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.960
<v 1>what the hell is going on here.</v>

331
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:54.350
What his Dick in his head against Joan Rivers head.

332
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.900
So Andy,
you were fucked up and you had your dick hard.

333
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.800
It was flacid and you're pulling on it in your hand right in front of me.
Oh,

334
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:06.100
so this was with,
it was like later after the show.
That's what it was.

335
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.580
What was in the dressing room with my girlfriend.
It was like a trailer.

336
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.290
It was like after the show him party.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,
that,

337
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.340
that was the end of the night.
Then I can imagine me.

338
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.990
You were doing it for shits and giggles,
so it was fun.

339
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.070
You know it was half party in half.
You crazy.
Half,
half,
half.

340
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.290
I was attracted to you.
I'm not going to lie.

341
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.530
That was the Hubbard fucking dichotomy for me back then.

342
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.800
I was sexually attracted to you and just as equally fucking frightened of you,

343
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.220
so I wanted to,
maybe he use sexually.

344
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.410
I was putting off all those barriers for you buddy.
You really,

345
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.510
you knew subconscious date.

346
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.410
Do you remember the episode where you guys were wrestled and you're on the

347
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:48.310
ground rolling around?

348
00:21:48.311 --> 00:21:51.880
Where are you thinking that like this is the hottest scene?
I still,

349
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.750
I still jerk off to it.
I'm just kidding.
No,
I know,
but listen,
well,

350
00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:59.860
I didn't get to the point where he took me,
he take me to buy a couch.

351
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.580
I was sitting right next to me.
I'd have Douchey chills.
Do you want to spray?

352
00:22:04.581 --> 00:22:07.770
But back in the day.
Spray bottle just in case.
Yeah.

353
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.970
You got an aid from my soul.
Come on you.

354
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.030
I'm not attracted like I was back then.
I got some fewer SLU.

355
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.040
I don't know what it is.
I think maybe because we smoke a lot of pot now,

356
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.370
but you puffed up a little bit.
Your puffier.
You're not,

357
00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.830
you're not necessarily,
you're still muscular and you're probably strong as fuck.

358
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.250
You could knock me out with one punch,
but you're more none of saline.
Yeah.

359
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.050
You're not as disciplined.
I don't work out nearly or anymore.
Well,

360
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.870
I work out like a fucking,
I going to say,
if you scroll down,
you've got to eat.

361
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.840
I was pretty disciplined with my dying.

362
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.910
You looked fucking cause this guy without any clothes on and fucking incredible.

363
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.810
But he took me to work out for,
and this is why,
this is why he looked like that.

364
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.290
He would work out every day for how many hours?
A couple of hours a day,

365
00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:55.720
a couple hours a day.
It's like you got my name because I was working out,

366
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.710
you know,
let me,
these guns come on.
What did they say to you?
They say back off,

367
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.790
but he took me there and they let me work at let's work out and you do my

368
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:08.350
workout.
And I go,
I couldn't do 20 minutes and I,

369
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:09.910
but he was my ride,

370
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:13.810
so I had to stick around and watch him work out on him and he's 30 40 minutes

371
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:14.644
into it.

372
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.540
Worked out so hard that he's now over in the corner with his hand on the edge of

373
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:26.440
a giant garbage cans,
just vomiting,
vomiting,
vomiting,
and then he goes,

374
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.600
okay,
I got one more hour to go.
Like he kept working out.

375
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.830
He worked down to the point where you bomb.
That's fucking crazy.
Well,

376
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:37.560
the only I threw up the other day,
I'm good.

377
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:42.570
A kettlebell workout throughout you out to the point of if you push yourself

378
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.040
over that line for every,

379
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.640
your whole body shaking and you're not vomiting,

380
00:23:48.641 --> 00:23:52.040
it's not a workout and your instincts are telling you to stop your instinct.

381
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:54.170
You have to push through those instincts.
You have to be mine.

382
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.810
The mine has to use the the body like it's a car.

383
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.510
Do you have to be able to stomp on that gas as the wheels are spinning and

384
00:23:59.511 --> 00:24:02.660
trying to get out of the mud,
you got to keep the fucking pedal to the floor.

385
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.490
I forget about what the engines won't wait.
You get a Cuban,

386
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.230
you've got to treat your body like that and it's the only way your body really

387
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:12.590
truly become strong.
Do you take pills,
dude,
like creatine,
all that,

388
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.530
the steroids and took a lot of differences now?
No.

389
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.590
Now I take human growth hormone and testosterone.

390
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.800
I'd go for a hormone replacement therapy.

391
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:26.210
Why do you think you need more testosterone?
No.
No worried about more kids.

392
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.030
What it does is you take it,
it's very light dose to query him.

393
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:33.620
All it does is keep you at healthy levels.
See I like boy Milken edit Nami.

394
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.220
He likes everything that makes you punish the,
he's on birth control now.

395
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.910
Right now my pussy boners heart.
Those two things.
Yeah.

396
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.000
Your turn you into a woman.
I know you not really like,

397
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.890
I like both of those things too and it sucks it really sad.
Yeah.

398
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:53.840
You gotta take some like Tribulus with that I showed you these injections,

399
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:56.740
the tests,
the test house friends.
No,
it's great.
It turns out trends.

400
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.950
Let me ask you though,
is this stuff is your heart okay is for your heart.

401
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:04.070
It's help you had your heart tested.
Of course bones,
derby.

402
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:09.730
I heard that the overtime that weakens your bones and your bone or arthritis or

403
00:25:10.121 --> 00:25:13.850
something like that,
it probably does wonders for your boner.
Well,

404
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:17.950
it does wonders for your body.
Argue.
Don't,

405
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.400
I don't do injections.
It's a cream.
It's very,
like I said,

406
00:25:20.401 --> 00:25:23.410
it was a very thick cream on your bone.
No,
I don't know.

407
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.290
Can you give me a little of that works that way?

408
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.340
If he jerked over that cream,
did you imagine what would happen?

409
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:35.210
Have you ever like run out of whatever you jerk off with?
I like use like,
um,

410
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.640
Astroglide I,
that'd be a good sponsor.

411
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.670
Oh,
we have flesh,
flesh lube up.
Well,
I'd like to talk to them too.

412
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.580
But anyhow.
Have you ever run out and then you have to use,

413
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:50.150
so you have to go around your house because you just need to jerk off.

414
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.200
And what is the weirdest thing you've ever used?

415
00:25:53.201 --> 00:25:56.870
The juice that comes with Bolognas really good.
Pretty Standard.

416
00:25:56.871 --> 00:26:01.090
And I came to Jordan shoes that comes with Bologna.

417
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:05.300
It's like slime that said,
you don't know Brian.
That's so typical.

418
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.060
So used to the way he says and that's absolutely disgusting.

419
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.520
That's par for the course for a Brian answer

420
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:18.380
mine.
I think the weirdest was olive oil,
which isn't even that weird.

421
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.150
That's healthy.
Yeah.
That would actually be good for scaling and and Shit.
Spit.

422
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.500
I've used spit spit sucks cause I that some work to get back to this hormone

423
00:26:27.501 --> 00:26:30.480
conversation isn't it?
It's kind of an important subject.
I liked her.

424
00:26:30.481 --> 00:26:33.770
She took off.
I want to think about,
I want to think about your Dick.
Listen Fella,

425
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.930
you can think about it all you like.

426
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.420
I've always loved them.

427
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.630
<v 3>This is for sure the strangest podcasts,</v>

428
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.850
human growth hormone and gang sec.
Um,
what,
what happens is as you get older,

429
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:55.560
like you say,
if you have a hypo thyroidism,

430
00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.380
your thyroid stops producing a certain amount of thyroid hormone and they just

431
00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:03.120
supplement it and to give you Synthroid or whatever.
And you don't have that.

432
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.390
I do have that too.
Yeah,
everybody does.
When you get to a certain age,
you're,

433
00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:10.080
your body stops producing as much.
Remember you had,

434
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:15.060
you had the middle.
I lag on.
Still have their again.
It's gone now.

435
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.980
Yeah.
You went off on my face.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Bonus.
That's just,

436
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.250
it's just a cream that you put on it.

437
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.520
Scrolled the protopic ointment and you have to catch it right away.

438
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.730
And there was some other stuff you could do.

439
00:27:24.731 --> 00:27:27.030
He could do light treatments and shit like that,
but I had mine.

440
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.780
Mine is a very mild,
I heard that it was because you,
you're,

441
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.650
you're rapid.
You're like,
oh,
your body's overworking.
No,

442
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:38.660
it's an immune system thing.
It's auto immune system.
Okay.
I didn't know it.

443
00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.060
They don't know exactly what causes it.
But uh,
you know,

444
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.330
like Michael Jackson had an horrible way.
He had it all over his whole body.

445
00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:46.550
I just have it on my knuckle.
You don't,

446
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.590
when you don't get pigment in your skin and it just turns what it is,
is your,

447
00:27:50.591 --> 00:27:53.070
your immune system is fighting against your pigment.
Well,

448
00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:55.440
that's what I was saying.
So your immune system is over.

449
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.690
My whole body is just in a battle all the time.

450
00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.100
So what does it mean system is attacking things that shouldn't be attacking.

451
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.630
Just to explain this,
this human growth hormone thing.

452
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:08.100
When you go to for just like he shouldn't be attacking.

453
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.870
Well not anymore though.
Not since not since bought anyway.
Pop,
go,

454
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.320
go and you get blood tests done and they find out what your levels are.

455
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.060
Testosterone.
Ollie's there you should go.

456
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.120
I can totally go back and tell you that you're a girl.
Well that's fine.

457
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.490
I can tell you're a girl.
Girls since it,

458
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.790
the girls sensing girls love to fuck girls so they have to send to you.

459
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.170
Do you really have man have large nipples but not boobies.
They get hard now.

460
00:28:36.171 --> 00:28:40.590
Let me let me know.
Anyway.

461
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.290
What happens is you go and you get a blood test,

462
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:47.370
they find out all your levels and it makes you feel so much better to get,

463
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.090
you know,
a normal level of testosterone,
normal lever of IGF,

464
00:28:51.091 --> 00:28:53.910
all these different things,
all these different things that keep you healthy.

465
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:58.530
I go in and do that for sure.
[inaudible] great.
This is,
this is what happens.

466
00:28:58.531 --> 00:29:00.660
Look,
you're dying.
Okay,

467
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.560
40 something or result 45 eventually you're going to be 60 eventually going to

468
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:07.620
be dead.
There's just no stopping that.
That's just how it's always been.

469
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.190
What I have done.
It's just the way it is here.
It's true.
And people go,
well,

470
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:12.840
why would you supplement hormones?
Well,

471
00:29:12.841 --> 00:29:15.960
because it makes your body operate like a younger body because it gives your

472
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:19.290
body the things that it's missing and you know,
people go,
well,

473
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:21.230
what happens if you don't?
If you do that,
you know what?

474
00:29:21.231 --> 00:29:22.710
It would have a fucks up your body.
First of all,

475
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:25.050
there's no evidence that it does.
And second of all,
if you don't,

476
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:29.130
you're just going to grow weak and die.
Right?
It's like,
it's that simple to me.

477
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.400
To me it's like it's,
it's,
it's almost like a pragmatic choice,

478
00:29:32.401 --> 00:29:35.940
but how old are you now?
43 Oh,
I didn't know we were that close in age.
Yeah.

479
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.800
And you feel like 1 million bucks.
Yeah,
I feel great.
Yeah.

480
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.070
As long as I do the right thing.
Eat the right foods,

481
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.980
<v 2>take the right vitamins.
Lots of,
lots of vegetables.
Lots.
I mean it will be,</v>

482
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.310
I stay really healthy.
Liquified Bachelor.
Yeah.
Well you were always on a trip.
He,

483
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.440
he used to show up for work with bags,
like big plastic bags filled with herbs,

484
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.330
herbs and various vitamins and concoctions and he would sit there.

485
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.310
Sorting is pills out for fucking hours.
Like sometimes we'd be rehearsing.
Yeah,

486
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.180
pills on my desk,
Matthew's desk,
all of those.
Or were real,
they were real,

487
00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:12.890
they weren't props and he would just take all these different herbs and said

488
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.520
that was back when I was really stupid.
I didn't take anything.

489
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.420
I didn't take a multivitamin.
I didn't take a God damn thing.

490
00:30:18.421 --> 00:30:20.800
You did take one thing.
Cheese burritos.
Yeah.

491
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.870
I saw you just ate like a lot of burritos.
Yeah.
Do you still eat like shit?
Well,

492
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.520
I don't eat like shit.
I just need a lot of calendar every once in a while.
No.

493
00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:30.400
I eat healthy.
I just eat a lot of food.
He's alive.

494
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:35.020
But you were appetizers to meals,
to desserts,
to conferences.
I see the shows,

495
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.310
but you still work out.
Your body needs fuel,
man.
If you'll look good,

496
00:30:39.311 --> 00:30:43.320
you don't look back.
You just look puffy.
Lump that Earth,
you know?

497
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.780
Definitely have more body fat than I had when I was saying I have a short
really,

498
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:50.260
I have a bigger belly than you.
Do you work out at all?
Yeah,
but I just hike.

499
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:54.010
I'm like,
I could do old man workouts.
I started doing p 90 x.

500
00:30:54.011 --> 00:30:57.340
What are you thinking about that shit?
It's brutal,
so I should do it.
Yeah,

501
00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.920
kind of like that where you're doing a different thing every night.

502
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.940
You're doing dumbbell clean and jerks.

503
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.090
The next night you're doing chin ups and you're doing karate and then you're

504
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:10.090
doing yoga.
Yeah.
It just makes your butt shocks the shit out of your body,

505
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.811
don't you?
Body work.

506
00:31:10.811 --> 00:31:13.900
Don't you think they should have like a p five like they should have different

507
00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:18.200
levels so you don't want to start a g g h three what does it do for,
okay,

508
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.860
what does it too,
I don't know.

509
00:31:19.861 --> 00:31:22.810
It's all the stuff you're talking about makes you younger,
younger.

510
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.500
You take it a little ounce like every day you might want to look into it.

511
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:29.110
It's very,
very,
very underground crap.
I did it like,

512
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.430
no you're ended that but I just love it because it rhymed with cocaine.

513
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:37.420
It's called crow came and like cocaine is like the car.
Did you get this stuff?

514
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.870
Cause cocaine,
the negative but pro cane that's positive.

515
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:46.420
There are listening online called procaine and compound and he's got this g

516
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.270
three but that's not what's in here.

517
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.200
I just cut the lid off and use it as a disposable.
That's not what's in there.

518
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:57.370
The g procaine is actually just this clear liquid and you take an ounce of it

519
00:31:57.371 --> 00:32:00.100
every day.
I ran out of that stuff.

520
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.110
This has slots for flipping Cilantro.
Parsley,
Chlorella,
uh,

521
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:09.910
some,
some acid awfulness that has the flax oil,
that three,
six,
nine oil.

522
00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:12.340
It has dates,
bananas,
apples.

523
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.620
It has all kinds of Algaes and green powders.

524
00:32:17.621 --> 00:32:21.460
Three different green powders.
It has the flax seeds,
it has chia seeds.

525
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.580
She's has every fucking thing you can imagine.

526
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:27.370
I put it in a Vitamix and it liquid,
even though it's tiny,
tiny,

527
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:31.450
tiny black seeds become liquid and they go right into my bloodstream.

528
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.070
And this is all living shit enzymes.
So I,

529
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:39.950
we're on the same path,
but I just tried to get it from the earth,

530
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:41.000
from Mother Nature.

531
00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.080
We're all looking after you make that yourself or do you get somebody to get

532
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:46.880
help?
I do it.
I made this up.

533
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:50.360
It's the most comprehensive fucking smoothie that John,

534
00:32:50.361 --> 00:32:53.180
but juice can't even touch.
Do you just do you like shit?

535
00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.040
What do you shit like fucking trees that have the most amazing shit he would

536
00:32:58.041 --> 00:33:03.040
love.
Yeah.

I late.
I really laid pipe.

If I feel one coming on,
you can totally filming word.
Listen,

538
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:09.650
it's worth doing.

539
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:14.390
I think about all the hits that Ariz butthole got indie shit will get double

540
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:16.700
those hits.
I will promise you double though.
Yeah,

541
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:19.940
you got to watch this and a video called juke clamp and once the uncensored

542
00:33:19.941 --> 00:33:23.150
version of it jus clam.
Okay,
I'll watch it,

543
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.420
but I don't want like your flip phone and going up my ass hole.

544
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.890
I'll let you fill me sitting there and you can hear it coming out,

545
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.760
whatever you want and then I'll get up and you can see here.

546
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.980
I see it coming out of,

547
00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:39.740
it's really the only way that I see you're getting all the sexual with me.

548
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.860
No getting sexual,
sexual.
You're taking a ship.

549
00:33:42.861 --> 00:33:47.650
You want to sit down and I'm going to ask.
Then I want to see your Dick.
We got,

550
00:33:47.651 --> 00:33:49.140
I mean I got a barter here.
Oh,

551
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:54.400
I work on the barter system through like two at glass for the team will go in

552
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.020
and I want to see it.
You can see it.
You going to see it a rack.
Impossible.

553
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.210
It's not even possible if you are,
you're a mile away.
My Dick would recognize

554
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.510
what Dick would be screaming at me that night.

555
00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.290
That is not nice.

556
00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:16.000
You go and get with your girl and then she'll get you going and then run out of

557
00:34:16.001 --> 00:34:19.610
the room with your boner.
It sounds like a good idea.
What do you bartering with?

558
00:34:19.611 --> 00:34:24.260
You've got gold coins and I'm not noticing it and then you could see me.

559
00:34:24.261 --> 00:34:28.220
Shit.
You have to do the most humility,
dark,
desperate,

560
00:34:28.221 --> 00:34:30.890
saddest thing and if you do it then you can see.

561
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.430
All you have to do is show me your Dick and then we have film with him pooping

562
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:38.410
that you take it for the team bro.
You really think the pooping.

563
00:34:38.411 --> 00:34:41.260
We'll get us some good.
Did you feel that that will be on TMZ.
Alright.

564
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.080
Can we get to this?
Like a chair between him and my penis.

565
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.390
You can put me in one of those dog cages and lock.

566
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.910
I have a dog cage.
That's the next place you get to be with him and we can,

567
00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.230
we'll just,
we'll just film Him Pooping on the pee pad and one of the dog.

568
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.000
What did you say?
I said,
then that's the next place you're going to be living,

569
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.440
pal.
You're living in a garage outside your chick's house.

570
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:14.070
It's a shed.
It's a shack shed.
What does it,
I'm no,

571
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.900
was I drinking?
Someone else gave you too.
Oh,
you did.
Okay.
What is that like?

572
00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:21.560
I'm such a germ freak.
I've always been insured for,
well,
I pimped it out.

573
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:26.570
First of all,
I downplay it and make people feel sorry for me,
but I wanted to be,

574
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.820
I saw the movie funny people and I really related to all the characters.

575
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.140
It's not a comedy.

576
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.200
Go Watch it and it's a very well made dromedy except for the half hour.

577
00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:39.363
Let's do like it.

578
00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.920
I like everything up to the last half hour when they threw his kids in there for

579
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:45.720
like,
so they can have health insurance or something.

580
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:49.890
There was no reason for the last half hour.
Good.
They have,

581
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.460
they have Judd Apatow's daughter's singing that,
uh,

582
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:58.440
just Grill Isabella and Glamour at Arbor from,
from cats.
Right.
And that really,

583
00:35:58.441 --> 00:36:01.980
it's her singing in her school for real.
I thought about that this morning.

584
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.840
I was thinking what you're thinking but you know,
but you know.
Yeah,
it does.

585
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:07.940
It has like five different entities.

586
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.650
It goes along but basically just watch the movie,

587
00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:14.190
but my point is is that I realized that I,

588
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.940
and you probably experienced this bite by observing me,

589
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.890
but I really wasn't around as much as I obviously could have been for my kids

590
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:27.210
and my kids are now about to not be kids.
In fact,

591
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.500
Lucas is 22 I don't want to hit a great standup too.
He's doing,
he's doing great.

592
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:36.260
He just moved to New York and immediately got it.
He called it.
He passed.

593
00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.470
He passed,
I guess it's called and I'm like,
that sounded negative to me.
I'm like,

594
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.340
Oh,
I'm sorry.
No,

595
00:36:41.341 --> 00:36:46.260
he passed I guess the the test and now now he can perform at the comic strip.

596
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:47.220
It's not the biggest one,

597
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.710
but he can perform there every week now and comic strips.

598
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.250
One of the best clubs in New York.
It is so awesome.
It's one of the best clubs.

599
00:36:53.251 --> 00:36:56.360
It's the place where everybody goes and works out.
Oh he,
he can he he passed.

600
00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.200
That's where like Louis C K we'll go

601
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.430
with nothing if he's on Twitter,
but he doesn't go on much.

602
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:10.200
But he's at Lucas Dick and he needs help.

603
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:11.034
He showed me the,

604
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.420
I got a text the first morning after the first night that he was there just

605
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:19.350
earlier this week and he said,
here's the view.
You're going to love this.

606
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.060
Here's the view from the bunk bed,

607
00:37:21.061 --> 00:37:24.390
the top bunk from where I'm staying at a stranger's house,

608
00:37:24.391 --> 00:37:28.920
they had never met and it was looking down onto a computer screen and along the

609
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:32.670
computer screen was the poster for Brokeback mountain.

610
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.620
Now I can be,
you know by and I can be with guys on it,

611
00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:40.830
but I didn't really want my kids to be.
I like,
I texted him back,

612
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:43.770
get out of there,
take the first plane back.
Wow.

613
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:49.260
Know I freaked me out.
He's staying at some gay guys house.

614
00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:51.810
Wow.
Isn't that weird that I would freak out about it?

615
00:37:51.811 --> 00:37:54.320
It's funny that you would freak out about it.
Why?
I don't want them.

616
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.740
You just don't want it to happen to him.
Is that what it is?

617
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.160
I know that I know how straight all my kids are.

618
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.300
I don't want them to be to be taken advantage of or that's what you think.

619
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.970
You feel like someone's going to catch him while he's vulnerable,

620
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.360
slipped something in his drink or some steroids

621
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.100
and he's a handsome grill.

622
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.030
Isn't that a big thrill for a lot of gay guys to get a straight guy to do

623
00:38:18.031 --> 00:38:22.440
something like yeah,
I guess that's what I think that's what it is.

624
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.540
Every guard where you might,

625
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.480
you might be one of the straightest guys I've ever met.

626
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.740
I've got to see that boner.
I know,
I know this gay Guy Joe,

627
00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:36.220
I know this gay guy that does hair and he goes to people's house to do hair

628
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.060
<v 4>and he,</v>

629
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.600
every time he does a guy he tries to fucking sleep with the guy or do something.

630
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.290
He says that like one out of five people actually do it.

631
00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:45.430
They do like straight guys.

632
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.320
<v 3>Dude,
there was a dude I worked with.
Um,
uh,</v>

633
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.400
I don't want to mention which show cause everybody on the show will know he was

634
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:53.890
a behind the scenes guy and he,

635
00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:57.850
he was a gay guy and he told me you would be amazed.

636
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:02.090
Amazed at how many straight guys he's blown.
Yeah.
He just like offers to blows.

637
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:06.000
I guess that happens.
It happens all the time.
But what does the bathroom Oh yeah.

638
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.470
Well it should go to take those headphones off though.

639
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:15.490
We're going to third door down while you're in there.
Third door.

640
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.430
Wow.
Jesus Christ.
This is awesome.

641
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.140
<v 4>This is fucking great.
I love it.
I can't,
I loved her.</v>

642
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.710
I love how he talks about your Dick and stuff and you could just sit there and

643
00:39:25.711 --> 00:39:30.030
different for kind of like nervous and what's up to like a waiting for the storm

644
00:39:30.031 --> 00:39:31.230
to pass.
Yeah.
Like

645
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.621
<v 3>when you're,</v>

646
00:39:31.621 --> 00:39:34.770
when you're in your car and there's a big wave of rain comes down and like,
Shit.

647
00:39:34.771 --> 00:39:36.450
All right,
maybe we should just pull over and wait this out.

648
00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.190
Don't drive right now.

649
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.950
Like if you're in Miami and there's a wall of water in front of you,

650
00:39:40.951 --> 00:39:44.640
that's Andy Dick.
Yes.
He's a wall of water in Miami talking about your deck.

651
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.850
That's so funny.
I love it.
Talking about me talking about you.

652
00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:52.260
Making me uncomfortable.
Get uncomfortable.
That's one thing I like about you.

653
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:56.600
You're fine.
You're totally fine.
You're not uncomfortable,
Aria.
No,
no,
no.

654
00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:00.720
In all the years I've known you,
you never get uncomfortable.
No,

655
00:40:00.721 --> 00:40:03.960
I'm pretty open minded person island.
Sometimes you have,

656
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.820
I think you've pushed me or he'd gotten violent,

657
00:40:05.821 --> 00:40:09.330
but you know I only pushed you out of my door while you had your dick in your

658
00:40:09.331 --> 00:40:13.710
hand.
You're crazy.
Fuck.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

659
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.210
You accuse me of being violent,
but you don't want to own up to what causes the,

660
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:21.810
the reaction to you know,
violent anymore.
No,
much more mellow now.

661
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.650
Thank you.
Marijuana.
It's about,
I want it.

662
00:40:24.651 --> 00:40:29.280
It's also the tank was doing in the tank on a regular basis.
No.
Well,

663
00:40:29.281 --> 00:40:32.790
it's real simple.
There's a place down here in Burbank called soothing solutions.

664
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.830
There's a place in Venice,
it's the best place.

665
00:40:34.831 --> 00:40:38.460
It's called the float lab and if you go to the float lab.com you'll see what

666
00:40:38.461 --> 00:40:41.730
they have there.
But I want to go to my favorite place called Joe Rogan's house.

667
00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.670
Can I get out eventually?
Like do you have to change the water every time?
Yes.

668
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:47.640
Every time.
No.
No.

669
00:40:47.641 --> 00:40:50.580
You don't change the water every time it goes through a filter system.

670
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.660
Every time I turned the thing on,
how much was it?
The tank itself,

671
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.220
everything is about $8,000 Oh,
that's not bad.
But it's still very expensive.

672
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.000
And you're laying down long ways.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
Invaluable to me.

673
00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:07.380
You're laying down,
you lay down.
It's okay.
Yeah.
It's like a giant bed,
like a bed,

674
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.340
you know,
it's like four feet wide and paid me seven or eight feet long.

675
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.930
Saltwater.
Yeah.
Oh really?
800 pounds of salts in the water.
So your,

676
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.470
your float it float and it's heated.

677
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:22.560
The same temperature as your skin and there's no sensory experience or no

678
00:41:22.561 --> 00:41:25.920
sensory input rather top part of your body is out of the yeah,
exactly.

679
00:41:25.921 --> 00:41:29.440
And you and you can breathe,
you can breathe.
Your fears are underwater.
Um,

680
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.450
I don't know,
but other people do.
And uh,

681
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:36.460
the guy who's a friend of mine who set up the tank for me,
um,
not only did,
uh,
he,

682
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:41.060
he had this crazy experience where he kept waking up inside of dreams.

683
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.350
Like he had a dream and then boom,
he would wake up and realize,
oh my God,

684
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:47.540
I was dreaming and then boom and wake up.
No,

685
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:51.350
you were dreaming again about waking up from dreaming like he thought and then

686
00:41:51.351 --> 00:41:54.120
he realized it was in the tank.
That's awesome.
Like you,
you,
you,

687
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.880
when you strip away all the input,
all the sensory input,

688
00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:02.030
you're just left with the mind outside of the body.

689
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.300
Your brain literally is unconnected to your body because it's not getting any

690
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:09.010
information from it.
And in La it's overstimulated and everywhere.

691
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:13.940
New York and in city,
in our,
in our off shore,
yes.
Overstimulation.

692
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.290
Not just overstimulation,

693
00:42:15.291 --> 00:42:17.870
but a lot of bizarre stress and occupation because there's a lot,

694
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:22.190
I apologize if I'm putting bizarre stress on you now.
Oh No,
you're not at all.

695
00:42:22.191 --> 00:42:26.100
You know,
you're not,
I don't call the people.
Yeah.
When people are freaking out.

696
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:31.970
Joe's gonna be so mad.
I've,
this is working with Andy for five years.

697
00:42:31.971 --> 00:42:35.300
This is what we did every day.
So you've never seen his dick ever,
I'm sure.
Yes.

698
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.150
I think I might've,
out of the scene,

699
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:41.600
there was a scene where I had to pull my fucking thick.

700
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.910
I remember that meeting.
It was meeting.

701
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:48.170
There was a scene where I was supposed to be naked and they had a kick candy out

702
00:42:48.171 --> 00:42:49.004
of the studio.

703
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.230
I was totally naked and that was [inaudible] went over to Catherine's place and

704
00:42:52.231 --> 00:42:57.030
you made me
leering and shit staring at my hogwash.

705
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.310
Cut it up buddy.
What does that,
I'm cut out all the hogs.

706
00:43:01.311 --> 00:43:05.630
Darren would have been fun.
Um,
well it's funny.
Before we got to that,

707
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.390
we were talking about something,
the tank,
the tank.

708
00:43:08.391 --> 00:43:10.750
But what were you going to say?
I need to try it,
man.
That's my point.

709
00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:13.150
<v 4>You know what?
I can do it.
You know what's funny about Andy is when,</v>

710
00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.640
when I do open mics,

711
00:43:14.641 --> 00:43:16.800
you know we're always talking about different comics and stuff,

712
00:43:16.801 --> 00:43:20.640
but every time we,
anyone talks about Andy Dick,
it's always like,
dude,

713
00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:25.320
Andy Dick was at my house last night who was just walking around and going,
hey,

714
00:43:25.321 --> 00:43:27.570
do you guys got beer?
And then he just went into the apartment.

715
00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:31.800
He hung out for like five hours.
Every single person has a story like that.

716
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:36.030
Do you just did you at one time used to just wander the just last year I do

717
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.130
<v 3>just call it [inaudible] someone beat you up or attack you or something like</v>

718
00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:41.660
that.
TMZ Guy.
I pushed,

719
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:46.661
I pushed his camera away and he got mad and actually I grabbed his mic,

720
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:50.540
snapped it off,
and then I was like talking into it,
but it wasn't attached.

721
00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:56.270
And so what did he do?
He pushed me over,
pushed me real.
It's on,
it's on.

722
00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.980
So that it's not your fault?
Yeah,
if I want it to,
but you know what,

723
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:05.540
I wouldn't win.
You don't think you'd win?
Well,
no.
Nobody would believe me.

724
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:07.180
Was there a video or out of the way,

725
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:10.360
you're really not allowed to be just shoving people like that.
I didn't.
Yeah,

726
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:11.120
he shouldn't.

727
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.210
The only way you're supposed to ever shoved someone as if they get in your face

728
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.710
and you're,
you're protecting yourself,

729
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:20.060
I think when you come up to someone and just shoved them,
shoved me my back.

730
00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.650
Did you hear about that woman that got knocked out and a,

731
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.600
I think it was in New York.

732
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.070
Guy and a woman were arguing over a parking spot and the chick was four feet,

733
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:32.250
1100 pounds,
and the guy was a small guy too,
was only like 150 pounds,

734
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.990
but he punched her.

735
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:37.950
She hit him a bunch of times and then he punched her and knocked her unconscious

736
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:41.430
and she fell back and bounced her head off the concrete and now she's fucked.

737
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:45.210
She's got bleeding in the brain.
They had to remove a section of your brain.
Oh,

738
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.080
over a fucking parking spot.
And she started,
she hit him.
Well,

739
00:44:49.081 --> 00:44:51.750
supposedly that's his story,
but who knows what.
We'll remember.

740
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:54.510
The guy was a felon and he had aggravated assault charges.

741
00:44:54.511 --> 00:44:56.320
He had a bunch of charges already in its path.

742
00:44:56.321 --> 00:45:00.540
So he was obviously not a fucking preacher,
you know,
it wasn't a choir boy,

743
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.530
but it's just,
it's so sad when you know,

744
00:45:02.531 --> 00:45:05.700
you hear about violence over nothing like that.
I remember a few,

745
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.440
maybe five years ago,
there was that road rage incident where the people,
I knew,

746
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.300
one of the people barely,

747
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:16.450
I can't even remember though who he was and they got out of their cars to

748
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.330
continue screaming at each other.

749
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:23.550
And then the one guy took out a knife and stabbed him and God,
road rage.

750
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:26.720
A friend of mine,
a friend of mine,
when he was in high school,
uh,

751
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.940
there was a kid who was important to the school from Jamaica.

752
00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:33.660
I came from Jamaica and she hoarded straight.
We was important.

753
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.050
He came from another country.
I mean,
isn't that what it is?
An important word.

754
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:41.310
Students.
So you import products,
import this psychopath,
this guy.
Anyway,

755
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.730
they get in a fight,
an argument about something and they go outside.

756
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:49.410
The kid pulls out a fucking giant kitchen knife,
like a big,

757
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:50.780
the Jamaican Guy Jamaica,

758
00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:54.480
get and just stabs the fuck out of this kid while these suburban high school

759
00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:58.380
kids are freaking out and screaming,
no one's ever seen any violence at all.
Like,

760
00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.200
you know,
a little fist fight.
This guy pulls out a knife.

761
00:46:01.201 --> 00:46:04.920
He's coming straight from Jamaica and just stabs the fuck out of this kid.

762
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.620
I know he didn't die,
but he was in the hospital for almost a year.

763
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.950
Like you had to have like 10 different surgeries.
His whole body was just,
I mean,

764
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:15.140
stabbed him like four or five times and the guts and the guy literally,
you know,

765
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.840
he got cut open like a fish.
I'll never be the same evening stabbing in the guts.

766
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:19.590
What?

767
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:24.590
I never did hear anything more about Artie Lange when,

768
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.040
what happened?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I,
you know,

769
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.220
do we have the same lawyer?
Do you?
Yeah,
and he,

770
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:36.270
but he know I don't see him.
I don't talk to him.

771
00:46:36.271 --> 00:46:38.390
He's in New York out here.
I,
you know,

772
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:41.640
I hadn't done the stern show since he had been on it.
So I have this book,

773
00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:45.620
I'm reading it.
He's doing great.
Is that must be a great rich lawyer?
Well,
I did,

774
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.880
actually,
no,
I did it a few times while he was on it,

775
00:46:47.881 --> 00:46:50.010
but I didn't keep in touch with them unfortunately.

776
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.010
But I did run into this guy once.

777
00:46:53.011 --> 00:46:56.160
It was a real sad moment was way before the attempted suicide.

778
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.850
We were at a bar and,
uh,
this guy,
uh,

779
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.550
we was at a UFC event and this guy apparently was friends with already's

780
00:47:02.551 --> 00:47:04.470
assistant and he just didn't know,

781
00:47:04.471 --> 00:47:07.140
like the assistant didn't know what the fuck to do.
Nobody knew what to do.

782
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.780
Nobody knew what to stop,
but they all thought that he was on this dark,

783
00:47:09.781 --> 00:47:12.750
dark road.
It was all like everyone was scared for him,
you know,

784
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:15.000
and the guy was like,
Hey,
know could you call them up?
And I'm like,

785
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.720
what would I say?
You know,
hey,
already it's,
that's what people are saying.

786
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:23.460
Reagan who you barely know.
I worked with you on man TV in 1994.

787
00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:24.271
And,
uh,

788
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:27.540
I've hung out with you a few times at comedy clubs and stuff and I went to see

789
00:47:27.541 --> 00:47:29.590
him until,
I mean,
I don't know him enough to,
to be

790
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.850
<v 2>exactly the same with me.
And Charlie Sheen really hung out a little,
little bit.</v>

791
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.630
Then when I was having my time,
darkest hour during less than perfect.

792
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:42.140
And you know,
they,
they literally said,
go into rehab or you're fired.

793
00:47:42.141 --> 00:47:47.141
And I went then just fire me and Charlie Sheen and

794
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:50.620
they brought him in to talk to you.

795
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:55.220
He was sober at the time and he really did help me once I got sober and he

796
00:47:55.221 --> 00:47:59.300
helped me.
That's why I reached out.
I don't remember.
I just remember thinking,
Oh,

797
00:47:59.301 --> 00:48:02.510
this is cool Charlie.
She's fucking bad ass.
Fucking cool.

798
00:48:02.511 --> 00:48:04.400
And then you take a picture with them and put them on your Facebook.

799
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:09.530
Now Facebook wasn't around yet even,
but um,
but so I reached out to him,

800
00:48:09.531 --> 00:48:12.880
cause I,
all the,
all my people are saying,
God help your boy.

801
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:17.270
The same things that light me up.
And I'm like,
Ooh,
am I being selfish here?

802
00:48:17.271 --> 00:48:20.330
So I called,
I didn't know his number.
I don't know how to reach him.

803
00:48:20.331 --> 00:48:23.630
But then when he was on Howard Stern,
I'm like,
oh,
I have Howard's number.

804
00:48:23.631 --> 00:48:26.450
I can just call now.
Right.
And so I called in,
but I was calling,

805
00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:31.370
I was calling from this.
Chad and I had a really shitty connection and not out.

806
00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:36.740
He's like,
Oh hey buddy.
And we started to talk and then she could have helped.

807
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:37.970
And then they put in.

808
00:48:37.971 --> 00:48:42.200
Then I really think that you could have helped possibly had I got on the phone,

809
00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:46.600
because if I can get over there and my energy is infectious,
I,

810
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:50.120
if I can get over there,
he,
I can,
I think I could get him to stop.

811
00:48:50.121 --> 00:48:53.420
I tell you what,
I got my assistant to stop drinking and then he had it.

812
00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.970
You've had a fucking seizure on my kitchen floor.
But,
but,

813
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.690
but I just said that's all the more reasons that you really need to fucking stop

814
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:04.760
long period of time.
But it seems like Charlie Sheen,
what what he's doing.

815
00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.100
I mean,
the way he's behaving and acting,

816
00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.700
he's got this crazy like I'm invincible thing going on.
Something's,

817
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.330
you know what just happens?
It's not a magic thing.
What does the ego,

818
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:19.400
I don't know.
I think it's from,
I mean he admits he smokes these rocks,

819
00:49:19.401 --> 00:49:23.540
these seven gram rocks.
Do you know how much that is?
That would be about,

820
00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:28.570
I would say 200 this much cocaine and not just snort and little monkey,

821
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.720
but smoking rocks.

822
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.560
How he's like an ox.

823
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:41.210
Well he's going to suffer in his older years.
See suffering.

824
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:46.170
She's going on.
I've,
I've known you can't come back.
You can bounce back.

825
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:51.940
People that back in the day had heavy cocaine habits and they almost all develop

826
00:49:52.071 --> 00:49:57.071
neurological problems like fucking Parkinson's and all kinds of shit.

827
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:58.910
Guys who have like heavy duty,

828
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:02.450
like Hollywood style smoking it and they get fucking look we,
Richard Pryor,

829
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.120
those guys,
they get fucked up when they get old girl.
Yeah.
You know,

830
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.220
just wondering.
I was wondering if Michael J.
Fox cause he memory,

831
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.050
he made that movie bright lights,
Big City where I was like,

832
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.470
you would a member there is said he was,
he was like in the bathroom.

833
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.530
We've tried it in the toilet and like I wonder if he,

834
00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.050
that's about the same guy who made American psycho,
isn't it?

835
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:25.280
Isn't it by the Bret Easton Ellis?
Didn't I write that as well?
I like it.

836
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.310
Did all those goddamn crazy dark

837
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.860
<v 3>movie.
Not all of them,
but he writes up,
I didn't like American soccer.</v>

838
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:33.030
You did what the book to me.

839
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.750
I remember getting in an argument with someone but not an argument,

840
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.270
but rather a disagreement with someone about the book where they were,

841
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.350
they were saying all he does is like describe all these really fucked up scenes.

842
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.280
And I'm like,
man,
I couldn't disagree more like he,
he's,
he's making,

843
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:49.590
he's not passing any judgment,
all the things he sees and,
and,
and,

844
00:50:49.591 --> 00:50:50.510
and describes to you.

845
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:53.900
But I wouldn't say that it's just making a bunch of shit up.

846
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.260
He's really accurately painting a,

847
00:50:56.270 --> 00:51:00.140
a character assessment of a fucking sociopath and a psychopath.
Like,

848
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:02.640
to me it seemed like he was like,
yeah,

849
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:05.450
he was making all the connections the way a psychopath would make it.

850
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.180
I thought it was brilliant,
you know,
but you know,

851
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:10.010
there's a lot of people that don't like those kind of movies.

852
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.700
<v 2>The,
the violence and the,
then the death and the blood.
That doesn't bother me.</v>

853
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.830
I liked that part.
There's just really,

854
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:20.400
you got to admit there was no story less than zero or American psycho.
Uh,

855
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.290
American second lesson zero is American psycho.
The book had more of a story.

856
00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.650
Yeah.
You know,
it's always the case.
You know,
you'd try to widdle down a bill,

857
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:30.590
a book into a couple of hours of film.
It's just,
it doesn't,

858
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:33.180
what was the last film you liked?
I haven't,

859
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:36.950
don't ask me because I haven't been to a movie in a while.
I liked,

860
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.260
I'm saving my money.
I'm saving my money.

861
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:42.980
I'm saving my money to put a bathroom in my shit.
Yeah.
You don't have a bathroom.

862
00:51:42.981 --> 00:51:47.530
What'd you do know?
Just,
you've got to go into cancer.
I mountain to big,

863
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:50.840
big,
wide mountain,
the whole whole outside.
I have a,

864
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.250
I stay a bucket to make it to once again downplay it.
Right.
Let me explain.

865
00:51:55.251 --> 00:51:59.240
By the way,
I put in five grand to pimp it out.
Really,
really nice.

866
00:51:59.241 --> 00:52:02.270
It's like a man cave.
It's gorgeous.
You're planning on staying there.

867
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.510
I'm going to stay there until my kids are 18 or over and you guys have an

868
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:08.610
agreement in five more years she's wearing,
I don't know.
Yeah,

869
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.390
it's up and down many days I'm like,
I can see why we're not going out anymore.

870
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:18.200
She's,
I'm crazy.
She's a little crazy and we just,
you know,

871
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:20.500
crazy mashes together.
But a lot of times,

872
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:24.020
but I can just go to my man cave and watch Netflix or do whatever,

873
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:28.070
jerk off to porn.
That's nice.
So you're thinking about this with your kids.

874
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:31.640
I'm right there and thank God because it's,
it's at a time where,

875
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.620
especially Jacob,

876
00:52:33.621 --> 00:52:38.621
he's 16 he really needs me to be there and whether he wants it or not,

877
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.870
there's been times where he's been screaming at my face,
but I just,

878
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:44.800
I just absorb it and then I'm thinking,
you know,

879
00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:46.850
this is just years and years of anger.

880
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:51.410
Just let it come out and I just absorb it like a sponge and I don't get mad back

881
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.150
and like he deserves,

882
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:58.151
I deserve to be yelled at and I just let him go and now we're just like super

883
00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:00.230
fucking clothes.

884
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:04.820
And same with my daughter who is 13 five more years and they're adults.

885
00:53:04.821 --> 00:53:08.770
Like I said,
Lucas is as an adult in New York on his own.
Do you,

886
00:53:08.771 --> 00:53:11.300
are using Lucas on one of your shows,
weren't you?

887
00:53:11.301 --> 00:53:14.810
Didn't you have them in the audience for some of your shows which show you and

888
00:53:14.811 --> 00:53:18.550
when were doing live shows?
No,
no,
no.

889
00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.550
He know when we,
when we,
when I still do this,
when we go around the country,

890
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:27.210
which a,
I took a break from because the last time,
last time I did it is,

891
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.680
is when,
uh,
you know,
I got,
I went to jail again a year ago.

892
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:35.430
It's like,
are you kidding me?
I had the best show of my fucking life.
I went out,

893
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:39.210
had a little wine and I had started making out with this guy and the guy was

894
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:41.430
like 30 years old.
Everybody,
I,

895
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.970
this is one thing I didn't talk about all year because there's a lawsuit's still

896
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:48.060
up in the air,
you know,
like that.
So you're not allowed to talk about it.

897
00:53:48.061 --> 00:53:51.090
It's kind of over now while you're talking about,
because it's kind of over.

898
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.930
It's kind of over it.
Yeah.
We're on the tail end of it,
let's say.
But anyhow,

899
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.650
I'm making out with this guy and he's making out with me.
I don't attack them,

900
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:02.520
you know,
I talk and then we start,
we're making out,
his girlfriend comes up,

901
00:54:02.521 --> 00:54:07.260
went berserk.
His girlfriend brought brother is a cop.
Suddenly there's 20 cops.

902
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:11.940
They're tapping me going,
come with me.
Handcuffing.
Just very,
very angry.

903
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.110
It's a from,
you know the Mason Dixon line all the way down south.

904
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:19.710
It's just filled with homophobes.
Right?
Where was this?
It was in West Virginia.

905
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.230
This was in West Virginia.
It's science.

906
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.250
You are even making out with a dude in a bar in Westford Chinchilla.

907
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.860
Consensual man.
Consensual.
I didn't,
right?
Never again.

908
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.230
That's the last time I did the shows have been over a year ago.

909
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.210
It was the best show ever is,

910
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.490
but when I do the show back to the point when I do my live show,

911
00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:39.720
Lucas opens for me and that's all it is,
is not,
he's not in the audience.

912
00:54:39.721 --> 00:54:44.160
I do plan a couple of people,
but I get that.
I do.
I do this thing.

913
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:48.630
I don't want to give it away,
but I get the people there.
It's always someone new.

914
00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:53.250
I find somebody in town who you're selling,
they were suing you.

915
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:57.640
Yeah.
Wow.
I will.
It seems like you should be able to sue them.
I'm trying to,

916
00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:01.170
I know.
Once again,
your story is the boy who cries wolf.

917
00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.150
I don't know if it's completely accurate.
We went there.

918
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.950
I hired the best lawyer in town and I'm taking a picture of you from my folks.

919
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:12.460
They love you so much.
What happened in Columbus,
Ohio.
Here we go.
Um,

920
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.180
I was just pissing in the year.
Do the thumbs up again.
That's good.

921
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:16.920
You were pissing in the street and Columbus,
Ohio.

922
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.390
I'm doing another one because you closed your eyes.
Hang on.
Just here we go.
Um,

923
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.310
well,
you know what?
When you drink as much beer as I do,
right?

924
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.030
I think it was something else was I think he peed on a person or something.

925
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:29.460
I don't know.
I'm not like that.
Well,

926
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:36.510
the lines you won't cross.
So now you,
you've been sober for three months.

927
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:40.290
Are you doing a program?
What are you doing when you're doing the program?

928
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.920
Alcoholics anonymous.
Is that what it is?
Or narcotics anonymous.
If it was,

929
00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:46.080
I wouldn't tell you because it's anonymous.
Oh,

930
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:49.960
but you told me you're doing a program.
It's like you're just a secret name,

931
00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:55.290
let's call it.
Yeah,
no,
no,
I,
I,
yeah,
I'm doing,

932
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.400
I'm doing everything.

933
00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:00.690
Everything known to man that you can do everything known to man,

934
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:05.520
I'm doing a okay.
I've always been fascinated by those.
Uh,
those,

935
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.730
those programs that try to reset the way you're thinking.
And they were,

936
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:12.210
they approached that.
They were,
what did they do?
Did they give you patterns?

937
00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:15.820
At the very least,
it was positive thinking.
That's at the very least,

938
00:56:15.821 --> 00:56:19.500
right at the very most,
at the very most,

939
00:56:19.501 --> 00:56:22.350
I don't know what you believe in spiritually,
but at the very most,

940
00:56:22.351 --> 00:56:26.980
you're actually making like a conscious contact with God,
right?

941
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.740
That's at the very most.
And then at the very least,
if it's,

942
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:33.520
if it's positive thinking,
fuck it.
That's good enough.
Sure.
You know,

943
00:56:33.521 --> 00:56:35.860
if you're praying,
then pray a prayer,

944
00:56:35.861 --> 00:56:39.490
at the very least is positive thoughts.
You know,
you're,

945
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:43.990
you're not sitting there worrying or,
or,
or,
or,
or being angry.

946
00:56:43.991 --> 00:56:47.260
You're praying you're,
you're at the,
once again,
I'll say one more time.

947
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:50.830
At the very least,
your positive thinking.
Remember that back in the 70s?

948
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.970
Positive thinking.
Yeah.
Okay.
I love writing.

949
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:58.920
I love Joe Rogan.
Or should I read,

950
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.700
I love Joe Rogan stone,
the subject.

951
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.230
I want to know like what it's like what does it like when you go into this thing

952
00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:08.440
and you have to sort of submit,
okay,
I have a problem.
You know,

953
00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:12.640
we'll help him do the weird thing for me about the program and I'm going to say

954
00:57:12.641 --> 00:57:15.400
it again.
It fucking works.

955
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.690
You submit and you subscribe and you,

956
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:24.430
you let go and let them,
they literally in the program they'd say,

957
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.660
let us think for you.
Let us hold you up.

958
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:30.610
Let us be,

959
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.510
let us love you until you love yourself.

960
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:38.560
Like let us love you until you learn to love yourself and that and that's

961
00:57:38.561 --> 00:57:42.820
fucking awesome.
You get these people in their 50 years sober,
20 years sober,

962
00:57:42.821 --> 00:57:45.460
even one year sober,
even I have three months.

963
00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:49.360
Even the guy that has four months sober,
I'm like,
wow,
this guy,

964
00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:52.900
I want to hang out with him.
He's got one more month and me,
but you know,

965
00:57:52.901 --> 00:57:55.540
I'm the guy that had that knows the program inside and out.

966
00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:58.510
I've had three years of sobriety in a row.
You know that.

967
00:57:58.511 --> 00:58:01.150
That's when I did the Andy Dick show three years sober.

968
00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:05.770
I don't know if you know that three years.
Now the other thing is,

969
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:09.250
is I don't like,
this is me personally,

970
00:58:09.251 --> 00:58:12.790
I'm going to preface it by saying,
once again it works.

971
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.460
I've seen people get sober and stay sober.

972
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:18.340
I've seen people go into the program and if they drop out of the program,

973
00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:23.000
they're fucked.
Right?
So,
so,
but the thing that that weirds me out,
and it's a,

974
00:58:23.001 --> 00:58:27.250
it's a thing and it's an American thing,
is that they call,

975
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:31.660
they call it a disease.
Okay.
This is where I start getting weird.

976
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.290
So if alcoholism is a disease,
I have a disease.

977
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.500
So it has to be treated and it has to be treated by,

978
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.770
in the program,
there's certain things,

979
00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:46.420
there's steps and that's how you treat it.
Like in cancer,

980
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:47.950
you know,
the,
the,

981
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.730
I don't know what you think about when people get cancer and they get radiation

982
00:58:51.731 --> 00:58:55.030
or the,
or the,
the chemotherapy or whatever like that.

983
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:59.410
I don't believe in all that stuff.
I don't,
I don't,
there's other ways to do it.

984
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:02.150
You know,
like the Gerson therapy,
you know about that.
Okay.

985
00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:06.190
Let me chemotherapies incredibly effective.
And people that have cancer.

986
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:10.900
There's a lot of people who are alive today because you certainly organic diets

987
00:59:10.901 --> 00:59:13.270
and all those things are absolutely fantastic for you.
But they're pretty,

988
00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:17.310
God damn good with chemotherapy these days.
It can.
It can really.
Yeah.
Yup.

989
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.850
Really can't know what you're saying though.

990
00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:23.180
You're much better off having a very healthy and nutrient rich diet and you'll

991
00:59:23.181 --> 00:59:26.120
probably avoid a lot of stuff.
Well,
watch the movie.

992
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:30.560
It was a beautiful truth or the beautiful truth.

993
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:34.250
It's about the curse and therapy.
You'll,
you'll,
okay.
But anyhow,
um,

994
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:38.810
so here's the dichotomy that bugs the fucking shit out of me.

995
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.680
The disease.
So I saw I'm diseased.
Let's just take me I,
Andy,
Dick.

996
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.260
So they'll look at that,
look at that poor fool.
He's just,

997
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:47.630
he's kind of to see alcoholism.

998
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:52.900
So then when I'm on the streets of Hollywood in the midst and in the throes,

999
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:57.020
t,
h,
r,
O,
e,

1000
00:59:57.110 --> 01:00:00.380
s when I'm right in the middle of my disease,

1001
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:05.120
up to my eyeballs,
in the sickness of it all,
I mean what I,

1002
01:00:05.121 --> 01:00:07.950
what I'm talking about,
it's like stumbling around and I can't,
you know,

1003
01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.793
like help me,

1004
01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:13.810
why do people laugh at that and take pictures of it and then you're playing

1005
01:00:15.891 --> 01:00:19.040
dumb.
You know exactly what they're doing.
That's a freak show that exactly.

1006
01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:20.780
But that's the dichotomy.
If you saw,

1007
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.810
if you saw somebody with w with multiple sclerosis,
with those,

1008
01:00:23.811 --> 01:00:26.660
with those things that are there with those,
those,
those,
um,

1009
01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:29.090
sticks that you walk with you and going,
oh,
look at him.

1010
01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:32.930
And way over simplifying it,
it's not that simple.

1011
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:37.280
It's not something that I'm,
that I am simplifying.
It's that simple.

1012
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:42.170
They that you'd have much more sympathy and much more compassion for somebody

1013
01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:46.610
who really does habit disease.
So that's the,
my pulling the so,

1014
01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.820
so do I have a disease or not?
You fucking assholes.
Listen to you.
If,

1015
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:53.450
if you don't feel good,
if you're sick and if you have issues,
it's a disease.

1016
01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:56.390
If it's a mental disease of addiction,
it's a disease.

1017
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.330
Any addiction to jerking off is a disease.

1018
01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.420
Do you have that Dell often teacher come?
I'm pretty good about it.

1019
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:07.040
Just like twice a day.
No more than once a day.
What about your word,
your girl?

1020
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.790
I fuck her every day.
Whenever I want to settle down,

1021
01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.030
I'm creeping mother fucker.
I'm sending an addiction.

1022
01:01:14.031 --> 01:01:17.600
I don't have an addiction issue in that regard.
I have addictions to games.

1023
01:01:17.601 --> 01:01:19.610
I have addictions,
I get addictions to activities.

1024
01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:22.580
What's your favorite game right now?
I don't,
I don't play any video games.

1025
01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:26.480
Can you stop?
I can't do it.
I have the same thing online for eight,

1026
01:01:26.481 --> 01:01:30.480
10 hours at a time.
I can't stop.
It's just too much fun.
Really fucking fun.

1027
01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:37.460
Back at toe jam and Earl,
I played all the way to the end.

1028
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:41.240
I don't remember toe jam.
Oh,
what was that on Nintendo?
Uh,
yeah,

1029
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:44.990
I think it was on that toe jam and Earl,
I beat the fucking thing.

1030
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:48.040
And then I went,
you know what?
Now I'm done.
But you sit by,

1031
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:51.860
I don't understand why you're getting upset about this classification.

1032
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:53.570
Classification of addiction.

1033
01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:55.220
I don't know why because I don't believe it's a disease.

1034
01:01:55.221 --> 01:01:59.090
I think I drink a fucking ass low.
I think I,
I have a pro,

1035
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.270
you know I drink a lot.
I don't think it's a decent,
let me tell you this.

1036
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:06.770
If it's a disease,
if I had multiple sclerosis,
I stopped.
Silly.

1037
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:09.480
Simplify.
You're simplifying it.
You not,

1038
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.370
there's a bunch of different kinds of diseases.

1039
01:02:11.371 --> 01:02:14.240
It's just like there's a bunch of different kinds of drugs.
Caffeine is a drug.

1040
01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.590
Explain to me why pain is a dry explained to me of different why?

1041
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:21.900
Why it's a disease or why you're saying you have a mouse ease.

1042
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:23.340
I'm not drinking now.
No.

1043
01:02:23.341 --> 01:02:25.950
Right now you feeling figured out how to stop doing it for awhile,

1044
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:30.120
but the cancer can you figure out how to not have cancer so it's a type of

1045
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:33.000
disease that you think you are.
It doesn't mean it's not a disease.
I didn't.

1046
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:36.210
I ended when you woke up,
did you want alcohol?

1047
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:38.340
Right when you woke up this morning?
No.
No.
Like,

1048
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:41.910
like when you were into right when you woke up,
you want him to drink?

1049
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.250
I needed to really,
I'd have to design your body addicted to it.

1050
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:47.190
I would get weird,

1051
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:52.800
strange that we become physically addicted and connected to substances that are

1052
01:02:52.801 --> 01:02:57.000
bad for us.
That is weird.
So what else was czar human trait?
I know,

1053
01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:57.900
that's why my friend,

1054
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:03.140
my assistant who is my friend collapsed flopping around like a fucking fish

1055
01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:05.840
cause he didn't do it the right way.
He wasn't careful about it.

1056
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.230
Taper off man drinking a lot.
Is that what I want to,
so I would ask him,

1057
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.680
cause he lives in Orange County and he,
he did say a week ago,

1058
01:03:13.681 --> 01:03:18.090
I'm in kind of in a bad place and I said well get your shit together and get up

1059
01:03:18.091 --> 01:03:20.550
here.
I need help.
He has a truck and I bought this loft bed.

1060
01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:23.370
I'm trying to open my space up right in my shed.

1061
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:26.050
I've got this gigantic queen bed that takes up half the thing.

1062
01:03:26.051 --> 01:03:29.430
So now I'm getting a loft bed and I'm going to have a hope to,
or I'm going to,

1063
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:32.820
I'll send you pictures.
Going to do like a youtube video and edicts cribs.

1064
01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:36.670
I just invite you over.
I thought about doing the USTREAM.

1065
01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.380
Ustream first came out,
I was on it for,
I was addicted to it.

1066
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:42.210
I was sober because I was wearing that ankle thing.

1067
01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:45.690
There was another whole year I had it.
Lindsay Lohan ankle thing.

1068
01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:48.270
She worked for a month.
I wore that fucking thing for a year.

1069
01:03:48.271 --> 01:03:53.271
You fucking [inaudible] made you be sober for a year.

1070
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:57.660
But it's not even that.
I could just smoke weed while you're on that thing.

1071
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:01.470
I found that out like in the last month.
I was so fucking,

1072
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.770
cause it wasn't,
there was only a month left,

1073
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:08.230
but I was [inaudible].

1074
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.010
So you thought that it was only,
it's only alcohol and then I don't know why.

1075
01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:16.770
I finally said,
wait a minute.
And then I looked online,

1076
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:20.040
I asked a bunch of people and I tested it and I was scared shitless.

1077
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:24.330
He went to jail.
If you drink on it,
you'd go to jail.
And I don't like jail.

1078
01:04:24.331 --> 01:04:25.440
Jail is unpleasant.

1079
01:04:25.441 --> 01:04:29.790
What was the rumor that she had gotten it from Kombucha tea?

1080
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:33.120
Cause Kombucha tea fermented that remember that?
No,

1081
01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:34.470
I don't remember that but that that would be,

1082
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:38.880
that's what you're saying because they pulled it off the shelves.
GTS,
Kombucha.

1083
01:04:38.881 --> 01:04:41.730
They pulled them hopeful and I know about that but,
but even if it's a,

1084
01:04:41.731 --> 01:04:44.060
even if it did some big country town.

1085
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.510
Yeah cause you can tell mine because mine went off a couple times when I was

1086
01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:52.800
performing at nightclubs because of the booze vapors just coming up from the

1087
01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:53.400
floor.

1088
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:58.400
But they can tell it was so minute like it wasn't even a shot of alcohol vapor

1089
01:04:58.981 --> 01:05:03.080
that comes out.
That's what I mean.
It's pretty good coming out of your pores.

1090
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:07.560
Pretty sensitive.
Very sensitive.
How do you know?
Did you have to wear one?
No,

1091
01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:09.940
I just know about it.
I asked her,

1092
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:13.820
I believe I wore for a year nor for a whole year.
Where's the fruit?

1093
01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:16.920
What did you get arrested for?
That you had to wear it for a year.
What was it?

1094
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:19.451
I wonder why it,
oh no,

1095
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:23.080
that was the one I was talking about earlier in buffalo wild wings into in

1096
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:25.870
Temecula and I couldn't talk about it ever.

1097
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:28.210
So I can never tell my side the,

1098
01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.320
but the way they describe it is that I went up to this girl and ripped her top

1099
01:05:33.701 --> 01:05:38.050
down and not true at all on my assistant once baby Andy,

1100
01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:43.000
Dick rips her top down hand,
the middle of Wild Wayne didn't happen.

1101
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.360
First of all,
wild wings it,
you know it,

1102
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:49.920
she shouldn't have been there after hours.
It's a bar.
And,
and she would have,

1103
01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:50.381
the thing is,

1104
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:55.381
is that she was 17 she wanted an autograph and a hug and I gave her a hug and

1105
01:05:55.511 --> 01:05:58.000
that was it.
And then she,
she said that,

1106
01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:02.880
that I ripped her shirt down.
Say anything creepy to her,
you know,

1107
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:07.120
maybe I say it.
Oh,
what?
You're so beautiful.
I'm always complimenting everybody.

1108
01:06:07.121 --> 01:06:10.630
I always feel obligated.
And the thing is,
is that she was overweight.

1109
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:14.900
She wasn't very attractive.
I always feel obligated to give people compliments.

1110
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.450
I feel like they need it and they want it.

1111
01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:19.570
And that it really validates them if it's coming from a celebrity,

1112
01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:24.320
you know that I ever feel that,
that you feel obligated to be like you.

1113
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.070
I definitely feel obligated to be nice to be able,
but I want to,

1114
01:06:27.071 --> 01:06:31.090
I think you have a unique opportunity to enable one good.
Yeah,
you can.

1115
01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:31.990
And that's what I was doing.

1116
01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:35.630
And then she fucking flipped it around so she was just crazy.
So we usually,

1117
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:39.310
and it's proven because her,
her friend called me,

1118
01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:42.010
found me and called me and said,
just so you know,

1119
01:06:42.011 --> 01:06:46.180
she's playing you and here's the,
this is back during my space.
She was like,

1120
01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:49.680
here's the mice based messages that she's sending to me.
And all her friends go,

1121
01:06:49.681 --> 01:06:53.520
oh,
I got this guy and I'm going to get money out of them.
And I,

1122
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.040
and it was fun because I did,

1123
01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:59.500
I did an interview for the paper and I pretended to cry.
Wow,
whoa.

1124
01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:02.350
Got All this on my spice all,
why don't you put this online?

1125
01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:07.530
Because nobody will believe me.
I'll believe you.
I'll read it to the only one.

1126
01:07:07.531 --> 01:07:10.650
I'll tell her.
But it's true.
Do you understand the point?
It's the boy who cried.

1127
01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.790
You have these mindspace messages.
Do you have the actual photo of the month?

1128
01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.850
I've already done my time.

1129
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.720
I wore the notes to labor the year the thing is over.

1130
01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.550
It's behind me.
It's done.
Andy.
dick.com needs an update.
What's his bitches name?

1131
01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.820
I don't even know.
No,
don't do that.
No,
I really don't know.

1132
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:31.610
I don't know why I'm telling you though.
Freaks.

1133
01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.350
I'll do it took quite a lot of past with,

1134
01:07:33.351 --> 01:07:35.400
and that's not even counting the people worldwide.

1135
01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:38.140
How many freaks are listening to this thing?
They're loving it as a parent.

1136
01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:40.480
My friends are leather and in Russia,

1137
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:44.680
my followers are loving what we're doing right now that love it.
Powerful.

1138
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:49.630
The Andy Dick follows assholes and least you finally came out of the closet to

1139
01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:53.830
people and I always talked about liking guys from day one.

1140
01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:55.450
This guy had not read all your interviews.

1141
01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:59.350
He's just extrapolating what he wants out of Russell Smith.

1142
01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.210
Fucking let's don't do this.
I want to know.

1143
01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:05.380
I'll just read this and get on negative.
You're right.
I'm not like that.

1144
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:08.110
Are you know you're going to have really not.
I growed.
We had,

1145
01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.450
we already tried this on the podcast,
but rain,

1146
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.530
we had a chat room for a while and it doesn't work.
It doesn't work.

1147
01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.410
What I love to do,
talk to my nigger.

1148
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.160
My nigger client is someone saying like a hundred times,
it's like equal.

1149
01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:22.940
It just would do anything to get attention.

1150
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.930
It's like everybody wants to hear that.
I'd be looking to do anything.

1151
01:08:26.931 --> 01:08:29.120
That's what I love about Twitter.

1152
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:33.530
I'm in love with it because I control my world and it's all a bunch of
lovebirds.

1153
01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:37.220
If there's problem later when you come up with a creative way of saying,
Oh,

1154
01:08:37.221 --> 01:08:41.840
I'm sorry that you feel that way.
How do you feel about being dot that Tata?
Tata?

1155
01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:46.750
I always go to [inaudible] blocked and then I go to their thing and I block them

1156
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:48.280
all haters.

1157
01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.730
<v 3>You know when someone,
I block a lot of haters.
Yeah,
that's all good Andy.</v>

1158
01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.720
But what we're saying is when you read all this shit while we're online,

1159
01:08:55.721 --> 01:08:59.440
while we're doing it,
it gets,
it cuts the conversation off.
We learned.

1160
01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:01.810
Let me close this,
close that shit.
Fuck.

1161
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.360
You can't get on Twitter and just deal with all these negative people and have

1162
01:09:04.361 --> 01:09:06.710
fights with him.
I don't I,

1163
01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:10.360
that's when you're on a show like this is you're broadcasting something.

1164
01:09:10.361 --> 01:09:14.020
There's a heightened need to be paid attention to,
so you'll get alone.

1165
01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:19.090
You would have a lot to say about somebody who said it's you finally committed

1166
01:09:19.091 --> 01:09:23.110
core sis.
They're silly people out there,
man.
They don't know you.

1167
01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:27.180
They should just go,
oh,
I guess Andy Dick's gay,
and I didn't know it.
I'm not gay,

1168
01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:29.980
by the way.
Sometimes I'll be gay with you

1169
01:09:32.650 --> 01:09:34.620
<v 2>gay for this day,
for this day,</v>

1170
01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:39.650
<v 3>it's Mexicans use it in prison.
I'm going to go to prison bone each other.</v>

1171
01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.630
They call it gay for this day.
What does that mean?

1172
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.060
Just to make them make a deal and they're gonna fuck some dudes when they're in

1173
01:09:44.061 --> 01:09:46.370
jail and then when they get out there,
they're back home.

1174
01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:50.180
Gay for this day during the stay,
while we're in prison,

1175
01:09:50.181 --> 01:09:52.130
we're going to fuck some dudes.
And then when you get out,

1176
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.160
it's all only girls were in a sort of a prison of our own right now.

1177
01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.140
Is that your sleazy guy rose?
I wonder why you have been acting lately.
You're at

1178
01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:07.530
<v 2>all the time.
I die really?
Halloween.</v>

1179
01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.690
I did two episodes of community with Chevy Chase.
You don't watch TV?

1180
01:10:12.691 --> 01:10:15.510
Prunes commute in there.
Why Washi it's on NBC.
Everything.

1181
01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:19.770
I watched the strange and most times I'm probably going to be doing,

1182
01:10:19.771 --> 01:10:21.000
I got offered two parts,

1183
01:10:21.001 --> 01:10:25.110
but I was not in a good place and I said no both times and I had not seen the

1184
01:10:25.111 --> 01:10:29.580
show,
but it's called drop dead diva.
It's a girl show.
Fucking love it.

1185
01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.860
I'm addicted to it.
Why don't I love it?

1186
01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:35.460
I've seen every episode twice at least because I'm showing it to all the green.

1187
01:10:35.461 --> 01:10:38.040
You know I live in a house of girls.
Oh,
I live in the shed and in the,

1188
01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:40.980
in the main house there's five girls,
right?
I said no,

1189
01:10:40.981 --> 01:10:43.350
because I was not in a good place then they didn't know the show.

1190
01:10:43.351 --> 01:10:46.830
I thought dropped a diva.
That sounds like a a reality show about.

1191
01:10:46.831 --> 01:10:51.390
I'm about runway models.
I,
I didn't know,
but it's a very clever,

1192
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.290
awesome show that does empower women.
It's on lifetime.
So it's a woman's show.

1193
01:10:55.291 --> 01:10:56.040
But once again,
I'm,

1194
01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:01.040
I'm in love with it and Margaret Cho is on it and she said so twice.

1195
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:04.480
And then I finally saw him and I called Margaret back and I,

1196
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.800
and I got in touch with the Creator's name Josh.
And I said,
dude,

1197
01:11:07.801 --> 01:11:10.290
I was out of my mind.
I don't know what was wrong with me.

1198
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:14.160
But you're so fucking rocks.
Go to see it.
I don't know

1199
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.630
<v 3>if you'll like it.
Okay.
Cause your,
your,
your girl might lie.
Shut out.</v>

1200
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.220
It's not like fluffy girly.
It's like it's powerful women.

1201
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:28.200
I bet you're a girl.
I know her but I can't remember Jessica.
Good

1202
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:34.400
motherfucker.
Well you already said her name.
I fucked up once.
What,
what,
what,

1203
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:39.330
what?
They don't know her last Farrah Fawcett like what's listen,

1204
01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:43.500
I want to get to know what,
so what you're trying to do now,

1205
01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:47.070
by all this cleaning yourself up,
you're trying to really start working again.

1206
01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:50.160
That's what you're trying to do.
It's mostly for my kids,

1207
01:11:50.161 --> 01:11:54.390
but then after a few weeks of being clean,
I'm fucking bored.
Right.
Yeah.

1208
01:11:54.391 --> 01:11:55.850
I'd love to.
I'd love to have a comeback.

1209
01:11:56.850 --> 01:12:00.360
Weird for like two years that just do nothing.
Nothing.

1210
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:02.140
Oh do that.

1211
01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.650
Didn't work out through all your money to write quickly.
Ah,
it's horrible.

1212
01:12:07.651 --> 01:12:11.280
You've got to make money doing horrible.
You do.
You're very good at it.

1213
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.660
You must not only be well off on a day to day basis doing great,

1214
01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:20.790
but you must have so much fucking cash tucked away in in accounts,

1215
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:24.960
maybe even buried in your fucking backyard knowing you with all your old

1216
01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:25.920
Buddhists.
I bet.

1217
01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:30.300
I bet with all his conspiracy theories and all the shit the underground weird

1218
01:12:30.301 --> 01:12:33.640
shit is into because cause I know cause lean,
my ex,

1219
01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:38.520
his mom is telling us,
buy silver,
buy gold,

1220
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.910
buy bullion and we'll find a place and bury it.
I want to tell you right now,

1221
01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:45.020
let me just ask you,
since you don't have any silver,
you,

1222
01:12:45.021 --> 01:12:47.280
I don't have any gold buried anyway.
When this shit,

1223
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:51.330
you're going to need it bullets and gasoline.
That's what you're going to need.

1224
01:12:51.331 --> 01:12:53.760
You're not going to need gold.
I don't give a fuck about your goals.

1225
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:58.230
Do you have any venison?
I need to feed my children.

1226
01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:01.080
It's not going to be gold,
man.
That goal is nonsense.
Gold.

1227
01:13:01.081 --> 01:13:04.440
Maybe a thousand years after the apocalypse when people started to develop,

1228
01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:06.510
you know,
some sort of monetary system.
Again,

1229
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.330
when you ask then you need to have a car and,

1230
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:12.690
and you know you need to light things on fire and you shouldn't go very far.

1231
01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:16.520
You're going to,
I heard you need like a hummer because when the olives comes,

1232
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:19.500
it's thing.
There's earthquakes and you're going,
there's no roads anymore.

1233
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.860
You're going to need biofuel.
You don't need a farm.

1234
01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:26.070
You don't need to make corn and make your own fuel.
Well,
we're halfway there.

1235
01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.040
It's,
we have comp,
we have for compost heaps.
We,

1236
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.960
we were were getting more comfortable.

1237
01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:34.800
It's good to have a food that you actually grow and develop in your own yard.

1238
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.720
That's a definitely a God damn smart thing.

1239
01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:39.660
I mean we trust so much in the food system that's in place right now,

1240
01:13:39.661 --> 01:13:43.680
but they're constantly finding new asteroids that are heading our way.

1241
01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.400
Constantly finding meteor impacts.
They just found a big one in the Congo.

1242
01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:52.640
A big meteor impact is this your masturbation lotion and my cds isn't even my

1243
01:13:53.251 --> 01:13:57.450
fucking house,
Dude.
It's not going to vote.
Everyone does.
It's not bad.

1244
01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:01.160
It's right by the computer.
Just lotion bro.

1245
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:05.670
I like the shit you say and you pick up is lotion and it's freaking you out
here.

1246
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:11.050
This is better.
You really honestly though your name are you read?

1247
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:12.100
Yeah.

1248
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.980
<v 2>Okay.
I read.
Everybody's talking about you on my thing.</v>

1249
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:18.250
So you really do use this to masturbate.
Yeah,
and that's,

1250
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:22.950
that's where that computer,
when I'm over there behind here.
No,
I knew when he is,

1251
01:14:22.951 --> 01:14:24.070
when he's on his computer,

1252
01:14:24.071 --> 01:14:29.071
he has this [inaudible] on this computer that I just spit on my hand when I'm on

1253
01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:30.170
that couch.

1254
01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:34.040
<v 1>What?
What happens to you when the wheels fall off?
What is it that makes you,</v>

1255
01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:36.800
I know you're gone,
but no,
no.

1256
01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:39.010
If you've gone like all these years without being with,

1257
01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:41.330
without drinking or anything,
you've gone like three years in a row,

1258
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:46.190
being completely sober.
What,
what sets it off?
Um,

1259
01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:50.120
what gets you right back to it when you know that it's bad for you?
Uh,
well,

1260
01:14:50.121 --> 01:14:51.380
I just seems fun,

1261
01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:55.840
<v 2>but that's the point I get to a place where,
you know what?
I can ha,</v>

1262
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:58.240
I can drink a little beer,
I can have little,

1263
01:14:58.241 --> 01:15:02.590
I can smoke a little pot and then it doesn't happen overnight.

1264
01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.410
<v 1>You should slowly slow.
It takes months and months in really,
really?</v>

1265
01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.170
Do you ever start out like,
y'all,
hey,

1266
01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:12.140
I'll just have a little beer and smoke a little pot and then that night I'm

1267
01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:13.830
looking at weed coke.
No,

1268
01:15:13.831 --> 01:15:16.160
I'm just going to say it then stop doing it for a couple of weeks.

1269
01:15:16.161 --> 01:15:20.360
I've done that and then start it up again.
Yeah.
Settling in the world,

1270
01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:23.660
honestly,
impulsive thing or is it a physical

1271
01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:25.270
<v 2>Dang,
I think,</v>

1272
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.220
I honestly think the crux of the issue is boredom and,
and,

1273
01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.330
and I get to a place,
and I already knew with Dr True about this.

1274
01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:36.970
I asked him right to his face.
Do you think I'm an alcoholic?

1275
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:42.060
He doesn't even answer.
He just laughs hysterically.
It doesn't say yesterday.

1276
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.750
I mean the answer is in his laughter.
Right.
But,
uh,
but to me,
the doctor drew,

1277
01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:49.780
he's a sweetheart.
Laughs at,
you know,

1278
01:15:49.781 --> 01:15:54.370
but ask him if alcoholic and he really is a sweet.
I know.
It really is.

1279
01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:58.540
He's helped me immensely.
I just called him Jim yesterday.
Well,
because Mike,

1280
01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:02.500
while I talked to him as a we're,
we're doctor patient now.
We're not,

1281
01:16:02.501 --> 01:16:05.880
have you ever been on a show?
Of course.
Celebrity Rehab.
Yeah.

1282
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.230
I remember I was in the sober house.
You didn't know that.

1283
01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.810
I didn't really don't watch TV.
I try not to watch those things.

1284
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.250
It's doctor Jared,
gentle kisser.
Brian.
He's like me,

1285
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:19.370
me and him.
If you weren't here,
we would talk about what launches.
No,

1286
01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:26.700
he's a good looking guy.
But Hey,
mass won't shut him down.

1287
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:31.840
Shut him down in his own home.
At least make the boy feel good.

1288
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:35.470
So let me ask you,
I had made one quick question.

1289
01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.490
Have you ever had a homosexual experience?
Uh,
no.
Yup.

1290
01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.590
<v 1>Yeah.
What's the apart?
The fuck is that about it?</v>

1291
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.870
Even if it's just a little looking or,
well,
you know what the a is really,

1292
01:16:45.871 --> 01:16:49.290
he's a girl.
So every experience he has,
what girls are homosexual.
He spirits

1293
01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:50.411
<v 2>because you're a girl.</v>

1294
01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:55.270
So he's like technically the gassing everyday did I used to play doctor with my

1295
01:16:55.271 --> 01:16:59.110
friend I growing up,
but we'd play doctor on other girls.

1296
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.320
So while you were doing what kind of gay while you were naked.
Huh?

1297
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.830
Would you be naked?
Can we all be nick?
Three girls and me and this guy.

1298
01:17:05.831 --> 01:17:09.150
But we were like,
well why would the doctor need to be naked?
Huh?

1299
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:12.320
Why is the doctor name they don't ask questions,
don't ask questions.

1300
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:17.200
I'm asked is a malpractice doctors,
hey,
I smell it.
They believed it.

1301
01:17:17.210 --> 01:17:20.270
They believed it.
Andy Dick knows a thing or two about lawsuits.

1302
01:17:20.271 --> 01:17:22.620
He sees one coming.
You might want to listen when they,

1303
01:17:22.621 --> 01:17:25.940
Andy Dick says you're on the path to ruin.
Oh,
you better listen.

1304
01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.100
You might want to pull over and read the map.

1305
01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:30.860
There's nothing wrong with sugar and some eight year old girls.

1306
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:34.280
Well when you're young,
as in when you're a,
well,

1307
01:17:34.281 --> 01:17:36.500
I don't think you're really tricking them.
You're all tricking each other.

1308
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:38.930
Well obviously that wasn't a good doctor.
Like he said,

1309
01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.370
doctors don't take off their clothes.

1310
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:43.440
They do in some youporn videos does a few of the doctor takes office.

1311
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:45.920
I must happen.
You know,

1312
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:49.550
because you always hear about dentists molesting their patients when they're
out.

1313
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:54.230
Yeah,
it must,
it must be like attractive doc.
Do you ever see that?
Yeah.

1314
01:17:54.231 --> 01:17:58.880
That was Stephen Root plays Louis C.
Case dentist.
Yes.

1315
01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.350
And he puts him under and then he starts,

1316
01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:05.660
he's literally just tripping out and then he goes into a dream and he's,

1317
01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:09.350
he's talking to a Sama,
been loud and talking to a Sama of Atlanta who is,

1318
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.810
I think that's chuck Sklar.
Chuck's car.

1319
01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.130
And then he starts Osama,
or one of his,

1320
01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.270
his minions at one of his minions starts giving him a banana.

1321
01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:24.260
Flambe go.
Just take it.
Eat it.
It's a banana and the banana.

1322
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:28.070
I don't know that Stephen Root in the dream in the dream at Stephen root cause

1323
01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:31.910
comes into his dream saying it's just a banana.
Take it,
but it's like I said,

1324
01:18:31.911 --> 01:18:35.120
the peel still on it and he wakes up and then,

1325
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:38.150
and then Steven Rita's zipping up the zipper and go and you're done.

1326
01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:41.210
There was nothing wrong with your teeth.
You're done.
You're fine.
Move.

1327
01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:43.860
It's sets a good episode.
So hard core.

1328
01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:49.690
I love that she even brutes stuck his Dick Louie seat case mouth as a dentist.

1329
01:18:50.071 --> 01:18:52.690
It must happen all the time.
It happened to a friend of mine.

1330
01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:54.520
I wrote a little song about it.
Yeah.
What happened?

1331
01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:58.430
He'd said that he got put under but then he said that he liked it and he would

1332
01:18:58.431 --> 01:19:02.900
go back.
Joe,
he said he got put under to the point where the dentist Facteau.

1333
01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.640
Wow.
Jesus Christ.
That's crazy.
He said he liked it and he kept going back.

1334
01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.820
He said he learned to like it and it probably learn to like if he was out cold.

1335
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:13.610
How does he learn to like it cause you to wake up?
I don't know.

1336
01:19:13.611 --> 01:19:17.280
I don't know if he was alcohol.
I think I,
if I said that I,
I take it back out.

1337
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.870
I think he just got to the place where it was.
It was just so,
you know,

1338
01:19:20.871 --> 01:19:25.130
you know that stuff is hard core.
I remember,
what is it called?
A nitrous oxide.

1339
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:29.180
Nitric oxide you,
I take it when if I have,
I hate,

1340
01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:32.720
I haven't gone to the dentist.
Here's,
I really tried to sell it.
I'm afraid of it,

1341
01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.070
but,
but I remember just,
I would always say I take it on your own without,
oh no,

1342
01:19:37.071 --> 01:19:40.040
no,
no.
At the dentist office I would say I would,

1343
01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:44.640
I would feel it and I still feel,
I don't feel anything I,
it's like I would,

1344
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:49.400
I would make them turn it up and I can hear it going.
I can hear it going home,

1345
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:52.790
but I'm still like,
I still,
I really,

1346
01:19:52.791 --> 01:19:56.240
I still feel completely normal,
but really I'm like starting to roll.

1347
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:59.520
Things are echoing like that.
Like I feel like I'm at a race.

1348
01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.550
Then there's [inaudible] staying conscious just so that you can crank it to the

1349
01:20:04.551 --> 01:20:07.770
MAG.
Why screaming?
I started screaming,

1350
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.340
bring home the good doctor.

1351
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:14.970
How are you staying awake?

1352
01:20:14.971 --> 01:20:18.540
Are they shocked at the dosage they're able to give you your tolerance must be

1353
01:20:18.541 --> 01:20:21.420
through the roof out there.
It must be your body's probably,

1354
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.370
oh we got some new shit.
It process it,
process it.
We're working bonds.

1355
01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:29.400
Double Time,
double time.
There's mopping up,
whatever the fuck you're taking in.

1356
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:33.210
They just the whole crew.
A cleanup crew like for the Valdez oil spill.

1357
01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:37.650
Well bunch of dudes in orange suits throughout your body and just ready to rush

1358
01:20:37.651 --> 01:20:38.520
off toxic.

1359
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.810
I'm telling you my body is my friend about three years ago said you,

1360
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.670
I've never seen anybody drink as much as you do.
I'm sending you to my doctors.

1361
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.550
A specialist are going to take blood tests,
is going to do a liver test,

1362
01:20:49.551 --> 01:20:53.700
a kidney tests,
all the fuck yes.
After we got 10 fucking

1363
01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:55.740
I'll keep,

1364
01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:00.740
didn't he play each other fucking test and this is in the midst of me drinking.

1365
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:02.491
I said,
fine,

1366
01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:05.400
I'll do it cause you know you might be right and I want to stay alive.

1367
01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:08.250
I don't want to die.
Right.
Every test came back and they said,

1368
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.910
you have the liver of a 15 year old soccer player.

1369
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:16.490
You are completely healthy,
your blood is 100% awesome.

1370
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.210
You were drinking all the time,
all the time.

1371
01:21:18.211 --> 01:21:21.150
But I was in the world soccer player and I was also drinking.

1372
01:21:21.151 --> 01:21:24.580
Then I was also doing this and I and I do exercise.

1373
01:21:24.581 --> 01:21:26.580
Like I said back then I used to run five miles a day.

1374
01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:29.940
All that stuff is just cleaning up all the alcohol in the exercise.

1375
01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:30.751
But like I said,

1376
01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:33.870
I'm stone cold sober and I plan on being this way for a very long time.

1377
01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:35.730
Too many people have died,
you know,

1378
01:21:35.731 --> 01:21:40.470
might star just about Mike Start yesterday and Mike D's define Austin chains

1379
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:42.570
bassist and he was on celebrity rehab.

1380
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:46.080
They just a clip on him on the opie and Anthony show this morning clip of him

1381
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.540
calling in somewhere and,
and,
and,

1382
01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:51.660
and talking to like a drug dealer or something like that.
You know,
ask,

1383
01:21:51.661 --> 01:21:55.090
ask him for weed and he's just sworn as or I like,

1384
01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.420
we really hard to understand what the fuck you saying.
Yeah.

1385
01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:02.310
I honestly believe God is putting this in my face and saying,
Hey,

1386
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:05.550
your next Mr Dick cleaned it up.
My,

1387
01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:08.880
my assistant flopping around on my kitchen floor with blood everywhere.

1388
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:14.520
Why don't you just get like a really big guy as an assistant and so in like

1389
01:22:14.521 --> 01:22:17.150
you'd pay him like,
look,
don't let me fucking ever drink or not.

1390
01:22:17.151 --> 01:22:19.860
That doesn't work.
I have to just want it.

1391
01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.760
That doesn't work then you don't know Andy.

1392
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.540
If we try to keep it away from him like that,
it will repress.

1393
01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:27.010
He'll go crazy and they'll do everything in your face.
I'm tracking,

1394
01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.140
I'm tracking your face,

1395
01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.620
fucking throwing shots and you tell him your idea for a game show.

1396
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:34.110
It's called let's get Andy Dick arrested and this is what it is.

1397
01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.070
It's sort of the show they do.
Where's the game part there?
That just,

1398
01:22:38.071 --> 01:22:41.640
it just happens naturally.
A young boy in his underwear rings your doorbell.

1399
01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:46.530
Ding Dong.
You're like,
come on in.
Cops tackle you.
It's like,

1400
01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:50.790
that's a,
that's a myth by the way.
I don't go after young girls or boys.

1401
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:56.130
Every,
every guy and girl I'm with.
I have a girlfriend right now.

1402
01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.150
She's 21 you know they're always on there.

1403
01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:03.180
Have you ever thought a trainee and that would seem like that you would be so

1404
01:23:03.181 --> 01:23:06.280
attracted to train Chinese?
No.
When I went,
when I like my,

1405
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:09.400
like my women to be women and I like my men to be men.
Right?

1406
01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:14.680
And I keep it separate and I also don't like threesomes.
I had a couple,

1407
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:18.610
they see it.
I like,
I'll have a girlfriend,
I'll be like,
black guy's so cute.

1408
01:23:18.611 --> 01:23:21.040
Let's,
let's have a threesome.
And what it always,

1409
01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:25.050
it happened twice and I don't do it anymore.
And it ultimately,
it's those two,

1410
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.630
you know,
I fuck and I,
and then,
and then he's there and I'm kind of into him.

1411
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:31.510
But then they started fucking,
and then I'm standing next to the bed going,

1412
01:23:31.511 --> 01:23:35.800
are you guys almost done?
I don't like it.

1413
01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:40.570
I'll never do it again.
You should talk about that on stage.
I just did it over.

1414
01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:44.050
Do you do standard,
eager?
We create the,
do you still do standup?

1415
01:23:44.051 --> 01:23:47.350
I want to start writing.
I do this weird.
You've never seen my show.

1416
01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:52.351
I do have this weird aversion glomeration of music and I tell stories like that.

1417
01:23:52.481 --> 01:23:55.210
I have never told that.
And like I said,

1418
01:23:55.211 --> 01:23:59.170
music and I do characters at the very end,
Daphne Aguilera comes out,

1419
01:23:59.171 --> 01:24:00.460
I don't know if you know that character,

1420
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:05.350
Daphne Agular you can go watch it from your MTV show.
Love that show by the way.

1421
01:24:05.351 --> 01:24:08.320
Thank you.
That was one that culminates the best the best.

1422
01:24:08.321 --> 01:24:10.750
I went to [inaudible] last week and they said,

1423
01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.810
cause they're talking about they want me to do a show.
That'll be awesome.

1424
01:24:13.811 --> 01:24:16.960
This is the first time this has ever happened.
What do you want to do,
Andy?

1425
01:24:16.961 --> 01:24:19.810
What kind of show do you want to do?
I was dumbfounded.
I was like,

1426
01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.530
you're asking me like what I want to do?
Nobody,

1427
01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.830
maybe they're doing that with you because you're,
you're very,

1428
01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:30.100
very popular and with the fear factor audience and what,
yeah,

1429
01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.030
like you're just happy.

1430
01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:33.640
You're just comfortable probably for the rest of your life.

1431
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:37.330
But I got to get a show going and I said and,
and I was,
I was like,

1432
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:41.680
I was cornered and I didn't,
I wasn't expecting that kind of question.

1433
01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:43.090
What do you want to do Andy?

1434
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:47.080
But immediately I said I want to do the analytics show again.
Do it again.
No,

1435
01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:48.910
right.
So fucking great.
You never saw it.

1436
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:53.230
I saw the Maryland masters case was awesome because I just posted it today cause

1437
01:24:53.231 --> 01:24:56.190
somebody was asking about,
no,
I'd seen it before.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1438
01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:57.130
I looked very fun.

1439
01:24:57.131 --> 01:25:01.640
I love your music to a lot of people don't even know that you do mute,

1440
01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:05.320
but he is a great musician.
Great Song Environment for you.

1441
01:25:05.321 --> 01:25:09.450
Like crazy sketch shows,
iTunes.
I have three albums.
What happened to it?

1442
01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:12.700
What happened?
Why did it get canceled?
What was the least Sasha,

1443
01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.420
do you remember Lisa?
No.
You don't remember Lisa?
She was an intern.

1444
01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:19.850
Newsradio they'll go on girl.
That became your girlfriend.
Remember Tony?

1445
01:25:19.851 --> 01:25:21.640
You remember telling me at Brillstein grey.

1446
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:26.970
I remember her walking into that dark stage 24 what was it till a few,

1447
01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:30.790
cause you're so high,
you don't remember.
I'm not that high.

1448
01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:34.050
You're not high anymore at all right now.
Yeah,
I'm high,
but I'm not that high.

1449
01:25:34.051 --> 01:25:37.330
I just don't remember the number of the stage.
I probably wouldn't remember it.

1450
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:43.900
See,
this is what he thinks is,
I'm still thinking.
No,
no.
I can hear.

1451
01:25:43.901 --> 01:25:48.520
I can hear it is you're building up crazy sauce.
Sexy builds up crazy socks.

1452
01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:52.900
He wonders.
Why go Andy?
Shut the fuck up and just angry.
It's not

1453
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:59.290
angry for no reasons.
It's reacting to your insanity.
Trying to anyhow,

1454
01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.300
environment that you're in.

1455
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:06.330
Tony walked in with this girl and I swear to God there was in this dark stage it

1456
01:26:07.041 --> 01:26:08.510
felt like there was a shaft,

1457
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:12.920
like a beam of light just coming down on her and she was shot.

1458
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:14.250
She was lighting yours.

1459
01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:19.250
Ashley had to be mine and Tony looked over at me and she told me this later.

1460
01:26:19.251 --> 01:26:20.960
She said that Tony said,
look,

1461
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:25.090
you can date anyone you want in Hollywood but don't date Andy.

1462
01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.810
So the same thing exact happened,

1463
01:26:26.811 --> 01:26:29.630
like a big guy trying to keep Andy from drinking.
He,

1464
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.190
she immediately felt pressured to data.
Andy.
Andy was the forbidden fruit?
Yes,

1465
01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:35.590
he does.
He own the deal.
He held that.

1466
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:38.990
He sealed the deal for us because he went out to buy beer for him.

1467
01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:43.760
She was working five years,
the most power over her woman.
She's still,

1468
01:26:43.761 --> 01:26:48.260
to me it was my glass ceiling on women.
So what happened?
Why did it well,

1469
01:26:48.261 --> 01:26:51.680
she is a mirror.
We were both crazy.
No,
the TV show,

1470
01:26:51.681 --> 01:26:54.680
you said it fall apart because of this girl.
How was that?
That was the,

1471
01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.110
I was sober three years of sobriety and she really helped said that.

1472
01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:04.160
So Brian,
you put an extra syllable in there.
I don't know.
But she,

1473
01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:07.900
she was,
um,
key in,
in keeping me sober,
but so she,

1474
01:27:08.050 --> 01:27:12.470
I basically replaced drugs and alcohol with her pussy.
I mean,

1475
01:27:12.471 --> 01:27:15.920
I've fucked her.
There was one time,
one day I fucked her nine times in a day.

1476
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.480
I mean,
I just,
just couldn't keep my dick out of her.
If it was my choice,

1477
01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:23.720
I would just have my dick inner and I'd go everywhere with my dick inside of it.

1478
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:27.170
I wouldn't pucker enough and I fucked her.

1479
01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:30.670
So what was it like one of those things too where you're wondering where you're

1480
01:27:30.690 --> 01:27:34.050
like,
I can't believe she's fucking me.
Every time she was so hot.

1481
01:27:34.090 --> 01:27:37.130
Every time she's a 10 right?
Oh God.

1482
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.830
Like an 11 and she's married now with kids.

1483
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:42.950
She married Madonna's guitar player now they're going to be able to find her.

1484
01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:45.410
She's going to hate that.
I'm talking about woopsies.

1485
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:49.750
<v 5>You weren't married to her,
will you?</v>

1486
01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:55.170
<v 2>No,
we,
we,
we could have gotten married.
We really were in love.
I was,
but you know,</v>

1487
01:27:55.171 --> 01:27:59.730
it was last,
last,
last week.
Cause I remember not really her company.

1488
01:27:59.731 --> 01:28:02.800
I didn't enjoy.
Just,
just want to take your clothes off

1489
01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:08.670
for five years.
You kept it going with just shut off,
take your clothes.

1490
01:28:08.671 --> 01:28:13.050
I wouldn't say that,
but yeah.
You know.
Did you put her on your show?
Yeah,

You can see her on the show.
Yeah.

1492
01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:15.991
If you go to Andy,

1493
01:28:15.991 --> 01:28:20.280
dick.com I spent 10 grand to put up everything that I've ever written and

1494
01:28:20.281 --> 01:28:24.000
directed.
Oh,

And if you go to the,

The one that has Dave girls face from the foo fighters,

1497
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:35.280
it's very tiny.
You really have to look and find it hard for meeting fine.

1498
01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:39.570
It is the one that she's,

1499
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:43.370
the hump og refer that um,
outcast is in.

1500
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:46.740
I had all these great people on my show.
Kathy Griffin.

1501
01:28:47.370 --> 01:28:50.660
You still didn't explain how did the show fall apart?
Because,

1502
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:56.040
because I stopped putting any,
any,
uh,
um,

1503
01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.780
attention or effort or I,
the show was like a pain in my ass.

1504
01:29:00.781 --> 01:29:04.050
Like why I can't,
I don't,
I don't want to work.
I don't want to write,

1505
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:07.230
I don't want to look at what the writers are writing.
I don't want to rewrite.

1506
01:29:07.231 --> 01:29:09.790
I don't want to,
I'd even show up to work.
I got a pro.
I'm,
I'm,

1507
01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:11.730
I'm like trying to hang on to my girlfriend.

1508
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.990
And this horrible situation started happening with her and a celebrity.

1509
01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:21.020
<v 6>Really?
Yeah.
It was bad.
Oh,
he was fucking there.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

1510
01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:23.980
<v 1>Gary Coleman.
You were trying to hang on to her.
Yeah.</v>

1511
01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:28.020
And then I do want to name the guy,
well,
I used to talk about it,
but I don't,

1512
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:29.050
well then it's already out there.

1513
01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:29.620
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1514
01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:32.590
<v 2>Then let them find it.
I don't,
I don't want to bring it up because I forgive.</v>

1515
01:29:32.591 --> 01:29:34.480
It was not his fault.
Of course.
It's not.

1516
01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:36.790
The weird thing is we're at real food daily.

1517
01:29:36.970 --> 01:29:39.670
We're sitting down and he comes up and I knew him.

1518
01:29:39.671 --> 01:29:43.870
He's a very famous movie star and I'm like,
Oh hey,

1519
01:29:43.871 --> 01:29:48.250
me and my girlfriend Lisa,
you know what he,
he teaches acting classes.
You should,

1520
01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:52.270
you should take classes as well.
And he's great.
He's like the best.
And Tammy.
Oh,

1521
01:29:52.271 --> 01:29:55.600
I know who's done it.
Sounds Sad.
What does the first initial

1522
01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:58.520
<v 1>Jay?
Yeah,
cause he probably did it with you.
No,
no,</v>

1523
01:29:58.521 --> 01:30:02.600
I've heard the stories and then I would say within weeks they're fucking,
yeah,

1524
01:30:02.601 --> 01:30:07.460
he did it to,
a friend of mine is all over.
The friend of mine was,
um,
he was,
uh,

1525
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:10.130
dating an accident when they were at,
they were at listen to this,

1526
01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:13.220
they were out of his house and uh,
the phone rang.

1527
01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:14.870
I guess his girlfriend was living with them.

1528
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:16.940
The phone rang at like three o'clock in the morning.

1529
01:30:16.941 --> 01:30:19.370
And this guy is on the answering machine.
Yeah.

1530
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:22.850
Like he calls up and she jumps out of bed to answer the call and then takes the

1531
01:30:22.851 --> 01:30:25.220
phone and leaves the real height.
Yeah.

1532
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:28.070
Like any movie playing on the TV.

1533
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:32.930
<v 2>I had,
I started about Joe that might give a hint to no,</v>

1534
01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:36.030
don't dump dump,

Cause I don't mind,
it wasn't the fly.

1535
01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.770
Oh there's no movie.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1536
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.990
Well it's just talking about like,

1537
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:44.540

1539
01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:53.520
Well I started to record conversations.
I have tapes of those guys talking.

1540
01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:58.200
Yeah.
I have tapes of her and him talking about how to get rid of me.

1541
01:30:58.850 --> 01:31:01.000
<v 7>Oh</v>

1542
01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:03.280

Like,</v>

1543
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:06.200
why don't you go on a vacation and you can take it literally.

1544
01:31:06.201 --> 01:31:09.370
This was one of them and take a picture of him,
you know,

1545
01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:12.320
like at the Grand Canyon near a cliff and just tell him to keep backing up.

1546
01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:14.410
<v 6>Wow.</v>

1547
01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:18.380
<v 2>Whoa.
Oh it got really sick and then Whoa,

1548
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:22.000
Someones talking about can you killing you?
You gotta pee again?

1549
01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:25.940
Why you got a urinary tract infection?
No,
I just drank my shake with some,

1550
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:30.550

It's pretty great.
And you enjoying them?
Yeah.

1554

I think this is the best thing ever.
The best thing ever.

1555
01:31:42.991 --> 01:31:46.050
I would love to do this every week with Andy Dick.

1556
01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:51.040
I think it would be the best by you and I have completely different tastes.
Why?

1557
01:31:51.041 --> 01:31:53.210
Why would this be the best thing?
Because you guys,

1558
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:57.080
you guys act like an old married couple and it's so fascinating.
Oh,

1559
01:31:57.081 --> 01:32:00.240
we always did.
I know,
but it's so fascinating to watch because it's,

1560
01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.740
<v 2>it's like,
and not like a normal person that,
you know,</v>

1561
01:32:02.741 --> 01:32:06.130
forced into this sort of a dichotomy.
It's great.
I fucking love it.

1562
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:08.390
You're welcome.
I,
uh,

1563
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:13.590
I used my strong stream of urination to clean off the globules of shit that

1564
01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:18.990
we're stuck deciding.
So funny you said I cleaned it off.

1565

1567
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:31.030

1571
01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:41.290
Don't you hate when you're trying to clean the shit and it just won't come off

So here they are.

1585
01:33:29.711 --> 01:33:33.740
There's a bunch of people.
I remember only one of my friends,
he was a fat guy.

1586
01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:37.780
It's not a sexual thing for me.
It's more fun knee.
I,

1587
01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:40.150
I'm laughing hysterically and I'm just,

1588
01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:44.050
and cars and they'd sit there and it takes them like at least five or 10 seconds

1589
01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:47.200
to realize even what's going on because it's so unheard of.

1590
01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:50.260
But I'm just P and going in a circle,
peeing on all of them.
They're like,

1591
01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.190
what is going?
And then they scream and they're like,
oh,
and then you,

1592
01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.093
they have to wash it off.

1593
01:33:55.170 --> 01:33:59.070
<v 1>Joey Diaz was at a gay club once she tells the story.

01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:03.743
He's a buddy of ours.

1596
01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.590
He was at a gay club and there's a big line to go to the bathroom and there was

1597
01:34:07.591 --> 01:34:12.591
a guy in a bathtub like lying there in his underwear and it just had a sign that

1598
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:14.100
said spit on me.

1599
01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.180
And people would walk by and spit on him while the clubs going on and this just

1600
01:34:18.181 --> 01:34:19.530
giant line to go to the,

1601
01:34:19.970 --> 01:34:23.370
<v 2>I really almost through it show,

1602
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:27.240
And like,
yeah,
I go share.
Go ahead.
So Jelly,

1603
01:34:27.241 --> 01:34:30.390
because he didn't want to wait in line to go all the way to the bathroom.

1604
01:34:30.391 --> 01:34:32.620
Just pissed on this.
Don't like it.
See,
I don't,

1605
01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:36.140
I have a weak stomach for that shit.
I might see sick.
Really.
I will,

1606
01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:41.130
I really have a,
we are so strange.
I will think that you're going to water water,

1607
01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:45.360
the other one and everyone else is in the shower,
but it's disgusting.

1608
01:34:45.361 --> 01:34:49.730
I saw a thing of,
I shouldn't be alive,
that show.
Have you seen that show?
Yes.

1609
01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.160
I should not be alive or whatever it's called.
And there was this,
this family,

1610
01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:56.940
a couple and two daughters and then,
uh,
they were dying in the,

1611
01:34:57.650 --> 01:35:01.910
and then the little girl said,
mommy,
can I tell you something?
My teachers said,

1612
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:03.560
you can drink your own p.

1613
01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:09.100
And then so the mother urinated in a bottle and made and the daughter to drink

1614
01:35:10.161 --> 01:35:11.960
and she drank it.
The one that didn't drink it,

1615
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.980
her kidneys shut down and she started to die.
She was practically dead.

1616
01:35:15.981 --> 01:35:19.910
But she did come.
They rescued everybody and they came back to life.
Wow.
Yeah.

1617
01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:22.520
But even watching that show,
my point was that I started,

1618
01:35:22.521 --> 01:35:27.521
I had to plug my ears when they showed that her like reenacting pissing in the

1619
01:35:28.161 --> 01:35:31.370
bottle and they showed a yellow liquid and they showed him drinking it.

1620
01:35:31.371 --> 01:35:35.120
And I even knowing it was a reenactment.
I was still like going to throw up.

1621
01:35:35.121 --> 01:35:39.860
I have various that you've done.
You watch a guy drink piss freaks.

1622
01:35:39.861 --> 01:35:44.120
You out girls.
Girls drink piss.
Whether it's a guy or girl or guy or girl.

1623
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.670
I've drunk cause before this.
Sure.

1624
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:48.740
For what reason you ever heard of you're in therapy?

1625
01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:51.990
I hear you wake up in the morning and drink your own fresh year and it's like,

1626
01:35:51.991 --> 01:35:55.040
I can't believe you did that.
I tried it for how many days?

1627
01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:58.370
I tried a couple of times.
I did it once on a radio when it tastes like for real.

1628
01:35:58.371 --> 01:36:00.500
It doesn't taste that bad.
It's sterile.
First of all,

1629
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:04.940
I know it's completely sterile and I know his son.
Is it salty stuff in it is,

1630
01:36:05.010 --> 01:36:09.640
you know like vitamins and minerals and you know,
no,

1631
01:36:09.650 --> 01:36:12.720
I don't drink coffee.
Even the smell of my own come makes me try.

1632
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:16.610
Have you ever tasted it?
Accidentally,
but what about other guys come,

1633
01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.870
especially other guys.
That's disgusting.
It's absolutely.
If you had to drink one,

1634
01:36:20.871 --> 01:36:24.830
which one would it be?
P I smell of your own.
Come freaks.

1635
01:36:24.831 --> 01:36:29.710
You out doesn't freak me out.
My stomach starts to turn.
I start so high.

1636
01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.530
You get involved in gay activities then.
These are not about the causal load.

1637
01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:36.980
Get me the fuck out of here.
Let me know that.
I like to see a load shoot out.

1638
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:39.420
It's exciting,
you know,

1639
01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.820
<v 0>causing troubles over there</v>

1640
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:50.750
<v 2>safely.
I want to know you didn't answer my question.
I really am curious.</v>

1641
01:36:50.751 --> 01:36:55.520
Does p tastes salty?
Taste a little salty?
It doesn't.
It's really not that bad.

1642
01:36:55.521 --> 01:36:57.560
It's all in your head when you drink it.
It's like nothing.

1643
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:58.520
You've got to watch the video.

1644
01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:01.460
I've made a video of him drinking as p card as San Fran Pisco.

1645
01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:03.570
<v 0>Yeah.
We were in San Francisco.</v>

1646
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:07.760
<v 3>Deal with the,
uh,
the DJ.
I'm like,
I'm like after,
because it was,</v>

1647
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:09.650
they were talking about Leo Machida,
who's a,

1648
01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.830
was the UFC light heavyweight champion who is,
uh,

1649
01:37:12.010 --> 01:37:16.130
this Japanese and Brazilian guy who is into like ancient medicine.

1650
01:37:16.131 --> 01:37:18.800
And that's one of the things that his father always taught him to drink your

1651
01:37:18.801 --> 01:37:22.040
urine in the morning.
That's kind of almost,
you know,
I hear it.
It's very,
very,

1652
01:37:22.041 --> 01:37:24.890
very good.
I don't know.
I mean it's probably bullshit.
I don't,
you know,

1653
01:37:24.891 --> 01:37:26.870
I just tried it.
I didn't really totally believe in it,

1654
01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:31.190
but I tried it because a friend of mine who had also been into that kind of
shit,

1655
01:37:31.191 --> 01:37:32.780
he's like into being a Shawmut and all that stuff.

1656
01:37:32.781 --> 01:37:35.660
He's drinking his urine when he's done mushroom trips.
Right.
And he told me,

1657
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:38.960
cause he,
that's how you get really high when you do a mushroom trip.

1658
01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:40.220
When you urinate,

1659
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:43.640
the sole assignment actually comes out in your urine and then you drink that

1660
01:37:43.641 --> 01:37:46.400
again and it reprocessed through systems and you just go,

1661
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.280
well shoot you through the whole thing.
I might do.
Yeah,

1662
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:55.290
it apparently that's the way to get super,
completely blitzkrieg on mushrooms.

1663
01:37:55.291 --> 01:37:57.990
Have you done mushrooms?
Yeah.
If I drink my own pee right now.

1664
01:37:57.991 --> 01:38:01.500
What'd you throw up?
Yeah,
not throw up.
I'd start dry heaving,

1665
01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.750
but what I was saying is we did it on this radio show and it's not that big a

1666
01:38:03.751 --> 01:38:07.830
deal.
The guy dry heaves,
dude,
no name for San Francisco.

1667
01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:10.770
He was all dry even when he did it,
but I just drank it.
It's really,

1668
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:12.690
once you get past it is in your mind.

1669
01:38:12.691 --> 01:38:15.480
Do you mind being on fear factor for six years?
Dude,

1670
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:18.960
I saw people get past some gnarly show.

1671
01:38:18.961 --> 01:38:21.480
There are things on there that seemed to be illegal.

1672
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:22.830
Now that we're all legal know,

1673
01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:27.180
like some of those dead animals or like animal parts.
Yeah,

1674
01:38:27.181 --> 01:38:29.920
they're all leaning to cook.
Really?
Yeah.
Everything we did,
we did.

1675
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.990
Anybody get sick ever?
Like they got like diarrhea sick,

1676
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:36.600
but never let get in trouble.
But we did have a problem.

1677
01:38:36.630 --> 01:38:40.710
Here's something for the folks at home.
If you are allergic to shellfish,

1678
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.830
you're also allergic to roaches.
Really?
Yeah.

1679
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:47.820
Cause I guess there's shit there that they have that exoskeleton.
Yeah.

1680
01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:50.580
Whatever it is that makes you allergic.
Am I right about that?

1681
01:38:50.610 --> 01:38:54.120
Their bones are actually on the outside of their skin.
Sure.
Yeah.

1682
01:38:54.150 --> 01:38:56.720
I mean that is what a cockroach in a lobster and shellfish.

1683
01:38:56.730 --> 01:39:01.730
I could eat bugs if they were cooked because it seemed like a crunchy snow.

1684
01:39:01.861 --> 01:39:03.720
I'm telling you,
it's not the big a deal.
It's all in your head.

1685
01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:07.980
Roach I eat a big Madagascar hissing cockroach.
It was no big deal.

1686
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:11.700
Raleigh and alive.
Alive.
I just,
it's all in your head.

1687
01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.150
I'd seen so many people do it.
I'm on,
I'm eating is how as an Edm,

1688
01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:17.220
like there's nothing bad about this.
It's not that bad at all.

1689
01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:20.120
Tasty doesn't taste good,
but it didn't taste terrible.

1690
01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:22.920
Like I would totally eat a gang of them and if I was starving to death,

1691
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:27.380
maybe if I was bobbing,
chew those motherfuckers.
No problem.
I don't believe wine.

1692
01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:31.560
He's so bad yourself.
Oh Shit.
Let me smell it.
That's not your Pittsboro.

1693
01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.190
Yeah,
I do want us that.
It's not your piss,
Bro.
Let me,

1694
01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.440
I do want to smell it full of shit.
I'm going to throw up.
Just warm.

1695
01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:45.520
You fucking liar.
It's apple juice.
Wheat Bran can't put me on.

1696
01:39:45.521 --> 01:39:49.420
It interrupts our fucking train of thought for that.
He wanted to see me.

1697
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:52.330
I listen.
If I smelled it,
I started dry heaving.

1698
01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.500
What were we talking about before you came in the cockroaches.
Oh,

1699
01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.930
I can only eat a,
if they were cooked and salted,
then I could eat them.

1700
01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:01.120
I'm telling you,
the,
the flavor is not that bad.

1701
01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:05.140
The much more impressive shit was when people ate like Habanero peppers and we

1702
01:40:05.141 --> 01:40:09.040
can do that.
Yeah,
I can do it where we're sweat is dripping out of my scalp.

1703
01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:12.150
Have you ever watched those videos online where people eat those ghost chilies?

1704
01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:16.420
There's,
there's a,
there's one sort of a pepper,
I forget what it's called.

1705
01:40:16.421 --> 01:40:20.950
I forget the actual technical name for it.
Crazy.
That's the name of it.

1706
01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:25.360
That's the red band.
And it's insanely powerful.
Like,

1707
01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:28.990
like many,
many,
many times worse than a hub.
An arrow.
Like you can die kind of.

1708
01:40:28.991 --> 01:40:31.210
Well I don't know if you can die.
I guess you probably could,

1709
01:40:31.330 --> 01:40:32.440
but when people take it,

1710
01:40:32.441 --> 01:40:35.050
they make videos of them taking it cause they're in agony.

1711
01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.520
It's just fucking screaming agony.
And then there's some people that like,

1712
01:40:39.521 --> 01:40:43.210
there's a woman in India who eats them like they're candy and then rubs him on

1713
01:40:43.211 --> 01:40:44.890
her eyes and nothing happens.

1714
01:40:45.010 --> 01:40:48.730
It's like this pitch is like immune to it somehow or another.
I love that.

1715
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:53.740
I love that stuff.
You know you can get immune to poison oak by

1716
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:57.100
<v 2>there's two ways.
And I did it.
I did,
I did.
One of the ways,</v>

1717
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:58.960
one of the ways is you pick,

1718
01:40:59.170 --> 01:41:03.160
and you have to pick it with like a Napkin so you don't touch it with your skin,

1719
01:41:03.161 --> 01:41:03.994
which is weird,

1720
01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:09.130
but you pick the tiny little baby red leaves.
This is poison oak,

1721
01:41:09.131 --> 01:41:12.730
which is all over California,
the tiny little baby red leas with a Napkin,

1722
01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:17.170
the shiny,
shiny,
oily,
tiny ones.
And you put it in your mouth,

1723
01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:20.060
a bunch of them and chew them June,
June,
June,
June,
July,

1724
01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:24.490
June and swallow them and your immune.
I did that.
But the better way,

1725
01:41:24.491 --> 01:41:27.460
which seems better is you get a goat.
I'm doing,
we're doing this.

1726
01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:32.550
We have three acres.
I actually have 30 acres,
real independent camp.

1727
01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:37.320
I'm not like down and out,
just saying no,
I just don't have liquid cash.
Right.

1728
01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:40.210
But um,
but anyhow,
you get to go,
we're going to get a bunch of goats,

1729
01:41:40.211 --> 01:41:44.710
maybe one or two or three.
We're going to own them.
In our property where we live,

1730
01:41:44.711 --> 01:41:47.940
there's three acres and there's a ton of fucking poison oak.
Right?

1731
01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:51.770
Just this morning I had to mend fences right before my,

1732
01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.050
my assistant had a seizure.

1733
01:41:53.051 --> 01:41:55.840
I was mending fences because their dogs are getting out and the neighbors are

1734
01:41:55.841 --> 01:41:59.680
complaining and I have a wolf.
By the way,
he's 90% wolf sorta got,

1735
01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:01.720
what are you doing with a wolf?

1736
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:05.140
You can see a picture of him on my Twitter pick account or whatever.

1737
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:08.290
You can't trust those fucking things.
I am a little worried,

1738
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:10.150
but didn't trust wolves.
Wolves are not dogs.

1739
01:42:10.170 --> 01:42:12.160
When you get one of those 90% wolves.

1740
01:42:12.250 --> 01:42:15.190
I had a friend who had a three quarter wolf and I was like,
this is you.

1741
01:42:15.191 --> 01:42:16.780
You are just taking chances here.

1742
01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:21.010
He wants to bring it to a farm to letting it stay with a friend to think killed

1743
01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:23.260
like 20 sheets.
Yeah.

1744
01:42:23.261 --> 01:42:26.380
It just went over and had a a blood orgy of sheep.
Well,

1745
01:42:26.381 --> 01:42:28.730
he's going to have a great meal when we get these cop,

1746
01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:32.740
this dude's fence hop this dude's fence and got in the sheep pen and just

1747
01:42:32.741 --> 01:42:36.580
slaughtered.
He might've been in the collected dog,
covered in blood.

1748
01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:39.940
He came back and they had a like lie to the,
the guy wanted to kill him.

1749
01:42:39.941 --> 01:42:42.520
The next door neighbor who was the farmer wanted to kill him cause he killed 20

1750
01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:46.630
of his fucking sheep.
Exactly covered in blood.

1751
01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:50.560
Every sheep just had his throat torn out and that DNA and didn't even kill the
H.

1752
01:42:50.590 --> 01:42:51.610
I mean,
didn't even eat the sheep.

1753
01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:55.360
Just tore their throats out and went back home and had some dog food.
He is,

1754
01:42:55.450 --> 01:43:00.340
he is displaying some disturbing behavior already.
Sure.
He's dominating you.

1755
01:43:00.370 --> 01:43:03.730
How old is he now?
He's not dominating me.
Know the two other dogs dominate him.

1756
01:43:03.850 --> 01:43:07.720
He's a puppy,
but puppy is still this tall,
this tall look.
Look,
he's,

1757
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.900
it's like three feet tall.
But the thing is,
is he,
he is,

1758
01:43:10.901 --> 01:43:13.000
he's getting these coal furs and these rats,

1759
01:43:13.001 --> 01:43:17.890
I've seen a rat or a gopher and I've seen the tail slurp into his mouth and down

1760
01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:20.850
his throat like spaghetti.
He just swallows these things.

1761
01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:25.720
Who's going to get diseases too?
You gotta be careful eating rats.
Can I tell?

1762
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:29.330
I don't remember what you got to be careful or a red band.
I was in the middle.

1763
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:32.570
You're in the middle of talking about this God damn monster you live will be

1764
01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:36.820
real about who is the poison oak dog.
Listen to this.
If you have poison oak,

1765
01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:40.890
get get some goats.
Let them eat the pork.
They love poisoning and it goes from,

1766
01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:44.380
yeah,
exactly.
But they eat that.
They eat the roots and all,
they'll pull it out.

1767
01:43:44.381 --> 01:43:47.920
So there's no poison oak and your yard.
You can drink the goats.
Saucier immune.

1768
01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:51.530
Then you drink the guts.
No.
Okay.
It shouldn't,
you know this for a fact.

1769
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.090
You're encouraging people to eat.
Yeah.
The throat closes up.
And what

1770
01:43:57.750 --> 01:44:00.860
experience is not responsible for any of these ideas of Andy?
Dick has.

1771
01:44:00.861 --> 01:44:04.010
We do not endorse them or support them,
nor have we researched them.
Okay.

1772
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:07.780
And I did.
I believe it's probably it.
We'll have someone looking at it,
did it.

1773
01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:10.730
And it worked.
And I have not gotten it since because I had,

1774
01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:15.350
I'm very susceptible to it and I've broken out like,
like a leper.

1775
01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:19.670
You were so into health and you're so into like vitamins and supplements and you

1776
01:44:19.671 --> 01:44:23.880
always have been used to eat raw cloves of garlic and there's,

1777
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:25.970
there's like five close of raw garlic in here.

1778
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.330
So how you that and then also this other control.
No,

1779
01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:35.270
what is it?
Do you,
do you ever go to therapy about that shit?
Oh yeah.

1780
01:44:35.271 --> 01:44:40.010
I've had multiple when I was having trouble with Elisa and that other person,

1781
01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.280
I had three therapists at the same time.
I would go from one,

1782
01:44:43.281 --> 01:44:44.930
tell him all different stories,
see which one works.

1783
01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:46.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1784
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:48.960
<v 2>No,
there,
there,
there was one time that I,</v>

1785
01:44:49.050 --> 01:44:52.050
I mean how many people go to therapy and in Hollywood for real,

1786
01:44:52.110 --> 01:44:53.340
just because they need an audience.

1787
01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:56.150
They need someone who wants to focus 100% on them.
Out of that,

1788
01:44:56.170 --> 01:45:00.180
there's a lot of it,
dude.
That's what I used to think when we were on Newsradio.

1789
01:45:00.610 --> 01:45:02.360
I,
that was the most I'd ever know.

1790
01:45:02.361 --> 01:45:05.220
Like that was the first time I'd ever really been around actors and I never knew

1791
01:45:05.221 --> 01:45:07.320
how many people were on therapy.
And I'm like,

1792
01:45:07.321 --> 01:45:09.780
I'm sure some of these people are actually getting helped by this,

1793
01:45:09.781 --> 01:45:10.860
but how many of these people are just,

1794
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:15.390
probably every cast member was going to therapy or on our show.
Right.
But uh,

1795
01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:18.240
I remember one time,
one of my therapists,

1796
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:22.830
this is during the Lisa phase and I was,
I couldn't sleep.

1797
01:45:23.010 --> 01:45:25.320
I would lay there.
And the thing is that,
that she was playing us both.

1798
01:45:25.321 --> 01:45:28.170
She was still seeing me and seeing him and I would lay in my,

1799
01:45:28.290 --> 01:45:33.240
she was at the same time I was waiting home and go down on her and she's all

1800
01:45:33.241 --> 01:45:37.400
salty.
Uh,
no.
But I would imagine him,

1801
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:42.960
him,
I would imagine him going down on her like this and spitting on her pussy.

1802
01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:45.720
So you know the fly

1803
01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:50.090
<v 0>Aye.</v>

1804
01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:57.080
<v 2>I like that.
That's great.
I forgot that scene.
What a great flick.
I,</v>

1805
01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:01.920
well at least he's talented.
I really have forgiven him.

1806
01:46:01.921 --> 01:46:05.490
It's not his fault.
It's not his fault.
It's the fucking ground or anything.

1807
01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:09.240
It's kind of creepy trying to come up with still use tapes too.

1808
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.830
You should release those.

1809
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:16.570
Maybe listen for his voice and change his name to miss mister silly pants.

1810
01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:18.721
And you know,

1811
01:46:18.721 --> 01:46:21.390
people draw their own conclusions cause you've already talked about him before.

1812
01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:24.090
This one therapist I was,
I told him,

1813
01:46:24.450 --> 01:46:29.340
I called him and says this is an emergency.
Um,
I really,

1814
01:46:29.341 --> 01:46:33.720
I,
I would like to come in and see you.
Um,
uh,
my,

1815
01:46:34.050 --> 01:46:37.230
my girlfriend at the time,
actually she,
we were both in hell.

1816
01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:41.690
She wrote a suicide note and um,
and I said,

1817
01:46:41.710 --> 01:46:44.250
I think she's going to commit suicide.
I,
I really,

1818
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:47.520
I don't know what to do cause I think I'm responsible and I don't know what to

1819
01:46:47.521 --> 01:46:48.930
do.
And he literally,

1820
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:52.730
<v 3>okay,
well listen,
I got a skid.
Adol</v>

1821
01:46:56.550 --> 01:47:00.210
said that phrase.
He called you a drama queen without saying it.
Yeah,

1822
01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:02.730
I got a skit battle.
Yeah,
that's exactly what it was.

1823
01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.830
He just called you a drama queen.
Like,
which maybe I was.
Okay.

1824
01:47:05.831 --> 01:47:09.420
And he cried wolf again.
How funny is it?
You Cry Wolf and you have the wolf.
Yeah,

1825
01:47:09.570 --> 01:47:13.410
I don't cry wolf.
I always think it's real.
That's the thing.
It's,
yeah,

1826
01:47:13.411 --> 01:47:18.030
but you're right.
I have a wolf.
People think I cry wolf.
So do you think it's Po?

1827
01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:22.330
I,
you know,
I had a conversation with Dave Foley about you when we were,
uh,

1828
01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:25.070
did the podcast.
I should listen to it and,
well,

1829
01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:29.130
one of the things we were talking about is how I said that Andy always needs

1830
01:47:29.310 --> 01:47:30.210
like a handler.

1831
01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:34.710
You need someone to just sort of guide you and keep you like just generally out

1832
01:47:34.711 --> 01:47:38.370
of trouble.
And the one thing about news radio,
I'm not,
you know,
I believe you,

1833
01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:41.760
but one of the great things about news radio was that there was work for you to

1834
01:47:41.761 --> 01:47:45.740
do.
Yeah.
It was like,
there was very rewarding,
very,
you know,

1835
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:50.390
it was very good writing.
The character was great,
really strong,
great teeth.

1836
01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:55.050
We were so lucky,
dude.
You know?
Great.
I'd step back and look about it.

1837
01:47:55.230 --> 01:47:57.310
I'd come on,
man.
It's the vacuum.
It was the best.

1838
01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.980
I'd never forget the moment I met Andy.

1839
01:47:58.981 --> 01:48:01.080
I met him on the set and then he came into my dressing room.

1840
01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:05.790
And this is 1994 and the like,
again,
no acting experience.
I remember.
No,

1841
01:48:06.110 --> 01:48:09.300
no actors and didn't.
Andy sitting there and he goes,

1842
01:48:09.301 --> 01:48:13.680
do you think you're going to be famous?
And I go,
I don't know.
He and Andy Goes,

1843
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:17.610
I know I'm going to be real.
I know it.
I go,
you really think so.

1844
01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:23.220
100% definitely.
I'm going to be famous.
Wow.
That I'm ready for grippy.
Yeah.

1845
01:48:23.221 --> 01:48:27.270
You were just fired up about,
I remember being famous.
I hate it now.

1846
01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:28.730
That's why I live in a shed.
Oh,

1847
01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:32.850
well when you're 20 whatever year you were back then.
That's that thing though,

1848
01:48:32.851 --> 01:48:34.860
man.
You just trying to make it happen.
I actually,

1849
01:48:34.861 --> 01:48:37.200
when people come up to me and they,
cause I got a young,

1850
01:48:37.201 --> 01:48:40.380
a lot of young people say,
Andy make me famous or I want to be payments.

1851
01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:45.300
I yell at them.
I'm like,
why?
There's you,
you,
you,
you want to do good work,
right.

1852
01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:50.280
Fuck that fame part.
Like I look at people like Sam Rockwell or Paul Giamatti.

1853
01:48:50.281 --> 01:48:53.070
Yes.
These are people I look up to do great work.

1854
01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:57.480
They're famous but they're famous Amos.
Perfect amount of Xanax.

1855
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:03.300
For the most part,
they're unrecognizable or,
or even if they are one guy,

1856
01:49:03.301 --> 01:49:07.170
people will come by.
Cool people come up to you but not freaks freaks.

1857
01:49:07.171 --> 01:49:10.680
I'm sure on the,
probably,
especially if Paul Giamatti then he gets weird at all.

1858
01:49:11.130 --> 01:49:15.480
I love sideways,
but you see,
that is great.
I love it.
Did you see moon?
I love it.

1859
01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:19.500
Sam Rockwell.
I fucking love it.
I worked with his girlfriend,
uh,
Leslie,

1860
01:49:19.530 --> 01:49:21.840
Leslie Bibb.
I hope they're still together and she's cool as fuck.

1861
01:49:21.841 --> 01:49:25.500
She's the hot chick and Talladega nights.
She plays my ex girlfriend,

1862
01:49:25.650 --> 01:49:29.170
girlfriend Kevin James Movie.
Yeah,
because you know those,

1863
01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:32.370
they're not in a childhoods.
They're just doing good.
Could of had that.

1864
01:49:32.371 --> 01:49:35.250
If I wasn't,
you're right.
I was like,
just a fucking,
well,

1865
01:49:35.410 --> 01:49:39.510
what makes you so good is that you're so fucking crazy.

1866
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.180
You got to that.
I understood that about me.

1867
01:49:42.181 --> 01:49:44.430
What makes me so good is that you know,
that,

1868
01:49:44.431 --> 01:49:47.170
that the crazy rage that I had when I was younger,
all that energy,

1869
01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:48.400
all that's inside

1870
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:53.020
<v 2>me,
unbridled,
always running around in circles on lockdown.</v>

1871
01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:56.200
We both fucked up that we had news radio.
I'm sorry to harnesses,

1872
01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:59.860
hundred yen and the outlet could come through the brilliant writing like you

1873
01:49:59.861 --> 01:50:02.890
said it.
Paul Simms and,
and,
and,
and Joe,
uh,

1874
01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:08.040
Joe Fury and Josh and all those guys drink.

1875
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:14.030
Say they're shot and said,
unfortunately.
Yeah,
I love that guy.
He was the best.

1876
01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:17.170
He's the one who wrote that VH one fashion,
but he runs under,

1877
01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:19.120
did he really rose Zulily,
Andrea.
I was,
you know,

1878
01:50:19.121 --> 01:50:23.430
I was supposed to be will Ferrel's park.
You know that he's serious.
Yes,

1879
01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:26.740
I did the table read.
It was written for me by Drake Sather drink.

1880
01:50:26.741 --> 01:50:30.670
Say the wrote the fashion awards shorts that I did where I played the,

1881
01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:34.030
remember the dirt,
that's my character.
Then we turned it into a movie.

1882
01:50:34.031 --> 01:50:37.120
We put Derek Zoolander and he,
because Ben was doing his shorts,

1883
01:50:37.121 --> 01:50:40.440
I was doing my shows.
We put them together,
we wrote Zoo lander,
you know,

1884
01:50:40.450 --> 01:50:44.020
they wrote it and I did the table read and then I got stuck on this show called

1885
01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:44.390
go.

1886
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:49.390
It went six episodes with Macaulay Culkin's younger brother Kieran Culkin and

1887
01:50:49.841 --> 01:50:52.660
you couldn't leave and they said you just got out of Rehab.

1888
01:50:52.661 --> 01:50:56.170
And you can't rock the boat.
You can't do that zoo lander movie.

1889
01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:58.960
And Ben Stiller thought it was too crazy.
They said,

1890
01:50:58.990 --> 01:51:03.670
you can't walk away from your TV show.
And I said,
Ben,

1891
01:51:03.671 --> 01:51:06.340
Ben Stiller was calling me at home saying,
just walk away from it.

1892
01:51:06.341 --> 01:51:10.450
I do it all the time.
And looking back,

1893
01:51:10.451 --> 01:51:13.420
do you realize what a what a fork in the road that was.

1894
01:51:13.421 --> 01:51:15.580
And I went down the wrong fucking one.

1895
01:51:15.610 --> 01:51:19.000
Ben Still so hot break some bad ass shit.

1896
01:51:19.130 --> 01:51:22.990
I'm not into that meet the Fockers movie,
but God damn was tropic thunder.
Good.

1897
01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:24.720
Yeah,
he,
he's,

1898
01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:28.360
he's on cloud nine and we're not friends anymore and I don't know why.

1899
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:33.250
What happened?
I don't know.
What did you do?
And I think he's running for office.

1900
01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:34.990
Is He?
I don't know.

1901
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.250
They're just trying to like separate himself and really just really nipping the

1902
01:51:39.251 --> 01:51:41.470
core.
You must feel that like,
you know,

1903
01:51:41.471 --> 01:51:45.200
I told you that I was going to be in Burbank and so let's do it here.
And you,

1904
01:51:45.230 --> 01:51:46.860
you immediately online,
which we didn't,

1905
01:51:46.861 --> 01:51:50.140
I guess Jonah's want me had at his house and even tweeted that you've been sent

1906
01:51:50.141 --> 01:51:53.980
me a text.
Okay.
I guess you don't want me to know where you live.
I mean,

1907
01:51:54.970 --> 01:51:59.650
but in his defense he immediately texted me back saying that's not it at all.

1908
01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.420
You can come by anytime.

1909
01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:05.850
Some other time I just happened to be in Burbank and that's where we want to do.

1910
01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:10.570
Yeah.
But I really did immediately thought totally get it.
I get it.

1911
01:52:10.571 --> 01:52:14.980
You don't want me to see just your girl and you don't want to meet and meet your

1912
01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:19.890
kids.
How many kids if you
have,
you are outside of,
uh,

1913
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:23.620
if you were sober for a year,
you can hang out at my house anytime you want.
Okay.

1914
01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:25.390
I will.
I will.
We need to,

1915
01:52:25.391 --> 01:52:27.920
we need to fucking put you through and I love it cause me,

1916
01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:32.470
you got to know though that people think that like,
okay,
I have a carrot.

1917
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:35.500
You know what I have now hanging here shows cock

1918
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:40.690
Dick you to record.

1919
01:52:40.691 --> 01:52:44.980
That is a funny thing that we said when we were on the set,
all of us did.

1920
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:46.010
We said,
you know,
when

1921
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.750
<v 3>this thing is falling apart,
if it does,</v>

1922
01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:51.500
we've got to figure out a way to all work together because we had such a crazy

1923
01:52:51.501 --> 01:52:54.410
chemistry.
The vast,
what a Sitcom we could put together right now.

1924
01:52:54.411 --> 01:52:55.610
I mean Dave Foley should we put some

1925
01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:59.750
<v 2>just in news radio but do it podcast.
And the only time I worked with any of any,</v>

1926
01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:03.890
anybody from news radio again was Maura.

1927
01:53:04.130 --> 01:53:07.430
She got me on Er,
I played a really great character on the yard.

1928
01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.870
<v 3>I ran into Maura once at one of those a couple of times,</v>

1929
01:53:10.890 --> 01:53:14.420
which she was on er and I was on a fear factor and we got drunk together like

1930
01:53:14.421 --> 01:53:18.620
the old days,
you know,
like those,
those NBC things.
And we have fun.
I was like,

1931
01:53:18.621 --> 01:53:22.190
God man,
we have all,
we have all had such a crazy connection.

1932
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:26.410
That was such an unusual cast.
We didn't always get along great.
Like,
you know,

1933
01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:29.480
you and I,
we got in arguments but we always made up everything.
We always,

1934
01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:33.470
we always,
we always brought it around,
but when we had fun,
dude,

1935
01:53:33.471 --> 01:53:37.610
we had fucking fun those sets after,
after we were done filming,

1936
01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:40.310
we had parties.
The crew,
the crew is,

1937
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:42.290
<v 2>you're on the ground.
We human,
human.
The nurse,</v>

1938
01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:46.640
remember that guy who was the nurse,
couldn't be massages.
Remember,

1939
01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:50.450
wasn't creepy to Andy.
I love,
he was a great guy.
No,

1940
01:53:50.451 --> 01:53:53.060
I'm just bullshitting about the creepy massages.
He was a good,
I do remember,

1941
01:53:53.061 --> 01:53:57.290
here's the one thing that the,
don't give the fucking punchline away,

1942
01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:00.170
but the very first week,
uh,
we're,
we're,

1943
01:54:00.171 --> 01:54:03.860
we're rehearsing these radio and that were in the first week and there was

1944
01:54:03.861 --> 01:54:05.330
somebody else playing Joe's part.

1945
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:09.040
Do not give it away because I don't even know if you know the story.
And,

1946
01:54:09.130 --> 01:54:11.630
and we're,
we're,
we're like in day one,
day two,
day three,

1947
01:54:11.631 --> 01:54:13.270
I don't know what's going on,
but we're doing it.

1948
01:54:13.271 --> 01:54:16.790
We're rehearsing where we're doing table reads and this guy that's playing Joe's

1949
01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:19.910
part before Joe came on board is,
it's coming to me saying,

1950
01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:23.330
I don't think they're liking what I'm doing.
And I'm going,
dude,

1951
01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:27.500
you're so fucking awesome.
You're subtle.
You're real.
I love it.

1952
01:54:27.501 --> 01:54:30.320
And I think they love it.
They're just not,
if they're not laughing,

1953
01:54:30.321 --> 01:54:31.640
they're not laughing.
Big Deal.

1954
01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:35.870
If you're doing great the next day his seat was empty.

1955
01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:39.350
We went a whole day with no one.
By the way,
you weren't there yet.

1956
01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:45.220
He had been fired and that guy was ray Romano of wow.

1957
01:54:48.410 --> 01:54:51.530
Did you,
you knew that?
Yeah,
I knew it and I didn't take over for Ray.

1958
01:54:51.531 --> 01:54:54.800
I took over for the guy who took over for oh you're right.
They brought,

1959
01:54:54.801 --> 01:54:57.650
then they brought another guy in and that guy fucking shit.

1960
01:54:57.651 --> 01:55:01.280
The bed was a Sama but he was funny too.
I'm lumped going to tell ya he,

1961
01:55:01.281 --> 01:55:04.950
I bet he's working.
Yeah.
But I don't remember who he,
yeah,
I don't know what,

1962
01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.580
what I bet he's working.
Cause I remember seeing him later.

1963
01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:10.790
But then that then on Dave on Friday,

1964
01:55:10.791 --> 01:55:13.010
it was like the last day before,

1965
01:55:13.011 --> 01:55:15.450
cause remember we used to film on a Tuesday or something.
We were like,
right.

1966
01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:17.180
So on the last day that you,

1967
01:55:17.181 --> 01:55:20.390
that we could have before we had our camera blocking day Monday,

1968
01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:24.450
Joe shows up and stays and nailed,

1969
01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:28.820
but nailed it like,
like Paul Simms loved you.

1970
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:33.590
I loved him too.
Yeah.
Do you talk to them?
Not really.
Me Neither.
I called him,

1971
01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:37.280
I called him when I saw that he was one of the,
um,
consulting producers,

1972
01:55:37.281 --> 01:55:41.470
I think on a boardwalk empire.
Right.
He's saying that right?
I don't know.
No,

1973
01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:43.890
he was on the flight of the Conchords Oh,

1974
01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:48.720
<v 3>by the congress.
That's just fucking awesome.
And we're talking,
catching up.</v>

1975
01:55:48.721 --> 01:55:51.150
And he did,
he invited me to his wedding and I didn't go out and I didn't,

1976
01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:56.080
I couldn't go.
I had a Gig that I had to go there.
I don't remember why I didn't,

1977
01:55:56.081 --> 01:55:58.440
and I was probably in a bad place,
but,
and,
and I,

1978
01:55:58.441 --> 01:56:01.800
and we were talking feel bad about not going to weddings too.
I wish.

1979
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:04.610
I wish I did all of them.
I don't want to go to any of them.

1980
01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:08.460
I have so many friends that have been divorced and there's so many of them that

1981
01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:11.100
are in this marital rack and owe so much money.

1982
01:56:11.110 --> 01:56:13.500
Dave Foley came on the podcast and I was crying.
Dude,

1983
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:15.750
he owe so much fucking money.

1984
01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:19.770
He's supposed to be paying three times what he makes every month to my worst.

1985
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:23.340
I've been reading tweets.
I know.
Fuck,
I can't go to Canada.

1986
01:56:23.341 --> 01:56:25.920
They're going to arrest him.
He owes a half a million dollars up there.

1987
01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:27.630
It's chaos.
He's,

1988
01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:31.080
they got him at the peak of its earning of his entire life and it's completely

1989
01:56:31.081 --> 01:56:35.220
unrealistic now.
Real.
Yeah.
New is not making money anymore.

1990
01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:39.840
I know that.
You're on it.
Yeah,
it works.
Sitcoms.
Yeah.
And that,
yeah.

1991
01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.470
So anyway,
so when people ask me to go to their wedding,
I'm like,

1992
01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:45.900
fuck a friend of mine.
This is no bullshit.

1993
01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:49.820
This fucking guy lost everything.
He lost every,

1994
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:53.730
I talk about him on stage cause I this,
this bit about divorce.
Do I know them?
No.

1995
01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:57.280
No.
You don't know.
He's a great guy.
And he lost everything in his first one.
Man.

1996
01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:01.350
He,
he,
his second wife came along during the first marriage,

1997
01:57:01.351 --> 01:57:02.480
broke up his first marriage.

1998
01:57:02.481 --> 01:57:05.610
She married a second wife and his second wife didn't want a prenup and they had

1999
01:57:05.611 --> 01:57:09.180
a fight for it and this guy lost everything in the first one.
It's like,

2000
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:11.460
and then he's like,
I want you to come to my mind,
my own marriage.
And I'm like,

2001
01:57:11.461 --> 01:57:15.600
Jesus Christ,
you're going into another goddamn execution.
I'll never get married,

2002
01:57:16.670 --> 01:57:20.520
never get married again.
I understand it with children and that's why I did it.

2003
01:57:20.521 --> 01:57:22.640
You know?
I'm like,
Jesus Christ.
If you're willing to have children,

2004
01:57:22.641 --> 01:57:25.810
and that's very important to raise the kids.
I live in the shot,

2005
01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:29.220
but it was important for her.
I know it's ridiculous.
We important for her.

2006
01:57:29.221 --> 01:57:30.770
So I did it,
but I,

2007
01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:34.470
I think it's absolutely ridiculous that you're going to bring in a bunch of

2008
01:57:34.471 --> 01:57:37.770
people that you don't know and they're going to be a part of this agreement.

2009
01:57:37.771 --> 01:57:38.760
That's your relationship.

2010
01:57:38.761 --> 01:57:41.880
Never were all based on the fact that when it falls apart,

2011
01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:45.810
we're just assuming that all of us are going to be irrational and greedy.

2012
01:57:46.290 --> 01:57:49.500
Usually works out.
Have to be fair.
Very occasionally it works.

2013
01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:53.760
That's not a marriage that I'm worried about.
It's it's divorce.

2014
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:56.700
It's not the idea of being bonded.
If you're together,
you're together.

2015
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:59.190
Who cares if you together on paper,
if you're together legally,

2016
01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:01.740
it's when you can't get away from each other.
It's ridiculous.

2017
01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:05.730
The divorce is the most ridiculous aspect of marriage.
But you're married,

2018
01:58:05.731 --> 01:58:09.070
you're married,
and you start putting in like,
Ooh,

2019
01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:12.360
you started putting it and you factor in how much lawyers make and then how the

2020
01:58:12.370 --> 01:58:16.050
lawyer with my buddy had to pay for his wife's lawyer.

2021
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:18.540
I had it with the girl I'm living with now.
I said,
look,

2022
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:21.930
let's come to an agreement and not bring lawyers in because when you bring

2023
01:58:21.931 --> 01:58:25.560
lawyers in and you're taking food out of our kid's mouth,
true,

2024
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:29.490
putting it up the fucking lawyers ass.
And I paid Lou,
right?

2025
01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:32.320
Tens of thousands of dollars,
maybe up upwards of hundreds.

2026
01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:35.640
How about my friend paid millions,
uh,
who have,
I'm not telling you,

2027
01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:40.410
I'm going to tell you,
he's a big,
he's got cash and he went through one.

2028
01:58:40.411 --> 01:58:42.010
The more you have,
the more they can take

2029
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:45.850
<v 2>two and a half years and went through a relationship or a divorce where he was</v>

2030
01:58:45.851 --> 01:58:49.510
paying for two lawyers at the same time.
That's why I'd rather live in the shed.

2031
01:58:49.570 --> 01:58:53.440
I let my ex,
my mum,
my money goes right to her.
I'm like,
you know what,

2032
01:58:53.441 --> 01:58:55.990
I'm done with this fucking shit.
I don't need anything.

2033
01:58:56.110 --> 01:59:00.640
As long as I have my 52 inch flat screen,
plasma,
whatever,
HD,
all that.

2034
01:59:00.641 --> 01:59:02.500
And with the sound in a whole and with this one,

2035
01:59:02.501 --> 01:59:06.280
this acid and I just need the very bare minimums and to be with my kids.

2036
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:09.970
That's beautiful.
Good food.
And then you can have all the rest of it.

2037
01:59:09.971 --> 01:59:14.550
You fucking con.
Well no it's not.
I know you're saying the world,

2038
01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:17.230
the world is done.
I'm done with it.

2039
01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:20.350
And you know if you want to try to take money from me,
I don't have it.
It's all,

2040
01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:23.800
it goes to her.
What do you take my TV cause that's all I got now.

2041
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:27.760
I got my TV and my dogs over it.
All my money.
I don't even know.

2042
01:59:27.850 --> 01:59:31.540
I sometimes I ask her,
did a couple checks come in?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
we're fine.

2043
01:59:31.541 --> 01:59:35.140
We're fine.
We don't even really,
where do you envision yourself?
I'm going to,

2044
01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:36.370
I'm going to get another show.

2045
01:59:36.610 --> 01:59:38.830
I already know that people are starting to come by.

2046
01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:42.940
I do you think that in the [inaudible] shit though,
they helped,

2047
01:59:42.941 --> 01:59:46.120
they're worried about you.
It helped me.
Why?
How did it actually,

2048
01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:50.890
there was a guy rob wrinkles,
you know him,
you know him.
He had a show last year.

2049
01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:55.780
Uh,
it didn't go through,
but I went in and tested and I went,
you know what?

2050
01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:59.030
They wanted me to audition,
turned the TV on,
you know,

2051
01:59:59.230 --> 02:00:03.280
and you can see me and you don't audition for things.
Oh yeah,
I do.
I go and I go,

2052
02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:06.720
you know what?
Fuck it.
I humble myself and I go,
okay.
You know,

2053
02:00:06.730 --> 02:00:09.970
and I'll roll my sleeves up and I'll show him how it's done.
And I go in,

2054
02:00:10.110 --> 02:00:14.740
I see I do it.
And,
and,
and Ted Wass,
the director said,

2055
02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:17.980
said rob wriggles jumped out.
I didn't know who he was.

2056
02:00:18.190 --> 02:00:20.830
He jumped up in the room and said,
I want to do the scene with you.
And I went,

2057
02:00:21.010 --> 02:00:25.000
why?
Who are you?
Who are you anyway?
And he's like,
I'm the lead.

2058
02:00:25.001 --> 02:00:28.870
I'm the guy that wrote it,
or I'm the lead.
And I'm like,
Oh fuck,
I'm so,

2059
02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:30.880
I'm sorry again.
But we did the scene and we were laughing.

2060
02:00:30.881 --> 02:00:34.800
We're having a great time.
I leave.
Ted Wass calls me and Holmes says,
you know,

2061
02:00:34.810 --> 02:00:38.290
you're the,
you're the number one guy.
And there was no one,

2062
02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:41.070
there wasn't even a close second.
You're the guy.
That's great,
Andy.

2063
02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:44.360
But what I'm asking,
this is Charlie Sheen thing.
Listen,
okay.

2064
02:00:44.361 --> 02:00:48.850
It was on CBS and everybody wanted me.

2065
02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:53.080
And then they went to CBS and said,
we found our guy,
this just for a small part,

2066
02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.200
the band leader,
like it was in a high school.
And I'm like the band

2067
02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:01.790
once against them,
some,
some homosexual,
you know,

2068
02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:06.760
something crazy on wonder why anybody would get that k.
Anyhow,
so he said,

2069
02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:09.600
you know,
I just want to let you know that you're,
you're,
you're,

2070
02:01:09.601 --> 02:01:13.870
you're a number one.
Everybody wanted to.
We went to CBS and CBS said,

2071
02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:18.310
um,
no thank you.
We we,
we can't hire Andy Dick.

2072
02:01:18.311 --> 02:01:22.080
We already have one of those.
His name is Charlie Sheen,

2073
02:01:22.090 --> 02:01:24.160
so how's that helping you bro?
Well,

2074
02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:28.660
that's asked you if it helped you and obviously that took a job away from you.

2075
02:01:28.661 --> 02:01:32.380
It's not how that was a long that was,
that was your,
that was like last year.

2076
02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:36.190
Now he's out there.
I think the perception has changed that much in 12 months.

2077
02:01:36.270 --> 02:01:39.200
Do you think that him going all,
it's going to be fine.
I'm going to,

2078
02:01:39.201 --> 02:01:42.170
it's going to be a slow,
steady climb.
Hey,
come on.
Help me out.

2079
02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:46.490
I hope I helped you out.
I might not get on a network show tomorrow.

2080
02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:50.000
I know I'm not going to the,
I'm just,
but I'm going to have to reality.

2081
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:51.650
I know how to get brilliant.

2082
02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:54.560
I'm going to have a small little show and you're going to fucking come on it and

2083
02:01:54.561 --> 02:01:58.250
try and help me.
I'll help you.
Absolutely.
It's going to be a small little thing.

2084
02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:01.440
I don't even need money anymore.
My question,
I'm going to go to a network like,

2085
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:03.290
like an e type situation.

2086
02:02:03.291 --> 02:02:06.170
I'm going to be able to do a show and you don't need money to be funny.

2087
02:02:06.650 --> 02:02:08.690
It's not about money.
You just,
you know,

2088
02:02:08.691 --> 02:02:12.370
you can be funny and you don't need money.
Right.
I need you though.
Well,

2089
02:02:12.371 --> 02:02:14.420
would you to come on,
I'm going to need my friends.

2090
02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:18.530
I don't have any many that I need people to rally up around me and help me out

2091
02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:19.670
you to have a show like that,

2092
02:02:19.671 --> 02:02:22.240
to have like some sort of a sketch show like the old Andy Dick show you,

2093
02:02:22.241 --> 02:02:23.720
you could totally pull that together.
Yeah.

2094
02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:27.020
Because you don't need money to do that.
That's cheating.
Yeah.
You just need,

2095
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:31.100
I just heard talented people and I listened to Kevin Pollock's podcast because

2096
02:02:31.101 --> 02:02:33.250
he had Dave Thomas on and I was,
uh,

2097
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:36.800
an SCTV fanatic when I was like 12 or whatever.

2098
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:38.630
I used to record it on a,

2099
02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.640
on a little radio shack cassette recorder and listen back to it all shitty

2100
02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:48.080
sounding and laughs.
You can actually hear me laughing on the cassette thing.

2101
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:49.101
And and,

2102
02:02:49.101 --> 02:02:54.101
and he and Anne Sctv was done back in the day.

2103
02:02:54.230 --> 02:02:58.640
The budget of every episode.
$3,000.

2104
02:02:58.790 --> 02:03:03.740
That's incredible.
Well,
what the
thing on the Internet,

2105
02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:04.910
I know you did for a while.

2106
02:03:04.911 --> 02:03:08.110
You had the one weird interview show house arrest with Auntie Dick.

2107
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:12.460
No money involved.
Is that my house and I,
you should have come on that.

2108
02:03:12.910 --> 02:03:15.920
I don't know what happened.
It just ended.
I,
I,
you know what,

2109
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:18.830
for a long time I didn't have your number and like yeah,
we didn't,

2110
02:03:18.831 --> 02:03:20.930
there was no Twitter.
It wasn't that easy to get in touch.

2111
02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:23.270
Like you got in touch with me through Twitter like that.

2112
02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:28.190
We just started talking again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm glad.
Yeah,
I'm glad too.

2113
02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:29.413
I'm glad to.

2114
02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:34.580
We got to do a 2011 version of the odd couple Mi Mi.

2115
02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:38.300
That would be jock character.

2116
02:03:38.530 --> 02:03:42.480
Am I sexually ambiguous?
Who's the controls dress?

2117
02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:46.190
Sloppy one though.
Is it you or who?
Some more painful,

2118
02:03:47.010 --> 02:03:50.780
it doesn't have to be that way.
One guy.
I see what was saying.

2119
02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:54.440
Neither one of us completely have our shit together,

2120
02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:57.980
but obviously you want to think of one,
be more out of control.
No,

2121
02:03:57.981 --> 02:04:00.830
in real life though,
you have your shit together or get together.

2122
02:04:00.831 --> 02:04:05.780
But it's a constant battle.
What?
Why at the pommel fucking savage.
The Pot?

2123
02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.571
No,
I'm,
I'm,

2124
02:04:06.571 --> 02:04:11.430
I'm a violent chrage a holic a nice guy and trapped in the body of a violin and

2125
02:04:11.431 --> 02:04:15.740
he's a rageaholic.
I just work out a lot.

2126
02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:18.960
I have a lot of energy.
I have a lot of a aggressive enter.

2127
02:04:18.961 --> 02:04:22.100
Just always have loved that.
I mean,
I'm,
I was attracted to it.

2128
02:04:22.101 --> 02:04:26.900
I stop it.
It's gusting.
I think a lot of people are,
but you know,

2129
02:04:26.901 --> 02:04:30.470
I keep it completely and totally together,
but I do it with body maintenance.

2130
02:04:30.471 --> 02:04:31.640
I have to make sure I work out a lot.

2131
02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:33.830
I have to make sure that I get in the tank along.
I have to,

2132
02:04:34.190 --> 02:04:36.950
I think all of us are struggling.
No one is just getting through life.

2133
02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:39.640
Everything's perfect.
So yeah,
I'm just happy in every,

2134
02:04:39.690 --> 02:04:42.390
that's what you have to remember.
Oh,
you think about your problems.

2135
02:04:42.391 --> 02:04:45.530
You think about how,
what hell you're in everybody.

2136
02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:48.420
It's also what causes your problems.
I have way,
way,

2137
02:04:48.421 --> 02:04:52.230
way less problems now than I did when I was younger because I understand life

2138
02:04:52.231 --> 02:04:55.020
better.
Understand myself back.
I understand my own behavior.

2139
02:04:55.021 --> 02:04:59.520
I don't you wish that you could be you and I could be me with what we know and

2140
02:04:59.521 --> 02:05:04.500
how we are and how I actually think our chemicals literally changed and we could

2141
02:05:04.501 --> 02:05:08.010
go back with with this,
this,
this,

2142
02:05:08.670 --> 02:05:13.050
this knowledge or whatever or do these chemicals coursing through our veins and

2143
02:05:13.051 --> 02:05:17.310
start over.
No,
I don't want to start over,
man,
you're in a different place,

2144
02:05:17.311 --> 02:05:19.330
but I know that I could.
I could just,

2145
02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.580
but you know it's not even starting over and I have that you haven't makes you.

2146
02:05:23.581 --> 02:05:24.400
You though.

2147
02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:29.100
I'm sure she also makes you humble because quite honestly,

2148
02:05:29.101 --> 02:05:31.950
anybody that wants to be famous,
anyone who wants to be successful,

2149
02:05:31.951 --> 02:05:34.040
we're saying it's an impartial struggle with ego.
We should.

2150
02:05:34.050 --> 02:05:38.070
You struggle with the idea of grandiose ideas like being being better than you

2151
02:05:38.071 --> 02:05:41.670
really are.
Being this amazing person that deserves all of this attention.

2152
02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:43.560
You know the the humiliating moments,

2153
02:05:43.561 --> 02:05:46.620
the humbling moments actually really kind of round you off.

2154
02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:48.140
So in a way you can't do,

2155
02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:53.040
it's impossible to do what I just said except that I can do it.

2156
02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:57.510
What I do now is I say,
you know what I am,
I can do that.

2157
02:05:57.540 --> 02:06:02.490
I can start right now with what I know and with the chemicals that are my

2158
02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:06.020
natural,
how I my who I am,
I feel different,

2159
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:10.800
different learn you've learned over the years and start over starting now and

2160
02:06:10.801 --> 02:06:13.560
that's all we are part of shedding everything off and I didn't,

2161
02:06:13.561 --> 02:06:15.240
no pun intended the shed,

2162
02:06:15.390 --> 02:06:19.080
but I sh I got rid of everything I own.

2163
02:06:19.290 --> 02:06:21.810
I gave it away.
It sounds very healthy.

2164
02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:25.710
They had so much your approach to correct the people think I'm doing bad,

2165
02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:30.630
I'm doing better than I've done in years.
You feel mentally,
physically,
yes.

2166
02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:33.560
I think you have to exercise to do.
I just went on.

2167
02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:38.100
I just went on an hour and a half hike yesterday also.
It's one of those things,

2168
02:06:38.101 --> 02:06:40.610
it sounds so frivolous when people talk about exercise,

2169
02:06:40.611 --> 02:06:41.760
you say you should work out like,
oh,

2170
02:06:41.761 --> 02:06:44.280
what you want to look great so you have a big once again,
tell it,

2171
02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:47.550
tell it to my guy.
Hey,
I'll tell it to me as I imagine that broken.

2172
02:06:47.551 --> 02:06:52.110
So important thought I can do it.
There weren't bicep.
Yeah,

2173
02:06:52.270 --> 02:06:55.570
I heard him.
I try not to hear him every day,
mother fucker.

2174
02:06:56.250 --> 02:06:59.220
Cause I don't really know the podcast that well.
You guys have that kind of like,

2175
02:06:59.310 --> 02:07:02.910
oh he's,
he's silly.
He's silly.
He's not really bumping heads.
Is this your house?

2176
02:07:02.970 --> 02:07:07.080
Yes.
And then all your equipment?
Yeah.
This is like expensive shit.

2177
02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:12.300
Well this podcast is for real son.
It started off.
It was just a web.
A Web Cam.

2178
02:07:12.301 --> 02:07:16.060
Let's say you started it together.
Yeah.
Cool.
How many years has it been trying?

2179
02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:18.480
This is my video editor.
He's been working with me forever.

2180
02:07:18.481 --> 02:07:21.660
He makes all the UCF crazy videos you see online.

2181
02:07:21.661 --> 02:07:23.610
There's really well edited stuff.
It's all his work.

2182
02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:27.020
You know which one fascinated me,
and I did.
I did see this,
the car,

2183
02:07:27.090 --> 02:07:29.640
why don't you pray?
It's probably old news to you,
but the Carlos Smith scene,

2184
02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:33.710
I just loved it.
I loved it.
I did that.
That was fascinating.
It was fascinating.

2185
02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:36.070
Bill Cosby,
that wasn't

2186
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:36.670
<v 3>even us.</v>

2187
02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:39.130
That was somebody else on the bill because we think there's Jonathan Taylor

2188
02:07:39.131 --> 02:07:41.980
Thomas.
If you want to keep looking,
there's probably a million for it.

2189
02:07:41.981 --> 02:07:44.410
And I heard that you guys,
uh,
what's it called?

2190
02:07:44.411 --> 02:07:48.210
Broke Brad or water under the bridge.
You guys made out you and Carlos says,

2191
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:52.140
I never,
I haven't talked to him since [inaudible] to him.
Oh,
somebody told me,

2192
02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:55.240
you guys may look good luck to the guy.
You know what we were,

2193
02:07:55.241 --> 02:07:57.730
we were involved in a terrible situation where a guy was,

2194
02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:59.710
who is victimizing all these comics.

2195
02:07:59.711 --> 02:08:02.110
He was stealing all their shit and nobody wanted to be in the room when he was,

2196
02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:04.270
when he,
when he was in the room,
nobody wanted to be on stage.

2197
02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:06.740
They would light the light up to make sure that you knew that he was onstage.

2198
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:10.780
So you wouldn't do new material.
Ah,
it was crazy and they all got it all.

2199
02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:15.020
That's not even kidding.
It's valid conversation.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

2200
02:08:15.070 --> 02:08:17.650
It all came about and I didn't want it to happen.

2201
02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:21.040
It's not something that I was looking forward to and it was totally

2202
02:08:21.041 --> 02:08:24.280
unpretentious.
I'll be a planned.
We had no idea it was gonna happen.

2203
02:08:24.510 --> 02:08:28.300
<v 2>I,
I remember when it was happening and they,</v>

2204
02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:31.540
cause I know you and I'm like,
oh this isn't going to be

2205
02:08:31.630 --> 02:08:35.830
<v 3>good.
Cause I knew you were just going to get more and more egg.</v>

2206
02:08:36.370 --> 02:08:39.130
Well I wasn't even really that angry with him.
You brought him down.

2207
02:08:39.710 --> 02:08:43.390
Tantalus I know he's a really person,
but he knows he's a bad,

2208
02:08:45.010 --> 02:08:49.720
all of it.
All what it all is about it,
you know,

2209
02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:52.660
he's better off that exposed as well.
You know,

2210
02:08:52.661 --> 02:08:54.440
he was the reason why and don't have first place.

2211
02:08:54.850 --> 02:08:57.670
He was living in some crazy lie state where you know,

2212
02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:01.000
he really believe his bullshit.
He wanted that to happen.
That's why when,

2213
02:09:01.001 --> 02:09:02.890
when people do terrible things like serial killers,

2214
02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.630
a lot of them want to get caught.
You know,

2215
02:09:04.631 --> 02:09:06.810
a lot of them do shit cause they want to get caught.

2216
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:08.530
I always leave a little something.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2217
02:09:08.531 --> 02:09:10.690
And when you do fucked up things to people,
men,

2218
02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:14.740
I think for real that there's somewhere in the back of your head that you got to

2219
02:09:14.741 --> 02:09:15.940
know that that's affecting you.

2220
02:09:16.210 --> 02:09:19.870
You can't just skate away clean and he didn't think he had that.
Sure.
Yeah.

2221
02:09:19.871 --> 02:09:22.330
I think everybody,
everybody does fucked up things.

2222
02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:24.580
He denied a complete total sociopath.

2223
02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:29.670
Eventually started giving in the watched the movie.
I am comic.
Yeah.

2224
02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:33.880
He just flat out admits it.
And I am comic who feel bad for the guy.

2225
02:09:33.881 --> 02:09:36.370
What is that about?
And mental illness.

2226
02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:40.470
Who's some documentary about lots of different comics?
Are you in it?
No.

2227
02:09:41.010 --> 02:09:42.910
What was no one ever heard of it.
Yeah.
I don't know.

2228
02:09:42.911 --> 02:09:44.650
I didn't hear about it until after it was already made,

2229
02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:45.880
but apparently he's in it,

2230
02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:48.680
<v 2>you know,
whatever man,
you know,
give a fuck.
I made up the,</v>

2231
02:09:48.710 --> 02:09:52.790
I never talked with Pauly shore for 20 years after in the army now I didn't,

2232
02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:54.740
I didn't like him.
He was,

2233
02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.610
he was a little bit like you boat but worse.
Um,

2234
02:09:58.670 --> 02:10:02.360
because he was just very aggressive and just outright mean.

2235
02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:07.400
And I wasn't used to,
I was a naive kid from the suburbs of Chicago.

2236
02:10:07.401 --> 02:10:12.170
I was just this nice guy and sweet and always full of happy love.

2237
02:10:12.171 --> 02:10:13.010
And then he,

2238
02:10:13.011 --> 02:10:18.011
he was mean to me and and on the right in front of people and on the set and I

2239
02:10:18.711 --> 02:10:23.350
just didn't want to ever work with them again.
But over the years he changed and,

2240
02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:26.810
and then I changed.
Now we're friends again and now we're talking,

2241
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:28.220
we're talking about doing,

2242
02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:31.700
we did in the army now and now I actually came up or my,

2243
02:10:31.850 --> 02:10:36.530
my aunt and old assistant mine came up with the idea of doing in the army again

2244
02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:39.050
because it's been 20 years,
I'm telling you.
Amazing.

2245
02:10:39.051 --> 02:10:43.010
No one really could work because we're in the first movie were in the reserves

2246
02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:46.160
and when you're in the reserves you can get called up to active duty at any

2247
02:10:46.161 --> 02:10:49.010
moment.
20 years.
Give this away.
Right now.

2248
02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:52.550
Someone's rewriting the script right now and they know it has to be me and him.

2249
02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:57.860
I would love it.
No,
it has to be 20 years later we have to be old and we're,

2250
02:10:57.861 --> 02:11:01.310
and we're I w w welcome somebody to write the script.

2251
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:04.370
Just make sure you sent it to me so that Holly and I can do it.

2252
02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:08.240
Now this is going to go to Paulie and then Paul is going to demand some sort of

2253
02:11:08.850 --> 02:11:13.610
Etsy and something could go down.
No,
but we're friends.

2254
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:17.980
I did a special on showtime.
What was that?
I'm in a standup special.
Yeah.

2255
02:11:18.050 --> 02:11:20.690
I can't remember what it is.
So how much standup are you doing these days?
Well,

2256
02:11:20.691 --> 02:11:24.200
I ain't never,
like I said,
do stand up.
I do these characteristics.
Do Music.

2257
02:11:24.201 --> 02:11:27.410
I tell stories.
I mean how often they do not do an in touring anymore.

2258
02:11:27.411 --> 02:11:30.500
You're not going places.
I'm starting.
I am.
You know that plays,

2259
02:11:30.501 --> 02:11:34.910
it's called borderlines.
It's in thousand oaks.
No.
What is it?
Oh,

2260
02:11:34.911 --> 02:11:38.630
they'd love to have you.
Well,
they wanted me like two or three times.
What is it?

2261
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:42.860
It's a club or something.
It's a comedy club in thousand oaks.
Yeah,
it's new.
Yeah,

2262
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:45.530
you'd love it.
I'll,
I'll give him a couple of years ago.

2263
02:11:45.531 --> 02:11:48.920
Then they asked me to do like maybe even five different times.
I said No.
I said,

2264
02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:51.350
no,
they probably can't pay you your money.

2265
02:11:51.351 --> 02:11:55.090
But like I want to do it because I don't,
cause when I do what I,

2266
02:11:55.091 --> 02:11:58.760
I fly my son out,
I fly Tim Walsh out the guitar player.

2267
02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:02.960
I usually bring an assistant and it just,
and then I then there,
where's my money?

2268
02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:06.740
You know?
So I'm like paying for everybody a little bit in this one.

2269
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:12.010
I don't have to fly anybody out or do anything or pay for anything and that they

2270
02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:16.160
paid for me to fly out honestly.
And,
and they put us all up.
You know,

2271
02:12:16.170 --> 02:12:19.940
we all just cram into one or two hotel rooms,
but still I pay for their food.

2272
02:12:19.941 --> 02:12:20.774
I pay for this,

2273
02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:25.190
but here I'm going to do the show and I'm going to still make about as much

2274
02:12:25.191 --> 02:12:26.600
money as I do when I go on the road.

2275
02:12:26.690 --> 02:12:29.510
Will you ever do like the brand Improv and the Irvine Improv?

2276
02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:32.250
Those are great because they're right and they're like a real,

2277
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:36.220
there's so many people in California.
It can support that many comedy clubs.
Yeah.

2278
02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:38.870
Have you ever seen me on the marquee?
Many,
many times.

2279
02:12:38.871 --> 02:12:42.110
I'll be there and I see that you have just been there or that you're coming up.

2280
02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:45.210
You ever seen me at my,
yeah.
Yeah,
you're right.
I haven't done it.

2281
02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:49.610
It's been awhile and yeah,
but I'm getting back into it.
Well Dude,
listen,

2282
02:12:49.611 --> 02:12:53.780
we're going to end this thing.
Okay,
great.
To see a healthy,
stray motivated.

2283
02:12:53.781 --> 02:12:56.790
It sounds like it's sign.
Is it a good place?
I truly route for you,
dude.

2284
02:12:56.830 --> 02:13:01.780
I love you.
I'm so glad.
I'm so happy to see you puffy.
Well,

2285
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:04.100
just kidding.
You look great.
You're always great.

2286
02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:09.160
And I'm going to take you up on your offer of going into your tank to get you.

2287
02:13:09.161 --> 02:13:10.750
I really,
really want to go there and you know,

2288
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.820
we live close to each other and I'm,
and then I like having friends like you.

2289
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:18.740
I like having a Goddamn bulldog in my corner.
I need it back the fuck off.

2290
02:13:18.741 --> 02:13:23.210
This kind of energy back off.
I got Joe Rogan in my fucking corner.

2291
02:13:26.630 --> 02:13:28.420
All of a sudden Brian is Charlie Sheen's producers.

2292
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:32.010

2293
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:36.480

2294

And then Andy Dick on Twitter,

2295
02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:44.640

2296
02:13:44.641 --> 02:13:47.850

2297
02:13:47.851 --> 02:13:50.430

2298
02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:52.980

2299
02:13:52.981 --> 02:13:57.630
I'm sure you'll get some fucking hilarious tweets and he's a goddamn character.

2300
02:13:57.690 --> 02:14:01.640
The real deal.
He's not faking it.
This is real.
This is really handy.
You don't,

2301
02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:05.460
it takes a lot to grow one of these fucking things.
You know,

2302
02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:06.780
a lot of weird shit has to happen.

2303
02:14:06.781 --> 02:14:09.270
It's like Jenga seamonk you gotta meet my friend.
Joey does.

2304
02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:13.380
Isn't that one where there's just not a whole lot of opportunities in life or

2305
02:14:13.381 --> 02:14:16.110
someone like that to develop.
Great.
