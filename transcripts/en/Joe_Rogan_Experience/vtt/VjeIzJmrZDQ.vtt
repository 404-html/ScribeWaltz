00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 4>just waited till results came back</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing these girls and you just didn't</v>

<v Speaker 4>side some other guy's life is ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well I heard this is this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll suck it up and take my lumps also</v>

95
00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.370
<v Speaker 4>on the other level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I figured I could tell them I'm 90% sure</v>

96
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:10.670
<v Speaker 4>it was like a cop out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not like fully sag.</v>

97
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have it.</v>

98
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 4>We fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it that uh,</v>

99
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.720
<v Speaker 4>from what I understood when I got tested</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that you can only test herpes while</v>

100
00:04:17.721 --> 00:04:20.420
<v Speaker 4>the outbreaks happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they act to actually spoon a little</v>

101
00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:22.940
<v Speaker 4>out of the outbursts that I could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't really,</v>

102
00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:26.390
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to test for herpes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of times you can get tested</v>

103
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.790
<v Speaker 4>during like not an outbreak and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

104
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.560
<v Speaker 4>to just positive for herpes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

105
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.110
<v Speaker 4>I think it was an old tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was like 15 years ago.</v>

106
00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:35.810

108
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.410

<v Speaker 4>I heard if you do pop it like you could</v>

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>w with civilization,</v>

118
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.060
<v Speaker 6>part of another inherent component of</v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization did you have to be better</v>

119
00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:18.950
<v Speaker 6>than someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

120
00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.980
<v Speaker 6>And so a lot of the things that we do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

121
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 6>our,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our,</v>

122
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.590
<v Speaker 6>our ways of delineating ourselves from</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sab,</v>

123
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.650
<v Speaker 6>like what we would call savages are more</v>
<v Speaker 6>primitive people.</v>

124
00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:34.490
<v Speaker 6>Like you wore shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you didn't want your skin to be too dark</v>

125
00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:35.750
<v Speaker 6>or Tan you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

126
00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:37.730
<v Speaker 6>you wanted to show that you had more</v>
<v Speaker 6>affluence,</v>

127
00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 6>that you weren't as barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't have to poop on it.</v>

128
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:42.680
<v Speaker 6>You could just poop it and push it</v>
<v Speaker 6>flusher and it went away.</v>

129
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 6>And like it just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that just comes soft hands.</v>

130
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.180
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cultured demeanor.</v>

131
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.500
<v Speaker 6>You were less and less animal running</v>
<v Speaker 6>away if you were less animal.</v>

132
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you're trying to be more animal,</v>

133
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.000
<v Speaker 6>but the word is primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am a primate.</v>

134
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.273
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

135
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 6>What advancements the society make that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think has society made that you</v>

136
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 6>think are beneficial?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

137
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 6>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I think medicine is benefit.</v>

138
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think everything is beneficial.</v>

139
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 6>It's just that what I'm more concerned</v>
<v Speaker 6>of about is what's,</v>

140
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 6>what has been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is no longer needed that is still</v>

141
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 6>essential.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's,</v>

142
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 6>it's my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

143
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have really an aversion against</v>

144
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.180
<v Speaker 6>civilization and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just that vitamin C is still</v>

145
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 6>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we can't get around the fact that</v>

146
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 6>vitamin C is still necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm just trying to figure out</v>

147
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 6>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when you're trying to figure out</v>

148
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 6>diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to kind of boil down to,</v>

149
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 6>could this disease be a rising because</v>
<v Speaker 6>of some non input,</v>

150
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 6>some essential input that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting.</v>

151
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:49.820
<v Speaker 6>And so as people get more and more</v>
<v Speaker 6>advanced,</v>

152
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 6>the our,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our health,</v>

153
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the terms of biological sense isn't</v>

154
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 6>getting better with us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so what happens to a species that</v>

155
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 6>advances itself right out of being a</v>
<v Speaker 6>species?</v>

156
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.620
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that,</v>

157
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 6>that's more what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm interested in.</v>

158
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 6>So I like it all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like all technology.</v>

159
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:11.620
<v Speaker 6>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Netflix might be my favorite technology.</v>

160
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible].</v>
