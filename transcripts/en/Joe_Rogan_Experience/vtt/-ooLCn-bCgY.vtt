00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well hiking on antelope island one time and uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.070
<v Speaker 2>just north of Utah and then they have this big buffalo reserve out there.</v>

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like a public peak,</v>

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 2>probably 6,000 a day height and uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.200
<v Speaker 2>but there's all these free range in buffalo or were on the island,</v>

7
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:17.830

8
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.500
<v Speaker 2>and it's coming back down the hill.</v>

9
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Me and my buddy and as we were hiking down a trail,</v>

10
00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:23.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

11
00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:25.060
<v Speaker 2>about 300 yards down,</v>

12
00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I can see there's a couple of buffalo right on,</v>

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.851
<v Speaker 2>right on the trail,</v>

14
00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:28.684
<v Speaker 2>on the footpath.</v>

15
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>

16
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.890
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

18
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

19
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 2>they'll be moved on by the time we get there and we come down the hill,</v>

20
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 2>come around this big boulder and sure as shit,</v>

21
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:36.554
<v Speaker 2>they're still standing there.</v>

22
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

23
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.610
<v Speaker 2>my uncle had a farm,</v>

25
00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:40.301
<v Speaker 2>he had cows.</v>

26
00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I never been around a damn buffalo.</v>

27
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the difference in a suddenly,</v>

28
00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 2>well they'll move.</v>

29
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.880
<v Speaker 2>It's just a big ass cow,</v>

30
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:46.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 2>so we just keep walking towards him.</v>

32
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.210
<v Speaker 2>But if he jumps up on a rock and he's just laughing at me like a dumb ass</v>

33
00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 2>because I'm standing there at this point,</v>

34
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 2>this thing is 15 feet and it was grazing like sideways with his hip towards me</v>

35
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.341
<v Speaker 2>and he's just eating.</v>

36
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 2>And finally he looks up and turns his head and looked at me,</v>

37
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

38
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And I realized holy shit was like the size of a Volkswagen beetle man.</v>

39
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

40
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.150
<v Speaker 2>He's just looking at me.</v>

41
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking this is some dumb shit.</v>

42
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.493
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

43
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>

44
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

45
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.110
<v Speaker 2>what do I do?</v>

46
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's a different buffalo buddy.</v>

47
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 2>That's a water buffaloes,</v>

48
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 2>animals school.</v>

49
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.741
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

50
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Top lives.</v>

51
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Bison.</v>

52
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.090
<v Speaker 2>He just turns and looks at me and I'm like,</v>

54
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm so fucked.</v>

55
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.933
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

56
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what else to do.</v>

57
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 2>That thing took one more step forward.</v>

58
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.880
<v Speaker 2>You did towards him.</v>

59
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what else to do.</v>

60
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Mix.</v>

61
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.373
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at,</v>

62
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

63
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 2>we're making it,</v>

64
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

65
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I just kinda like took.</v>

66
00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know like he's going to charge me,</v>

67
00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:43.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating,</v>

68
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 2>running or what.</v>

69
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 2>So I took one more step and you just kinda like often and him and his buddy ran,</v>

70
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:52.930
<v Speaker 2>but when he started running me like the whole ground shook and I remember</v>

71
00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:56.680
<v Speaker 2>standing there looking at my friend thinking like that could've been really bad,</v>

72
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

73
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 2>But it's open to the public and out there all the time.</v>

74
00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 2>It's buffalo everywhere.</v>

75
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 2>So how's that?</v>

76
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:06.274
<v Speaker 2>A winning combination.</v>

77
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

78
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.271
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

79
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I like it way better than I liked the idea of nature at your own risk.</v>

80
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for introducing me to your dog because I have to tell you that that video</v>

81
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:21.741
<v Speaker 1>of you grabbing that raccoon and chucking it down the stairs was easily one of</v>

82
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the most gangster things I've ever seen.</v>

83
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 1>That lets you do.</v>

84
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Is this it?</v>

85
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I had to put a little disclaimer up here so that you know,</v>

86
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>the animal rights folks wouldn't get pissed off.</v>

87
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.873
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

89
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get pissed off right now.</v>

90
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I hear him crying because there's no audio in the cameras,</v>

91
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

92
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.100
<v Speaker 1>just getting mauled by this thing and you just picked it up and fucking chucked</v>

93
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:46.171
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

94
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Like gangster dude.</v>

95
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

96
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you didn't just push it away,</v>

97
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>you picked it up over your head,</v>

98
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>went back behind the head like you're throwing a medicine ball because another</v>

99
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>angle.</v>

100
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

101
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>this is the best tag over the back of the head.</v>

102
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>And Bang,</v>

103
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>we're talking to Kevin rose,</v>

104
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the founder of dig.</v>

105
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

106
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I gotta say though it was a little liquid courage.</v>

107
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I'd had a couple glasses of wine and number two,</v>

108
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>my intention was to go down there and just kick it.</v>

109
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

110
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>But it was on top of my dog so I'd be punting my dog at the same time.</v>

111
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.240
<v Speaker 1>It was tangled is.</v>

112
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.520
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

114
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>then I grabbed it and it's,</v>

116
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>it's greasy and kind of bristly so,</v>

117
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.631
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

118
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:26.051
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

119
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:26.420
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

120
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>it's when it's your baby.</v>

121
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds weird to say with the dog,</v>

122
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like I thought he was dying.</v>

123
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.111
<v Speaker 1>He was getting,</v>

124
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>he was howling like he was getting shredded.</v>

125
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>But with this clause,</v>

126
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:35.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>so I'm thinking my dog is being killed.</v>

128
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Did you think it was a coyote?</v>

129
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

130
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

131
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>we had seen raccoons in the backyard before and it was just one of those things</v>

132
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>where they always just kind of like run away the second that the lights come on</v>

133
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>and this time I don't know what he was.</v>

134
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he had babies.</v>

135
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Actually there were some other records that we saw with him at the same time.</v>

136
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know,</v>

137
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.253
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

138
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.320
<v Speaker 1>those weird sort of a fringe wildlife creatures like raccoons and coyotes and</v>

139
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:02.861
<v Speaker 1>kind of hang around.</v>

140
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Cities are so creepy.</v>

141
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

142
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a ton in San Francisco.</v>

143
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just all over the place at night.</v>

144
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>They just dig through the trash.</v>

145
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

146
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.250
<v Speaker 1>A</v>

147
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.790
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine was living out with the Navajos to kind of get his head straight.</v>

148
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

149
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.560
<v Speaker 3>And he would,</v>

150
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

151
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.140
<v Speaker 3>help take care of their animals when they,</v>

152
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.240
<v Speaker 3>this male female shamans both would go off to do pod ceremonies.</v>

153
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.991
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

154
00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:27.290
<v Speaker 3>And he stayed out there for about a year and he kind of put himself together and</v>

155
00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:28.124
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

156
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.000
<v Speaker 3>what helped you and we're interested in what your medicine is.</v>

157
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.650
<v Speaker 3>And he said it was Mtma.</v>

158
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.521
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

159
00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:34.641
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

160
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:38.570
<v Speaker 3>we'd be interested in trying to experience Mtma.</v>

161
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 3>So I was invited out there and we ended up doing this ceremony in a Navajo and</v>

162
00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:49.130
<v Speaker 3>they only spoke Navajo.</v>

163
00:04:49.131 --> 00:04:51.080
<v Speaker 3>They didn't speak English at all.</v>

164
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.850
<v Speaker 3>And there was this,</v>

165
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.620
<v Speaker 3>like in the western movies,</v>

166
00:04:54.621 --> 00:04:57.620
<v Speaker 3>there was a trail of dust coming in.</v>

167
00:04:57.621 --> 00:05:02.621
<v Speaker 3>Somebody came on horseback to be our translator and it was their friends,</v>

168
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.860
<v Speaker 3>it was their 17 year old niece,</v>

169
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.150
<v Speaker 3>holy Shit.</v>

170
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.380
<v Speaker 3>And she came</v>

171
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 3>to mediate during this mtv experience and it became clear that this was really</v>

172
00:05:18.681 --> 00:05:19.514
<v Speaker 3>for her,</v>

173
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.320
<v Speaker 3>not so much for them to,</v>

174
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.860
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

175
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.340
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

176
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.210
<v Speaker 3>for them to show their seventh year who was torn between the different cultures,</v>

177
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.250
<v Speaker 3>that that's something about our culture.</v>

178
00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:30.380
<v Speaker 3>We wanted what they had or was,</v>

179
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.910
<v Speaker 3>we saw it and respected it.</v>

180
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

181
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.853
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

182
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.260
<v Speaker 3>and a lot happened in and in the,</v>

183
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.320
<v Speaker 3>it was wonderful in all different ways and there are some important healings.</v>

184
00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:43.154
<v Speaker 3>But in the morning,</v>

185
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

186
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.840
<v Speaker 3>when we were going,</v>

187
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.890
<v Speaker 3>this young woman,</v>

188
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.013
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

189
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.070
<v Speaker 3>was going to get back on her horse and she had 17 magazine.</v>

190
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

191
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.500
<v Speaker 3>And was reading it.</v>

192
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I started out that,</v>

193
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

194
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:03.191
<v Speaker 3>even out on the reservation in these protected cultures that had this</v>

195
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.220
<v Speaker 3>globalization of ideas and Internet and vodcasts and people are being exposed to</v>

196
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 3>ideas that they wouldn't have normally been exposed to.</v>

197
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:14.691
<v Speaker 3>Even in China.</v>

198
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:14.871
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

199
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 3>they're having to do so much just kind of sensor stuff.</v>
