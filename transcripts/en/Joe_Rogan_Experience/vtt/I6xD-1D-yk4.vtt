<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to,</v>

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I've never told this story and I haven't told the story because it's a scary</v>

4
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

5
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I've never told this story before,</v>

7
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.501
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to tell you,</v>

8
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you don't know the story of Joe.</v>

9
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.390
<v Speaker 1>last summer I went to south of France and I was with my wife and my buddy and</v>

11
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:17.341
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

12
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>the first day were there.</v>

13
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:18.661
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

14
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go cliff diving.</v>

15
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

16
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

17
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that idea.</v>

18
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a group of people.</v>

20
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>One guy's the best horseback rider in the world,</v>

21
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>whatever random stuff.</v>

22
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>So we get there and do,</v>

23
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.940
<v Speaker 1>we get there and we're up there and it's,</v>

24
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

25
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

26
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>it's the ocean number one.</v>

27
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.461
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

28
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it's craggy rocks.</v>

29
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.141
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>

30
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:37.831
<v Speaker 1>it's very high.</v>

31
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:38.521
<v Speaker 1>And number four,</v>

32
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.354
<v Speaker 1>it's cold.</v>

33
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 1>So I look over and my instincts and I go,</v>

34
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>so if we jump,</v>

35
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>where are we supposed to swim too?</v>

36
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>And the surfer,</v>

37
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>who was from there,</v>

38
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I said over there,</v>

39
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like the way the tide is washing up on those rocks.</v>

40
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

41
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

42
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>that's all I had to here.</v>

43
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Not going to do it.</v>

44
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.073
<v Speaker 1>Prosing cons,</v>

45
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.913
<v Speaker 1>not going to do it.</v>

46
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>The horseback rider jumps his,</v>

47
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>his chubby girl jumps and guess who else jumps?</v>

48
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.373
<v Speaker 1>My wife,</v>

49
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>mother of my children,</v>

50
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>she just goes,</v>

51
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>she's talked about it,</v>

52
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:08.311
<v Speaker 1>but she's like,</v>

53
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this to competitive chick.</v>

54
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

55
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.471
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

56
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>that girl's going to do it.</v>

57
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.053
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it.</v>

58
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's my,</v>

59
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the mother of my children.</v>

60
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>So guess what?</v>

61
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I got to go in and make sure she's okay.</v>

62
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>So I jumped in and you're scared shitless.</v>

63
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't scared about jumping.</v>

64
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:25.434
<v Speaker 1>I was mad.</v>

65
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I was mad because I don't like the ocean.</v>

66
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I was mad because I didn't have a good instinct about it.</v>

67
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I was mad because I don't know that area.</v>

68
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And the mother and children decides to,</v>

69
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really mad about they see your,</v>

70
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.001
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

71
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:36.781
<v Speaker 1>fuck these kids.</v>

72
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:37.471
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to jump into this.</v>

73
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:38.011
<v Speaker 1>Rochelle.</v>

74
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>My wife is brutally competitive and she's not going to let somebody won.</v>

75
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.491
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

76
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>

77
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.051
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

78
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

79
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Now I jump in and I know you and I are the same mind because your cost is like</v>

80
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:48.631
<v Speaker 1>this too.</v>

81
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I jump in and I,</v>

82
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.043
<v Speaker 1>I swim,</v>

83
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>we swim and now we have to go up on the rocks and the waves are hitting these</v>

84
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>rocks.</v>

85
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.000
<v Speaker 1>So I said to Amanda,</v>

86
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

87
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to ride this wave onto these rocks.</v>

88
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Let me go first so I can turn around and pick,</v>

89
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>grab you.</v>

90
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.873
<v Speaker 1>No big deal.</v>

91
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I go and as I go and turn around,</v>

92
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I get hit with a second wave with which just came out of nowhere.</v>

93
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

94
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

95
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>it literally knocks me,</v>

96
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>rolls me on this really sharp coral.</v>

97
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.593
<v Speaker 1>So my feet,</v>

98
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.381
<v Speaker 1>my hands,</v>

99
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>everything's all full of blood.</v>

100
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>My waist,</v>

101
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.381
<v Speaker 1>my waist,</v>

102
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.760
<v Speaker 1>legs are all full of blood.</v>

103
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>She starts to kind of panic.</v>

104
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>She goes and like that and the ways and stuff.</v>

105
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause I got the wind knocked out of me and I'm telling you right now,</v>

106
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

107
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I grabbed her and she goes,</v>

108
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:36.811
<v Speaker 1>get away from me.</v>

109
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>She thought I was going to drown her so I have to [inaudible] well she just</v>

110
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>didn't want it.</v>

111
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.541
<v Speaker 1>She didn't tell.</v>

112
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 1>She thought I was gonna bring her down.</v>

113
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So just so I have to calm her down.</v>

114
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>So it gets so bad cause I can't grab her.</v>

115
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get her back up on the rocks again.</v>

116
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Washed off again.</v>

117
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.373
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

118
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.423
<v Speaker 1>so now,</v>

119
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>now I'm swollen with seawater.</v>

120
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>She's swollen seawater and,</v>

121
00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:57.470
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

122
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.303
<v Speaker 1>and I'm literally,</v>

123
00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally talking to me like this,</v>

124
00:02:59.471 --> 00:02:59.610
<v Speaker 1>like go.</v>

125
00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.861
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

126
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:00.281
<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>

127
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:00.800
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to,</v>

128
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to stay here.</v>

129
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's relax.</v>

130
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's just swim further out so we can get used to these waves.</v>

131
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's wait until it calms down.</v>

132
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It's crisis mode,</v>

133
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.533
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

134
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>It's crisis mode.</v>

135
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>And I realize that I'm panicked and I don't really actually have the strength.</v>

136
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried that I'm going to go,</v>

137
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

138
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I got to hold her up because she's,</v>

139
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>she's strong and I think,</v>

140
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:23.601
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

141
00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and I think I've got to get behind her,</v>

142
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>but she's literally pushing me away.</v>

143
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Now she grabs onto me and now I'm like,</v>

144
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>

145
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotta get it together here because she's holding onto me and kind of</v>

146
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>pulling me under the dude who's the surfer sees what's going on.</v>

147
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>He dives in,</v>

148
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>he grabs her.</v>

149
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.731
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

150
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding her.</v>

151
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>He comes up and I go take her,</v>

152
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>take her like really calm.</v>

153
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I go take her cause she's panicking.</v>

154
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.803
<v Speaker 1>He grabs her,</v>

155
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.230
<v Speaker 1>he ends up having to put her on top of him and he lets the wave ride them up.</v>

156
00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:00.660
<v Speaker 1>He gets his whole back and legs ripped up and he pulls her on shore.</v>

157
00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>So she's a bloody mess.</v>

158
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I ride the next wave in my feet,</v>

159
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>my hands,</v>

160
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.861
<v Speaker 1>my body.</v>

161
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm all ripped up.</v>

162
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm all ripped up for the rest of the v.</v>

163
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>The vacation never been more angry so bad by the way,</v>

164
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:17.161
<v Speaker 1>that the helicopter that the rescue helicopter shows up and and people all</v>

165
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>crowded around like where they saw everything happened.</v>

166
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm full of blood and we're all full of blood.</v>

167
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>The rescue helicopter comes up,</v>

168
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.061
<v Speaker 1>which is by the way,</v>

169
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>some $20,000 fine or something.</v>

170
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

171
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I grab Amanda,</v>

172
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I grab my,</v>

173
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>grab my friends,</v>

174
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:31.121
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

175
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>let's get in the car.</v>

176
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Now they're going to equate the,</v>

177
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>they think of the catches and figure out it's us.</v>

178
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>So we jumped in the car and drive off.</v>

179
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.030
<v Speaker 1>That was the scariest I,</v>

180
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>what I realized there was that the sea can take you so quickly,</v>

181
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>you just go to the bottom.</v>

182
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:44.291
<v Speaker 1>Then I find them,</v>

183
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you will see you later love.</v>

184
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And that should happens all the time because people are,</v>

185
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know how to ride,</v>

186
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>currents and waves,</v>

188
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>if you're not used to it,</v>

189
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>if you know a good swimmer,</v>

190
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.413
<v Speaker 1>swimmer,</v>

191
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.413
<v Speaker 1>lose your life.</v>

192
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

193
00:04:57.701 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>and I am a good swimmer.</v>

194
00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what I thought about?</v>

195
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 1>You know what's crazy to me,</v>

196
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>into your family.</v>

197
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.193
<v Speaker 1>Think about me.</v>

198
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I thought about my kids getting without their mom.</v>

199
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:05.194
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going back without,</v>

200
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.921
<v Speaker 1>without their mom.</v>

201
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:06.754
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to happen.</v>

202
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's way scarier than me losing my life.</v>

203
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I never had that expression.</v>

204
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't jump in,</v>

205
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>well that's exactly.</v>

206
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you didn't.</v>

207
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

208
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>That's why they should suffer.</v>

209
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>But it sounds like there was a lot of space between a lot for jumping in and a</v>

210
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>surfer and the surfer in,</v>

211
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

212
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know we were in trouble.</v>

213
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

214
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>That's why I jumped in.</v>

215
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you see the big fight after,</v>

216
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:32.720
<v Speaker 1>it was so scary.</v>

218
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.091
<v Speaker 1>That was thankful.</v>

219
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:34.421
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

220
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

221
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.433
<v Speaker 1>she was okay.</v>

222
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

223
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>That was a bad situation.</v>

224
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like telling a story cause it was cause,</v>

225
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.700
<v Speaker 1>cause of the feeling it gave me like I didn't feel you.</v>

226
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not good to feel that vulnerable to see is a scary bitch.</v>

227
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.283
<v Speaker 1>The scheme.</v>

228
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck around.</v>

229
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.613
<v Speaker 1>I love the ocean.</v>

230
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 1>My buddy who says something that's not fun.</v>

231
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 1>My buddy used to have to take,</v>

232
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

233
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.521
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>

234
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:59.521
<v Speaker 1>he would make his money by sailing boats in the winter for rich people up the</v>

235
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:00.351
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic,</v>

236
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>which doubled during storm season sailboats.</v>

237
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>And he was only one of the few people willing to do that.</v>

238
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And ice,</v>

239
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>he got caught in a storm for 23 hours or the swells were going over his body.</v>

240
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.561
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't,</v>

241
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>they had to literally fly a guy from Alaska in a special boat cause nobody else</v>

242
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:17.571
<v Speaker 1>could do it,</v>

243
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>could navigate the storm who tugged him in and he strapped himself and he was</v>

244
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>getting hypothermia as the water and he couldn't see the waves at night.</v>

245
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>He had to wait to hear them because they would just come over the boat and the</v>

246
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 1>whole boat would submerge.</v>

247
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

248
00:06:30.901 --> 00:06:31.734
<v Speaker 1>that happened.</v>

249
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 1>That happened for him.</v>

250
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>That happened for about 10 hours.</v>

251
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Just kept some merging and they were out.</v>

252
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>He keeps [inaudible] from cap and you've got to steer you towards the weight.</v>

253
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be an expert.</v>

254
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And he was so,</v>

255
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.440
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

256
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

257
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 1>they were stuck out there and you're at the mercy of the C and a lot of times</v>

258
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you just get washed up on rocks and you die.</v>

259
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 1>So we had to keep the rocks.</v>

260
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>He got to keep away from the rocks and he had to keep the boat.</v>

261
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 1>He had to deal with these insane waves at night where you can't see them.</v>

262
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Nature's another love rocks and the water and the water got a simultaneously</v>

263
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:03.780
<v Speaker 1>worry about bolts.</v>

264
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Sounds right.</v>

265
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>And you're in a metal boat for 10 hours.</v>

266
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a wood boat.</v>

267
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a word blood.</v>

268
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269

<v Speaker 1>It's a wood boat.</v>

270
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a sailboat.</v>

271
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

272
