12
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:40.521
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So we're going to keep doing it and it's</v>

14
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>fun as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

15
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on itunes now.</v>

16
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>You can get it on itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just Joe Rogan podcasts.</v>

17
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>That would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that has the most ones.</v>

19
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple other ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>other people have created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the real one.</v>

21
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of people have noticed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've taken straight up bits and put </v>

22
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>it on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on itunes and put underneath the podcast</v>

23
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>name and get on.</v>

24
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my attitude about the Internet is always</v>

25
00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>that the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.060
<v Speaker 1>can't put any energy into trying to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shit down because uh,</v>

28
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.970
<v Speaker 1>especially as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inconvenient sometimes.</v>

29
00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:26.971
<v Speaker 1>Like I go places and people have already</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen bits that aren't out on anything </v>

30
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>yet and they've seen it because somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube did and then,</v>

31
00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan hope has a whole bit about,</v>

32
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how people will put your shit on Youtube</v>

33
00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:34.540
<v Speaker 1>and it's not done and the waistband hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

34
00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:38.740
<v Speaker 1>And the way I work with both work real </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar in that we have an idea and it's</v>

35
00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>never like totally done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep adding to it and tweaking it.</v>

36
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>And then when you put it on a recording,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least there,</v>

37
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

38
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>But oftentimes like I'll put something </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a recording and then like a week </v>

39
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>afterwards or two weeks or even a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

40
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I have a better tagline.</v>

41
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.000
<v Speaker 1>So before the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the things,</v>

42
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.340
<v Speaker 1>even on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have like a new better way to do it,</v>

43
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody wants said to me that you </v>

44
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>got to look at standup comedy as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>every performance is just,</v>

45
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just capturing a moment in time,</v>

46
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>which is true once you've got some good </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff out there,</v>

47
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's not true if you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything good out there.</v>

48
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.460
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't like until like shiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy Jihad.</v>

49
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I was not happy with any of my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do it.</v>

50
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:19.180
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

51
00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I did that,</v>

52
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 1>2005,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the one that's just called Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>

54
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>when is out of print with no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that was from the Netflix shows </v>

55
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>from Netflix that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't.</v>

56
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix when I was doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing the man show,</v>

57
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>UFC comedy and fear factor at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

58
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 1>I was doing all of them at once and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was frazzled and it was just like,</v>

59
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't my best performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't a.</v>

60
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.200
<v Speaker 1>like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at it,</v>

61
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that I'm like tents.</v>

62
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like enjoying myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

63
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's that one I consider like </v>

64
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.941
<v Speaker 1>that's a moment in time like that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least it was better than the stuff that </v>

65
00:02:59.941 --> 00:02:59.941
<v Speaker 1>I had before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:00.120
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my</v>

67
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>first CD,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked some of the bits but it's like </v>

68
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>my delivery was kind of fucked up back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

69
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.140
<v Speaker 2>But now I looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I looked at the stuff that's out now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

71
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:12.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every now and then someone can like </v>

72
00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 2>videotape something like before way </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it becomes anything,</v>

73
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'll video tape me just talking </v>

74
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.671
<v Speaker 2>shit onstage and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll become a bit somewhere down the </v>

75
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:22.010
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

76
00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>most times someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I go to a show somewhere,</v>

77
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 2>if they're a fan of download my shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might've already seen the premise,</v>

78
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it might not be as fun for them.</v>

79
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

80
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.010
<v Speaker 2>so it's like you could look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

81
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>it hurts you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it does.</v>

82
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I think having stuff out on the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people enjoy is always good.</v>

83
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 3>That's the big problem though with </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything like now like tv shows,</v>

84
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.630
<v Speaker 3>other like Hulu and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to find out how to.</v>

85
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.720
<v Speaker 3>They want to share it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to do that,</v>

86
00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 3>that concept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also need to make a profit from</v>

87
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:55.021
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of interesting how they </v>

88
00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:55.021
<v Speaker 3>have to go about doing it.</v>

89
00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:55.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I think we're,</v>

90
00:03:55.021 --> 00:03:57.690
<v Speaker 2>we're experiencing a whole new model and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think uh,</v>

91
00:03:57.691 --> 00:04:02.691
<v Speaker 2>your attitude about how your fans get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your stuff is very important.</v>

92
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>It's very important because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents how you feel like as a </v>

93
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.221
<v Speaker 2>performer and like what you feel the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship that you have with </v>

94
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:12.221
<v Speaker 2>audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

95
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.150
<v Speaker 2>And if I was like this greedy dude that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

96
00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:14.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck them,</v>

97
00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:16.670
<v Speaker 2>they got to fucking pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want my fucking money.</v>

98
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Like if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really think like that,</v>

99
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:22.850
<v Speaker 2>like these people are just like you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be fucking honest man.</v>

100
00:04:22.851 --> 00:04:25.310
<v Speaker 2>If you were 18 years old and you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>broke,</v>

101
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.950
<v Speaker 2>you gotta fucking download Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to do it.</v>

102
00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:31.040
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you're not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes you broke,</v>

103
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think is if you have people,</v>

104
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you have a certain attitude </v>

105
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.381
<v Speaker 2>about like what you do and that attitude</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you're just trying to create </v>

106
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:46.130
<v Speaker 2>things and you're trying to make money </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of it,</v>

107
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.280
<v Speaker 2>but really trying to create things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to enjoy.</v>

108
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that making money saying it's </v>

109
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.790
<v Speaker 2>the money will come if you work and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>people enjoy your work,</v>

110
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 2>they're going to support you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are going to come to see your </v>

111
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.191
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to buy dvds if they have </v>

112
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:03.191
<v Speaker 2>the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the money.</v>

113
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Like if I like there's a band that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really liked out,</v>

114
00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:08.120
<v Speaker 2>download their shit online like on </v>
<v Speaker 2>itunes and then I'll buy a CD to,</v>

115
00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:10.550
<v Speaker 2>to play in my car just because I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>support them.</v>

141
00:06:18.551 --> 00:06:22.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability eventually of making </v>

142
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.271
<v Speaker 2>printers that can print up things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like really what's going to </v>

143
00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:25.271
<v Speaker 2>happen eventually.</v>

144
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Kind of real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they can make with these,</v>

147
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.620
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to get to a point and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that far off where you say if </v>

148
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.581
<v Speaker 2>your mouse breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be able to go to this </v>

149
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 2>computer printer thing and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to put in the combinations.</v>

150
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:50.411
<v Speaker 2>So whatever the fuck you have to say to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a mouse or download a mouse program </v>

151
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 2>and a mouse is going to fucking appear </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your.</v>

153
00:06:57.071 --> 00:06:57.071
<v Speaker 2>things with a printer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

154
00:06:57.071 --> 00:07:00.131
<v Speaker 2>And remember the first printers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were old and clumsy and fucked up and </v>

155
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 2>slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I have this new epson.</v>

156
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just like 100 bucks or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a hundred 50 bucks.</v>

157
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.620
<v Speaker 2>The fucking thing is like lightning </v>
<v Speaker 2>pages just flying by.</v>

158
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.910
<v Speaker 2>You can print,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can print it from the road.</v>

159
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 2>You can call it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

160
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's programs that you can.</v>

161
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 2>You can get on your God damn iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could print it up from your computer.</v>

162
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.830
<v Speaker 4>My old apartment just somebody had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wireless printer and they just had an </v>

163
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.610
<v Speaker 4>open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'd sit there and find the biggest </v>

164
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:29.880
<v Speaker 4>goat cifo get with herpes and I'll throw</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in,</v>

165
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.920
<v Speaker 4>print it on their printer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped 50 pages and it never went away </v>

166
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.170
<v Speaker 4>and in fact printing successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's also funny how much you that that</v>

167
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.180
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could pretty much go through any </v>

168
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.180
<v Speaker 4>neighbor there and get on somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>printer and do that.</v>

169
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.910
<v Speaker 4>It's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just take your laptop.</v>

170
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:47.890
<v Speaker 4>Gives me three plus hotspot.</v>

171
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.020
<v Speaker 2>That's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could wreck some marriages like </v>

172
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.071
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you knew a dude who had a parental </v>

173
00:07:56.071 --> 00:07:56.071
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could send him.</v>

00:07:56.071 --> 00:08:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Just doctored up photoshop pictures of </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

176
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.480
<v Speaker 2>That's the golden rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other golden rule about the </v>

177
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.701
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's a picture of you on the </v>

188
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.280
<v Speaker 4>have you ever seen how a dildos are </v>
<v Speaker 4>made?</v>

190
00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:41.260
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a asshole,</v>

191
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:42.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could buy like a girls.</v>

192
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen how they're made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen them.</v>

193
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.190
<v Speaker 2>But you're fucking something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be a girl's body</v>

194
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have people that sit there and </v>

195
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.941
<v Speaker 4>paint veins and veins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the Mexican ladies and they the </v>

196
00:08:55.941 --> 00:09:00.830
<v Speaker 4>first day wiped his coat and they sit </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and have to stroke it for like an </v>

197
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.070
<v Speaker 4>hour and that does under vein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it looks like the skin underneath the</v>

198
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 4>veins underneath the skin didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>car,</v>

199
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.630
<v Speaker 4>they let that dry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they have this person that just </v>

200
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 4>does the purple ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's significant game veins.</v>

201
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 4>Like the ones that have the main blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>flow to the tip of the Dick,</v>

202
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:19.371
<v Speaker 4>kind of smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is the most creepiest thing that if </v>

203
00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:23.541
<v Speaker 4>you look there and you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody getting murdered and you're </v>

204
00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:23.541
<v Speaker 4>watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just people making dildos.</v>

205
00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when they cast her,</v>

206
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 4>it's so true though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is like,</v>

207
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.600
<v Speaker 4>well what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it creep us out so much to see </v>

208
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:31.600
<v Speaker 4>like bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the idea of bodies.</v>

209
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't know because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

210
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like body parts and stuff.</v>

211
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 4>It's terrifying to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when they make a cast,</v>

212
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 4>like if they have fucking Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy come in there and they're like,</v>

213
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:46.101

215
00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:50.511

<v Speaker 4>Almost like when you ever see like a </v>

216
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 4>horse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to get sperm from a horse</v>

217
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:55.881
<v Speaker 4>to make babies or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to like Jack it off into this </v>

<v Speaker 4>plaster and he can't touch it.</v>

220
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.820
<v Speaker 4>He has to stay hard for five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't,</v>

221
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 4>he has to have his girl or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a porn star girl to sit there and </v>

222

<v Speaker 4>it's fucking crazy.</v>

228

<v Speaker 4>minutes and they pull up this thing and </v>

230
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.100
<v Speaker 4>then they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't just play paste hair on it.</v>

231
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 4>They actually have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So with a thread and needle every single</v>

232
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.180
<v Speaker 4>hair on the pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's ridiculous.</v>

233
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 4>Go to a dildo factory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's one in studio city.</v>

234
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 4>You got to take a trip there with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>camera or something.</v>

235
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 4>I think they would let you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That they did for Hbo Sixty years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but dates hbo.</v>

237
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:59.781
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they would do it just </v>

238
00:10:59.781 --> 00:10:59.781
<v Speaker 4>for a regular dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless they were like UFC fans.</v>

239
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Dude the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they think they would want to like </v>

240
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.010
<v Speaker 4>show people if you let them get with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>basic.</v>

241
00:11:07.011 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would never do that $100,000.</v>

242
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm not getting a boner in front of any </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

243
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

244
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

245
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.030
<v Speaker 4>People are doing all of the scientists </v>
<v Speaker 4>like shut the fuck up.</v>

246
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.880
<v Speaker 4>That would be weird though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's what was after in this </v>

247
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:25.880
<v Speaker 4>video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw that the porn star.</v>

<v Speaker 4>There was a box of his dick's.</v>

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.950
<v Speaker 4>What a great idea though because people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are such freaks.</v>

252
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.740
<v Speaker 4>They watched someone fucking a video and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to be like that person.</v>

253
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

254
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.330
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get one just to see what it's </v>

255
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:47.490
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have ones now.</v>

256
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.410
<v Speaker 4>Crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

257
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

258
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of a human</v>

259
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 5>being thought that up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first guy.</v>

260
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.500
<v Speaker 5>A really good warranty priest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's just get someone and we'll make an</v>

261
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 5>exact mold of their body so we can fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

262
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How crazy is it?</v>

263
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.700
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this new thing about the.</v>

264
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.940
<v Speaker 5>The priests.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what's happening that they're a</v>

265
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 5>equating there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Them being persecuted for kid fucking to</v>

266
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 5>the Holocaust and the pope say going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>save them all.</v>

267
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're saying to south </v>
<v Speaker 5>park.</v>

268
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 5>Let's talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is going on?</v>

269
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 5>Like how crazy is the Catholic religion?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact,</v>

270
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.920
<v Speaker 5>the fact that it's still around is mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>boggling,</v>

271
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.990
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that anybody takes him </v>
<v Speaker 5>seriously,</v>

272
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.120
<v Speaker 5>are all these fucking kids get molested?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how many kids have to get molested </v>

273
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 5>before someone steps in and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

274
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 5>maybe these guys aren't directly tied to</v>
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

275
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>

276
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 5>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we've been fooled.</v>

277
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.460
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

278
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:48.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just amazing that a cult can have </v>

279
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.021
<v Speaker 5>so much power in 2010 and and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody wants to call it a cult and </v>

280
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:56.851
<v Speaker 5>everybody wants to pretend that there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something sacred about it because it's </v>

281
00:12:56.851 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 5>been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's the craziest,</v>

282
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.940
<v Speaker 5>most fucked up idea ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was a big discussion about it </v>

283
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 5>on our message board and one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting arguments was so people were</v>

284
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're your discounting all the positive</v>

285
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:14.101
<v Speaker 5>work that the Catholic Church does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying anything positive that </v>

286
00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:14.101
<v Speaker 5>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

287
00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:18.751
<v Speaker 5>they do charities or that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's them doing things outside of </v>

288
00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 5>religion that doesn't have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do with the fucking religion.</v>

289
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 5>That's just people doing charitable </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

290
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:28.290
<v Speaker 5>That does not make up for kid fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That does not make up for living a life </v>

291
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:32.581
<v Speaker 5>filled with guilt so they can control </v>
<v Speaker 5>you and keeping you down like a little </v>

292
00:13:32.581 --> 00:13:32.581
<v Speaker 5>bitch.</v>

293
00:13:32.581 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 5>Terrified about every fucking thing you </v>
<v Speaker 5>do because you're going to burn in hell.</v>

294
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 5>And anybody who's ever been a Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 5>school knows that.</v>

295
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a year in Catholic school,</v>

296
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was like I did a year in jail.</v>

297
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.610
<v Speaker 5>My first grade,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first grade I went to Catholic school,</v>

298
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 5>Our Lady of chest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jehovah,</v>

299
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

300
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 5>in New Jersey and this fucking cunt nun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sister Mary Josephine.</v>

301
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 5>I was like a pretty happy kid before </v>
<v Speaker 5>this happened,</v>

302
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my parents had just broken up and the </v>

303
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.520
<v Speaker 5>impact of it hadn't hit me yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

304
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.660
<v Speaker 5>but I was still in denial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

305
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.930
<v Speaker 5>but I would see my dad's still because </v>
<v Speaker 5>we were still in New Jersey.</v>

306
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.880
<v Speaker 5>And then while this was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to Catholic school for a year and</v>

307
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:15.790
<v Speaker 5>it was horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was brutal.</v>

308
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:18.940
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This nun was such a fucking cunt.</v>

309
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 5>Everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything you did,</v>

310
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.460
<v Speaker 5>she would just be on you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She will tell you she's going to make </v>

311
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.910
<v Speaker 5>you sit on a nail and the closet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's going to have to stay overnight.</v>

312
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.740
<v Speaker 5>And she was just as haggard old bitch </v>
<v Speaker 5>that nobody loved.</v>

313
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 5>Nobody had fun with her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody told jokes to her.</v>

314
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 5>She never danced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She never supposedly never fucked,</v>

315
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she wasn't allowed to do shit.</v>

316
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 5>She was just the worst representation of</v>
<v Speaker 5>an elderly woman.</v>

317
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.670
<v Speaker 5>Possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best would be a woman who's lived a </v>

318
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.401
<v Speaker 5>life of joy and she's just super </v>
<v Speaker 5>friendly to everybody because she feels </v>

319
00:14:53.401 --> 00:14:53.401
<v Speaker 5>so blessed</v>

320
00:14:53.401 --> 00:14:54.460
<v Speaker 2>that she made it through this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is great.</v>

321
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.000
<v Speaker 2>This fucking con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She used to hit us.</v>

322
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:04.001
<v Speaker 2>She really used to hit us like people </v>
<v Speaker 2>think like Catholic school teachers </v>

323
00:15:04.001 --> 00:15:04.001
<v Speaker 2>don't hit you with rulers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

324
00:15:04.001 --> 00:15:05.570
<v Speaker 2>they fucking hit you with rulers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's real shit.</v>

325
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.390
<v Speaker 2>They'll smack you in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was brutal.</v>

326
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.570
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every day was terrifying,</v>

327
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 2>but I got awesome grades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was that crazy.</v>

328
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Like right after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fell off school hardcore often that my</v>

329
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:24.161
<v Speaker 2>was in gifted classes and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next year after a Catholic school </v>

330
00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:26.390
<v Speaker 2>and then I totally stopped trying and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was sleeping.</v>

331
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:31.391
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stayed up all night and just when </v>

332
00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:31.391
<v Speaker 2>you're in a Catholic school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so terrified.</v>

333
00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 2>You will push the everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to have a fucking see.</v>

334
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll yell at you.</v>

335
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 2>They're monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

336
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.860
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

337
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.190
<v Speaker 2>it's just that whole idea as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy is the worst idea possible.</v>

338
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 2>That means you're putting the control of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness.</v>

339
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.370
<v Speaker 2>You're putting your trust in the wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>of someone who lives in a cult of kid </v>

340
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 2>fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

341
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

342
00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.780
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of guys aren't allowed to fuck </v>

343
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:01.780
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

344
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.360
<v Speaker 2>that's real natural.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's the dumbest fucking idea ever.</v>

350
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:20.590
<v Speaker 2>The dumbest idea ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have to pretend unlike CNN and </v>

351
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:25.031
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Catholic Church?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never.</v>

358
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 2>crazy places together.</v>

359
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.690
<v Speaker 2>All men really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

360
00:16:42.691 --> 00:16:47.691
<v Speaker 2>the nuns are all evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they all look haggard and beaten </v>

361
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:47.691
<v Speaker 2>Dab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

362
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 2>a few of them do some charity work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do some good things to.</v>

363
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 2>They donate some of the millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>

364
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:57.371
<v Speaker 2>They trick people into giving them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd donate some of that and they do </v>

365
00:16:57.371 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 2>some good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yet you never really hear about this</v>

366
00:16:58.011 --> 00:16:59.690
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the amish religion.</v>

367
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Catholicism is one of the worst ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Catholics were controlling the </v>

368
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:06.220
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be fucked.</v>

369
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 2>You mean everybody wants to fight off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslims.</v>

370
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:09.140
<v Speaker 2>At least the Muslims like the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>

371
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Muslims like each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholics don't even like each other </v>

372
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.721
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking controlling you with </v>

373
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:16.721
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

374
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:20.010
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess Muslims if you believe in like,</v>

375
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hardcore jihadists,</v>

376

<v Speaker 2>I guess they do to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

377
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.920
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

378
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:27.820
<v Speaker 2>cat Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that has over over the,</v>

379
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 2>the Muslims says you don't hear about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholics who said bars as much.</v>

380
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.320
<v Speaker 2>It's more rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

381
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:34.160
<v Speaker 2>It's happened though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

382
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 2>It's been Catholic suicide bombers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

383
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.690
<v Speaker 2>You never see a Buddhist cock sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

384
00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.550
<v Speaker 2>you never Buddhist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

385
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.010
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to be scared to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tent in the middle of the woods with a</v>

386
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:51.011
<v Speaker 2>Buddhist guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to think he's going to </v>

387
00:17:51.011 --> 00:17:51.011
<v Speaker 2>fucking rape you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to guys to protect me.</v>

388
00:17:51.011 --> 00:17:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A real Buddhist though,</v>

389
00:17:52.161 --> 00:17:55.040
<v Speaker 2>people will argue that a real Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't fuck kids too.</v>

390
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

391
00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think maybe that's just a former </v>

392
00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:00.490
<v Speaker 3>retards and like to be around each other</v>

393
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.870
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you know,</v>

394
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.680
<v Speaker 2>and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

395
00:18:03.681 --> 00:18:06.110
<v Speaker 2>you guys talk about the subject of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion a lot.</v>

396
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Like it comes up a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't it?</v>

397
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's all about?</v>

398
00:18:10.491 --> 00:18:15.491
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's programming and then that's really </v>

399
00:18:15.491 --> 00:18:19.691
<v Speaker 2>all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows anymore about what life is </v>

400
00:18:19.691 --> 00:18:20.390
<v Speaker 2>all about and you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

401
00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:23.000
<v Speaker 2>we have wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've learned things.</v>

402
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us have had different life </v>

403
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.771
<v Speaker 2>experiences that we've benefited from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We try to express these to each other </v>

404
00:18:29.771 --> 00:18:30.170
<v Speaker 2>and we can all get a little smarter in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the process,</v>

405
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.830
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is nobody really knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on and nobody </v>

406
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.250
<v Speaker 2>knows where this is going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has any idea what this is,</v>

407
00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.380
<v Speaker 2>you know this itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this,</v>

408
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:44.410
<v Speaker 2>if we live this life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this life would be the craziest drug </v>

409
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.170
<v Speaker 2>trip ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

410
00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:48.650
<v Speaker 2>If you had some sort of a logical two </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensional life,</v>

411
00:18:48.651 --> 00:18:53.651
<v Speaker 2>like a binary life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something you could read out on a </v>

412
00:18:53.651 --> 00:18:53.651
<v Speaker 2>piece of paper.</v>

413
00:18:53.651 --> 00:18:55.640
<v Speaker 2>If that was life and that life was </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced to this life right here,</v>

414
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.190
<v Speaker 2>you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this life is psychedelic,</v>

415
00:18:58.191 --> 00:19:01.940
<v Speaker 2>this is insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything is insane and it gets more</v>

416
00:19:01.941 --> 00:19:03.800
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous by the minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

417
00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:08.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be fucking CNN headline news </v>

418
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:08.801
<v Speaker 2>and they'll have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

419
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:08.801
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:11.450
<v Speaker 2>an episode on him is Kim Kardashians </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked too fat.</v>

421
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally will do that.</v>

422
00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

423
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.820
<v Speaker 2>this is where we're at this tiger woods </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and this Jesse James Shit and all </v>

424
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 2>this crazy stuff where we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on,</v>

425
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.130
<v Speaker 2>on nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

426
00:19:22.131 --> 00:19:27.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so much more concerned with </v>

427
00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:27.290
<v Speaker 2>dancing with the stars than we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that we're in the middle of</v>

428
00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:28.000
<v Speaker 2>two fucking years</v>

429

<v Speaker 3>wars grazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have too much info about Demi Moore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We have too much info about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>current Dashi and people that would </v>

431
00:19:37.441 --> 00:19:40.861
<v Speaker 3>normally not know about unless you rode </v>
<v Speaker 3>a horse in the town and somebody told </v>

432
00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:40.861
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

433
00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:42.260
<v Speaker 2>It's so fascinating that it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>

434
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.000
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

435
00:19:44.001 --> 00:19:47.390
<v Speaker 2>we are the weirdest animal ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't,</v>

436
00:19:47.391 --> 00:19:50.570
<v Speaker 2>if people didn't exist and you made them</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

437
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.090
<v Speaker 2>it would be too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

438
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.300
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't be that fucked up like fucked</v>

439
00:19:56.301 --> 00:20:01.301
<v Speaker 2>up and they figured out nuclear weapons </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucked up and they can fly through </v>

440
00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:02.840
<v Speaker 2>the air to all parts of the planet </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

441
00:20:02.841 --> 00:20:05.660
<v Speaker 2>That fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

442
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.270
<v Speaker 2>They're really having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the pope.</v>

443
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.750
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking cult leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

444
00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:14.120
<v Speaker 2>why are you sitting down with them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

445
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.050
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

446
00:20:15.051 --> 00:20:16.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to play along with them.</v>

447
00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:21.281
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to play along with them </v>

448
00:20:21.281 --> 00:20:22.601
<v Speaker 2>because playing along with them is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>concession that what they're saying is </v>

449
00:20:22.601 --> 00:20:25.901
<v Speaker 2>legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really represent something </v>

450
00:20:25.901 --> 00:20:25.901
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nonsense.</v>

451
00:20:25.901 --> 00:20:27.650
<v Speaker 2>The individuals inside that </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

452
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.330
<v Speaker 2>they represent something meaningful.</v>

453
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:34.330
<v Speaker 2>They're individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just trapped in this web of </v>

454
00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:34.520
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trapped in this thing.</v>

455
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.640
<v Speaker 2>They know I'm a Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born Catholic and the Catholic </v>

456
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:39.640
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking human.</v>

457
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Why are you lumping yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily with this gigantic group of </v>

458
00:20:45.051 --> 00:20:49.030
<v Speaker 2>people who believe nonsense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense and no one's</v>

459
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:54.031
<v Speaker 2>saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody else has the answers like I'm </v>

460
00:20:54.031 --> 00:20:56.701
<v Speaker 2>not saying I'm right and you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I know I have some information you </v>

461
00:20:56.701 --> 00:20:57.340
<v Speaker 2>don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything or you know,</v>

462
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:02.341
<v Speaker 2>I have my own life that I can tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly what I've learned from my </v>

463
00:21:02.341 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 2>experiences and things that I've read </v>
<v Speaker 2>that other people have researched,</v>

464
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:07.490
<v Speaker 2>but what do I really know about what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this is and what's next?</v>

465
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Nothing and I know as much as anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know as much as anybody.</v>

466
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.650
<v Speaker 2>There's not a single person who has more</v>
<v Speaker 2>of an more of a realistic view of the </v>

467
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 2>next phase of existence.</v>

468
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Whether it exists at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows and it doesn't help.</v>

469
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Pretending you do know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what fucks everybody up with,</v>

470
00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:31.921
<v Speaker 2>fucks everybody up is someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretends they do know because then we </v>

471
00:21:31.921 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 2>with our fucking monkey instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just follow that guy and I'm like,</v>

472
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows.</v>

473
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:37.140
<v Speaker 2>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so confident and this guy,</v>

474
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 2>of course he's confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these people are listening to them.</v>

475
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's crazy and then all these people are</v>

476
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:42.970
<v Speaker 2>listening to them and so the more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to him,</v>

477
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:47.971
<v Speaker 2>the more he believes his own bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the more he really thinks he is </v>

478
00:21:47.971 --> 00:21:51.181
<v Speaker 2>special and ordained and there to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word of the Lord and the more but </v>

479
00:21:51.181 --> 00:21:51.181
<v Speaker 2>delusional they become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>

480
00:21:51.181 --> 00:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking classic Jim Jones </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern,</v>

481
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.330
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what it is,</v>

482
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:59.350
<v Speaker 2>is it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is completely ridiculous that </v>

483
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 2>some guys who don't get pussy have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers.</v>

484
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has got the fucking answers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be no ideologies like this.</v>

485
00:22:07.901 --> 00:22:12.901
<v Speaker 2>This should be no predetermined patterns</v>
<v Speaker 2>of behavior that are attractive to </v>

486
00:22:12.901 --> 00:22:17.611
<v Speaker 2>follow because anything predetermined </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is gonna fuck you up because </v>

487
00:22:17.611 --> 00:22:19.540
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to give you a realistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>map of the world.</v>

488
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:24.690
<v Speaker 2>You live in your map of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back when people had very little </v>

489
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:24.820
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Catholicism was created,</v>

490
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:26.980
<v Speaker 2>the map of the world was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no internet.</v>

491
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.030
<v Speaker 2>There is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

492
00:22:28.031 --> 00:22:33.031
<v Speaker 2>in an exchange of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no pornography available and </v>

493
00:22:33.031 --> 00:22:36.391
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking iphone anywhere you look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many things that are </v>

494
00:22:36.391 --> 00:22:39.781
<v Speaker 2>different about that world than about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this world and so all their crazy </v>

495
00:22:39.781 --> 00:22:40.050
<v Speaker 2>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

496
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Speaker 2>could be easily disproved if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to start up that religion today,</v>

497
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

498
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:50.461
<v Speaker 2>but it's there and it's been there </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever so people just fucking stick </v>

499
00:22:50.461 --> 00:22:50.461
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

500
00:22:50.461 --> 00:22:51.820
<v Speaker 2>It's the weirdest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like logically,</v>

501
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 2>religion is one of the weirdest things </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

502
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.140
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to believe it's still </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

503
00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.500
<v Speaker 2>You really got stopped watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lost at the wrong time.</v>

504
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.900
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't fucking getting really </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrical religion.</v>

505
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe I'll tune in.</v>

506
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I still got a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm confused now.</v>

507
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.200
<v Speaker 2>You probably know religion a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than me.</v>

508
00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I really like do and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

509
00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:18.631
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Sir enough to get annoyed and </v>

510
00:23:18.631 --> 00:23:21.301
<v Speaker 2>then when I started researching it more </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes more and more cookie and then </v>

511
00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:24.991
<v Speaker 2>then I can't take it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I only know surface details of like </v>

512
00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:28.591
<v Speaker 2>all religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all I know about all of them as </v>

513
00:23:28.591 --> 00:23:28.591
<v Speaker 2>they're all ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

514
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.790
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that as dangerous.</v>

515
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Anything where you've got older people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you grow up with these older people</v>

516
00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:35.350
<v Speaker 2>that are telling you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

517
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.410
<v Speaker 2>what's what you should and shouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>

518
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at best you know,</v>

519
00:23:41.381 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 2>we exist really well in small tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think</v>

520
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when people are in small tribes,</v>

521
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.210
<v Speaker 5>those small tribes are so important to </v>
<v Speaker 5>stay alive.</v>

522
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:55.211
<v Speaker 5>These people have this intense bond of </v>
<v Speaker 5>family and I think what happened with </v>

523
00:23:55.211 --> 00:23:58.571
<v Speaker 5>human beings is we went from small </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribes to gigantic countries so fast,</v>

524
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:05.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>over the course of just a few thousand </v>

525
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:05.020
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think our,</v>

526
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.071
<v Speaker 5>our body caught up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think our body has separated </v>

527
00:24:09.071 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 5>itself from the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

528
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.100
<v Speaker 5>we really are all connected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

529
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:18.101
<v Speaker 5>I think in the small tribes when they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were looking out for each other all the </v>

530
00:24:18.101 --> 00:24:21.341
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was really like having a giant </v>

531
00:24:21.341 --> 00:24:23.681
<v Speaker 5>family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we don't feel connected as a </v>

532
00:24:23.681 --> 00:24:23.681
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

533
00:24:23.681 --> 00:24:27.011
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel connected with all the </v>

534
00:24:27.011 --> 00:24:27.011
<v Speaker 5>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

535
00:24:27.011 --> 00:24:28.240
<v Speaker 5>That seems ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's 300 million of us.</v>

536
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:33.250
<v Speaker 5>So like how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can anybody connect to everybody </v>

537
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 5>back then they could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's how we're wired.</v>

538
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.100
<v Speaker 5>We're wired for that kind of life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's why so many people are </v>

539
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.221
<v Speaker 5>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people were depressed because </v>

540
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:45.161
<v Speaker 5>the energy in their life is imbalanced </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they don't have enough love and </v>

541
00:24:45.161 --> 00:24:45.161
<v Speaker 5>compassion.</v>

542
00:24:45.161 --> 00:24:46.500
<v Speaker 4>It's all about their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all about.</v>

543
00:24:46.501 --> 00:24:49.320
<v Speaker 4>It's all about you need to just feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>love.</v>

544
00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:54.000
<v Speaker 4>You don't need negative things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you were on a plane and you</v>

545
00:24:54.001 --> 00:24:57.390
<v Speaker 4>hear like a screaming kid right next to </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're trying to sleep,</v>

546
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.910
<v Speaker 4>you know now might be different from you</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

547
00:24:59.911 --> 00:25:04.911
<v Speaker 4>you have kids now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the old days it used to just </v>

548
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:05.190
<v Speaker 4>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to just fucking knocked the kid</v>

549
00:25:05.191 --> 00:25:06.840
<v Speaker 4>out or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't draw me.</v>

550
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.900
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't bother me at all anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

551
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.080
<v Speaker 4>it was like comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

552
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.670
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked kids.</v>

553
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.760
<v Speaker 4>What if I started crying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would have slapped you in the </v>

554
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:19.870
<v Speaker 4>waterfalls?</v>
<v Speaker 4>On your ass?</v>

555
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:27.540
<v Speaker 4>I went waterfalls on you the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian gets bottled up.</v>

556
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.270
<v Speaker 4>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do once the once a year.</v>

557
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Crazy heart.</v>

560

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There was a spa one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because it was about a little</v>

565
00:25:47.881 --> 00:25:50.430
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little kid getting lost.</v>

566
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to tell you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>junkie of technology and more also more </v>

<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and you are a little bit of an apple </v>

585
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.110
<v Speaker 2>fan.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Know why?</v>

587

588
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.640
<v Speaker 2>You're excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really hating that you're </v>

589
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:49.640
<v Speaker 2>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

590
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.870
<v Speaker 2>it's when you see what gets tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not when you praise and object,</v>

591
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:55.130
<v Speaker 2>but when you start shitting on like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kindle kid was dead,</v>

592
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 2>fucking cute and then people's defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>their kindle and they get crazy.</v>

593
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm not an apple fan.</v>

594
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

595
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.260
<v Speaker 3>So many cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love so many cameras.</v>

596
00:27:05.261 --> 00:27:10.261
<v Speaker 3>I liked the company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to support something that I </v>

597
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:10.261
<v Speaker 3>believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're the best.</v>

598
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I love their little portable cameras </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the IPAD,</v>

599
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.920
<v Speaker 3>but what's crazy is before I was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tricking myself,</v>

600
00:27:14.921 --> 00:27:15.220
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

601
00:27:15.221 --> 00:27:17.440
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get netbook this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>better than a netbook.</v>

602
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready to support this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then lately they've been showing all</v>

603
00:27:21.011 --> 00:27:23.770
<v Speaker 3>these applications and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have netflix now,</v>

604
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to teether Internet from my</v>
<v Speaker 3>cell phone and be able to watch netflix </v>

605
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.720
<v Speaker 3>anywhere I want to throughout the united</v>
<v Speaker 3>slugging them,</v>

606
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.180
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was losing his marbles.</v>

607
00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of people.</v>

608
00:27:36.011 --> 00:27:41.011
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm living in my fucking technology </v>

609
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:41.260
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking great.</v>

610
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny because if you were forced</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live your life in front of a computer</v>

611
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.950
<v Speaker 2>and then someone allowed you to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside,</v>

612
00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 2>you'd be so happy to go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

613
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because we're forced to live in </v>

614
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:54.680
<v Speaker 2>reality that the computer life seems so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more interesting.</v>

615
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.270
<v Speaker 2>It seems more like it like I'm supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

616
00:27:57.271 --> 00:28:02.271
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for something we always </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about and that's why Google is </v>

617
00:28:02.271 --> 00:28:05.661
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite websites because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>searching for something always 30 </v>

618
00:28:05.661 --> 00:28:08.601
<v Speaker 2>percent of them do and that's the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about my message board when I go </v>

619
00:28:08.601 --> 00:28:08.601
<v Speaker 2>to that message board everyday I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking,</v>

620
00:28:08.601 --> 00:28:09.600
<v Speaker 2>what do you got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

621
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I looking for?</v>

622
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:15.981
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will click links and so literally </v>

623
00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:15.981
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'm nodding out to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>keyboard.</v>

624
00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:16.450
<v Speaker 2>You ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like nodding out keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sitting there.</v>

626
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.240

<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

627
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:25.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to be writing and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>start surfing the Internet and then next</v>

628
00:28:25.861 --> 00:28:27.240
<v Speaker 2>thing you know I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not now and then I'm like,</v>

629
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:29.250
<v Speaker 2>what am I dealing with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of retarded mind.</v>

630
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just keep checking,</v>

631
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll be ready to go to bed and then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>just say let me get online real quick </v>

632
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.010
<v Speaker 2>and see what's going on in the world</v>

633
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.210
<v Speaker 3>and you go to the same websites over and</v>
<v Speaker 3>over waiting for that one</v>

634
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.480
<v Speaker 2>almost or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what man,</v>

635
00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.640
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty bad ass as a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

636
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.930
<v Speaker 2>there's never been a better time to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to promote your gigs so much better</v>

637
00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.480
<v Speaker 2>than it's ever been before because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you can,</v>

638
00:28:49.481 --> 00:28:52.330
<v Speaker 2>you can get information out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:54.970
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you develop like a whole network of your</v>

640
00:28:54.971 --> 00:28:55.670
<v Speaker 2>fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how do you get someone to show us</v>

648
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.750
<v Speaker 2>what they know about you is like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do like the Ed Sullivan show.</v>

649
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.590
<v Speaker 2>I know you go on stage and do like seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

650
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 2>That's all you got mad right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

<v Speaker 2>who was a very funny guy as sometimes </v>

653
00:29:27.351 --> 00:29:28.680
<v Speaker 2>has a hard time getting gigs on the road</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was saying you should put together</v>

654
00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:29.790
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

655
00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:34.791
<v Speaker 2>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do your best bits that you've ever </v>

656
00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:37.371
<v Speaker 2>done and do and throw them up on youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he has a lot of bits it doesn't </v>

657
00:29:37.371 --> 00:29:40.581
<v Speaker 2>even do anymore because he's got new </v>
<v Speaker 2>bits and it might be you don't have </v>

658
00:29:40.581 --> 00:29:41.090
<v Speaker 2>those old bits like in a video you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should make.</v>

00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:38.950
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

691
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have an iphone.</v>

692
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.540
<v Speaker 4>Downloaded it right into in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I purchased it,</v>

693
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:46.420
<v Speaker 4>download it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and with a Bluetooth it to my stereo and</v>

694
00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:47.400
<v Speaker 4>my car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking.</v>

695
00:30:47.401 --> 00:30:49.000
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like a jukebox.</v>

696
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:54.090
<v Speaker 4>I have the best shoe box ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nuts that just that idea is crazy </v>

697
00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 4>and that shit's going to be in your car </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's going to be voice activated.</v>

698
00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.590
<v Speaker 2>You gonna be able to press a button and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

699
00:30:58.591 --> 00:31:02.970
<v Speaker 2>go to itunes and download rollingstones </v>
<v Speaker 2>tattoo you.</v>

700
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit's gonna.</v>

701
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the demos of the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>photoshop cs five or six or whatever it </v>

702
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.780
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new feature in it.</v>

703
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.440
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on your message board.</v>

704
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Look under like new photoshops and on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the main form,</v>

705
00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:19.520
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's smart fixing.</v>

706
00:31:19.521 --> 00:31:22.040
<v Speaker 3>So can you take a picture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a treater is a shadow.</v>

707
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.980
<v Speaker 3>There's a glare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's somebody in the way of you.</v>

708
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.340
<v Speaker 3>You just circle it and cut it and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it does,</v>

709
00:31:28.341 --> 00:31:31.280
<v Speaker 3>it looks around it and tries to make its</v>
<v Speaker 3>own scene.</v>

710
00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.150
<v Speaker 3>So you're just sitting there like trig </v>
<v Speaker 3>on Blair gone shadow gone.</v>

711
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.240
<v Speaker 3>It just like you have a brand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it does all the hard work that took</v>

712
00:31:38.241 --> 00:31:41.270
<v Speaker 3>like hours and hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be the fake his photos,</v>

713
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>photos are going to be real anymore.</v>

714
00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Like pretty soon every photo you take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can zoom into your face,</v>

715
00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:48.770
<v Speaker 3>just a rate cut at wrinkle and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>

716
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.820
<v Speaker 3>make her skin grow back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we'll find out what your skin </v>

717
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:53.820
<v Speaker 3>textures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just see the video demo.</v>

718
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.830
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

719
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.890
<v Speaker 3>for those completely gone nap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go to the moon</v>

720
00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.020
<v Speaker 4>10 times next year.</v>

721
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:07.510
<v Speaker 2>It really is getting very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technology is getting very strange.</v>

722
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>

723
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:13.771
<v Speaker 2>Getting to have this weird point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've talked about this before and </v>

724
00:32:13.771 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about onstage lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There used to be that people,</v>

725
00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.730
<v Speaker 2>and I wrote about this in my blog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when when they invented something,</v>

726
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.010
<v Speaker 2>it was to make their life better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

727
00:32:21.011 --> 00:32:26.011
<v Speaker 2>you the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first cavemen invented putting a </v>

728
00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:26.011
<v Speaker 2>sharp stick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

729
00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:30.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor appointed rock at the end of the </v>

730
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.481
<v Speaker 2>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like it's kill Santa and then they </v>

731
00:32:32.481 --> 00:32:34.891
<v Speaker 2>invented a pot so they could take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat and put it inside and carry it </v>

732
00:32:34.891 --> 00:32:34.891
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they invented all these.</v>

733
00:32:34.891 --> 00:32:39.590
<v Speaker 2>It made their life easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck does the large Hadron do</v>

734
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 5>to make your life easier?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tag It looks awesome.</v>

735
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:48.310
<v Speaker 5>It looks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like the biggest robot </v>

736
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.390
<v Speaker 5>rollercoaster ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need to make a movie in there too.</v>

737
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.950
<v Speaker 5>Two in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine that?</v>

738
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Just to think of the idea behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are going to send Adams around a 27 </v>

739
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:03.620
<v Speaker 5>kilometer circle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a giant machine and to build up speed.</v>

740
00:33:03.621 --> 00:33:08.621
<v Speaker 5>Did they get to like just below the </v>
<v Speaker 5>speed of light and they slam into each </v>

741
00:33:08.621 --> 00:33:09.050
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>

742
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.960
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How is that trickling down to anybody?</v>

743
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean is there anything at a particle </v>
<v Speaker 5>physics that trickles down to to make </v>

744
00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.120
<v Speaker 5>life more convenient for people at </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything?</v>

745
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're talking about like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>biggest scientific project in history.</v>

746
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:29.260
<v Speaker 5>There's 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>different scientists from 100 countries </v>

747
00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.700
<v Speaker 5>and it's cost billions and billions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollars and I'm not criticizing it.</v>

748
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.970
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong because somebody said</v>
<v Speaker 5>something about this like,</v>

749
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 5>how could you attack science?</v>

750
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.260
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying,</v>

751
00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 5>they're doing what they're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so not criticizing.</v>

752
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.280
<v Speaker 5>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

753
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:45.281
<v Speaker 5>I am not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not on one side of the other and I </v>

754
00:33:45.281 --> 00:33:48.001
<v Speaker 5>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

755
00:33:48.001 --> 00:33:48.001
<v Speaker 5>with them doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just completely fascinated by it.</v>

756
00:33:48.001 --> 00:33:52.510
<v Speaker 5>I am so fascinated by the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to recreate the </v>

757
00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:57.041
<v Speaker 5>conditions right after the big bang and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what they're looking for and </v>

758
00:33:57.041 --> 00:34:01.271
<v Speaker 5>that's why they're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And probably something weird that it </v>

759
00:34:01.271 --> 00:34:01.271
<v Speaker 5>would trickle down to like storage and </v>
<v Speaker 5>power,</v>

760
00:34:01.271 --> 00:34:04.770
<v Speaker 5>like battery life is ridiculous like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

761
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 5>We're figuring out how to save power and</v>
<v Speaker 5>energy.</v>

762
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:10.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe because they are making a </v>
<v Speaker 5>corrosion.</v>

763
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:13.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it might be something weird like that</v>

764
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.160
<v Speaker 5>or it could be something game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

765
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.680
<v Speaker 5>it could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could trickle down.</v>

766
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:20.681
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean know who they'll be known for is </v>

767
00:34:20.681 --> 00:34:20.681
<v Speaker 5>to say not that smart.</v>

768
00:34:20.681 --> 00:34:24.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when things get really wonky is when </v>

769
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.320
<v Speaker 5>they really figured out how to crack </v>
<v Speaker 5>time when they figured out how to travel</v>

770
00:34:27.321 --> 00:34:28.850
<v Speaker 5>through time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

771
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:31.610
<v Speaker 5>and there's been like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a model to this,</v>

772
00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:34.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this fucking this scientist,</v>

773
00:34:34.851 --> 00:34:37.850
<v Speaker 5>I think his name was Kurt or Dale was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

774
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.920
<v Speaker 5>what else goes with the double?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

775
00:34:39.921 --> 00:34:40.670
<v Speaker 5>what is that called?</v>
<v Speaker 5>UHM,</v>

776
00:34:40.671 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

777
00:34:42.801 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 5>he was this guy who figured out that if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you could,</v>

778
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:50.830
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to take a cylinder half the </v>
<v Speaker 5>size of the solar system and spinning at</v>

779
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.610
<v Speaker 5>the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to cross it out.</v>

780
00:34:54.611 --> 00:34:56.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember exactly what the fuck,</v>

781
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:57.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

782
00:34:57.621 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 5>the formula was for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you did that,</v>

783
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:05.410
<v Speaker 5>if you actually created this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was half the size of the solar system </v>

784
00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.230
<v Speaker 5>moving at the speed of light somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 5>another,</v>

785
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.540
<v Speaker 5>you actually could your lack of time </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it is possible.</v>

786
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.390
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if,</v>

787
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.450
<v Speaker 5>what if they figure out something along </v>
<v Speaker 5>those lines.</v>

788
00:35:14.451 --> 00:35:19.451
<v Speaker 5>Because the thing about people is we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not gonna be satisfied with just the </v>

789
00:35:19.451 --> 00:35:22.751
<v Speaker 5>large Hadron collider.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they're going to figure </v>

790
00:35:22.751 --> 00:35:25.151
<v Speaker 5>this out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to create the Higgs Boson </v>

791
00:35:25.151 --> 00:35:25.151
<v Speaker 5>particle and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

792
00:35:25.151 --> 00:35:25.151
<v Speaker 5>here we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

793
00:35:25.151 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 5>we did create the God particle and we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know that it's real.</v>

794
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Speaker 5>What we know they're going to come.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be another thing is </v>

795
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Speaker 5>going to be the going to try to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazier.</v>

796
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:37.510
<v Speaker 5>We think we can make a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well if you think you'll make a black </v>

797
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.510
<v Speaker 5>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's not do it.</v>

798
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 5>Well we don't know if we can make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>black hole,</v>

799
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 2>but we think we can make and we think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll go away really quickly.</v>

800
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's their fucking with everything.</v>

801
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.350
<v Speaker 3>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

802
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.740
<v Speaker 3>I thought I like a lot that we talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about recently.</v>

803
00:35:48.741 --> 00:35:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I always keep on going back to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking is like how,</v>

804
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:57.190
<v Speaker 3>what if all this creek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because lately I haven't had a lot of </v>

805
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.190
<v Speaker 3>crazy stuff go on in my life and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

806
00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:01.781
<v Speaker 3>what if me and you in the future like </v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone 50 or changing the past,</v>

807
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.050
<v Speaker 3>you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

808
00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.480
<v Speaker 3>what do you want this month?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>

809
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.520
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're creating our own past using </v>

810
00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:09.520
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like changing time.</v>

811
00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Remember when we were talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>how weird would that be?</v>

812
00:36:12.141 --> 00:36:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Like if we could sit there now and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

813
00:36:14.451 --> 00:36:16.570
<v Speaker 3>we can go back to 1989.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you're,</v>

814
00:36:16.571 --> 00:36:18.830
<v Speaker 3>you're eating pizza here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want something crazy to happen?</v>

815
00:36:18.831 --> 00:36:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Were you eating pizza here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

816
00:36:20.091 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Let's just throw in this crazy world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

817
00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Because like lately it just seems like </v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

818
00:36:24.951 --> 00:36:29.951
<v Speaker 3>this is like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of stuff that's happened </v>

819
00:36:29.951 --> 00:36:32.081
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it's so insane that that </v>

820
00:36:32.081 --> 00:36:32.081
<v Speaker 3>doesn't even seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm waiting for a reality show.</v>

821
00:36:32.081 --> 00:36:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Cameras to come out.</v>

822
00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man,</v>

823
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

824
00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:40.371
<v Speaker 2>I've often thought that there's a path </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're supposed to live in life and</v>

825
00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:44.540
<v Speaker 2>then path will sort of illuminated </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself to you as you go along the way,</v>

826
00:36:44.541 --> 00:36:46.310
<v Speaker 2>as long as you pay attention to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>instincts,</v>

827
00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:47.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

828
00:36:47.881 --> 00:36:52.881
<v Speaker 2>I think a big part of that path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like your attitude in life and how </v>

829
00:36:52.881 --> 00:36:53.510
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you view things and how,</v>

830
00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.240
<v Speaker 2>how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you feel about yourself,</v>

831
00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:56.470
<v Speaker 2>how you feel about life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

832
00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:01.540
<v Speaker 2>And I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in as much as you can kind of dictate a </v>

833
00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:06.101
<v Speaker 2>lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of decide how you view the </v>

834
00:37:06.101 --> 00:37:06.101
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of decide your,</v>

835
00:37:06.101 --> 00:37:08.930
<v Speaker 2>your approach to things and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide based on your instincts.</v>

836
00:37:08.931 --> 00:37:13.931
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everything kind of just works out </v>

837
00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:13.931
<v Speaker 2>as great way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>

838
00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:18.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're doing the right </v>

839
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:19.751
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have to really be a </v>

840
00:37:19.751 --> 00:37:19.751
<v Speaker 2>positive person.</v>

841
00:37:19.751 --> 00:37:22.840
<v Speaker 2>You have to really be disciplined so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel like you're slacking off on </v>

842
00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.150
<v Speaker 2>all of the things that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on.</v>

843
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.640
<v Speaker 2>And there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain balance,</v>

844
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:30.790
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain guiltiness that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel when you don't work hard enough at </v>

845
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.790
<v Speaker 2>something that's there for a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

846
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:35.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily you can get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your life just by doing what </v>

847
00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:35.830
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to do and it feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

848
00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.160
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel like you're self </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating and the process,</v>

849
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

850
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.760
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a path to life,</v>

851
00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:45.761
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you might think of very </v>

852
00:37:45.761 --> 00:37:45.761
<v Speaker 2>being controlled by us in the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>using technology.</v>

853
00:37:45.761 --> 00:37:47.230
<v Speaker 2>So that was our theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

854
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe that is a possibility.</v>

855
00:37:50.391 --> 00:37:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows?</v>

856
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:56.410
<v Speaker 2>But I think what's more likely is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>every person sort of as ridiculous as </v>

857
00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 2>this sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that every person's sort of fits into a,</v>

858
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.810
<v Speaker 2>a peace in this world and that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

859
00:38:02.811 --> 00:38:06.560
<v Speaker 2>everything about it from bottled water </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fucking space shuttles,</v>

860
00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.880
<v Speaker 2>that it's all connected.</v>

861
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.630
<v Speaker 2>And then it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it seems like life,</v>

862
00:38:11.631 --> 00:38:14.000
<v Speaker 2>like we think of it as just life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we've labeled it.</v>

863
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's life on the world.</v>

864
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Here's all these people going about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their day,</v>

865
00:38:17.721 --> 00:38:18.380
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

866
00:38:18.381 --> 00:38:21.290
<v Speaker 2>a boat on the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think about it like that.</v>

867
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.980
<v Speaker 2>But really all these things in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

868
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.440
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all have a value.</v>

869
00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.380
<v Speaker 2>They all have a position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all have a purpose.</v>

870
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.560
<v Speaker 2>And it really is like what we're living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in is we're living a gigantic </v>

871
00:38:36.101 --> 00:38:41.101
<v Speaker 2>mathematical equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's what all human </v>

872
00:38:41.101 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal life,</v>

873
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.860
<v Speaker 2>when wind and fucking earthquakes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

874
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:49.861
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all a part of this insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematical equation and that chaos in </v>

875
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:53.470
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

876
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.220
<v Speaker 2>earthquakes and meteor impacts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all built into this equation.</v>

877
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 2>This is how the system works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how the system works.</v>

878
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:05.340
<v Speaker 2>It seems like this crazy randomness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fury of nature and you know,</v>

879
00:39:05.611 --> 00:39:10.611
<v Speaker 2>and birth and death and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sexuality and creativity and you </v>

880
00:39:10.611 --> 00:39:12.070
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was my childhood so bad?</v>

881
00:39:12.071 --> 00:39:14.870
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was I raised in a wealthy family now</v>

882
00:39:14.871 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 2>on lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

883
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:18.190
<v Speaker 2>all these different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different things.</v>

884
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:22.300
<v Speaker 2>They all play like a little park and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this giant fucking equation.</v>

885
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:27.301
<v Speaker 2>It's just so big we can't see it and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy and alien because it is us because</v>

886
00:39:27.851 --> 00:39:32.851
<v Speaker 2>it is the world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible for us to really </v>

887
00:39:32.851 --> 00:39:33.290
<v Speaker 2>see the big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

888
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:38.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that's very possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very possibly what we're doing in this </v>

889
00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.791
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all of us are living a giant </v>

890
00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:45.091
<v Speaker 2>mathematical equation and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably has something to do with </v>

891
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:45.130
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

892
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:50.190
<v Speaker 2>no one treats that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a serious possibility because </v>

893
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.150
<v Speaker 2>it's the subject of terminator movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

894
00:39:52.151 --> 00:39:57.151
<v Speaker 2>but if you looked at what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would see that technology is </v>

895
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.620
<v Speaker 2>increasing at a much faster rate of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution and human beings and if </v>

896
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:10.620
<v Speaker 2>essentially what we're capable of doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a human being is made calculations </v>

897
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.880
<v Speaker 2>and move and make decisions and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

898
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.870
<v Speaker 2>and have moral code and a judgment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

899
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could fucking program or </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion into a computer and it would </v>

900
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.550
<v Speaker 2>actually follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

901
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:26.580
<v Speaker 2>you could give a computer a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could force a computer to react a </v>

902
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:26.620
<v Speaker 2>certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different things.</v>

903
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Then you figure out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a put a computer so small that you </v>

904
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.390
<v Speaker 2>put it in an artificial body that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>created with your fucking computer.</v>

905
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:39.480
<v Speaker 2>And the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have computers making life and that </v>

906
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.030
<v Speaker 2>life is a computer and that computer is </v>
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>

907
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:45.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's own version of this mathematical </v>

908
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.731
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just as possible as us being a </v>

909
00:40:47.731 --> 00:40:47.750
<v Speaker 2>part of a mathematical program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

910
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

911
00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:51.460
<v Speaker 2>it's all very possible that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.210
<v Speaker 2>we are here to create technology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then our,</v>

913
00:40:54.211 --> 00:40:57.220
<v Speaker 2>our whole society is geared towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating technology.</v>

914
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:03.180
<v Speaker 2>The fact that like in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know how fucked up the pollution </v>

915
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:03.180
<v Speaker 2>isn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>China?</v>

916
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had this one city,</v>

917
00:41:05.951 --> 00:41:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think VBS TV did a,</v>

918
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a documentary on it.</v>

919
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:14.990
<v Speaker 2>This is one city where it's so bad there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just breathing the air is like </v>

920
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.410
<v Speaker 2>smoking three packs of cigarettes a day.</v>

921
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.810
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty bad here too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

922
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:25.230
<v Speaker 3>The other day I was coming or driving to</v>
<v Speaker 3>my house and you can even see burbank </v>

923
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 3>because happened to small.</v>

924
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is bad.</v>

925
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.960
<v Speaker 3>And we just breathe it in every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad where you live,</v>

926
00:41:29.961 --> 00:41:31.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's like</v>

927
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>camp good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

928
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.470
<v Speaker 4>clean air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons.</v>

929
00:41:35.471 --> 00:41:35.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

930
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.410
<v Speaker 5>Well I wanted to move to Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

931
00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.210
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to get away from this </v>
<v Speaker 5>overpopulation</v>

932
00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:41.500
<v Speaker 4>Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Texas.</v>

933
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:43.560
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody says that though,</v>

934
00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:45.150
<v Speaker 5>but that's why everybody's moving to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Austin.</v>

935
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.950
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I certainly think that places that are,</v>

936
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:49.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have less people are nicer.</v>

937
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 5>We were in Charlotte,</v>
<v Speaker 5>North Carolina this week for the UFC and</v>

938
00:41:55.021 --> 00:41:57.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in Charlotte are so fucking nice.</v>

939
00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 4>That's my second place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would move South Carolina or North </v>

940
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 4>Carolina,</v>

941
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 5>Charlotte,</v>
<v Speaker 5>North Carolina.</v>

942
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.990
<v Speaker 5>And the people were so fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was friendly.</v>

943
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.300
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was normal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

944
00:42:08.301 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a really nice place.</v>

945
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:14.960
<v Speaker 5>People were really nice though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody in restaurants and bars,</v>

946
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 5>it's like there's less people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are more down home.</v>

947
00:42:17.661 --> 00:42:18.950
<v Speaker 5>They're more friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

948
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.000
<v Speaker 5>It was a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

949
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:27.100
<v Speaker 5>This ain't the best way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>New York is where we were just at and </v>

950
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:27.110
<v Speaker 5>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was more interesting thing because</v>

951
00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:30.200
<v Speaker 5>we went from New York to Charlotte,</v>
<v Speaker 5>North Carolina and Charlotte.</v>

952
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Speaker 5>North Carolina is way better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean New York Yasmar restaurants.</v>

953
00:42:33.741 --> 00:42:34.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

954
00:42:34.071 --> 00:42:35.600
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's more stuff to do definitely.</v>

955
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.730
<v Speaker 5>But there's also more tension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's also a,</v>

956
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dealing with the overpopulation,</v>

957
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.350
<v Speaker 5>dealing with traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just like,</v>

958
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:49.390
<v Speaker 5>everybody's on edge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to live somewhere where </v>

959
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.390
<v Speaker 5>everybody's on edge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

960
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes,</v>

961
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.310
<v Speaker 5>it makes people a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people more creative.</v>

962
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.400
<v Speaker 5>It makes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it makes for more interesting </v>

963
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:57.400
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

964
00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.221
<v Speaker 5>more people in the east coast are way </v>
<v Speaker 5>more interesting to me that people on </v>

965
00:43:00.221 --> 00:43:00.221
<v Speaker 5>the west coast there were way funnier to</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

966
00:43:00.221 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it weird that the left sides of </v>

967
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 4>the United States is more dangerous than</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right side,</v>

968
00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:10.130
<v Speaker 4>but yet the right side as the angry or </v>
<v Speaker 4>people than the left side when it comes </v>

969
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.170
<v Speaker 4>to like the east coast versus West.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mostly East Coast is more dangerous.</v>

970
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Like angry people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't like the New York attitudes,</v>

971
00:43:16.711 --> 00:43:19.530
<v Speaker 4>that Boston attitude toward it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gangsters.</v>

972
00:43:19.531 --> 00:43:24.531
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>East Coast is more aggressive and </v>

973
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:24.531
<v Speaker 4>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

974
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:27.690
<v Speaker 4>that's the safer place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why you think of North Carolina?</v>

975
00:43:27.691 --> 00:43:30.360
<v Speaker 4>Why is it a safer place?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the whole side,</v>

976
00:43:30.361 --> 00:43:32.670
<v Speaker 4>we live on your like into the rural and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

977
00:43:32.671 --> 00:43:37.140
<v Speaker 4>like the earthquakes and the volcanoes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fucking like Sorta,</v>

978
00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.180
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to deal with snow.</v>

979
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:45.190
<v Speaker 4>Snow's a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so secrets of snow to snow makes people </v>

980
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.190
<v Speaker 4>a little more</v>

981
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:49.100
<v Speaker 5>more hostile in America at least.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to explain away that,</v>

982
00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.820
<v Speaker 5>that that like why people are so </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggressive in Boston and New York.</v>

983
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 5>I always said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the deal with that cold weather?</v>

984
00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:59.861
<v Speaker 5>It gets you a little more tense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's more to it than </v>

985
00:43:59.861 --> 00:44:02.291
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's cold weather end overpopulation </v>

986
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:03.620
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what makes douchey people because</v>

987
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 5>in Canada people are so fucking Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

988
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.600
<v Speaker 5>They're so nice.</v>

989
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

990
00:44:08.201 --> 00:44:10.050
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't make sense either because </v>
<v Speaker 4>even in Toronto,</v>

991
00:44:10.051 --> 00:44:12.640
<v Speaker 4>Toronto's a big ass city and people were</v>
<v Speaker 4>nice as fuck.</v>

992
00:44:12.641 --> 00:44:15.430
<v Speaker 4>They're to Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's much higher.</v>

993
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.310
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's when your body has too much </v>
<v Speaker 4>hydration,</v>

994
00:44:18.311 --> 00:44:20.200
<v Speaker 4>you get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>

995
00:44:20.201 --> 00:44:22.300
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so cute because Canada is</v>

996
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:27.390
<v Speaker 5>not a country that's living under the </v>
<v Speaker 5>shadow of this is government that's out </v>

997
00:44:27.981 --> 00:44:29.840
<v Speaker 5>there trying to take over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

998
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 5>That's part of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we've.</v>

999
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:32.140
<v Speaker 5>That</v>

1000
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.950
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't make up for America in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fifties though,</v>

1001
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.440
<v Speaker 6>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the thirties or the forties,</v>

1002
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.450
<v Speaker 6>they were pretty aggressive back then </v>
<v Speaker 6>too,</v>

1003
00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:41.880
<v Speaker 6>and even in the 18 hundreds you ever see</v>
<v Speaker 6>gangs of New York.</v>

1004
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.990
<v Speaker 6>What it used to be allowed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Have you ever thought about that?</v>

1054
00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.200

<v Speaker 6>on DVD.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Definitely.</v>

1064
00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:02.240
<v Speaker 6>It will be spiritual feel like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>different vibe in the air or something.</v>

<v Speaker 6>but I don't want to go in there.</v>

1069
00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.080
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's too scary.</v>

1070
00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.000
<v Speaker 6>But if you get.</v>

<v Speaker 6>What's that movie?</v>

1086
00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.310
<v Speaker 6>Watchman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The watchman.</v>

1087
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:51.710
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1088
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:56.050
<v Speaker 6>I was not familiar with that comic book </v>
<v Speaker 6>before that movie came out.</v>

1089
00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.270
<v Speaker 6>It was good though.</v>

1090
00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.350
<v Speaker 3>It was on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ellen is Dr Manhattan.</v>

1091
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I ever talked about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>with twitter.</v>

1092
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:05.110
<v Speaker 3>When twitter first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ellen tweeted like,</v>

1093
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to this bus stop if you want to be on</v>

1094
00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:09.420
<v Speaker 3>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to dress up as a superhero.</v>

1095
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was at the stoplight right next to</v>

1096
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:13.870
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That bus stop.</v>

1097
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 3>So I pull over and I'm fucking like </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking through my car.</v>

1098
00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:18.820
<v Speaker 3>Trying to find it head like some laundry</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>

1099
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:23.821
<v Speaker 3>I had some clothes and I'm back pillow </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I found all these blue things and I </v>

1100
00:48:24.041 --> 00:48:29.041
<v Speaker 3>dressed up all in blue and I put this a </v>
<v Speaker 3>neck pillow on my head and I got in the </v>

1101
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 3>bus stop and I was on the Ellen show as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Manhattan.</v>

1102
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.600
<v Speaker 3>And one of the funniest things though </v>
<v Speaker 3>was I,</v>

1103
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a sleeve of a blue coat and I put</v>

1104
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:42.030
<v Speaker 3>through my zipper and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I tied it at the end and put some </v>

1105
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.030
<v Speaker 3>socks in it and stuff like that.</v>

1106
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:45.250
<v Speaker 3>So it looked like I had this big wavy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick and nobody even saw it.</v>

1107
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Like they didn't even understand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was.</v>

1108
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 3>But if you watch it knowing that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out on l and they're like,</v>

1109
00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:53.770
<v Speaker 3>let's introduce Dr Wong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Manhattan or whatever,</v>

1110
00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.230
<v Speaker 3>and I'm coming out with this swing video</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this song.</v>

1111
00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't,</v>

1112
00:48:58.511 --> 00:49:01.810
<v Speaker 3>but I will put a video up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you not have that online?</v>

1113
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I do,</v>

1114
00:49:02.681 --> 00:49:05.410
<v Speaker 3>but it's on my facebook and god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how dare you.</v>

1115
00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:08.980
<v Speaker 3>I'll put it on the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucked up shit out right now.</v>

1116
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I'll put a red band.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>or twitter home</v>

1117
00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.300
<v Speaker 6>red band dot Com.</v>

1118
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:20.610
<v Speaker 5>Get Joe's philosophy of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That scene,</v>

1119
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.880
<v Speaker 5>that scene,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pyramids on TV is the same as real </v>

1120
00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:25.880
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

1121
00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's the same as real </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

1122
00:49:26.161 --> 00:49:31.161
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's only a few things I could do </v>

1123
00:49:31.161 --> 00:49:31.161
<v Speaker 5>before I died,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that wouldn't be my choice.</v>

1124
00:49:31.161 --> 00:49:33.120
<v Speaker 5>I'd be okay without saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would like to see it.</v>

1125
00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:36.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of the reasons why I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>done it is because first of all,</v>

1126
00:49:36.301 --> 00:49:39.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't have much time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I travel so much for work.</v>

1127
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't really have that much time to </v>
<v Speaker 5>travel outside of work.</v>

1128
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.200
<v Speaker 5>It's not fun for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I'm traveling all the time,</v>

1129
00:49:46.201 --> 00:49:49.410
<v Speaker 5>so like an extra trip to Egypt doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>sound exciting to me.</v>

1130
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:53.010
<v Speaker 5>And then the other part about it is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not that safe over there.</v>

1131
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to be.</v>

1132
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.400
<v Speaker 5>It's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to have to sweat shit.</v>

1133
00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:01.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw the only ruins I've ever seen </v>

1134
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.180
<v Speaker 5>where in Mexico I saw the Mayan ruins at</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chichen Itza,</v>

1135
00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:08.540
<v Speaker 5>which is a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty humbling man and it's </v>

1136
00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.751
<v Speaker 5>really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just stand there and I do agree that </v>

1137
00:50:11.751 --> 00:50:12.690
<v Speaker 5>there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 5>standing there in person,</v>

1138
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:18.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and checking these things out than </v>

1139
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:18.660
<v Speaker 5>watching a video or seeing it in </v>
<v Speaker 5>pictures.</v>

1140
00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.780
<v Speaker 5>Standing there in person was a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>flabbergasted,</v>

1141
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:25.530
<v Speaker 5>but all I'm saying is I don't need to go</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Egypt.</v>

1142
00:50:25.531 --> 00:50:26.790
<v Speaker 5>I would like to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1143
00:50:26.791 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 5>but I don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can be okay</v>

1144
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:29.540
<v Speaker 2>without doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

1145
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not now,</v>

1146
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:37.750
<v Speaker 2>but you can learn a lot of things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain places and really experienced </v>

1147
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 2>like how amazing and beautiful they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just from dvds.</v>

1148
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Like you really don't have to fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to go to the Congo.</v>

1149
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:47.720
<v Speaker 2>The Congo is so fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything there is trying to kill you.</v>

1150
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:52.721
<v Speaker 2>Everything there,</v>

1152
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:59.180
<v Speaker 2>They got ants that kill elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They climb up the fucking elephant,</v>

1153
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 2>go into his ear and start eating his </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain while he's alive,</v>

1154
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:08.620
<v Speaker 2>and they do that in surges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these little monster ants to </v>

1155
00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.000
<v Speaker 2>climb inside and eat their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

1156
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:16.150
<v Speaker 2>and they're responsible for way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>deaths in Africa than any of the other </v>

1157
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.050
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ants killed everything,</v>

1158

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed everything.</v>

1159

<v Speaker 2>There's some monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy scary aunts and in Africa,</v>

1160
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:30.310
<v Speaker 2>and that's not even for fuck all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the spiders that act as a </v>

1161
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:33.740
<v Speaker 2>team?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no spiders anywhere in the world</v>

1162
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:37.880
<v Speaker 2>that act impacts except the Congo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even know why,</v>

1163
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.680
<v Speaker 2>but fucking deers get trapped in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>little tiny spider webs.</v>

1164
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Deers get trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These tiny spiders swarm on it like 100 </v>

1165
00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:51.590
<v Speaker 2>wants and fuck them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make these giant ass fucking webs.</v>

1166
00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 2>They've realized that they're small and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to survive and stay alive,</v>

1167
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 2>they have to Jack bigger shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

1168
00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.140
<v Speaker 2>they fucking teamed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get birds,</v>

1169
00:52:00.141 --> 00:52:02.540
<v Speaker 2>they get all kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking nuts,</v>

1170
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:04.340
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is nuts.</v>

1171
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's just spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the fucking snakes?</v>

1172
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.620
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of fucking snakes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Congo.</v>

1173
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:11.810
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a chimpanzee in the Congo that's</v>

1174
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:14.780
<v Speaker 2>six feet tall and they walk upright.</v>

1175
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're called Bondo apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds retarded.</v>

1176
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.290
<v Speaker 2>It sounds totally ridiculous because </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody ever tells you about it,</v>

1177
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 2>but they have photographs of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1178
00:52:23.751 --> 00:52:28.751
<v Speaker 2>They got a picture of a dead one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a different bone samples like </v>

1179
00:52:29.121 --> 00:52:31.730
<v Speaker 2>they've confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an actual real animal.</v>

1180
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.340
<v Speaker 2>It has a crest on his head like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gorilla does.</v>

1181
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:39.520
<v Speaker 2>So it's a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different species of chimpanzee </v>

1182
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 2>that's much larger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they call them lion killers.</v>

1183
00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:46.661
<v Speaker 2>That's what the locals call them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have fucking observed scientists </v>

1184
00:52:46.661 --> 00:52:48.290
<v Speaker 2>observed and photographed them eating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead Jaguar.</v>

1185
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:50.540
<v Speaker 2>They don't know if they killed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jaguar,</v>

1186
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 2>but what the fuck they're eating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn Jaguar.</v>

1187
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:56.570
<v Speaker 2>That's why verizon personal force field </v>
<v Speaker 2>is important.</v>

1188
00:52:56.571 --> 00:52:59.720
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would love to see all that,</v>

1189
00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:01.130

<v Speaker 2>your life up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like fucking geniuses and shit gets in </v>

1195
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:15.950
<v Speaker 2>their ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts rotting away their brain,</v>

1196
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:21.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like big giant tumors growing in their </v>

1197
00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.411
<v Speaker 2>head and it turns out massive worms that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they picked up an Africa seven years </v>

<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the large Hadron collider.</v>

1225
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought the Internet came up.</v>

1226
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Al Gore's butthole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't it.</v>

1227
00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.700

1231
00:55:03.831 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was more like funding.</v>

1232
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pushed a bill through or some nonsense </v>

1233
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:14.140
<v Speaker 2>guy pushing for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might've said that he was one of the </v>

1234
00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:14.140
<v Speaker 2>people that help.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You don't want to fuck Al Gore.</v>

1237
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit about Al Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I heard that,</v>

1238
00:55:19.341 --> 00:55:22.710
<v Speaker 2>how much money Al Gore's made from </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate research,</v>

<v Speaker 2>now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1240
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Al Gore has made an ass load of money </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the idea that we are,</v>

1241
00:55:29.551 --> 00:55:30.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>about that issue.</v>

1245
00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:42.120
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those weird issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1246
00:55:42.121 --> 00:55:47.121

00:55:47.121 --> 00:55:51.560
<v Speaker 2>shit and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't really done the research </v>

<v Speaker 2>but he did a video where he went to a </v>

1253
00:56:01.461 --> 00:56:02.000

<v Speaker 5>like they're just saying nonsense and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you realize that people don't have to </v>

1265
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.970

<v Speaker 5>make sense.</v>

1266
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.310
<v Speaker 5>They just have to have a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking that makes sense.</v>

1267
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:38.490
<v Speaker 5>That's all you really need to have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this guy who did it with the tea </v>

<v Speaker 5>And when it comes to global warming,</v>

1276
00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.380
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1277
00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:04.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone has a very typical and </v>

1278
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.110
<v Speaker 5>predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>

1279
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:10.230
<v Speaker 5>Let's come back to that typical and </v>
<v Speaker 5>predictable a stance on things.</v>

1280
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.450
<v Speaker 5>And very rarely do people stray outside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1281
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.390
<v Speaker 5>the either or ideologies left or right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1282
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 5>I hate when people ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you a Democrat or Republican?</v>

1283
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:22.960
<v Speaker 5>Like what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a nonsense game.</v>

1284
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:26.560
<v Speaker 5>It's all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no fucking Democrats and there's</v>

1285
00:57:26.561 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 5>no Republican says stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all nonsense.</v>

1286
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:32.500
<v Speaker 5>It's been nonsense since the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a,</v>

1287
00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:36.190
<v Speaker 5>it's a bunch of fucking red tape and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1288
00:57:36.191 --> 00:57:39.520
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and fucking just complications.</v>

1289
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:43.990
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of shit piled up together to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to control either or.</v>

1290
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea that there really are democrats</v>

1291
00:57:47.171 --> 00:57:47.740
<v Speaker 5>and they're really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1292
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:50.170
<v Speaker 5>look at what Obama's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's doing the exact same shit.</v>

1293
00:57:50.171 --> 00:57:52.030
<v Speaker 5>Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you just doing a little,</v>

1294
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:54.550
<v Speaker 5>a few things different socially and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a don't ask,</v>

1295
00:57:54.551 --> 00:57:56.790
<v Speaker 5>don't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you win the Nobel Peace Prize,</v>

1296
00:57:56.791 --> 00:57:59.710
<v Speaker 5>he still sent 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>more people to a war that nobody wants.</v>

1297
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:01.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do they really know more than ever?</v>

1298
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Can you tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1299
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.820
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like talking sports and to me,</v>

1300
00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:08.430
<v Speaker 2>don't you think that if you just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't to me.</v>

1301
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Well you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should spend that much</v>

1302
00:58:10.871 --> 00:58:12.120
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who cares what it is?</v>

1303
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it all.</v>

1304
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:15.220
<v Speaker 2>It's all stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just negative.</v>

1305
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:19.240
<v Speaker 2>If you really think about how fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole United States government is,</v>

1306
00:58:19.241 --> 00:58:22.600
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you think that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible to do anything about it?</v>

1307
00:58:22.601 --> 00:58:27.601
<v Speaker 2>I think if it is what the ways you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do something about it is not </v>

1308
00:58:27.601 --> 00:58:30.631
<v Speaker 2>necessarily influencing people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought and changing these people's </v>

1309
00:58:30.631 --> 00:58:32.920
<v Speaker 2>opinions before they get into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible situation of doing fuck up.</v>

1310
00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Things that are not benefiting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people I think.</v>

1311
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to affect them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to let them know that they're.</v>

1312
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:42.670
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's people way better than </v>

1313
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:45.541
<v Speaker 2>that than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so instead of worrying and spending my </v>

1314
00:58:45.541 --> 00:58:45.541
<v Speaker 2>stress on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even though man,</v>

1315
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.970
<v Speaker 2>to me it's just like another crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality show that I have to watch.</v>

1316
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

1317
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like they attack each other where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so ridiculous.</v>

1318
00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:58.480
<v Speaker 2>You can't believe anyone can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's fucking fake.</v>

1319
00:58:58.481 --> 00:59:01.600
<v Speaker 2>It's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Craziest that Fox News is real,</v>

1320
00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:06.601
<v Speaker 2>that that's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is like some parody crazy </v>

1321
00:59:06.601 --> 00:59:09.010

<v Speaker 2>Fox News is like if there was like a TV,</v>

1322

<v Speaker 2>a movie from the eighties with like Bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>Murray in it,</v>

1323
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.980
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a parody that would be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right wing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rah Rah fucking truth organization.</v>

1325
00:59:18.201 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 2>That would be the network that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would make fun of in a parody movie.</v>

1326
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.710
<v Speaker 5>And that's what's really going on man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the parody movie,</v>

1327
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 5>that would be like some really hot </v>
<v Speaker 5>blonde chick who was mean as fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 5>when they,</v>

1333
00:59:39.441 --> 00:59:44.441
<v Speaker 5>when they interrogate dudes on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they give people a hard time on </v>

1334
00:59:44.441 --> 00:59:47.390
<v Speaker 5>Charlotte and cut people off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're like the stern right wing,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Frank Sinatra is in the back of my limo.</v>

1467
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.190
<v Speaker 5>I almost got to drive a Stevie Ray </v>
<v Speaker 5>Vaughan,</v>

1468
01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.400
<v Speaker 5>but he wouldn't take limos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would only take a cab.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I probably killed him.</v>

1473
01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.180
<v Speaker 5>It would probably be me that killed him </v>
<v Speaker 5>and not the a helicopter.</v>

1474
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:47.420

<v Speaker 5>car,</v>

<v Speaker 5>though when I,</v>

1491
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:27.610
<v Speaker 5>when I first got the job there that was </v>

1500
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:50.620
<v Speaker 5>And I was sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like he gave away his whole life for </v>

<v Speaker 5>bullshit working 16 hours every day.</v>

1505
01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:04.870
<v Speaker 5>He was always there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I looked at him and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1509
01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.990
<v Speaker 5>I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>

1510
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.230
<v Speaker 5>that ain't easy man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you got a job,</v>

1511
01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 5>if you're only doing it for a few hours </v>
<v Speaker 5>a day,</v>

1512
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:17.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're doing it like a regular job,</v>

1513
01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:18.910
<v Speaker 5>but it ain't bad really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have good clients,</v>

1514
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:24.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you're doing just sitting down </v>

1515
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:24.160
<v Speaker 5>and drive it and that's no big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they want you to work crazy hours.</v>

1516
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.000
<v Speaker 5>I was doing 40 hours a week and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>

1517
01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:27.910
<v Speaker 5>they were adamant they wanted me to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>it more out.</v>

1518
01:07:27.911 --> 01:07:29.200
<v Speaker 5>So I'd work eight hours.</v>

1519
01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:34.380
<v Speaker 5>I would work eight hours and I would </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to go home and they'll go eight </v>

1520
01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:34.630
<v Speaker 5>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just nothing like it with is 12 and he's</v>

1521
01:07:34.631 --> 01:07:36.480
<v Speaker 5>still waiting for his next pickup and be</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1522
01:07:36.481 --> 01:07:38.860
<v Speaker 5>for Fuck Mikey and fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I worked eight hours.</v>

1523
01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.410
<v Speaker 5>Get me out of here stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want any more hours.</v>

1524
01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:42.550
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got work to do.</v>

1525
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:45.200
<v Speaker 5>I had a Gig at a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1526
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.840
<v Speaker 5>some fucking bar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1527
01:07:46.841 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 5>one of these comedy things and I had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>leave work for the Gig.</v>

1528
01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.450
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was there on the way there,</v>

1529
01:07:52.451 --> 01:07:54.250
<v Speaker 5>they switched the gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they said,</v>

1530
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.280
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna send you to this one </v>

1531
01:07:59.280 --> 01:07:59.280
<v Speaker 5>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there was like a,</v>

1532
01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.190
<v Speaker 5>I think it was probably Boston comedy at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time because like a booking agency </v>

1533
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.410
<v Speaker 5>and they had a bunch of these little </v>
<v Speaker 5>gigs,</v>

1534
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in weird little places,</v>

1535
01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:07.210
<v Speaker 5>you drive like an hour and a half and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like a little sports bar.</v>

1536
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:12.330
<v Speaker 5>And then have a little stage and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>would go on stage and sometimes they </v>

1537
01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:12.330
<v Speaker 5>would switch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You say,</v>

1538
01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:13.180
<v Speaker 5>hey this guy is going to go with him </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he doesn't have a car,</v>

1539
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.700
<v Speaker 5>so why don't you go to this place </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead?</v>

1540
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:20.110
<v Speaker 5>So that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so this asshole called up the </v>

1541
01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:21.110
<v Speaker 5>fucking the bar where I was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be because he asked me like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you're leaving out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1543
01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:27.131
<v Speaker 5>I got a Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he calls up the fucking bar and then </v>

1544
01:08:27.131 --> 01:08:28.070
<v Speaker 5>the next day says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you lying motherfucker.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:41.920
<v Speaker 3>He said I used to wash windows with me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this girl was the worst.</v>

1552
01:08:41.921 --> 01:08:46.921
<v Speaker 3>She would have a little girl and hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ladder and I would have to climb </v>

1553
01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:50.170
<v Speaker 3>like four stories up or while stone out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my mind and try to clean windows,</v>

<v Speaker 3>While we're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been washing windows.</v>

1558

<v Speaker 3>What else are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wash windows and be sober was the </v>

<v Speaker 3>But sometimes you just go to a house and</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's terrible and it sets you up in </v>

1602
01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:04.120
<v Speaker 5>life to start thinking of work like </v>

<v Speaker 5>be actually fun.</v>

<v Speaker 5>But on the grill the grill was way worse</v>

1608
01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:23.841
<v Speaker 5>for my acne because I do fucking </v>

<v Speaker 3>talking monkeys and Columbus and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty cool to watch it.</v>

1649
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dvds out.</v>

1650
01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.220
<v Speaker 1>So if you saw the special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1651
01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:21.750
<v Speaker 1>on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that.</v>

1652
01:13:21.751 --> 01:13:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1653
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.040
<v Speaker 1>it's uncensored and then there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of q and a footage just like five </v>

1654
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:28.040
<v Speaker 1>minutes or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot,</v>

1655
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how many minutes it is,</v>

1656
01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:34.701
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of q and a and I do that in </v>

1657
01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:34.701
<v Speaker 1>most of the shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1658
01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1659
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.750
<v Speaker 1>it makes it more fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1660
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to have like a normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy show and I know you want that </v>

1661
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.520
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1662
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also fun to just shoot the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit together,</v>

1663
01:13:45.091 --> 01:13:46.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and me make fun of things,</v>

1664
01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:47.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a microphone.</v>

1665
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:49.750
<v Speaker 1>And so the end of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1666
01:13:49.751 --> 01:13:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I always have that kind of q and a type </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing except</v>

1667
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:57.550
<v Speaker 3>it's almost becoming bits because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to ask the same questions and that </v>

1668
01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:58.010
<v Speaker 3>kind of sexist to Vcu twice and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the same questions.</v>

1669
01:13:58.011 --> 01:13:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1670
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.580
<v Speaker 3>I know I</v>

1671
01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:01.610
<v Speaker 1>tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things have to be answered the same</v>

1672
01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:03.050
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the DMT thing.</v>

1673
01:14:03.051 --> 01:14:04.880
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way to answer it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1674
01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.950
<v Speaker 1>when I try to explain that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>other way to explain it.</v>

1675
01:14:06.951 --> 01:14:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I have to explain it the best way I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>

1676
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

1677
01:14:10.371 --> 01:14:11.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to sound same way every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1678
01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>The only</v>

1679
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.490
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

1680
01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:14.110
<v Speaker 2>it's if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I do it like that anyway,</v>

1681
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.420
<v Speaker 2>there is a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't want to do about that.</v>

1682
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put that on my next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comedy special,</v>

1683
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.720
<v Speaker 2>that description of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that way nobody ever asked me again </v>

1684
01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:24.720
<v Speaker 2>because they know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1685
01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:24.970
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1686
01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not going to yell out </v>
<v Speaker 2>DMT and then like,</v>

1687
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll just say go to itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

1688
01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1689
01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.570
<v Speaker 2>at a certain point in time it's like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't keep talking about the same things</v>

1690
01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:36.760
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of them that's been.</v>

1691
01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Ever since I've did conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it on a Jim Breuer show,</v>

1692
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I hate the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to win versus who?</v>

1693
01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Like you said that a million times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ask.</v>

1694
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you think about this point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fight?</v>

1695
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1696
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:53.090
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people like to talk about five,</v>

1697
01:14:53.091 --> 01:14:55.170
<v Speaker 2>so they just like to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like baseball,</v>

1698
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.150
<v Speaker 2>baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1699
01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like that,</v>

1700
01:14:59.021 --> 01:15:00.640
<v Speaker 2>they just like to talk about it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1701
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.430
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1702
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:08.460
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they liked me as a commentator and they </v>

1703
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:08.460
<v Speaker 2>want to know my take on things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1704
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:08.860
<v Speaker 2>and I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1705
01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

1706
01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:12.250
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't give a prediction.</v>

1707
01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.310
<v Speaker 2>The only time I would ever give a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prediction that something's ridiculous,</v>

1708
01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1709
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:19.120
<v Speaker 2>you know is going to fight my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say,</v>

1710
01:15:19.121 --> 01:15:21.140
<v Speaker 2>oh my mom's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1711
01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:21.510
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1712
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:27.010
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But unless it's like that I don't get </v>

1713
01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:27.010
<v Speaker 2>predictions and those fights don't occur</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UFC,</v>

1714

01:16:00.011 --> 01:16:05.011
<v Speaker 2>about what the fuck is going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a fight between two skilled men that </v>

1729
01:16:05.011 --> 01:16:05.530
<v Speaker 2>are more than capable of smashing each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You Zig when you should zag.</v>

<v Speaker 6>over and over again.</v>

1781
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:18.110
<v Speaker 6>It's the one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the number one show for me,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1785
01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:34.690

1786
01:18:34.691 --> 01:18:39.691
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's probably one of the funniest guys </v>

1787
01:18:39.691 --> 01:18:39.691
<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As far as creativity,</v>

1788
01:18:39.691 --> 01:18:43.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't think any,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anybody has ever put out as much stuff.</v>

1789
01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.400
<v Speaker 6>As prolific as he is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one has ever put out as much.</v>

1790
01:18:46.401 --> 01:18:48.320
<v Speaker 6>Funny stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that guy and the other guy too?</v>

1791
01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:49.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1792
01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:52.010
<v Speaker 6>I don't know who's writing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've seen the Cannibal who writes it?</v>

1793
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.750
<v Speaker 6>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's writing?</v>

1794
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:55.180
<v Speaker 6>She writes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything.</v>

1795
01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:00.350
<v Speaker 6>I think he just helps once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's mostly because we don't want to</v>

1796
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:02.780
<v Speaker 6>give them credit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know from what I understand,</v>

1797
01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:07.820
<v Speaker 6>my trade just locked himself in his </v>
<v Speaker 6>office and just mad writer and he's </v>

1798
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.470
<v Speaker 6>always changing stuff and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 6>show that's been like that.</v>

1799
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:14.620
<v Speaker 6>I mean think about what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have these little corny looking </v>

1800
01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:14.620
<v Speaker 6>animated dudes that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1801
01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:15.620
<v Speaker 6>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>

1802
01:19:15.621 --> 01:19:20.621
<v Speaker 6>really crude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now the images are so crude and it's </v>

1803
01:19:20.621 --> 01:19:20.870
<v Speaker 6>really easy to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1804
01:19:20.871 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 6>as far as that kind of stuff is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then they,</v>

1805
01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:28.470
<v Speaker 6>they consistently go after more shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm sorry,</v>

1806
01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.900
<v Speaker 6>was that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was going to answer it something,</v>

1807
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.570
<v Speaker 6>trevor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't have a team of writers.</v>

1808
01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.760
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy says they have a team around </v>

1809
01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.651
<v Speaker 6>him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he knows the people that worked </v>

1810
01:19:39.651 --> 01:19:39.651
<v Speaker 6>there and he's actually been there </v>
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>

1811
01:19:39.651 --> 01:19:42.620
<v Speaker 6>I think they had a team of writers at </v>
<v Speaker 6>one point for like a season or something</v>

1812
01:19:42.621 --> 01:19:47.621
<v Speaker 6>or health writer help,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but from from my understanding now it's </v>

1813
01:19:47.621 --> 01:19:48.710
<v Speaker 6>really just trained.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1814
01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:51.740
<v Speaker 6>Everybody says this week's episode,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Groovy girly.</v>

1815
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.900
<v Speaker 6>Everybody says that it's the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 6>episode over.</v>

1816
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:59.630
<v Speaker 6>Pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's one part about it is we're so </v>

1817
01:19:59.630 --> 01:19:59.630
<v Speaker 6>good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1818
01:19:59.630 --> 01:19:59.630
<v Speaker 6>and they're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's humbling.</v>

1819
01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:00.920
<v Speaker 6>It's humbling how much that God has put </v>
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

1820
01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:05.921
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think about the stuff that you've </v>

1821
01:20:05.921 --> 01:20:07.421
<v Speaker 6>done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like how productive you've been over </v>

1822
01:20:07.421 --> 01:20:07.421
<v Speaker 6>your life and you see what that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 6>done like Jesus Christ.</v>

1823
01:20:07.421 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 6>I just wished that team</v>

1824
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.190
<v Speaker 2>America to would happen because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't.</v>

1825
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:15.200
<v Speaker 2>That was still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the hardest movie ever for every </v>

1826
01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:15.600
<v Speaker 2>one of my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's top five.</v>

1827
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the first one.</v>

1828
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:19.470
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no movie ever.</v>

1829
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.050
<v Speaker 2>The first time I saw made me laugh that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

1830
01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:24.230
<v Speaker 2>No movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no movie even came close.</v>

1831
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.390
<v Speaker 2>That was the second time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't as funny to me,</v>

1832
01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.720
<v Speaker 2>but the third time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just like it's not,</v>

1833
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:34.130
<v Speaker 2>it's the third time was just as good as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the secretary and I still do that and it</v>

1834
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.420
<v Speaker 2>was maybe funnier than the first time I </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw.</v>

1835
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I forgot how funny it was too close to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of it was shocking.</v>

1836
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at twice,</v>

1837
01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:47.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting them again five years later to </v>

1838
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:47.280
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't enjoy it.</v>

1839
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't enjoy it the second time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I loved it so much the first time,</v>

1840
01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things that you can't </v>

1841
01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.811
<v Speaker 2>see twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certain things you can see over and </v>

1842
01:20:56.811 --> 01:20:56.811
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>

1843
01:20:56.811 --> 01:20:56.811
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

1844
01:20:56.811 --> 01:20:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Comedies are very funny thing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1845
01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:02.900
<v Speaker 2>like why is like really bad stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>roadhouse or like showgirls or something</v>

1846
01:21:03.181 --> 01:21:04.860
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the more you see it,</v>

1847
01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:06.480
<v Speaker 2>the funnier it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1848
01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:11.490
<v Speaker 2>you could see it like a bunch of times </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it gets funnier because he started </v>

1849
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:11.540
<v Speaker 2>knowing the script of it and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>act it out.</v>

1850
01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.280
<v Speaker 2>There's some movies that are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous that it's just going,</v>

1851
01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:18.320
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one right here,</v>

1852
01:21:18.321 --> 01:21:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Howard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The duck.</v>

1853
01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.810
<v Speaker 2>This is Tuckey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That movie.</v>

1854
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:24.390
<v Speaker 2>What was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The adventures in babysitting.</v>

1855
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Nobody needs this.</v>

1856
01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:30.240
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was recommended to me.</v>

1857
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I think we've talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want a bad movie,</v>

1858
01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:34.560
<v Speaker 2>go get this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The room.</v>

1859
01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.420
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genius.</v>

1860
01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Don't watch it by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as fun.</v>

1861
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:40.020
<v Speaker 2>But if you watch it with some friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are funny,</v>

1862
01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:42.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geniusly bad movie.</v>

1863
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they have screenings in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>

1864
01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:50.290
<v Speaker 2>the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'd play that movie and people </v>

1865
01:21:50.290 --> 01:21:50.290
<v Speaker 2>get there and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1866
01:21:50.290 --> 01:21:51.360
<v Speaker 2>they quote the words because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows the words and it's like a</v>

1867
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:53.790
<v Speaker 2>sort of a rocky horror picture thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that bad.</v>

1868
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:56.090
<v Speaker 2>It's you want to borrow it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1869
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:57.230
<v Speaker 2>I can just make a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1870
01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:59.620
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just look at it on my computer.</v>

1871
01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Let me just look at it on my computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>real quick.</v>

1872
01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I just want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's not even do this online.</v>

1873
01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want people to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong impression here.</v>

1874
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Everyone likes fight club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what man?</v>

1875
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like fight club.</v>

1876
01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:19.160
<v Speaker 2>I'd liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked it for awhile and then when I </v>

1877
01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:19.410
<v Speaker 2>found out that the two dudes were </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually one dude,</v>

1878
01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1879
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want it anymore.</v>

1880
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.500
<v Speaker 2>So I liked it up until the end movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

1881
01:22:25.501 --> 01:22:30.501
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like it after I found out that </v>

1882
01:22:30.501 --> 01:22:33.291
<v Speaker 2>they were supposed to be two dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside because he's punching himself in </v>

1883
01:22:33.291 --> 01:22:35.040
<v Speaker 2>the face and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was way more believable.</v>

1884
01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:37.590
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you're seeing a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit in this movie.</v>

1885
01:22:37.591 --> 01:22:40.620
<v Speaker 2>That didn't really happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the style of it,</v>

1886
01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:45.650
<v Speaker 2>the visual Shitty to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1887
01:22:46.411 --> 01:22:48.360
<v Speaker 2>that sucks because it's not what I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be,</v>

1888
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:51.060
<v Speaker 2>but everything else along the way was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing that you can't.</v>

1889
01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:54.600
<v Speaker 2>It required a suspension of disbelief </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I wasn't willing to give it.</v>

1890
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.720
<v Speaker 2>When all of a sudden you're telling me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything I saw was just his </v>

1891
01:22:59.720 --> 01:22:59.850
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this entire movie,</v>

1892
01:22:59.851 --> 01:23:03.510
<v Speaker 2>what was real out of this fucking movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in the movie I saw there was two</v>

1893
01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>different people and if if one part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was</v>

1894
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.800
<v Speaker 4>absolutely a figment of his imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1895
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:10.150
<v Speaker 4>What about the rest of it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much?</v>

1896
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:13.210
<v Speaker 4>How do I know what I'm watching anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm watching nonsense.</v>

1897
01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.000
<v Speaker 4>Now you have the shitty plot device </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can say,</v>

1898
01:23:16.001 --> 01:23:17.750
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was just a dream.</v>

1899
01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's gone crazy.</v>

1900
01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:21.730
<v Speaker 4>This is what's really happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's hitting himself and I'm like,</v>

1901
01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:23.620
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what has really happened?</v>

1902
01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:25.210
<v Speaker 4>This guy's been sitting around hating </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>

1903
01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:27.670
<v Speaker 4>There's been no real fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's really going on?</v>

1904
01:23:27.671 --> 01:23:31.030
<v Speaker 4>I think he just don't like seeing Brad </v>
<v Speaker 4>Pitt get hurt is a part of me.</v>

1905
01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:32.670
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sloan.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The.</v>

1907

<v Speaker 6>moving.</v>

1908
01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.880
<v Speaker 6>You know that everybody's like,</v>

1909
01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:41.500

<v Speaker 6>getting the fuck beat out of them.</v>

1910
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's great.</v>

1911
01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:46.060
<v Speaker 6>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would hope that that's not the case in</v>

1912
01:23:46.061 --> 01:23:47.080
<v Speaker 6>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hope there is nothing.</v>

1913
01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:52.650

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1943
01:25:02.851 --> 01:25:07.851
<v Speaker 6>I liked that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought that was an interesting </v>

1944
01:25:07.851 --> 01:25:07.851
<v Speaker 6>little.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1945
01:25:07.851 --> 01:25:07.851
<v Speaker 6>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was pretty interesting,</v>

1946
01:25:07.851 --> 01:25:08.400
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Donnie Darko,</v>

1947
01:25:08.401 --> 01:25:09.840
<v Speaker 6>and don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love fight.</v>

1948
01:25:09.841 --> 01:25:13.620
<v Speaker 6>I mean if I had to see fight club again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would watch it up until the moment.</v>

1949
01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:18.650
<v Speaker 6>I would watch it up until the moment </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you find out it's two people not </v>

1950
01:25:18.650 --> 01:25:18.650
<v Speaker 6>to shut it off because I liked it up </v>
<v Speaker 6>until that,</v>

1951
01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:19.810
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just.</v>

1952
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:21.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I liked about.</v>

1953
01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.670
<v Speaker 6>Didn't like about shutter island.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like when you say,</v>

1954
01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:24.810
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was all trek,</v>

1955
01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't,</v>

1956
01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:27.120
<v Speaker 6>don't give me that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to hear it.</v>

1957
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:29.990
<v Speaker 6>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Show me a real goddamn moment,</v>

1958
01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:35.170
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why I like the Avatar was so </v>

1959
01:25:35.170 --> 01:25:35.170
<v Speaker 6>cool.</v>

1960
01:25:35.170 --> 01:25:37.610
<v Speaker 4>I have a feeling lost my face up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking the last recent episodes.</v>

1961
01:25:38.311 --> 01:25:42.060
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also like this could get really</v>

1962
01:25:42.061 --> 01:25:44.490
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad that it could.</v>

1963
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:47.910
<v Speaker 4>Like it has the potential to be ending </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way that you're just like,</v>

1964
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:49.200
<v Speaker 4>are you kidding me?</v>

1965
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.940
<v Speaker 6>I think this year it just seems silly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>leaping back and forth and time.</v>

1966
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:57.160
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just one.</v>

1967
01:25:57.330 --> 01:25:59.960
<v Speaker 6>Once they hit the nuclear bomb and went </v>
<v Speaker 6>back in time,</v>

1968
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:01.370
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is happening?</v>

1969
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.680
<v Speaker 6>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shut up.</v>

1970
01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:08.740
<v Speaker 6>You can't just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nuclear jumped back and forth through </v>

1971
01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:08.740
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1972
01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 6>stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just stop it.</v>

1973
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.630
<v Speaker 6>I need more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I need more from you than that.</v>

1974
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:15.440
<v Speaker 6>I need a little more than you blow off a</v>
<v Speaker 6>nuclear weapon and we go back in time.</v>

1975
01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:19.250
<v Speaker 6>That's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just,</v>

1976
01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.380
<v Speaker 6>it's too dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then where are we now?</v>

1977
01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:22.750
<v Speaker 6>We're in 1977.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do we do?</v>

1978
01:26:22.751 --> 01:26:23.260
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1987
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:43.290

<v Speaker 6>Fuck that.</v>

1988
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.530
<v Speaker 6>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would suck to accounting back.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Did we talk about that past?</v>

2008
01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.120
<v Speaker 6>The good friend outlaw from Joe's </v>
<v Speaker 6>message board has passed and he was a </v>

2009
01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.420
<v Speaker 6>great guy and we all love him very much </v>

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:10.420
<v Speaker 1>all my message board from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2013
01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember when he was never </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2014
01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember a time.</v>

2015
01:28:13.690 --> 01:28:15.370
<v Speaker 1>There was one time where he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2016
01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:19.150
<v Speaker 1>he took off for awhile and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called them at home.</v>

2017
01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I got his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2018
01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:25.690
<v Speaker 1>information from somebody I call them at</v>
<v Speaker 1>home and I found out that his brother </v>

2019
01:28:25.690 --> 01:28:25.690
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2020
01:28:25.690 --> 01:28:26.630
<v Speaker 1>died recently and he had some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2021
01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:30.910
<v Speaker 1>some real serious family issues and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was very depressed and um,</v>

2022
01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:33.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to him and he was,</v>

2023
01:28:33.930 --> 01:28:38.930
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was nice to know that he was okay </v>

2024
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:40.711
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was real sad and then he came </v>

2025
01:28:40.711 --> 01:28:43.471
<v Speaker 1>back and eventually became his old self </v>
<v Speaker 1>again and he was just one of the </v>

2026
01:28:43.471 --> 01:28:44.020
<v Speaker 1>funniest posters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2027
01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Dude was so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like quick,</v>

2028
01:28:46.210 --> 01:28:51.210
<v Speaker 1>really witty and apparently according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife he had always wanted to be a </v>

2029
01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:55.021
<v Speaker 1>standup comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why he </v>

2030
01:28:55.021 --> 01:28:57.901
<v Speaker 1>liked to hang out on my board because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to chance to like really be an </v>

2031
01:28:57.901 --> 01:28:57.901
<v Speaker 1>online comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2032
01:28:57.901 --> 01:28:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a real thing.</v>

2033
01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've talked about this before,</v>

2034
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 1>there are dudes</v>

2035
01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.100
<v Speaker 5>and message boards are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

2036
01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:07.110
<v Speaker 5>they're comedy stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2037
01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:10.040
<v Speaker 5>like you're a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

2038
01:29:10.041 --> 01:29:11.160
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I consider you,</v>

2039
01:29:11.161 --> 01:29:13.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean you've done standup comedy a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>times,</v>

2040
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:18.590
<v Speaker 5>but I consider you like an internet </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedian because you make these little </v>

2041
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.900
<v Speaker 5>videos that are funny and you've put </v>
<v Speaker 5>them up on the Internet.</v>

2042
01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Well the problem is it's just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you spend so much time at five hours,</v>

2043
01:29:22.401 --> 01:29:27.401
<v Speaker 3>you're spending a ton of hours just you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can get three to five minutes in front </v>

2044
01:29:27.401 --> 01:29:29.510
<v Speaker 3>of eight people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could spend the same amount of time,</v>

2045
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:31.670
<v Speaker 3>make a video that thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>

2046
01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:36.760
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would I want to do it on stage when </v>

2047
01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:36.760
<v Speaker 3>I could do the same thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet and get $50,</v>

2048
01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.000
<v Speaker 3>million times more people seeing it.</v>

2049
01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.220
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then eventually,</v>

2050
01:29:39.221 --> 01:29:40.510
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the red thing,</v>

2051
01:29:40.511 --> 01:29:43.090
<v Speaker 5>if you get enough people to see your </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit on the Internet,</v>

2052
01:29:43.091 --> 01:29:44.860
<v Speaker 5>you can develop like an immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 5>community.</v>

2053
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:46.810
<v Speaker 5>I could go on and then you can go do a </v>
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>

2054
01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:52.400
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what the kind of shit that </v>

2055
01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:52.960
<v Speaker 5>already really needs to take advantage </v>
<v Speaker 5>of because Ari has a name.</v>

2056
01:29:52.961 --> 01:29:55.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's been opening up for me for years.</v>

2057
01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Thousands of people have seen it because</v>
<v Speaker 5>of that.</v>

2058
01:29:57.490 --> 01:30:00.370
<v Speaker 5>And then he's been on the Jim Norton </v>
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>

2059
01:30:00.371 --> 01:30:05.371
<v Speaker 5>a down and dirty with Jim Norton and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got a lot of clips on the Internet </v>

2060
01:30:05.371 --> 01:30:06.760
<v Speaker 5>and he's been on opiod.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anthea with me a bunch of times.</v>

2061
01:30:06.761 --> 01:30:08.260
<v Speaker 5>He was on the last time when I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2062
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:12.970
<v Speaker 5>So he's got enough stuff happening that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he should have like a community.</v>

2063
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:15.360
<v Speaker 5>And so it's just a matter of putting it </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

2064
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:19.750
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's so much better now than </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's ever been before for comedians.</v>

2065
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:22.270
<v Speaker 5>And my message board is one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>parts about it.</v>

2066
01:30:22.271 --> 01:30:25.600
<v Speaker 5>And this dude outlaw was one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 5>parts about my message board.</v>

2067
01:30:25.601 --> 01:30:28.510
<v Speaker 5>He was a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was really funny and he was,</v>

2068
01:30:28.511 --> 01:30:29.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

2069
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2070
01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:35.200
<v Speaker 5>we got a chance to hang out with them in</v>
<v Speaker 5>real life a few times once way back in </v>

2071
01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:35.200
<v Speaker 5>Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

2072
01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.470
<v Speaker 5>way back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was how many years ago was at seven,</v>

2073
01:30:38.690 --> 01:30:43.690
<v Speaker 5>seven years ago and then again recently </v>
<v Speaker 5>last year he came to Dallas and what are</v>

2074
01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:47.860
<v Speaker 5>one or two other times other than that </v>
<v Speaker 5>to at least one,</v>

2075
01:30:47.861 --> 01:30:48.400
<v Speaker 5>but I can remember</v>

2076
01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:51.080
<v Speaker 3>one of the saddest things for me is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to his facebook page.</v>

2077
01:30:51.081 --> 01:30:54.230
<v Speaker 3>His and his photos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot for Christmas last year.</v>

2078
01:30:54.231 --> 01:30:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I think for Christmas I sent them a </v>
<v Speaker 3>photo of me shaving my chest going,</v>

2079
01:30:58.070 --> 01:31:03.070
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really shaving my chest but like a </v>

2080
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:04.370
<v Speaker 3>photo of me and just as a joke because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how our relationship all were.</v>

2081
01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.900
<v Speaker 3>What was on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like photoshops back and forth,</v>

2082
01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:11.910
<v Speaker 3>you silly photos and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like then I went to his facebook </v>

2083
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:12.500
<v Speaker 3>and he has that on his facebook page and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2084
01:31:12.501 --> 01:31:14.930

<v Speaker 3>That</v>

2085
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:18.720
<v Speaker 5>was one of the cool things about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>message board is like,</v>

2086
01:31:18.721 --> 01:31:21.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have like these online friends,</v>

01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:26.471
<v Speaker 6>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but part of it is just I know people </v>

2170
01:34:26.471 --> 01:34:27.410
<v Speaker 6>there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I liked her for a quick jolt.</v>

2171
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:29.240
<v Speaker 6>Get in there and get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2172
01:34:29.241 --> 01:34:32.240
<v Speaker 6>I love going on opiod Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love meeting my old pool plan.</v>

2173
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.700
<v Speaker 6>Frowns.</v>

2174
01:34:32.850 --> 01:34:37.850
<v Speaker 3>I'd be an alcoholic immediately looming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that's the only thing to </v>

2175
01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:38.430
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And plus when we came back off the plane</v>

2176
01:34:38.431 --> 01:34:40.920
<v Speaker 3>in California after they're just seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature scene,</v>

2177
01:34:40.921 --> 01:34:43.170
<v Speaker 3>grassy fields and trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2178
01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:48.380
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see any of that when I was in </v>

2179
01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:50.181
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the perfect time to be driving </v>

2180
01:34:50.181 --> 01:34:50.181
<v Speaker 3>around California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right after you.</v>

2181
01:34:50.181 --> 01:34:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's green if it sounds gay,</v>

2182
01:34:51.991 --> 01:34:54.240
<v Speaker 3>but when I'm getting the mail and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>smells like roses,</v>

2183
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:55.320
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2184
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:57.320
<v Speaker 3>this is so much better to shit.</v>

2185
01:34:58.290 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 6>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's something to be said definitely </v>

2186
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 6>for that and there's definitely </v>
<v Speaker 6>something to be said.</v>

2187
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:06.120
<v Speaker 6>It's not natural to live stack 70 people</v>
<v Speaker 6>on top of each other.</v>

2188
01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:10.350
<v Speaker 6>They've done like those population </v>
<v Speaker 6>density studies with rats and they found</v>

2189
01:35:10.351 --> 01:35:12.360
<v Speaker 6>that if they have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 6>rats in a box,</v>

2190
01:35:12.361 --> 01:35:15.000
<v Speaker 6>everyone's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the more rats you add to the box,</v>

2191
01:35:15.001 --> 01:35:17.970
<v Speaker 6>the more fucked up behavior starts </v>
<v Speaker 6>manifesting itself.</v>

2192
01:35:17.971 --> 01:35:21.300
<v Speaker 6>There's starts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them become neurotic.</v>

2193
01:35:21.301 --> 01:35:26.301
<v Speaker 6>They started like tweaking and some of </v>
<v Speaker 6>them like become duddy and they sit by </v>

2194
01:35:26.301 --> 01:35:26.301
<v Speaker 6>themselves and shake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They.</v>

2195
01:35:26.301 --> 01:35:31.000
<v Speaker 6>They develop all this nutty sensory </v>
<v Speaker 6>overload ship because there's too many </v>

2196
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:31.680
<v Speaker 6>rasters started attacking each other and</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting violent.</v>

2197
01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:34.530
<v Speaker 6>It gets bad man and that's what happens </v>
<v Speaker 6>when fucking people.</v>

2198
01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:36.540
<v Speaker 6>When I was in North Carolina last week,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2199
01:35:36.810 --> 01:35:38.640
<v Speaker 6>it was a couple of days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was like North Carolina.</v>

2200
01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:40.020
<v Speaker 6>You could smell it.</v>

2201
01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:40.920
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was nice to.</v>

2202
01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.000
<v Speaker 6>Everybody was cool right out to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Or would you like something to drink?</v>

2205
01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:49.850
<v Speaker 6>Like everyone's like tying to move there</v>
<v Speaker 6>and hang out with cliff.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's even,</v>

2208
01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:53.460
<v Speaker 6>I would just need to play.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I can always just turn up with Charlie </v>

2213
01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:08.100
<v Speaker 6>Good nights during the week to show it </v>
<v Speaker 6>hurricanes.</v>

2214
01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:08.900
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck.</v>

2215
01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:09.990
<v Speaker 6>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hard Dude.</v>

2216
01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:12.470
<v Speaker 6>One of the waitresses at the place we </v>
<v Speaker 6>ate,</v>

2217
01:36:12.471 --> 01:36:15.300
<v Speaker 6>we had this cool barbecue place and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>waitress said to us,</v>

2218
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:16.430
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that uh,</v>

2219
01:36:16.690 --> 01:36:18.660
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hurricane came and uh,</v>

2220
01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.920
<v Speaker 6>picked up her neighbor's house and </v>
<v Speaker 6>dropped it.</v>

2221
01:36:21.130 --> 01:36:25.080
<v Speaker 6>Paul would them in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were in their fucking house.</v>

2222
01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.120
<v Speaker 6>It picked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not a mobile house.</v>

2223
01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:32.180
<v Speaker 6>A house picked her house up and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>fluid like 30 yards down the road into a</v>

2224
01:36:32.521 --> 01:36:33.330
<v Speaker 6>pond.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2225
01:36:33.331 --> 01:36:38.331
<v Speaker 6>I totally forgot about storms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just hate being around tornadoes and </v>

2226
01:36:38.331 --> 01:36:40.380
<v Speaker 6>storms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking whether living in Ohio has raped</v>

2227
01:36:40.381 --> 01:36:45.381
<v Speaker 6>me of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm scared of fucking lightning now </v>

2228
01:36:45.381 --> 01:36:45.381
<v Speaker 6>because I've just been through so much </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking crap.</v>

2229
01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:48.880
<v Speaker 6>I think the move is a smaller town in </v>
<v Speaker 6>California.</v>

2230
01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.840
<v Speaker 6>I think San Diego or Santa Barbara </v>
<v Speaker 6>Diego's not a bad,</v>

2231
01:36:52.841 --> 01:36:55.880
<v Speaker 6>but San Diego is so close to Barbara </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's funded buyers now.</v>

2232
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:58.540
<v Speaker 6>That's not a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Santa Barbara is a good call.</v>

2233
01:36:58.570 --> 01:37:03.570
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a good call because it's still </v>

2234
01:37:03.570 --> 01:37:03.570
<v Speaker 6>like they have good restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>diversity of babies.</v>

2235
01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:08.580
<v Speaker 6>So yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a university there so that </v>

2236
01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:08.580
<v Speaker 6>people could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2237
01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:09.610
<v Speaker 6>that's a good jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love that jail.</v>

2238
01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.610
<v Speaker 6>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look up the um,</v>

2239
01:37:12.670 --> 01:37:14.080
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a university up there,</v>

2240
01:37:14.081 --> 01:37:14.500
<v Speaker 6>a couple.</v>

2241
01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:15.810
<v Speaker 6>I think there's more than one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2242
01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:19.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then this line is good Jujitsu up.</v>

2243
01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:24.220
<v Speaker 6>There was no comedy club up there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you could do something around a </v>

2244
01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:28.470
<v Speaker 6>campfire at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm really seriously thinking about </v>

2245
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:30.070
<v Speaker 6>getting some regular gig somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just have a campfire,</v>

2246
01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:33.610
<v Speaker 6>a campfire in a winery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tickets are $25 a year.</v>

2247
01:37:33.611 --> 01:37:34.330
<v Speaker 6>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2248
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:37.050
<v Speaker 6>doing a Gig like in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like every week.</v>

2249
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:42.390
<v Speaker 6>The that's the to place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could do it every week because new </v>

2250
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.390
<v Speaker 6>people come in every week,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2251
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:45.900
<v Speaker 6>there's always people coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but vegas is just so bad,</v>

2252
01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:49.650
<v Speaker 6>so bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not good to stay there.</v>

2253
01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:52.620
<v Speaker 6>Vegas is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like smoking cigarettes.</v>

2254
01:37:52.650 --> 01:37:54.750
<v Speaker 6>It's like you can get away with it for a</v>
<v Speaker 6>long time.</v>

2255
01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.030
<v Speaker 6>Eventually it's gonna get</v>

2256
01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:01.200
<v Speaker 4>you know or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you could not do it and then you get </v>

2257
01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:01.390
<v Speaker 4>hit by a bus tomorrow and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2258
01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:02.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2259
01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.290
<v Speaker 5>Like I never say I should've moved to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Vegas,</v>

2260
01:38:04.590 --> 01:38:06.960
<v Speaker 5>but I think doing a Gig in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if I did it,</v>

2261
01:38:06.961 --> 01:38:10.230
<v Speaker 5>I'd still wouldn't live there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would fly in and you know,</v>

2262
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:15.310
<v Speaker 5>on the weekends I wouldn't be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one of those five nights a week </v>

2263
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:15.570
<v Speaker 5>gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do five nights a week.</v>

2264
01:38:15.571 --> 01:38:20.571
<v Speaker 5>I'll lose my marbles for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five nights a week to I'm not going to </v>

2265
01:38:20.571 --> 01:38:21.950
<v Speaker 5>be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2266
01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:25.800
<v Speaker 5>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of it is a based on enthusiasm and</v>

2267
01:38:25.801 --> 01:38:28.770
<v Speaker 5>I think if I did every night I had to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>five nights a week.</v>

2268
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:30.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I would be as </v>
<v Speaker 5>enthusiastic.</v>

2269
01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:35.570
<v Speaker 5>I like little days off sometimes on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>weekend off here and it gets the juices </v>

2270
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:37.890
<v Speaker 5>all fired up and that's the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>try to create new material to.</v>

2271
01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.510
<v Speaker 5>You can't create new material if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>always doing long headlines sets all the</v>

2272
01:38:42.511 --> 01:38:42.870
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2273
01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:47.900
<v Speaker 5>I think the better way to do it is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>just really sit down and try to break </v>

2274
01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.350
<v Speaker 5>out some new ideas then just go up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>try them on their own.</v>

2275
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:51.000
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the,</v>

2276
01:38:51.001 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 5>I used to introduce them to bits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes you know,</v>

2277
01:38:53.791 --> 01:38:55.080
<v Speaker 5>introduce them like in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>bits.</v>

2278
01:38:55.081 --> 01:39:00.081
<v Speaker 5>And I still do that sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think maybe the best way to do is </v>

2279
01:39:00.081 --> 01:39:02.511
<v Speaker 5>just go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some crappy open mic night or </v>

2280
01:39:02.511 --> 01:39:02.511
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2281
01:39:02.511 --> 01:39:07.190
<v Speaker 5>you gotta make sure there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm going to do that at the </v>

2282
01:39:07.190 --> 01:39:07.190
<v Speaker 5>Improv.</v>

<v Speaker 5>one that I'm vbs dot TV show about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Arctic.</v>

2335
01:41:00.630 --> 01:41:05.630
<v Speaker 5>Remember there was at one dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think his name was [inaudible] and he </v>

2336
01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:08.691
<v Speaker 5>lives in Alaska and northeast Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their daughter fell off the boat when it</v>

2337
01:41:08.721 --> 01:41:09.900
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was two years old.</v>

2338
01:41:09.901 --> 01:41:14.901
<v Speaker 5>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were living up there in the </v>

2339
01:41:14.901 --> 01:41:14.901
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Yukon,</v>

2340
01:41:14.901 --> 01:41:14.901
<v Speaker 5>wherever the hell it is up there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it called up there?</v>

2341
01:41:15.450 --> 01:41:17.460
<v Speaker 5>North Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2342
01:41:17.490 --> 01:41:19.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean these way in the Arctic Circle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2343
01:41:19.530 --> 01:41:21.450
<v Speaker 5>He's waiting to fuck up their deep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deep,</v>

2344
01:41:21.451 --> 01:41:23.870
<v Speaker 5>deep into Alaska and his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2345
01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:27.930
<v Speaker 5>they were on a river with a canoe and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the canoe tipped over and their daughter</v>

2346
01:41:27.931 --> 01:41:32.931
<v Speaker 5>was two years old and she drowned and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all they ever found was her little boot </v>

2347
01:41:32.931 --> 01:41:33.810
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that killed me.</v>

2348
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:36.900
<v Speaker 5>That story killed me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And every year they go to this site,</v>

2349
01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:41.960
<v Speaker 5>like near where where it happened and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they plant flowers because I wasn't </v>

2350
01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:42.750
<v Speaker 5>flowers like ribbons because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 5>flowers up there.</v>

2351
01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:45.570
<v Speaker 5>And it was sad as fuck by watching them </v>
<v Speaker 5>cry.</v>

2352
01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:50.660
<v Speaker 5>And they had two grown daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the edit to two daughters </v>

2353
01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:52.971
<v Speaker 5>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's still crushed them thinking </v>

2354
01:41:52.971 --> 01:41:52.971
<v Speaker 5>about their two year old that drowned in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their canoe.</v>

2355
01:41:52.971 --> 01:41:54.410
<v Speaker 5>Fuck a canoe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>narrow,</v>

2356
01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.340
<v Speaker 5>narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>narrow,</v>

2357
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:56.110
<v Speaker 5>narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>narrow,</v>

2358
01:41:56.250 --> 01:42:01.250
<v Speaker 5>not interested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not interested in putting my life at </v>

2359
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:01.800
<v Speaker 5>risk for some fucking natural river </v>
<v Speaker 5>ride.</v>

2360
01:42:01.801 --> 01:42:03.330
<v Speaker 5>Thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Interesting.</v>

2361
01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.760
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I understand that this might be a</v>

2362
01:42:05.761 --> 01:42:10.761
<v Speaker 5>thrill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my logic will not let me get past a </v>

2363
01:42:10.761 --> 01:42:13.980
<v Speaker 5>risk to benefit ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look at it and I get angry with myself</v>

2364
01:42:13.981 --> 01:42:16.260
<v Speaker 5>for even thinking about trying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just seems like it's dumb.</v>

2365
01:42:16.890 --> 01:42:17.610
<v Speaker 5>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.560
<v Speaker 5>so good luck on your boat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Faggot.</v>

2367
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:21.210

2368
01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 12 tour with Stan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope is well.</v>

2369
01:42:25.721 --> 01:42:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Last time Stan hope and I talked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to do it and I want to do it.</v>

2370
01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have an end of the world show and then </v>

2371
01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:39.120
<v Speaker 1>the real end of the world would be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world wouldn't end ever ever read </v>

2372
01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:40.320
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behold a pale horse.</v>

2373
01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not that you think it's a </v>

2374
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.350
<v Speaker 1>great conspiracy book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death rock dance.</v>

2375
01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:50.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a bad book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that guy sounds like he's </v>

2376
01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.520
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like either he's crazy or he's </v>

2377
01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.351
<v Speaker 1>like a disinflation guy and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>people without a doubt who are paid to </v>

2378
01:42:57.661 --> 01:43:02.661
<v Speaker 1>say things that seem like nonsense and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say those nonsense things along with </v>

2379
01:43:02.661 --> 01:43:07.521
<v Speaker 1>things that do make sense and are true </v>
<v Speaker 1>and real and thereby the nonsense </v>

2380
01:43:07.741 --> 01:43:09.660
<v Speaker 1>discredits the real information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2381
01:43:09.661 --> 01:43:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone says like,</v>

2382

2384
01:43:13.311 --> 01:43:16.920

<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

2387
01:43:18.771 --> 01:43:20.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it from William Cooper's book.</v>

2388
01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:25.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the guy that believes there's </v>

2389
01:43:25.730 --> 01:43:26.010
<v Speaker 1>alien bases on the moon that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching us and that there's information</v>

2390
01:43:26.011 --> 01:43:27.330
<v Speaker 1>that they have given us to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He sounds fucking crazy.</v>

2393
01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:36.120
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy that also said that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>driver is the one who killed Kennedy.</v>

2394
01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:41.240
<v Speaker 1>He believes that the driver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the driver turned around and shot </v>

2395
01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy and then could clearly see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a or felt like he's nuts.</v>

2396
01:43:42.930 --> 01:43:43.800
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

2397
01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:48.801
<v Speaker 1>that's so nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to believe there's one or two </v>

2398
01:43:48.801 --> 01:43:53.031
<v Speaker 1>options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either he's completely out of his </v>

2399
01:43:53.031 --> 01:43:53.031
<v Speaker 1>fucking mind and people just believed </v>
<v Speaker 1>him</v>

2400
01:43:53.031 --> 01:43:56.180
<v Speaker 5>or he's a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a guy that they hired to,</v>

2401
01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:01.010
<v Speaker 5>to distribute this information to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and theories appear ridiculous.</v>

2402
01:44:01.011 --> 01:44:03.710
<v Speaker 5>It's very possible that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's definitely people that do,</v>

2403
01:44:03.711 --> 01:44:08.711
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's people that have admitted that </v>

2404
01:44:08.711 --> 01:44:09.150
<v Speaker 5>the government hires people to blog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hires people to uh,</v>

2405
01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:12.440
<v Speaker 5>go online and post on message boards and</v>
<v Speaker 5>debate issues.</v>

2406
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:17.600
<v Speaker 5>Anytime anything specific comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have guys that they'll send on that</v>

2407
01:44:17.601 --> 01:44:22.601
<v Speaker 5>issue if they believe that this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>causing descent and some sort of a meme </v>

2408
01:44:22.601 --> 01:44:23.750
<v Speaker 5>of consciousness if they can avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2409
01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:25.790
<v Speaker 5>they'll attack it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll try to discredit things,</v>

2410
01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:28.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it says means pretty standard.</v>

2411
01:44:28.401 --> 01:44:29.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would have to do that.</v>

2412
01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.330
<v Speaker 5>They've got to realize how big the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet is</v>

2413
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:34.650
<v Speaker 6>as you hold that fucking hard drive </v>
<v Speaker 6>noise.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody.</v>

2423
01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:04.160
<v Speaker 6>They made it into two.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could play quake two in your </v>

2424
01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.550
<v Speaker 6>browser.</v>
<v Speaker 6>60 frames per second.</v>

2425
01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.810
<v Speaker 6>Just going to a website.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>

2426
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:09.680
<v Speaker 6>this guy's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The government is.</v>

2427
01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:13.530
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if you tell them the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me start shaking my keys.</v>

2428
01:45:13.531 --> 01:45:18.531
<v Speaker 6>Every time I talk to you shaking your </v>
<v Speaker 6>community that help my friend and have </v>

2429
01:45:20.491 --> 01:45:22.080
<v Speaker 6>to do that because they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2430
01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.020
<v Speaker 6>their mind wanders.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So sigma keys.</v>

2431
01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:25.710
<v Speaker 6>I was just listening to what this guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrote.</v>

2432
01:45:25.711 --> 01:45:28.710
<v Speaker 6>The government is only out to protect </v>
<v Speaker 6>itself from the rest of us.</v>

2433
01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:32.220
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if he's being serious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people really think like that.</v>

2434
01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.820
<v Speaker 6>We got my to do that because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 6>people would overthrow the government.</v>

2435
01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.220
<v Speaker 5>The whole idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to say this,</v>

2436
01:45:39.221 --> 01:45:44.221
<v Speaker 5>but the whole idea that everybody should</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a say in how the world works is </v>

2437
01:45:44.221 --> 01:45:46.300
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just too many dummies out there and</v>

2438
01:45:46.301 --> 01:45:48.070
<v Speaker 5>there's no way to stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2439
01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.400
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have kind of bypassed nature and it's</v>

2440
01:45:50.401 --> 01:45:55.401
<v Speaker 5>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not only the strong survive </v>

2441
01:45:55.401 --> 01:45:55.401
<v Speaker 5>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's everybody survives.</v>

2442
01:45:55.401 --> 01:45:55.570
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2443
01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.760
<v Speaker 5>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we try to keep you going,</v>

2444
01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:03.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can be the dumbest motherfucker ever </v>

2445
01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:03.180
<v Speaker 5>and we try to keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

2446
01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:05.830
<v Speaker 5>that didn't always used to be the case </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think because it is the case,</v>

2447
01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

2448
01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:12.861
<v Speaker 5>just way too many dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The irregular democracy just wasn't </v>

2449
01:46:12.861 --> 01:46:16.301
<v Speaker 5>going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's one of the reasons why </v>

2450
01:46:16.301 --> 01:46:18.991
<v Speaker 5>the government is completely full of </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit and why there's just such a cash </v>

2451
01:46:18.991 --> 01:46:21.451
<v Speaker 5>grab at the top and why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why they still push war and why they </v>

2452
01:46:21.451 --> 01:46:21.451
<v Speaker 5>still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they know,</v>

2453
01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.520
<v Speaker 5>they know that there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no way this fucking system is </v>

2454
01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:27.280
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>

2455
01:46:27.281 --> 01:46:30.490
<v Speaker 5>You can't have a regular real democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are too dumb.</v>

2456
01:46:30.970 --> 01:46:34.350
<v Speaker 5>You know the Sarah Palin thing proves </v>
<v Speaker 5>all that and know,</v>

2457
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:35.700
<v Speaker 5>look how many people are into that </v>
<v Speaker 5>check.</v>

2458
01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:41.220
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would think that in a society in </v>

2459
01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:44.050
<v Speaker 5>2010 that someone who literally doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>read at all,</v>

2460
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:45.580
<v Speaker 5>like you find out about that and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>be like,</v>

2461
01:46:45.581 --> 01:46:48.220
<v Speaker 5>get that crazy bitch outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she can't be president,</v>

2462
01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people love it.</v>

2463
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:50.970
<v Speaker 1>They love her more than ever.</v>

2464
01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.480
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree,</v>

2465
01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:59.890
<v Speaker 4>I've hit the wall like starting to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>across.</v>

2466
01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.480
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to take vitamins.</v>

2467
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:07.120
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2468
01:47:07.130 --> 01:47:10.250
<v Speaker 4>but you can't just say that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>even going to hit the two hour mark.</v>

2469
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.720
<v Speaker 1>These people are listening to us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their board now.</v>

2470
01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:13.990

<v Speaker 4>history of the Internet.</v>

2474
01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:26.090
<v Speaker 4>You know that stuff is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2475
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:29.960
<v Speaker 4>Go look and buddy must've had a longer </v>
<v Speaker 4>with her.</v>

2476
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:32.780
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However you being silly.</v>

2477
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:37.790
<v Speaker 4>So probably just ain't never no pants on</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy talking about nine slash 11.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's podcast is nine hours long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it every day.</v>

2479
01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:46.540
<v Speaker 4>We will not be suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lisa interview with Alex Jones on </v>

2480
01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:47.240
<v Speaker 4>something the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>CNN.</v>

2481
01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:47.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2482
01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it like?</v>

2483
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said it right that 98 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>

2484
01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Ninety nine percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2485
01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a really.</v>

2486
01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:06.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have paraphrased and made it </v>

2487
01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:06.320
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use that no doubt.</v>

2488
01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:10.540
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really what it is at a </v>

2489
01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:10.540
<v Speaker 1>certain point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2490
01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:14.081
<v Speaker 1>you got to listen to some of that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he says he's right about a lot of </v>

2491
01:48:14.081 --> 01:48:14.081
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just so crazy.</v>

2492
01:48:14.081 --> 01:48:15.140
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to take them seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2493
01:48:15.141 --> 01:48:17.720
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Alex Joseph Disinformation agent?</v>

2494
01:48:18.170 --> 01:48:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I hope not because I think he's my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

2495
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:25.390
<v Speaker 1>If it turns out it's just a district </v>
<v Speaker 1>information age and he's been fucking </v>

2496
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.390

<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

2497
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:27.050
<v Speaker 1>She had definitely been friends with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of the government.</v>

2498
01:48:27.051 --> 01:48:28.700
<v Speaker 1>You'd dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the case.</v>

2499
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm way more fun to hang out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government,</v>

2500
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:36.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got to make money off the </v>

2501
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.550
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't need it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The road to conspiracy or the.</v>

2507

<v Speaker 1>The road to a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a called.</v>

2508

01:48:56.010 --> 01:48:58.570
<v Speaker 4>there's a point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there comes to a point you can't believe</v>

2511
01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:01.440
<v Speaker 4>anybody because you weren't there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can believe this side is that.</v>

2512
01:49:01.570 --> 01:49:02.470
<v Speaker 4>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just become,</v>

2513
01:49:02.471 --> 01:49:03.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what avoids each other.</v>

2514
01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:05.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I concerned?</v>

2515
01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:06.170
<v Speaker 4>Even</v>

2516
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:11.210
<v Speaker 1>the nine slash 11 stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the stuff in the World Trade </v>

2517
01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a stuff on these people that were</v>

2518
01:49:11.441 --> 01:49:16.441
<v Speaker 1>paid to disrupt peaceful protests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would hire cops to go in and dress </v>

2519
01:49:16.441 --> 01:49:19.090
<v Speaker 1>up as a people with ski masks on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>start smashing cars and shit,</v>

2520
01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:24.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he documents it all in and really </v>

2521
01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:27.240
<v Speaker 1>fucking exposes the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently it's a common tactic and </v>

2522
01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:27.240
<v Speaker 1>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2523
01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:31.921
<v Speaker 1>whenever there's a demonstration </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere that's ever anything important </v>

2524
01:49:31.921 --> 01:49:35.641
<v Speaker 1>ever with involving world leaders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always the violence in these </v>

2525
01:49:35.641 --> 01:49:39.901
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if the people that are into this </v>

2526
01:49:39.901 --> 01:49:39.901
<v Speaker 1>idea or completely nonviolent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2527
01:49:39.901 --> 01:49:41.330
<v Speaker 1>even if it's Buddhists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2528
01:49:41.331 --> 01:49:42.670
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2529
01:49:42.671 --> 01:49:43.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2530
01:49:44.110 --> 01:49:45.070

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2531
01:49:45.071 --> 01:49:50.071
<v Speaker 1>that's happening in China and they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist show up and protest real </v>

2532

<v Speaker 1>some shit will happen.</v>

2534
01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Will they have to bring in cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why is because they do </v>

2535
01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:01.201
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that to make a nonviolent </v>

2536
01:50:01.201 --> 01:50:01.780
<v Speaker 1>protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a violent one so they can break it up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so wrong on so many levels.</v>

2540
01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:16.320

2583
01:51:52.590 --> 01:51:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always a weird thing,</v>

2584
01:51:53.851 --> 01:51:58.851
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you live with somebody for three </v>

2585
01:51:58.851 --> 01:51:58.851
<v Speaker 1>years and then you break up and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they move out and you're like,</v>

2586
01:51:58.851 --> 01:51:59.430

2588
01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:08.520
<v Speaker 1>if it gets really weird how you become </v>
<v Speaker 1>so comfortable with living with somebody</v>

2589
01:52:08.521 --> 01:52:10.170
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with not only that,</v>

2590
01:52:10.171 --> 01:52:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you get so accustomed to having that </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal time we addict to each other.</v>

2591
01:52:14.370 --> 01:52:17.130
<v Speaker 1>That's why people get so terrified when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to break up.</v>

2592
01:52:17.170 --> 01:52:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2593
01:52:17.850 --> 01:52:19.070
<v Speaker 1>people get terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2594
01:52:19.190 --> 01:52:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted to you in my life will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell if you leave,</v>

2595
01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:27.740
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what it's like </v>

2596
01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:27.740
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2597
01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.790
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people obsess on relationships</v>
<v Speaker 1>for long periods of time,</v>

2598
01:52:29.791 --> 01:52:34.770
<v Speaker 1>but God so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much more often when the relationship</v>

2599
01:52:34.771 --> 01:52:39.771
<v Speaker 1>is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel so much better once it levels </v>

2600
01:52:39.771 --> 01:52:41.991
<v Speaker 1>out like what I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to fucking go canoeing and then </v>

2601
01:52:41.991 --> 01:52:46.011
<v Speaker 1>maybe roller rollerskating or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you were involved in a situation </v>

2602
01:52:46.011 --> 01:52:46.011
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2603
01:52:46.011 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much you want</v>

2604
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:51.040
<v Speaker 5>to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you were involved in a situation </v>

2605
01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.871
<v Speaker 5>where you felt like you were the person </v>
<v Speaker 5>who wasn't very happy and you're a </v>

2606
01:52:52.941 --> 01:52:55.850
<v Speaker 5>pretty easy going kind of silly guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also,</v>

2607
01:52:55.851 --> 01:53:00.851
<v Speaker 5>there's a problem too and having um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a relationship with someone sometimes </v>

2608
01:53:00.851 --> 01:53:02.810
<v Speaker 5>he's really struggling and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2609
01:53:02.811 --> 01:53:07.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to get up at a specific </v>

2610
01:53:07.811 --> 01:53:07.811
<v Speaker 5>time every day.</v>

2611
01:53:07.811 --> 01:53:10.230
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems like a for crime with my </v>

2612
01:53:10.230 --> 01:53:10.230
<v Speaker 4>whole life now because now you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2613
01:53:10.230 --> 01:53:12.930
<v Speaker 4>most people have nine to five jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to,</v>

2614
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:14.430
<v Speaker 4>to think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2615
01:53:14.431 --> 01:53:15.150
<v Speaker 4>this person doesn't</v>

2616
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:18.270
<v Speaker 5>five that you enjoy is not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2617
01:53:18.271 --> 01:53:20.590
<v Speaker 5>those people are usually fairly fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2618
01:53:20.610 --> 01:53:22.200
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or at least fairly happy.</v>

2619
01:53:22.201 --> 01:53:24.060
<v Speaker 5>But in nine to five that you hate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's hard,</v>

2620
01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:26.240
<v Speaker 5>that's hard saucepan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hard to us to solve.</v>

2621
01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:28.440
<v Speaker 5>It gets to a point where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2622
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:33.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like too much of a percentage of your </v>

2623
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:34.590
<v Speaker 5>day is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is pushed into the negative zone and you</v>

2624
01:53:34.591 --> 01:53:37.230
<v Speaker 5>start dragging that negativity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

2627
01:53:44.931 --> 01:53:47.480
<v Speaker 5>boring ass day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the week you get this </v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like there's so many issues that </v>

01:54:07.341 --> 01:54:07.341
<v Speaker 5>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2638
01:54:07.341 --> 01:54:11.720
<v Speaker 5>everyone can't really figure it out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>find some job that they truly love.</v>

2639
01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:16.320
<v Speaker 5>There's gonna be people that are in jobs</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't like because if they're not,</v>

2640
01:54:16.590 --> 01:54:17.750
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

2641
01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:21.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean we need to keep this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>society rolling in,</v>

2642
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:22.950

<v Speaker 5>It's going to have to get done and if we</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to have a society like this,</v>

2646
01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:33.480
<v Speaker 5>unless we develop robots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean is that the future where robots </v>

2647
01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.140
<v Speaker 5>do all the jobs that suck and then the </v>
<v Speaker 5>only people that are left are,</v>

2648
01:54:34.141 --> 01:54:37.710

<v Speaker 5>scientists,</v>

2652
01:54:43.981 --> 01:54:46.860
<v Speaker 5>people that create new computers and fix</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stuff that we have.</v>

2653
01:54:46.861 --> 01:54:48.780
<v Speaker 5>Technicians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then what else?</v>

2654
01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:51.210
<v Speaker 5>Then you don't need burger king workers </v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean this is going to get to a point </v>

2656
01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:56.240
<v Speaker 5>where that's going to be the case.</v>

<v Speaker 5>your little pieces of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got it all figured out.</v>

2666

<v Speaker 5>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many Mexicans here that have </v>

2667
01:55:23.951 --> 01:55:24.080
<v Speaker 5>snuck across the border and until you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can count them,</v>

2668
01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:26.270
<v Speaker 5>why are we playing games while we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretending that you know?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're a grown ass man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta do what you want to do.</v>

2674
01:55:36.230 --> 01:55:37.790
<v Speaker 4>I keep on looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2675
01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:38.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

2676
01:55:39.130 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 4>Why do I have to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel like I need to do it and I </v>

2677
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:46.940
<v Speaker 4>also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel like I to participate in </v>

2678
01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:46.940
<v Speaker 4>anything</v>

2679
01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:46.940
<v Speaker 1>extracurricular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2680
01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean you gotta come up with a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to count people.</v>

2681
01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:48.800
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2683
01:55:53.850 --> 01:55:54.000
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it's helping things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think until you start concentrating on</v>

2684
01:55:54.001 --> 01:55:58.020
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck are we in Iraq and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan until we address that,</v>

2685
01:55:58.050 --> 01:55:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to address how many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

<v Speaker 4>engineering,</v>

2729
01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what's important is the things I</v>

2730
01:57:57.001 --> 01:58:02.001
<v Speaker 1>like most when I listened to like opie </v>
<v Speaker 1>and anthony or bubble loves bonds or </v>

2731
01:58:02.001 --> 01:58:05.091
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when they're in the middle of </v>

2732
01:58:05.091 --> 01:58:06.621
<v Speaker 1>a conversation and it's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and I enjoy the point of </v>

2733
01:58:06.621 --> 01:58:10.371
<v Speaker 1>views and the arguments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreements and the revelations of </v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't really care if it's produced </v>

2736
01:58:16.041 --> 01:58:16.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all nonsense to me.</v>

01:58:16.041 --> 01:58:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to listen to people,</v>

2738
01:58:16.711 --> 01:58:21.711
<v Speaker 1>be honest and I want to see if I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they think or if I can learn </v>

2739
01:58:21.711 --> 01:58:22.560
<v Speaker 1>something from the way they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2740
01:58:22.561 --> 01:58:23.910
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to do that.</v>

2741
01:58:23.911 --> 01:58:28.200
<v Speaker 1>So when they do that and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right about to do a deal to a,</v>

2742
01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:33.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not been totally finalized but </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost real close where I'm going to </v>

2743
01:58:33.230 --> 01:58:33.230
<v Speaker 1>write a book.</v>

2744
01:58:33.230 --> 01:58:33.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2745
01:58:33.230 --> 01:58:36.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the middle of doing that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get that shit crack.</v>

2746
01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:41.200
<v Speaker 1>I've been writing for a while but now </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the deals I've actually </v>

2747
01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:41.740
<v Speaker 1>finalized and I have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form,</v>

2748
01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:46.860
<v Speaker 1>so it's gonna be difficult and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to update my website with more,</v>

2749
01:58:46.901 --> 01:58:51.901
<v Speaker 1>like little quick videos and shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it'd be harder to just keep </v>

2750
01:58:51.901 --> 01:58:51.901
<v Speaker 1>writing things over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
