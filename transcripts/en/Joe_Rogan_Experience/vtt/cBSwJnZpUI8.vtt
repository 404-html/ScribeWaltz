<v Speaker 1>someone's ear.</v>

31
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Like my daughter was in my ear last</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Stevens says it's the fighters</v>
<v Speaker 2>curse.</v>

49
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that a bad ass is good old</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>

54
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 2>out all the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the girl hormones.</v>

55
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 2>Whatever chromosomes injected into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>white gives you like a 97 percent chance</v>

56
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>of getting a little boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

57
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that legit if you googled it?</v>

58
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a lot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't limited,</v>

59
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 2>but if it's a possibility that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>going in that direction for the next</v>

60
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:22.460
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of those things that I would</v>

62
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 2>google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would make sure that it's not some</v>

63
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 2>horseshit created by some dude just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>collect your sperm.</v>

64
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I heard Kanye did that to get a</v>

65
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 2>boy the second time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

66
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 2>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Income.</v>

67
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

68
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I obviously got to look into it</v>
<v Speaker 2>extensively before even trying to go in</v>

69
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 2>that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the plan.</v>

70
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it's real when you think in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some way.</v>

71
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not really too much of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual one.</v>

72
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say I'm spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't believe in.</v>

73
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I phrase this?</v>

74
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Would you worry that you would anger the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gods?</v>

75
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.960
<v Speaker 2>But trying to fuck with DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

76
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great question.</v>

77
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.400
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually thought that,</v>

78
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously I'm a religious guy.</v>

79
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I thought that my theory has always been</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is gonna give me a son when I am</v>

80
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.860
<v Speaker 2>mature enough to raise a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher man,</v>

81
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.680
<v Speaker 2>how to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was always my thing and I felt</v>

82
00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:19.514
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

83
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I felt like God was waiting for me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get married before a given me and my</v>

84
00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:27.530
<v Speaker 2>fiance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this boy that's deep and yeah,</v>

85
00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:28.580
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my whole theory.</v>

86
00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm mature enough and you were</v>

87
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
<v Speaker 2>married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

88
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.600
<v Speaker 2>God feels like we're in this good place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to give us a boy and then I'm</v>

89
00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:37.070
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.960
<v Speaker 2>but if we have another girl that trial</v>
<v Speaker 2>and error,</v>

91
00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:41.420
<v Speaker 2>so expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 18 more years of raising some</v>

92
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.890
<v Speaker 2>another girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

93
00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:44.570
<v Speaker 2>So because me and my wife already had</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

94
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call her my wife and my fiance.</v>

95
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:48.740
<v Speaker 2>She's pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife have been together forever.</v>

96
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like,</v>

97
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to read.</v>

98
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.700
<v Speaker 2>You think about it in terms of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial risk.</v>

99
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can afford to have a thousand kids.</v>

100
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's something that gets ingrained</v>

101
00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>in your hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people always say,</v>

102
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of raising kids,</v>

103
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost,</v>

104
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>the reason it's more at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

105
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.620
<v Speaker 2>That time that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to put it in,</v>

106
00:04:12.621 --> 00:04:13.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:15.980
<v Speaker 2>you're raising another little girl and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all trial and error.</v>

108
00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 2>So I'm thinking let's just put a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>science in there.</v>

109
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.590
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like God gives people the</v>

110
00:04:21.591 --> 00:04:26.591
<v Speaker 2>intelligence to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas and these different,</v>

111
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeries or whatever to be able to.</v>

112
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.480
<v Speaker 2>You got to be saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God gives someone the,</v>

113
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.280
<v Speaker 2>the idea to be able to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe he's okay with you.</v>

114
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Choose a boy or girl.</v>

115
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have the foresight when they</v>

116
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:45.541
<v Speaker 1>were writing the Bible to take out</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic diversity testing or whatever</v>

117
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>the fuck they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

118
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would they be doing?</v>

119
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Like some sort of DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chromosomal jazz.</v>

120
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the process is.</v>

121
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well people,</v>

122
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean wouldn't you say personally that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people who are religious,</v>

123
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them sort of pick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose what they decide to agree with</v>

124
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>and not agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a religious person,</v>

125
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:12.151
<v Speaker 1>but you have a tattoo of you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious hatoon which is double ironic</v>

126
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.550
<v Speaker 1>as it says in the Bible not to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>tattoos.</v>

127
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to mess with the temple.</v>

128
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you gotta pick and choose what</v>

129
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you were listening to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the way it's supposed to go</v>

130
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know where I'm perfect and he</v>

131
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:26.254
<v Speaker 1>knows that.</v>

132
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you think when you were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm wanting to wait until or that</v>

133
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 1>God would give you this opportunity when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are more mature,</v>

134
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>when you were mature enough to raise a</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

135
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like man,</v>

136
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>why do I have to wait?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

137
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.360
<v Speaker 1>why am I not mature enough right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

138
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 1>if I can internalize that and if I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that,</v>

139
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>like what is the difference between me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future when I am mature enough to</v>

140
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 1>have a man and me right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

141
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why have I not learned enough lessons?</v>

142
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Why not having</v>

143
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 3>a balance myself out enough?</v>

144
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.790
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

145
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I've learned lessons every year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

146
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.390
<v Speaker 2>every month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

147
00:06:04.391 --> 00:06:06.520
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm growing as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a man,</v>

148
00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:09.370
<v Speaker 2>but I only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know about some demons that I still</v>

149
00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:13.570
<v Speaker 2>struggle with and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I feel as if when I'm over those,</v>

150
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll feel outfit ready to be able to</v>

151
00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:19.090
<v Speaker 2>raise them and teach me how to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>proper bed.</v>

152
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.210
<v Speaker 2>But you don't feel like you're over</v>
<v Speaker 2>overdose yet.</v>

153
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.680
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle of it,</v>

154
00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:27.400
<v Speaker 2>you're in the struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely of still in the struggle</v>

155
00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:27.861
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

156
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:29.050
<v Speaker 2>of some things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

157
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

158
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.430
<v Speaker 2>but I've definitely got over a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I,</v>

159
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.650
<v Speaker 2>that I used to struggle with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm excited about.</v>

160
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.753
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.470
<v Speaker 2>life is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

162
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a work in progress.</v>

163
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were telling me before the show that</v>

164
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

165
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.110
<v Speaker 3>you don't do instagram anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not doing anything,</v>

166
00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:46.380
<v Speaker 3>you just sort of laying low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing any interviews.</v>

167
00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:47.880
<v Speaker 3>So like before you were about to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

168
00:06:47.881 --> 00:06:48.611
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

169
00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:50.380
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done anything like this in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

170
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

171
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.340
<v Speaker 2>The main reason why I decided to come on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your show was um,</v>

172
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting ready to do this grappling</v>
<v Speaker 2>match against Dan Henderson on the 11th</v>

173
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be a lot of media</v>

174
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 2>surrounding it and there was a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I got to do like a one hour phone or</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a bunch of different media guys.</v>

176
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few reporters that's got to be there</v>

177
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 2>physically to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do some interviews with me.</v>

178
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like this is kind of just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of things kind of untalked</v>

179
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 2>about and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are just wondering how I'm</v>

180
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 2>feeling and what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've been up to and stuff like</v>

181
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't want to have to answer the</v>

182
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 2>same exact questions over and over 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

183
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 2>so I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

184
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan has a lot of respect amongst</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mma community and you know,</v>

185
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 2>his fellow goes obviously beyond the mma</v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

186
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.210
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart guy and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather let me just talk with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>about kind of everything and get it out</v>

188
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 2>of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

189
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of this,</v>

190
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 2>this interview with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not really done anything publicly</v>

191
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.640
<v Speaker 2>since July when the UFC 200 scans.</v>

192
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 3>So you've been on a crazy ride just not</v>
<v Speaker 3>just through July,</v>

193
00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 3>but for the last couple of years you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been been involved in a lot of crazy</v>

194
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:56.264
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 3>what are you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>lot of this stuff that I am.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I totally am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally am.</v>

198
00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it feel like?</v>

199
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

200
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Gimme the thought.</v>

201
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Like we can go through all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but give me the thought like probably</v>

202
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 3>the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was disappointed in you and I love you</v>

203
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 3>as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a great guy to jail</v>

204
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

205
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 3>I've always had a good time hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you,</v>

206
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 3>but I was very disappointed with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that car accident.</v>

207
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.330
<v Speaker 3>When you ran away from that car</v>
<v Speaker 3>accident.</v>

208
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 3>That to me was like God Damn Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

209
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.401
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

210
00:08:26.401 --> 00:08:26.850
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

211
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.440
<v Speaker 2>I was at a bad place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>

212
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.870
<v Speaker 2>It was a messed up situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

213
00:08:30.871 --> 00:08:33.060
<v Speaker 2>I literally was an important mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

214
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Then when I was winning all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>

215
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 2>I was the boy in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sponsored by Nike and Gatorade and</v>

216
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest of all time finishing</v>

217
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.390
<v Speaker 2>legends after legend after legend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just really in this position where I</v>

218
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 2>felt so untouchable and I just felt like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like everything was meant to go</v>

219
00:08:56.611 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 2>my way and in that time of my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>started to.</v>

220
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 2>I was obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was smoking pot,</v>

221
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of my career of drake</v>

222
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 2>drink and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every weekend pretty much,</v>

223
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the point of blacking out.</v>

224
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Just lacking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

225
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Just just being a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 2>and just being a total party boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still,</v>

227
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm still training my butt off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm working really hard believer in</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hired,</v>

229
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 2>have big goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big dreams,</v>

230
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 2>but just being a party boy and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just took everything that I have for</v>

231
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 2>granted because everything for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of my career has gone my way.</v>

232
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.350
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

233
00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 2>that morning I got in a car accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

234
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

235
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

236
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 2>it was a huge reality check and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

237
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 2>I think in some people's mind they</v>
<v Speaker 2>envisioned me,</v>

238
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting this car and running up and</v>

239
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 2>seeing that it was a pregnant lady and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it off Vernon.</v>

240
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 2>And then people said that I came back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and grabbed a load of money,</v>

241
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 2>which is the stupidest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

242
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 2>With a millionaire and need to grab</v>
<v Speaker 2>cash,</v>

243
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you run back to the car.</v>

244
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 2>So I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through a light,</v>

245
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a green light that said that</v>

246
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 2>I could turn left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're supposed to yield for the</v>

247
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Speaker 2>right of way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to turn left.</v>

248
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.020
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

249
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 2>person came through and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just assumed it was my green light to</v>

250
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:27.770
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously being I'm not completely clear</v>

251
00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:28.604
<v Speaker 2>headed.</v>

252
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.430
<v Speaker 2>And I ended up running into a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

253
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:36.590
<v Speaker 2>I was definitely disoriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm disoriented from the accident,</v>

254
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 2>from the accident for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kinda like what the hell just</v>

255
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:41.220
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a really big hit,</v>

256
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 2>but that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no injuries and I just felt like,</v>

257
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:48.420
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it wasn't that bad of a hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I literally,</v>

258
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:53.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>step out of the car and I realized like</v>

259
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 2>seconds later I realized my bulls in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

260
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 2>So you bowl my ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>

261
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

262
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.471
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

263
00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my pop pop pot.</v>

264
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't smoking weed in the car or</v>

265
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was in the car,</v>

266
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 2>but my bowl that had residue was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

267
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 2>So I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I open my car door,</v>

268
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to take two steps away from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and then I go back to the car and I</v>

269
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.460
<v Speaker 2>searched the car because I had it in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>cup holder and when I hit the ball fell</v>

270
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

271
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Who knows where it flute you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I knew,</v>

272
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.780
<v Speaker 2>I knew shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't find that bull that's gonna</v>

273
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 2>get me in trouble and just having a bowl</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my car.</v>

274
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.630
<v Speaker 2>So I looked for like two seconds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>find the ball and I just took off</v>

275
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:37.550
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

276
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.450
<v Speaker 2>did you look at the other person in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other car?</v>

277
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no clue that it was a woman.</v>

278
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I had no clue that it was a pregnant</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

279
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.610
<v Speaker 2>How much time are we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like from the time literally from the</v>

280
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.030
<v Speaker 2>time that I hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

281
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.780
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

282
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I was over a fence probably eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds later.</v>

283
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was literally a super reactionary,</v>

284
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 2>like just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt I hadn't been home yet.</v>

285
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I say that a friend's house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't drinking and driving.</v>

286
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 2>my decision was to sleep at my friend's</v>
<v Speaker 2>house because I knew I couldn't drive</v>

288
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

289
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 2>He woke up early the next morning to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work and he's like,</v>

290
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel free to stay here and uh,</v>

291
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make yourself breakfast or</v>

292
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

293
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 2>And the guy has a family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a wife and he has a newborn baby</v>

294
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't want to stay at his house</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's at work.</v>

295
00:12:22.181 --> 00:12:23.680
<v Speaker 2>So I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

296
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really I had maybe like two hours of</v>

297
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 2>sleep and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that I was still wasn't</v>

298
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 2>ready to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

299
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I wake up and get in my car and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I just wasn't ready to drive or whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

302
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you look at the other car</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it all happened so fast.</v>

303
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

304
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it all happens so fast and um,</v>

305
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I just knew I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I smelled like alcohol and um,</v>

306
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like if the police came out</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a bad situation for me.</v>

307
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.680
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought the person that I hit had</v>

308
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 2>to have been okay because I was totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

309
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this collision wasn't that hard.</v>

310
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just feel like in a lot of people's</v>

311
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:14.710
<v Speaker 2>minds they see me as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was this woman,</v>

312
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I saw this woman hanging out the window</v>
<v Speaker 2>crying and bleeding and sort of</v>

313
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.680
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I just chose the lever and I</v>

314
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.300
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what I had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

315
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.250
<v Speaker 2>if I had a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know if I hit a uh,</v>

316
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.600
<v Speaker 2>a punch bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what it was that I had.</v>

317
00:13:27.601 --> 00:13:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I just knew it was another vehicle you</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even look.</v>

318
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.493
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look.</v>

319
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't go back for cash,</v>

320
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:39.540
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make a what I did.</v>

321
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that,</v>

322
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go back for cash and I really</v>

323
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 2>went back for my boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

324
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 2>that's no better.</v>

325
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

326
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.340
<v Speaker 2>full situation was just a shitty</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation I was in.</v>

327
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I was in a really bad point in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking everything for granted.</v>

328
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.760
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to have a situation come</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with just like worst case scenario,</v>

329
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.440
<v Speaker 2>that is the worst case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pregnant woman.</v>

330
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me like a monster.</v>

331
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 2>It makes me look a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you found out I was pregnant woman,</v>

332
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was going through your mind?</v>

333
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

334
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

335
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First I was afraid that there will be</v>

336
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:15.910
<v Speaker 2>some type of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

337
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.340
<v Speaker 2>problems with their baby because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

338
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:21.590
<v Speaker 2>obviously if she had a difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnancy then that's,</v>

339
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.270
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different level of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>in trouble and God forbid if she was</v>

340
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.140
<v Speaker 2>having a miscarriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

341
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that that would be</v>

342
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.580
<v Speaker 2>$1,000 to put on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought about the fact that I went</v>

343
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:38.581
<v Speaker 2>from just partying and join this career</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this amazing fairytale life I went</v>

344
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:40.540
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

345
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was going from that to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally being in jail,</v>

346
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.670
<v Speaker 2>being labeled as a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was my,</v>

347
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 2>that was my number one</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

348
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 2>was just hoping that the baby was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>

349
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 2>what were you thinking about yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you did that,</v>

350

<v Speaker 2>yourself that you did that.</v>

368
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:42.940
<v Speaker 2>health and safety and I'm really glad</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she ended up being okay.</v>

369
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I felt really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

370
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.980
<v Speaker 2>do even in the public's eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just heard a pregnant woman</v>

<v Speaker 2>I hit and I felt terrible.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They know that I have a good heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

384
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.670

<v Speaker 2>I've had a lot of people telling me I</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to get my shit together.</v>

389
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:34.240
<v Speaker 2>And what was it about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what besides that,</v>

390
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.150
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like besides this one instance,</v>

391
00:16:37.151 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 2>what other things would people come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and say,</v>

392
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Hey John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get your shit together.</v>

393
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of all of it,</v>

394
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.700
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's happened over the last</v>

395
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.570
<v Speaker 2>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes people feel like they can</v>

396
00:16:49.571 --> 00:16:51.250
<v Speaker 2>tell me that I need to get my shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>

397
00:16:51.251 --> 00:16:56.251
<v Speaker 2>And I recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recently went outside to my growers.</v>

398
00:16:56.531 --> 00:16:59.560
<v Speaker 2>My garbage man was coming up and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>late getting one of the garbage out to</v>

399
00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:03.850
<v Speaker 2>the side of the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he waited for me and I've even told</v>

400
00:17:03.851 --> 00:17:06.490
<v Speaker 2>me he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was dumping garbage and he's like,</v>

401
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.980
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm waiting to see you fight again.</v>

402
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like you really need to get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

403
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just parked outside of my little kitchen</v>

404
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.480
<v Speaker 2>pretty much just telling me to get my</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit together.</v>

405
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I've taken like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody feels like they have the right</v>

406
00:17:21.851 --> 00:17:25.240
<v Speaker 2>to tell me to get my shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the end of the day,</v>

407
00:17:25.241 --> 00:17:27.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sit there and I humbly take it because</v>

408
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.230
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

409
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:29.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're right.</v>

410
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.450
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

411
00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:34.270
<v Speaker 2>how many motherfuckers in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>

412
00:17:34.271 --> 00:17:39.271
<v Speaker 2>like so many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are into all types of crazy shit and</v>

413
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.700
<v Speaker 2>don't compare yourself to the losers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the losers.</v>

414
00:17:42.701 --> 00:17:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're talking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

415
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Can say hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well compared to dudes like to go out</v>

416
00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:47.980
<v Speaker 2>and who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

417
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

418
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Knows what we're shit this guy's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's telling me to get my shit</v>

419
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:53.650
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like just because mostly it's</v>

420
00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.580
<v Speaker 2>publicly don't mean you're any better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than I am.</v>

421
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know that that conflict is never</v>

422
00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 3>ending and you can't get involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that conflict that you're starting</v>

423
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:04.760
<v Speaker 3>up in your own brain right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a rationalization conflict.</v>

424
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.270
<v Speaker 3>You start rationalizing your behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus well,</v>

425
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.860
<v Speaker 3>a lot of other people do worse where a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of that is a dead end,</v>

426
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.430
<v Speaker 3>a bad road that a lot of people go down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make themselves feel better.</v>

427
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.110
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that can make you feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>better is to be pure or your shit</v>

428
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone comes up to me and says,</v>

429
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been ripping off old ladies and</v>

430
00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:24.750
<v Speaker 3>stealing money from the church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

431
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.310
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking to him about it doesn't make any</v>

432
00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:27.420
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not true at all.</v>

433
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.270
<v Speaker 3>So if someone says something to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's rude,</v>

434
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any impact on you.</v>

435
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.180
<v Speaker 3>But when someone says something to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's rude but true,</v>

436
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.940
<v Speaker 3>then you have to rationalize and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to go,</v>

437
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about you man?</v>

438
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:42.930
<v Speaker 3>What's going on in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're into some dark shit.</v>

439
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:44.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

440
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a,</v>

441
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a defensive road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a fighter it's a natural</v>

442
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:49.601
<v Speaker 3>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody hits you,</v>

443
00:18:49.601 --> 00:18:52.110
<v Speaker 3>you hit him back so many attacks you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't.</v>

444
00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what about your weaknesses?</v>

445
00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:57.390
<v Speaker 3>And you want to try to search them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure a lot of people go through</v>

446
00:18:57.391 --> 00:19:00.720
<v Speaker 3>that when they read social media and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see these anonymous eggs on twitter</v>

447
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:02.940
<v Speaker 3>saying mean shit to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Start Thinking,</v>

448
00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:04.620
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know who this fucking guy is</v>

449
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:05.870
<v Speaker 3>and what's going on in his fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

450
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.250
<v Speaker 3>that is a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a trap.</v>

451
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

452
00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.040
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do respectfully take it like I've</v>

453
00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:13.460
<v Speaker 2>never had someone say,</v>

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.720
<v Speaker 2>outside of sports is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

493
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 2>obviously haven't had the clear mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that I haven't had in a long</v>

494
00:20:58.601 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as.</v>

497
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.420
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also being in a position where</v>

498
00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't even really need to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>against it either.</v>

499
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Financially</v>

500
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.110
<v Speaker 3>like don't you though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you though in your mind?</v>

501
00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to fight because I have to fight</v>

502
00:21:18.441 --> 00:21:19.910
<v Speaker 2>because of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't end like this.</v>

503
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's like the financial thing is</v>

504
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 3>beautiful and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful that you're set for life</v>

505
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:27.160
<v Speaker 3>and you can just kick back and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>children will be taken care of.</v>

506
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:29.380
<v Speaker 3>And your wife would be taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all beautiful.</v>

507
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 3>But you have a responsibility of</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatness.</v>

508
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:38.500
<v Speaker 3>There's very few people that ever get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the position that you,</v>

509
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 3>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in when you won the title,</v>

510
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 3>when you were the youngest ever ufc</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight or light heavyweight</v>

511
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.400
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just that,</v>

512
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.970
<v Speaker 3>the youngest ever UFC champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

513
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Speaker 3>not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also a responsibility that comes</v>

514
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 3>with potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

515
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.280
<v Speaker 3>it's not just with what you've done and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

516
00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 3>it's what you could have done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

517
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.260
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fought Alexander Gustafson,</v>

518
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.710
<v Speaker 3>be honest about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much did you train for that</v>

519
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.280
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained,</v>

520
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.050
<v Speaker 2>I trained for the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

521
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.040
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

522
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this thing where I just felt</v>

523
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:16.180
<v Speaker 2>invincible and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a lot of wild stuff leading up to</v>

524
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely didn't give it my all</v>

525
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.540
<v Speaker 3>as far as partying and sleeping right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bailey party and stay up all night.</v>

526
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

527
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you win a fight like that where you</v>

528
00:22:28.311 --> 00:22:33.260
<v Speaker 3>weren't 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that sort of almost reinforced this</v>

529
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.850
<v Speaker 3>idea that you could do anything you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want?</v>

530
00:22:34.851 --> 00:22:35.331
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

531
00:22:35.331 --> 00:22:37.790
<v Speaker 3>imagine if I trained next time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's someone big,</v>

532
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:38.410
<v Speaker 3>I'll train.</v>

533
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have this,</v>

534
00:22:40.161 --> 00:22:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to share something with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if I've ever shared this</v>

535
00:22:42.321 --> 00:22:45.240
<v Speaker 2>with anyone else before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had this crazy thing that I would</v>

536
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.550
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

537
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:51.080
<v Speaker 2>where I would party one week before</v>
<v Speaker 2>every fight and I did it throughout my</v>

538
00:22:51.081 --> 00:22:54.050
<v Speaker 2>whole career and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was stupid,</v>

539
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.390
<v Speaker 2>but it was this mental crutch that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

540
00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I literally would one week before every</v>
<v Speaker 2>flight I would go out and I will get</v>

541
00:23:01.851 --> 00:23:06.770
<v Speaker 2>blacked out wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my logic was if this guy were to</v>

542
00:23:06.771 --> 00:23:11.771
<v Speaker 2>beat me somehow I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can look myself in the mirror and say</v>

543
00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.123
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

544
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I lost because I got hammered the week</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the fight.</v>

545
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.710
<v Speaker 2>So it was a built in safety net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a safety net.</v>

546
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

547
00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.790
<v Speaker 2>So I did it my whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

548
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.260
<v Speaker 2>I would go out and get hammered when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before every fight.</v>

549
00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever worked with a sports</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist?</v>

550
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now,</v>

551
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.780
<v Speaker 2>but now I don't have my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

552
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:35.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my old st proof.</v>

553
00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I was the first fight that I did not do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

554
00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Worse performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what was your worst performance?</v>

555
00:23:43.191 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 3>I think you were very unjustly</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticized that fight because I think</v>

556
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.050
<v Speaker 3>over in St.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] is a very tough guy.</v>

557
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 3>He's a very difficult five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very strong.</v>

558
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 3>He's got a brutal left kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's athletic.</v>

559
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 3>He moves well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was a good performance,</v>

560
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.590
<v Speaker 3>but it was still worst before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

561
00:23:57.591 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 3>I think over st proves a really tough</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and he was a tough fight.</v>

562
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:04.160
<v Speaker 3>And you hadn't fought in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were off for how long?</v>

563
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:05.700
<v Speaker 3>How many months?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixteen months or something?</v>

564
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

565
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.220
<v Speaker 2>it was over a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

566
00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.320
<v Speaker 2>it was a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over a year ago.</v>

567
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

568
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.410
<v Speaker 3>And then you're fighting a guy who had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been pretty active and fought some good</v>

569
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.540
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a great victory,</v>

570
00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.990
<v Speaker 3>was shogun and looked real good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of his fights and was an up</v>

571
00:24:18.991 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 3>and comer.</v>

572
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Main thing about events that really</v>
<v Speaker 2>bothered me was,</v>

573
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

574
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.660
<v Speaker 2>he was the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

575
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.650
<v Speaker 2>while he was seizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey actually has been fighting longer</v>

576
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:29.090
<v Speaker 2>than I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't realize that,</v>

577
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.480
<v Speaker 2>but he was just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>green and raw still like skill wise,</v>

578
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:36.440
<v Speaker 2>skill wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

579
00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

580
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.240
<v Speaker 2>I studied everybody extensively and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come up with their patterns.</v>

581
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured out the way they flinch.</v>

582
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I figured out their first favorite</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch,</v>

583
00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:47.420
<v Speaker 2>their second favorite punch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that third,</v>

584
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.140
<v Speaker 2>their favorite combinations that set up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they take downs when they clinched</v>

585
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:54.050
<v Speaker 2>what side of the head is going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally everything I know everything</v>

586
00:24:54.051 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 2>about every opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what side they're going to shoot,</v>

587
00:24:56.091 --> 00:24:57.740
<v Speaker 2>whether it's going to be a head inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>his head outside.</v>

588
00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.200
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

589
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I figured out everything.</v>

590
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Why they shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

591
00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 2>what area of the cage they like to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

592
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

593
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.160
<v Speaker 2>with in St [inaudible] he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

594
00:25:08.161 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know what he's gonna do.</v>

595
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:14.830
<v Speaker 2>He's so that are unorthodox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:18.770
<v Speaker 2>and he gets these random knockouts from</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird angles and he's just wing stuff</v>

597
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 2>and he almost closes his eyes and next</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing you know,</v>

598
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:21.990
<v Speaker 2>he's knocked somebody out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

599
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.750
<v Speaker 2>so the scary thing about him was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so unpredictable and so,</v>

600
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.180
<v Speaker 2>and I had a lot on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

601
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:30.380
<v Speaker 2>so I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

602
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.260
<v Speaker 2>this guy is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in a shell pretty much the whole</v>

603
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:34.130
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was defensive,</v>

604
00:25:34.131 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 2>the whole fight and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just thought I had coached through</v>

605
00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:38.030
<v Speaker 2>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

606
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.930
<v Speaker 2>and not really risk anything which I</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt like I let myself down because I'm</v>

607
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.690
<v Speaker 2>normally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>

608
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean normally when you get someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that you just,</v>

609
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take them out,</v>

610
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

611
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I should have just been able to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>them out.</v>

612
00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 2>But I was content with winning and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that was,</v>

613
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that was one of the first fights</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I actually just wanted to get the</v>

614
00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.140
<v Speaker 2>win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get my money,</v>

615
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.290
<v Speaker 2>go back to what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my actual goal,</v>

616
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:04.880
<v Speaker 2>which was Thisi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

617
00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:07.250
<v Speaker 2>instead of wanting to finish this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>like normal.</v>

618
00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:12.220
<v Speaker 2>So I had to really question my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really questioned myself and why I'm</v>

619
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.230
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like that while I was content with</v>

620
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.020
<v Speaker 2>coasting.</v>

621
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a fight where you,</v>

622
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.540
<v Speaker 3>that had the most pressure on you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then in a fight you've had before as far</v>

623
00:26:21.541 --> 00:26:26.220
<v Speaker 3>as like people wanting to see how you</v>
<v Speaker 3>respond to the adversity outside of the</v>

624
00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:26.800
<v Speaker 3>octagon.</v>

625
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

626
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

627
00:26:29.261 --> 00:26:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of pressure and I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I responded great to my adversity.</v>

628
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did all the things I had to do to get</v>

629
00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:36.874
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

630
00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.740
<v Speaker 2>get back to the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

631
00:26:41.741 --> 00:26:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I handled all my probation obligations</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

632
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.130
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

633
00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I stayed healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started powerlifting and hired a</v>

634
00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:51.950
<v Speaker 2>nutritionist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked better than ever.</v>

635
00:26:51.951 --> 00:26:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I felt better than ever physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

636
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.480
<v Speaker 2>I did everything I had to do Amanda up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and was responsible for my actions.</v>

637
00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it Greg Jackson that thought that</v>

638
00:27:01.061 --> 00:27:04.970
<v Speaker 3>the power lifting might have a bit of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect on your performance?</v>

639
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.850
<v Speaker 3>You thought that you were doing too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that?</v>

640
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

641
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I was doing too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

642
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>

643
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.300
<v Speaker 2>I started power lifting and I took off</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven months of martial arts training.</v>

644
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I didn't show up to Jackson's for seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>months and I,</v>

645
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I showed up to this place called Zia</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength systems,</v>

646
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerlifting gym.</v>

647
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm four days a week just getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked,</v>

648
00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 2>getting jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>African American.</v>

649
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 2>I became obsessed with lifting heavy</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight and I literally didn't know</v>

650
00:27:36.181 --> 00:27:41.181
<v Speaker 2>martial arts training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then about four months out from the</v>

651
00:27:41.341 --> 00:27:45.120
<v Speaker 2>fight I started to come into the room a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more.</v>

652
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:46.860
<v Speaker 2>And then only three months before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

653
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.510
<v Speaker 2>did I actually start a training camp?</v>

654
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.311
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

655
00:27:49.311 --> 00:27:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Why did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as like cardio and things like</v>

656
00:27:51.841 --> 00:27:53.040
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you think that your cardio</v>

657
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 3>would dramatically suffer from just</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting weights?</v>

658
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of weight to it</v>

659
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.590
<v Speaker 2>because I had gotten big and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

660
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I actually did a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

661
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.830
<v Speaker 2>a lot of cardio training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was also,</v>

662
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I had these new coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new strength and conditioning coaches</v>

663
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:11.160
<v Speaker 2>who specialize in powerlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to almost,</v>

664
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.810
<v Speaker 2>we had to come up with a plan together</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how we're going to start not weight</v>

665
00:28:14.811 --> 00:28:18.180
<v Speaker 2>lifting and doing all cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even at the beginning stages it was</v>

666
00:28:18.181 --> 00:28:18.481
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

667
00:28:18.481 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 2>well let's just look lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weights more.</v>

668
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:20.821
<v Speaker 2>And I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

669
00:28:20.821 --> 00:28:21.151
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

670
00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 2>I need like cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio.</v>

671
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.950
<v Speaker 2>And so it was just like a big learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that we had to do that.</v>

672
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these guys,</v>

673
00:28:27.021 --> 00:28:28.940
<v Speaker 3>were they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were they involved in martial arts at</v>

674
00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:30.150
<v Speaker 3>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

675
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.280
<v Speaker 3>my power lifting coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know they were so,</v>

676
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.650
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were giving you advice about</v>

677
00:28:33.651 --> 00:28:36.260
<v Speaker 3>martial arts training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of learning on the job?</v>

678
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of literally the job,</v>

679
00:28:37.461 --> 00:28:39.350
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't giving me advice about</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts training,</v>

680
00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:40.250
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

681
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a learning curve.</v>

682
00:28:41.991 --> 00:28:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they had ever worked with</v>
<v Speaker 2>an endurance athlete the way that I am.</v>

683
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.540
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they work with football players or power</v>

684
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.760
<v Speaker 2>lift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They work with a Philadelphia Eagle and</v>

685
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.040
<v Speaker 2>a lot of power lifters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

686
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these guys,</v>

687
00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 2>to their credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were really humble and they,</v>

688
00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:00.630
<v Speaker 2>they listened and they were able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly adjusted what we were doing</v>

689
00:29:01.131 --> 00:29:03.670
<v Speaker 2>every day to make it more about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

690
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.580
<v Speaker 2>endurance and not about maintaining</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle and strength and things like</v>

691
00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:09.530
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like I got in really good</v>

692
00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:10.460
<v Speaker 2>shape with these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

693
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.940
<v Speaker 2>and now we're at a place because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>still working with these same guys and</v>

694
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 2>now we're at a place where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

695
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.700
<v Speaker 2>we realized the importance of endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to start way farther</v>

696
00:29:19.701 --> 00:29:20.820
<v Speaker 2>out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

697
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.090
<v Speaker 2>and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are humble enough to do what</v>

698
00:29:23.091 --> 00:29:25.940
<v Speaker 2>I need them to do is put me through some</v>
<v Speaker 2>strenuous workouts that I think are a</v>

699
00:29:25.941 --> 00:29:28.130
<v Speaker 2>great ideal racial differences in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right place.</v>

700
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.750
<v Speaker 3>So other than the fact that you did so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much strength and conditioning or so</v>

701
00:29:31.751 --> 00:29:33.670
<v Speaker 3>much power lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else?</v>

702
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.540
<v Speaker 3>Like what did you feel when you got into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the octagon when you fought over in St</v>

703
00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.160
<v Speaker 3>Jude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you feel stronger?</v>

704
00:29:39.161 --> 00:29:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Did you feel like your endurance had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been diminished slightly because of all</v>

705
00:29:42.791 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 3>this power lifting?</v>

706
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

707
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.660
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like I was saying,</v>

708
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

709
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 2>I took off seven months of martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I did a three month campaign.</v>

710
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.510
<v Speaker 2>And so if you like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take off seven months,</v>

711
00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your game is going to change a little</v>

712
00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So literally throughout my training camp</v>

713
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I found myself trying to get learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to fight again,</v>

714
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 2>pretty much I felt like timing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>timing was off I creativity was off the</v>

715
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:13.390
<v Speaker 2>things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that go to moves that I used to do</v>

716
00:30:13.391 --> 00:30:14.790
<v Speaker 2>weren't quite there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

717
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I would watch some of my old training</v>
<v Speaker 2>practices or my old fights and I'm like,</v>

718
00:30:18.581 --> 00:30:20.170
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this stuff that I was</v>

719
00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:21.600
<v Speaker 2>doing before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

720
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 2>so I was really nervous going into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that I was ready to beat dc</v>

721
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.920
<v Speaker 2>because I was so well rehearsed and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drills and everything were so Robert</v>

722
00:30:30.921 --> 00:30:32.230
<v Speaker 2>hearst to be DC.</v>

723
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.450
<v Speaker 2>But as far as going into the fight will</v>
<v Speaker 2>open St Pruett.</v>

724
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I just felt that my creativity was Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone in my ability to improvise or</v>

725
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.130
<v Speaker 2>wasn't quite there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was just from taking off so</v>

726
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 2>much time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

727
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.410
<v Speaker 2>from martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the fight with ogen St Prue,</v>

728
00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt really strong.</v>

729
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I felt really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really strong,</v>

730
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:51.640
<v Speaker 2>like picking him up against the cage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

731
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:54.670
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and taking them down felt effortless.</v>

732
00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to the way you used to feel,</v>

733
00:30:57.461 --> 00:30:59.920
<v Speaker 2>you felt stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt I felt really strong.</v>

734
00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>

735
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else?</v>

736
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance felt good.</v>

737
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.590
<v Speaker 2>It felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't as sharp as normal,</v>

738
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:11.320
<v Speaker 2>like a few times when when I took him</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

739
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:17.070
<v Speaker 2>I remember I wound up in a punch and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a big punch and then I wound up and</v>

740
00:31:18.191 --> 00:31:19.760
<v Speaker 2>then I hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit him again in DC.</v>

741
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Said it was in the back of the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>which wasn't.</v>

742
00:31:21.551 --> 00:31:24.070
<v Speaker 2>It was on the neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

743
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I was throwing big shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Vince instead of throwing a whole</v>

744
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:34.000
<v Speaker 2>bunch of shots and that was because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was feeling lactic acid in my arms.</v>

745
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:37.300
<v Speaker 2>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that kind of made me nervous that I</v>

746
00:31:37.301 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 2>didn't have the normal level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance that are normally have.</v>

747
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's because you had more</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle bulk?</v>

748
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.431
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

749
00:31:42.431 --> 00:31:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it is because they have more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of bulk but on the bright side and</v>

750
00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:47.920
<v Speaker 2>not that this is a good thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to injure someone,</v>

751
00:31:47.921 --> 00:31:51.400
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't break or fracture his arm</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a kick and that's something that</v>

752
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I've never done before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that showed me.</v>

753
00:31:53.801 --> 00:31:57.780
<v Speaker 2>That definitely came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has to be connected to just develop</v>

754
00:31:57.781 --> 00:32:00.520
<v Speaker 2>and so much power in my hips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into my legs.</v>

755
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a point of like a balancing tipping</v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

756
00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:06.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it's like strength versus</v>

757
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:08.230
<v Speaker 2>endurance and trying to find that</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

758
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now,</v>

759
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:10.750
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

760
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 2>as I sit here today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

761
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.023
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

762
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm using my past experience and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

763
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.580
<v Speaker 2>to measure what I'm doing as we speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now I'm strong as hell.</v>

764
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my insurance is actually in a really</v>

765
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:25.880
<v Speaker 2>good place right now and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting until July.</v>

766
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.040
<v Speaker 2>So now we're figuring it out right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we speak.</v>

767
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 3>When you got really big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you doing that?</v>

768
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.450
<v Speaker 3>Were you thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

769
00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:33.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day I'm going to fight heavyweight.</v>

770
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what I would be like as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy.</v>

771
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

772
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.151
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

773
00:32:36.151 --> 00:32:38.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what I was going to do at</v>

774
00:32:38.251 --> 00:32:39.510
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

775
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just needed something to be passionate</v>

776
00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

777
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.030
<v Speaker 2>something that's to be competitive about</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you were suspended.</v>

778
00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Suspended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

779
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:48.741
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

780
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

781
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:54.550
<v Speaker 2>I went through a real self destructive</v>
<v Speaker 2>state right after the car accident and</v>

782
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:58.190
<v Speaker 2>then how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just started to party more.</v>

783
00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really,</v>

784
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I was really depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:05.261
<v Speaker 2>The belt had been stripped from me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not until Anthony Johnson and Dcf,</v>

786
00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:07.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

787
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.780
<v Speaker 2>that first time that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I joined the gym and get my,</v>

788
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 2>get my self together.</v>

789
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just watching that fight competing for</v>

790
00:33:16.121 --> 00:33:16.540
<v Speaker 1>your belt?</v>

791
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just seeing them compete for the bill.</v>

792
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:19.180
<v Speaker 2>That's myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

793
00:33:19.181 --> 00:33:24.181
<v Speaker 2>I am wasting and wasting talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wasting everything.</v>

794
00:33:24.191 --> 00:33:25.024
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

795
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.580
<v Speaker 2>I believe I can be both of these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're up there and uh,</v>

796
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.060
<v Speaker 2>on tv where I should be and I'm sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>here at home,</v>

797
00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

798
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.270
<v Speaker 2>living in this depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm literally,</v>

799
00:33:37.271 --> 00:33:39.260
<v Speaker 2>the next day I called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

800
00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked down there stoned,</v>

801
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

802
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:43.380
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

803
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.213
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

804
00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I need to get my life together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need something.</v>

805
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I need something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be excited about,</v>

806
00:33:52.031 --> 00:33:56.160
<v Speaker 2>something to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to inspire and motivate me,</v>

807
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.520
<v Speaker 2>get me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get me out of the house.</v>

808
00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.810
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

809
00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:04.380
<v Speaker 2>and I just completely turned everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>around from that day for it and just</v>

810
00:34:05.621 --> 00:34:07.780
<v Speaker 2>started to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

811
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a new passion and,</v>

812
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:15.410
<v Speaker 2>and that was weight lifting and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got so strong so fast,</v>

813
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it became,</v>

814
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.130
<v Speaker 2>it became everything to me just for my</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers to go up every week,</v>

815
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and which they did.</v>

816
00:34:23.381 --> 00:34:25.930
<v Speaker 2>And I found myself really happy again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

817
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>squatting 500 pounds would be in 64 and</v>

818
00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:30.964
<v Speaker 2>the only way in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

819
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:32.680
<v Speaker 2>to 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:34:32.681 --> 00:34:35.320
<v Speaker 2>with these really skinny legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 pounds is a lot of weight,</v>

821
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.950
<v Speaker 2>like dead lifts and 600 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

822
00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.500
<v Speaker 2>there were guys who had been training at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gym for years who still can't do</v>

823
00:34:41.501 --> 00:34:42.990
<v Speaker 2>those types of numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

824
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.220
<v Speaker 2>and I was able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just like,</v>

825
00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:45.731
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

826
00:34:45.731 --> 00:34:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I can do anything I put my mind to.</v>

827
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.610
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought I was going to become one</v>

828
00:34:49.611 --> 00:34:51.580
<v Speaker 1>of the strongest motherfuckers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Albuquerque.</v>

829
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.530
<v Speaker 1>That was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my plan.</v>

830
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power lifting gyms are very competitive</v>

831
00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:00.740
<v Speaker 1>and guys get super hung up on the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like lifting heavier and heavier</v>

832
00:35:00.741 --> 00:35:02.150
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hooked.</v>

833
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:07.270
<v Speaker 1>I had a Mark Bell on the podcast before</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also did a podcast in Columbus</v>

834
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.920
<v Speaker 1>with a Louie Simmons who's a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous power lifting a guru and he's a</v>

835
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:15.530
<v Speaker 1>fucking maniac and it's all with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys.</v>

836
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:17.660
<v Speaker 1>It's all just about putting up big</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

837
00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Keep it going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it going,</v>

838
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.040
<v Speaker 1>keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heavier numbers,</v>

839
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.370
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

840
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.350
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

841
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I fell in love with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy sort of discipline.</v>

842
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.630
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

843
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's so simple to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just lifted up,</v>

844
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's very satisfying for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it like,</v>

845
00:35:32.121 --> 00:35:33.950
<v Speaker 1>who gives a fuck if you squat 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>

846
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.630
<v Speaker 1>but when you're doing like screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

847
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high fives,</v>

848
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:42.000
<v Speaker 1>chalks flying in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best.</v>

849
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

850
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

851
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I really love power lifting and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>about getting injured though because</v>

852
00:35:48.231 --> 00:35:51.830
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part of power lifting until</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a pretty good traders and,</v>

853
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:55.520
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they teach me the right way to do</v>

854
00:35:55.521 --> 00:35:57.770
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also allow me to,</v>

855
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be out of position a lot of times too</v>

856
00:36:00.171 --> 00:36:01.004
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

857
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.430
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times people focus on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect form at everything,</v>

858
00:36:04.431 --> 00:36:06.560
<v Speaker 2>but when you looked at real big wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not always going to be in the</v>

859
00:36:06.561 --> 00:36:07.580
<v Speaker 2>perfect form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

860
00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.250
<v Speaker 2>they almost allow me to be out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

861
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you are not in the form is</v>
<v Speaker 2>still power through positions.</v>

862
00:36:13.251 --> 00:36:16.010
<v Speaker 2>That way you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're strong grappling sense.</v>

863
00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're strong in Everett,</v>

864
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.120
<v Speaker 2>you're showing every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

865
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.420
<v Speaker 2>every part of the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a former bad form,</v>

866
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:23.810
<v Speaker 2>you're still able to lift big weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

867
00:36:23.811 --> 00:36:25.610
<v Speaker 2>that's the big theory behind functional</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength,</v>

868
00:36:25.611 --> 00:36:27.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why people like doing things like</v>

869
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:27.470
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

870
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:31.580
<v Speaker 1>power cleans and presses because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>such an awkward thing to do with the</v>

871
00:36:31.581 --> 00:36:34.610
<v Speaker 1>weight and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in weird movements and you're</v>

872
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.360
<v Speaker 1>doing things with your whole body right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

873
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.380
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing</v>

874
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:42.070
<v Speaker 2>days?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these days I am a,</v>

875
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I have just been doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

876
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you back on Jackson's a bunch of</v>

877
00:36:46.451 --> 00:36:48.570
<v Speaker 2>power lifts and a bunch of wrestling and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu?</v>

878
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.640
<v Speaker 2>That's been my thing lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No striking.</v>

879
00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

880
00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done any striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My whole goal is to not get punched in</v>

881
00:36:56.051 --> 00:36:58.180
<v Speaker 2>the head at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your goal.</v>

882
00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what my plan is.</v>

883
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eventually answer my</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout routine to where I'm doing a lot</v>

884
00:37:04.961 --> 00:37:09.961
<v Speaker 2>of myths and working on my versatility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on my versatility and,</v>

885
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 2>and just my abilities on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

886
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:15.100
<v Speaker 2>you're not throwing any punches these</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

887
00:37:15.101 --> 00:37:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Not throwing out kick now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's crazy to me,</v>

888
00:37:17.141 --> 00:37:20.380
<v Speaker 2>but my plan is to get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to last for too long,</v>

889
00:37:20.381 --> 00:37:23.620
<v Speaker 2>but I won't be doing too much sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially heavy spine.</v>

890
00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even without doing any sparring,</v>

891
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:29.050
<v Speaker 2>you don't hit the bag you don't know.</v>

892
00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Lately I've been doing a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and Jujitsu.</v>

893
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm really starting to love it to</v>

894
00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.770
<v Speaker 2>just Jujitsu will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

895
00:37:36.771 --> 00:37:38.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really starting to love Jujitsu and</v>

896
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu has been the art that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>neglected the most over my entire career</v>

897
00:37:43.001 --> 00:37:45.310
<v Speaker 2>and surprisingly I have the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>submissions in light heavyweight</v>

898
00:37:45.311 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

899
00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I think can Sha Kim shamrock is right</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind me with maybe five and I have</v>

900
00:37:50.951 --> 00:37:54.100
<v Speaker 2>six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken shamrock are frank,</v>

901
00:37:54.101 --> 00:37:55.750
<v Speaker 2>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the shamrock brothers are behind</v>

902
00:37:55.751 --> 00:37:58.720
<v Speaker 2>me for most submissions in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

903
00:37:58.721 --> 00:38:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Ken was never a light heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

904
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ken went to light heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fought Tito,</v>

905
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:06.510
<v Speaker 1>but in the early days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when he was,</v>

906
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.670
<v Speaker 1>he was a heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure someone could figure,</v>

907
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.890
<v Speaker 1>figured out is a light heavyweight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tito days.</v>

908
00:38:10.891 --> 00:38:12.060
<v Speaker 1>But that was ken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

909
00:38:12.061 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 1>later on in his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many submissions did frank have?</v>

910
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's frank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

911
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Keto Frank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the shamrock brothers are</v>

912
00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:23.540
<v Speaker 2>right behind me and some interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>legends.</v>

913
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Legends of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

914
00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:25.910
<v Speaker 2>pioneers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

915
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.410
<v Speaker 2>But now I love Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

916
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.660
<v Speaker 2>And will you bill for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

917
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.080
<v Speaker 2>These long arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

918
00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

919
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm becoming a joke man.</v>

920
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would assume that</v>

921
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 3>someone who is a professional mixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts fighter has to at least</v>

922
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:42.430
<v Speaker 3>maintain a maintenance level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>striking.</v>

923
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Constantly.</v>

924
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.380
<v Speaker 2>And my plan is to get back and I still</v>
<v Speaker 2>July still very far away</v>

925
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:51.100
<v Speaker 3>now when it's July.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that work when you're</v>

926
00:38:51.101 --> 00:38:51.960
<v Speaker 3>suspended?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

927
00:38:51.961 --> 00:38:53.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a question that I've always</v>

928
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 3>wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're suspended for ped or</v>

929
00:38:55.601 --> 00:38:58.870
<v Speaker 3>something along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you not supposed to train with other</v>

930
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:00.640
<v Speaker 3>fighters that are in the UFC or is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit?</v>

931
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:01.953
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

932
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard anything about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

933
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Because that sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

934
00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:06.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the train.</v>

935
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're trying to help</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

936
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be very therapeutic for someone</v>

937
00:39:10.801 --> 00:39:11.520
<v Speaker 3>who's on the outside</v>

938
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.680
<v Speaker 2>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time helping other</v>

939
00:39:13.681 --> 00:39:15.480
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that help you a lot when you're</v>

940
00:39:15.481 --> 00:39:19.410
<v Speaker 2>trying to get back into things and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of just someone in my house</v>

941
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:20.790
<v Speaker 2>studying their opponents?</v>

942
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

943
00:39:21.631 --> 00:39:25.640
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the best parts about MMA</v>
<v Speaker 3>and martial arts in general I think is</v>

944
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.593
<v Speaker 3>helping friends</v>

945
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:28.890
<v Speaker 2>given back something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's to me too,</v>

946
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.950
<v Speaker 2>because martial arts can be a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfish sport,</v>

947
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

948
00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:34.040
<v Speaker 2>it's a team sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

949
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're not putting yourself first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're not going to make it to</v>

950
00:39:37.401 --> 00:39:40.970
<v Speaker 2>certain levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been really selfish my entire</v>

951
00:39:40.971 --> 00:39:43.880
<v Speaker 2>career and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing my coaches have always</v>

952
00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.140
<v Speaker 2>gotten on me about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey John,</v>

953
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:47.360
<v Speaker 2>I know you live in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you got a family,</v>

954
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.660
<v Speaker 2>but you need to get back down here to</v>
<v Speaker 2>help these guys.</v>

955
00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.920
<v Speaker 2>They have a fight coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now that I live in Albuquerque,</v>

956
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:55.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly giving back and helping</v>
<v Speaker 2>other fighters,</v>

957
00:39:55.161 --> 00:39:58.340
<v Speaker 2>especially since I have all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspensions happen.</v>

958
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you surround yourself with too many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that liked to party?</v>

959
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You used to.</v>

960
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I used to for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

961
00:40:06.591 --> 00:40:11.420

<v Speaker 2>And when did you stop hanging out with</v>

962
00:40:11.421 --> 00:40:11.780
<v Speaker 2>these people?</v>

963
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.370
<v Speaker 2>With the car accident?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

964
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.130
<v Speaker 2>or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

965
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.860
<v Speaker 2>after the car accident when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I decided that it was going to be</v>

966
00:40:18.861 --> 00:40:20.510
<v Speaker 2>completely sober,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

967
00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I let loose a lot of friends and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy because,</v>

968

00:41:52.881 --> 00:41:55.360
<v Speaker 2>me to drink or anything and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1000
00:41:55.361 --> 00:41:56.550
<v Speaker 2>so they know I'm not going to.</v>

1001
00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.940
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>answering my phone call for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1007
00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:16.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kinda went into hiding for a</v>

1008
00:42:16.171 --> 00:42:17.530
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1009
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:22.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just stayed away from the scene until</v>

1010
00:42:22.901 --> 00:42:25.000
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was strong enough to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>not do it.</v>

1011
00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.410
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1012
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.410
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helped,</v>

1013
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.200
<v Speaker 2>it helped a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now do you ever go to bars now and</v>

1014
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:34.770
<v Speaker 2>order a water or anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1015
00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.261
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1016
00:42:35.261 --> 00:42:36.350
<v Speaker 2>I go out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1017
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll drink red bull,</v>

1018
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.241
<v Speaker 2>red bull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1019
00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a situation where a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are drinking.</v>

1020
00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I feel like I'm just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>chilling and like a little bit too</v>

1021
00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.600
<v Speaker 2>chilled out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like in order to like keep up with a</v>

1022
00:42:48.601 --> 00:42:50.550
<v Speaker 2>bunch of drunk people that are talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to drink red bull,</v>

1023
00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:51.453
<v Speaker 2>drink a red bull.</v>

1024
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Too many of those though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1025
00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.980
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's way better than just</v>

1026
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.770
<v Speaker 2>getting turned up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's funny because I,</v>

1027
00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.180
<v Speaker 2>I've developed this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1028
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:07.380
<v Speaker 2>this way of just having so much fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely sober where a lot of times</v>

1029
00:43:07.381 --> 00:43:09.000
<v Speaker 2>when I'm leaving like a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone be like,</v>

1030
00:43:09.001 --> 00:43:09.840
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you getting home?</v>

1031
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm like driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's great.</v>

1032
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I really do appreciate my sobriety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1033
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I know you were having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were saying you were having a</v>

1034
00:43:20.911 --> 00:43:22.700
<v Speaker 2>problem with pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1035
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1036
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

1037
00:43:24.031 --> 00:43:26.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been a stoner since high school.</v>

1038
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1039
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:34.210
<v Speaker 2>is that like stopping that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that as easy as stopping drinking or</v>

1040
00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:35.950
<v Speaker 2>is it a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was more difficult?</v>

1041
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.390
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1042
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:39.743
<v Speaker 4>s</v>

1043
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think stopping pot was really tough</v>

1044
00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:48.560
<v Speaker 2>because I literally didn't associate</v>
<v Speaker 2>with too many people who didn't smoke</v>

1045
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:52.550
<v Speaker 2>that that's the way I kind of like a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people in my own team.</v>

1046
00:43:52.551 --> 00:43:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hang out with them because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1047
00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of one of the hardest working</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys on the team,</v>

1048
00:43:57.091 --> 00:44:00.650
<v Speaker 2>but a little bit of a bad boy and none</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my teammates were really a bad board.</v>

1049
00:44:00.651 --> 00:44:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Meaning you smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being an.</v>

1050
00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I was just always down for a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1051
00:44:06.051 --> 00:44:08.540
<v Speaker 2>So I just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of my friends were people who</v>

1052
00:44:08.541 --> 00:44:11.450
<v Speaker 2>weren't martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had anything to do with martial arts and</v>

1053
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I would always kind of associate with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1054
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.950
<v Speaker 2>just just party people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who would like to have fun.</v>

1055
00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I realized once I quit smoking that I</v>

1056
00:44:19.431 --> 00:44:21.470
<v Speaker 2>really didn't know too many people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't smoke,</v>

1057
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.720
<v Speaker 2>so I had to kind of start</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with people who didn't</v>

1058
00:44:26.721 --> 00:44:27.930
<v Speaker 2>smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I kind of found,</v>

1059
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>boring.</v>

1060
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:32.803
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

1061
00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:38.340
<v Speaker 3>don't like to stare up at space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to go to the mountains</v>

1062
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:41.040
<v Speaker 3>and meditate well fucking cross legged</v>
<v Speaker 3>position</v>

1063
00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.840
<v Speaker 2>people who are just straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1064
00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.230
<v Speaker 2>we're always just straight and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had just,</v>

1065
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I had to find different activities to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1066
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.050
<v Speaker 2>because when you're hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't party,</v>

1067
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have certain ways that they have</v>

1068
00:44:55.811 --> 00:44:59.620
<v Speaker 2>fun and it's usually based around a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>more activities I feel like.</v>

1069
00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 2>So I got into mountain bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain biking and um,</v>

1070
00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:05.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jogging more fitness,</v>

1071
00:45:05.521 --> 00:45:07.420
<v Speaker 2>just laying on fitness and things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1072
00:45:07.421 --> 00:45:08.410
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1073
00:45:08.411 --> 00:45:13.411
<v Speaker 2>fitness is like my drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really love being strong and being</v>

1074
00:45:13.481 --> 00:45:17.200
<v Speaker 2>healthy and like I do mountain biking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jujitsu.</v>

1075
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of Jujitsu these days and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's Kinda like,</v>

1076
00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.980
<v Speaker 2>that's what I live for outside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

1077
00:45:23.981 --> 00:45:24.814
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

1078
00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.430
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds to me that you've done an</v>

1079
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:31.650
<v Speaker 3>audit of your life and you've looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the issues that you're,</v>

1081

<v Speaker 3>and you decided to not engage in them</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1082
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Have you write things down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you write goals down or,</v>

1083
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.830
<v Speaker 3>or things that you demand of yourself?</v>

1097
00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:15.660
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had to look through my phone,</v>

1098
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.260
<v Speaker 2>that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1099
00:46:18.261 --> 00:46:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I just write down a lot of reminders of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I stand for,</v>

1100
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:21.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>how I view things and yeah.</v>

1102
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:25.700
<v Speaker 2>But I do write things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Now when you look at the future and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see yourself from here on out,</v>

1104
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.910
<v Speaker 3>do you feel like from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1105
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:37.070
<v Speaker 3>from my time on this earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more drinking,</v>

1106
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 3>no more pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more partying.</v>

1107
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that I'll drink really</v>

1108
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.370
<v Speaker 2>advise as um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because I</v>

1109
00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.660
<v Speaker 2>coming out of high school I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking in high school and I always</v>

1110
00:46:49.661 --> 00:46:54.180
<v Speaker 2>felt like I needed alcohol to be cool or</v>
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>

1111
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:59.050
<v Speaker 2>put myself in certain situations to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to conquer anxiety or whatever.</v>

1112
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a part of the crowd and to have</v>

1113
00:47:02.831 --> 00:47:04.600
<v Speaker 2>fun and relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I always thought I needed alcohol and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1115
00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:11.650
<v Speaker 2>so I got to a point where I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go out and have a drink.</v>

1116
00:47:11.651 --> 00:47:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I would always get to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's getting crazy and things are</v>

1117
00:47:14.951 --> 00:47:15.940
<v Speaker 2>getting wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1118
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.530
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1119
00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.030
<v Speaker 2>I never really had the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop a healthy relationship with it.</v>

1120
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:25.330
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just went from high school to college</v>

1121
00:47:25.331 --> 00:47:30.331
<v Speaker 2>when you get even more to being famous</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being able afford to buy everybody</v>

1122
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:32.080
<v Speaker 2>drinks every night.</v>

1123
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1124
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.770
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my relationship with alcohol it,</v>

1125
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.310
<v Speaker 2>it became unhealthy and I never went</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a period of time where I,</v>

1126
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.560
<v Speaker 2>where I had a healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mature,</v>

1127
00:47:41.561 --> 00:47:44.530
<v Speaker 2>responsible relationship with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now being sober for so long,</v>

1128
00:47:44.531 --> 00:47:49.531
<v Speaker 2>I know that I can have one drink and</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel a little bit of a buzz and catch an</v>

1129
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:57.040
<v Speaker 2>uber home or whatnot or I know that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can go out and not have a drink at all</v>

1130
00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.940
<v Speaker 2>and be the life of the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that I can go out and not have a</v>

1131
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:04.750
<v Speaker 2>drink at all and approach someone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to someone with zero anxiety or</v>

1132
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 2>feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1133
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.371
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1134
00:48:06.371 --> 00:48:10.630
<v Speaker 2>I could sit amongst the group of drunk</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and know that I'm cool in my own</v>

1135
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:13.930
<v Speaker 2>skin just the way that I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something I never really had</v>

1136
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity to experience until now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1137
00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:19.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I feel like I'm in a mature enough</v>

1138
00:48:19.481 --> 00:48:20.520
<v Speaker 2>place where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1139
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.730
<v Speaker 2>if I wanted to have a drink in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future to celebrate a victory or</v>

1140
00:48:24.731 --> 00:48:27.490
<v Speaker 2>something like that or a glass of wine</v>
<v Speaker 2>at home with my fiance,</v>

1141
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I know that I could do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1142
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.160
<v Speaker 2>so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my relationship with it and it's</v>

1143
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:37.090
<v Speaker 2>completely changed and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that I could drink in the</v>

1144
00:48:37.091 --> 00:48:39.250
<v Speaker 2>future and not run into some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild,</v>

1145
00:48:39.251 --> 00:48:41.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crashing a Bentley into a pole.</v>

1146
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Stuff like that that I was doing before.</v>

1147
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.370
<v Speaker 1>When you say you believe you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1148
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.010
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of talking out of my ass here</v>

1149
00:48:48.011 --> 00:48:49.660
<v Speaker 1>because I've never had a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

1150
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.840
<v Speaker 1>But I know people that have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people that have had a problem</v>

1151
00:48:52.841 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 1>with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1152
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 1>the way they describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1153
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I go back,</v>

1154
00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:03.781
<v Speaker 1>I will go all the way that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing that alcohol does to you</v>

1155
00:49:04.601 --> 00:49:06.040
<v Speaker 1>where it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or drugs,</v>

1156
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just a little bit,</v>

1157
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:09.250
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit.</v>

1158
00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to get a little bit,</v>

1159
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:13.090
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little shot.</v>

1160
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Just a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little beer.</v>

1161
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 1>What's a beer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has a beer.</v>

1162
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's the siren song.</v>

1163
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:20.800
<v Speaker 1>That leads you back to the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

1164
00:49:20.801 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a problem with alcohol but I never</v>

1165
00:49:24.191 --> 00:49:25.000
<v Speaker 1>wanted to admit it.</v>

1166
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Like when you say you had a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have a physical problem?</v>

1167
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Like when you got it off the alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have withdrawals?</v>

1168
00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1169
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't waking up and drinking every</v>

1170
00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:36.880
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a psychological thing.</v>

1171
00:49:36.881 --> 00:49:37.540
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1172
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting hammered on the weekends.</v>

1173
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1174
00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't waking up in and like I didn't</v>

1175
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:46.750
<v Speaker 1>need alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always said to myself,</v>

1176
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when you run into a pregnant</v>

1177
00:49:52.121 --> 00:49:53.950
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a panel of alcohol.</v>

1178
00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:57.730
<v Speaker 1>The day that something affects you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first Gwi you know,</v>

1179
00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:00.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't thinking straight.</v>

1180
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Something was caused you to not think</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and it was your actions and</v>

1181
00:50:04.061 --> 00:50:06.340
<v Speaker 1>what you chose to take into your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you said,</v>

1182
00:50:06.341 --> 00:50:07.360
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with that,</v>

1183
00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:09.250
<v Speaker 1>but you feel like you could get back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1184
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm.</v>

1185
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I feel like alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1186
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.650
<v Speaker 2>was never really like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never really addicted to alcohol,</v>

1187
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 2>was addicted to 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just really enjoyed partying a lot and</v>

1188
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I made a lot of bad decisions with</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol,</v>

1189
00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:24.430
<v Speaker 2>so now I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really have had the time to see</v>

1190
00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:28.970
<v Speaker 2>clearly</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I went run with alcohol.</v>

1191
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Obviously again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a public figure,</v>

1192
00:50:30.921 --> 00:50:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I live in a small town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never needed to be getting blacked out</v>

1193
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:38.120
<v Speaker 2>in public again anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just something that I look back and</v>

1194
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:39.230
<v Speaker 2>I hear stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My boys were like,</v>

1195
00:50:39.231 --> 00:50:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember the time you do this?</v>

1196
00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

1197
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I used to get blacked out in public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks a little bit in this small town</v>

1198
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:49.970
<v Speaker 2>that I live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like.</v>

1199
00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1200
00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 2>I've had a lot of times they evaluate</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana actually is something that I</v>

1201
00:50:55.761 --> 00:50:57.790
<v Speaker 2>don't think I want to go back to really</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1202
00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I want to go back to and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel like you have an unhealthy</v>

1203
00:51:00.651 --> 00:51:03.240
<v Speaker 2>relationship or had an unhealthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with marijuana.</v>

1204
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.071
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I re,</v>

1205
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was smoking way too much pot.</v>

1206
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.410
<v Speaker 2>I was poking way too much pie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally breakfast,</v>

1207
00:51:09.411 --> 00:51:13.940
<v Speaker 2>lunch and dinner in between workouts to</v>
<v Speaker 2>study film to do everything.</v>

1208
00:51:13.941 --> 00:51:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just in it for me.</v>

1209
00:51:16.251 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 2>There's some functional smokers who can</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up and they have eight things</v>

1210
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:22.370
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do that day and they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>all eight things like me.</v>

1211
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I would wake up and I had eight things I</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to do that day and I'd be like,</v>

1212
00:51:25.661 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got three of them done today.</v>

1213
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm good with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>

1214
00:51:29.501 --> 00:51:30.291
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1215
00:51:30.291 --> 00:51:33.170
<v Speaker 2>it slowed me down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow me down and now that I haven't been</v>

1216
00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 2>spoken to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel a lot better.</v>

1217
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.400
<v Speaker 2>I feel a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel um,</v>

1218
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I feel more on my game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel sharper sparking up a joint right</v>

1219
00:51:42.711 --> 00:51:44.640
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead and saying.</v>

1220
00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I know it's probably hard for you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear it.</v>

1221
00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:48.980
<v Speaker 2>I know this fairly well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1222
00:51:48.981 --> 00:51:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean honestly everybody differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely does.</v>

1223
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.210
<v Speaker 2>It absolutely does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's important.</v>

1224
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Sodas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>red bull and so does alcohol and so does</v>

1225
00:51:55.321 --> 00:51:55.800
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>

1226
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1227
00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:58.770
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all day every day for me.</v>

1228
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:00.450
<v Speaker 3>But do you think that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1229
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:03.720
<v Speaker 3>was it all day every day because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were looking for an escape or was it all</v>

1230
00:52:03.721 --> 00:52:06.280
<v Speaker 3>day every day because it had formed a</v>
<v Speaker 3>habit and you just,</v>

1231
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.650
<v Speaker 3>that's what you were used to doing.</v>

1232
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.470
<v Speaker 2>It became a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just became a way of life.</v>

1233
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:10.850
<v Speaker 2>It became a way of life for me.</v>

1234
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.880
<v Speaker 3>When you're dealing with the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress and just the amount of pressure</v>

1235
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:19.390
<v Speaker 3>is probably a better word of being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1236
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.430
<v Speaker 3>one of the great fighters of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1237
00:52:22.431 --> 00:52:26.300
<v Speaker 3>you're without a doubt one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters that's ever fought in mma and</v>

1238
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.530
<v Speaker 3>there's so many eyes on you and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much pressure and there's so much</v>

1239
00:52:30.531 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 3>money involved and accolades and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these different things.</v>

1240
00:52:33.171 --> 00:52:34.004
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1245
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like it's almost like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>had set yourself up in a position where</v>

1246
00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:55.190
<v Speaker 3>you needed like some escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You needed an escape valve and that's</v>

1247
00:52:55.191 --> 00:52:58.250
<v Speaker 3>what you had found through the drinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's you had found through the pot.</v>

1248
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:02.300
<v Speaker 3>You'd found these ways where you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>not be Jon Jones for awhile.</v>

1249
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.090
<v Speaker 3>We could be the blacked out dude at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bar.</v>

1250
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.090
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden you feel normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1251
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.930
<v Speaker 3>normal as normal as you can feel by</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a 20 whatever year old millionaire</v>

1252
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.280
<v Speaker 3>fucking throwing shots around and</v>
<v Speaker 3>albuquerque the,</v>

1253
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:20.330
<v Speaker 3>you would found a valve to release you</v>
<v Speaker 3>from some of the intense pressure of</v>

1254
00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:23.480
<v Speaker 3>being one of the baddest motherfuckers</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the planet.</v>

1255
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1256
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

1257
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1258
00:53:26.461 --> 00:53:28.700
<v Speaker 2>It definitely made you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1259
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:31.860
<v Speaker 2>for those moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hands away from you.</v>

1260
00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 2>She just blocking the microphone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1261
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.261
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1262
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do agree that it is for those moments</v>

1263
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:46.980
<v Speaker 2>made me kind of feel</v>

1264

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1265

<v Speaker 2>normal like normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1266
00:53:52.311 --> 00:53:53.840
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially the bar thing,</v>

1267
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:57.410
<v Speaker 2>especially the bar thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going out and just having a good</v>

1268
00:53:57.411 --> 00:53:59.070
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes I,</v>

1269
00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I forgot that I was a celebrity and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of eyes on me and,</v>

1270
00:54:03.621 --> 00:54:05.360
<v Speaker 2>but for those moments I felt like I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1271
00:54:05.361 --> 00:54:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I think I was one of my biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1272
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I felt as if I was amongst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really hold myself to a higher</v>

1273
00:54:10.731 --> 00:54:12.920
<v Speaker 2>standard because of who I was and what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1274
00:54:12.921 --> 00:54:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1275
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.110
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even to this day,</v>

1276
00:54:15.111 --> 00:54:17.600
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like I'm one of the guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where you are.</v>

1277
00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In one of the guys like,</v>

1278
00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:19.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't try,</v>

1279
00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't really seek hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>other celebrities.</v>

1280
00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:26.390
<v Speaker 2>All my friends are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just normal average joe guys.</v>

1281
00:54:26.391 --> 00:54:27.410
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1282
00:54:27.411 --> 00:54:30.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back when I used to party,</v>

1283
00:54:30.131 --> 00:54:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I used to feel like that was me just not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being John Bones Jones and just being</v>

1284
00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:38.590
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just doing the wild shit that</v>

1285
00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.200
<v Speaker 2>everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when something bad happens,</v>

1286
00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're quickly reminded that</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of people around the world know</v>

1287
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:47.710
<v Speaker 2>exactly who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>

1288
00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:49.043
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1289
00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:51.440
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a two edge sword too because the</v>

1290
00:54:51.441 --> 00:54:55.430
<v Speaker 3>people that get completely lost in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that they are this unique and</v>

1291
00:54:55.431 --> 00:54:58.130
<v Speaker 3>special person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eliminate yourself from all those</v>

1292
00:54:58.131 --> 00:55:00.750
<v Speaker 3>other folks and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you separate yourself and that's</v>

1293
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:05.210
<v Speaker 3>extremely hard to relate and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of celebrities that go into a shell</v>

1294
00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.910
<v Speaker 3>and everywhere they go they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>security that takes him places and</v>

1295
00:55:07.911 --> 00:55:09.480
<v Speaker 3>they'd get delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a,</v>

1296
00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:13.460
<v Speaker 3>they have a completely distorted</v>
<v Speaker 3>perception of how people interact with</v>

1297
00:55:13.461 --> 00:55:15.320
<v Speaker 3>them because they don't just go hang</v>
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>

1298
00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:15.981
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1299
00:55:15.981 --> 00:55:17.180
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely not me.</v>

1300
00:55:17.181 --> 00:55:17.841
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1301
00:55:17.841 --> 00:55:20.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meet a lot of people and people say,</v>

1302
00:55:20.271 --> 00:55:22.310
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just don't act like you don't have</v>

1303
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:23.600
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

1304
00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I like,</v>

1305
00:55:26.211 --> 00:55:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I really have a lot of pride and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what,</v>

1306
00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.310
<v Speaker 2>like just normal shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going to places that most people,</v>

1307
00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:35.420
<v Speaker 2>even fighters in Albuquerque,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't don't go just being amongst</v>

1308
00:55:35.421 --> 00:55:36.770
<v Speaker 2>the people and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1309
00:55:36.771 --> 00:55:41.771
<v Speaker 2>I think a big part of me long to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of just be not famous sometimes.</v>

1310
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Now my question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why I asked you that as,</v>

1311
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:48.320
<v Speaker 3>how do you plan on handling that now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're not going to be</v>

1312
00:55:48.321 --> 00:55:50.540
<v Speaker 3>drinking and you're not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking pot and you're,</v>

1313
00:55:50.541 --> 00:55:53.800
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to mean right now you're</v>

1314
00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:58.580
<v Speaker 3>living life has just Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person and happy with your family</v>

1315
00:55:58.581 --> 00:56:01.640
<v Speaker 3>and happy with your life and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>working out and having a good time doing</v>

1316
00:56:01.641 --> 00:56:04.580
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but eventually everything's going to</v>

1317
00:56:04.581 --> 00:56:07.130
<v Speaker 3>ramp back up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Media obligations going to ramp back up</v>

1318
00:56:07.131 --> 00:56:09.890
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these things are gonna happen and</v>

1319
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:11.690
<v Speaker 3>the pressure is going to be back on you</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1320
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.990
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to use as an escape</v>
<v Speaker 3>valve then?</v>

1321
00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.173
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

1322
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Have you considered that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1323
00:56:18.561 --> 00:56:19.650
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1324
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:21.380
<v Speaker 2>That's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

1325
00:56:21.381 --> 00:56:24.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've matured in a way where,</v>

1326
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:27.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it will affect me the way</v>

1327
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:30.190
<v Speaker 2>it used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really had the opportunity to step</v>

1328
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:33.820
<v Speaker 2>away from it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized what I had and who I am,</v>

1329
00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:36.610
<v Speaker 2>what I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1330
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:43.060
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel above what used to be.</v>

1331
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel above the way.</v>

1332
00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:49.560
<v Speaker 2>I used to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>let so much consuming.</v>

1333
00:56:49.561 --> 00:56:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Like even right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1334
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says just so hard to explain it.</v>

1335
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like I'm in the same.</v>

1336
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like I look at things the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

1337
00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you don't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that when</v>

1366

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a lot of people saying that.</v>

1367
00:58:08.331 --> 00:58:09.164
<v Speaker 3>People that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:11.750
<v Speaker 3>I like said that and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1369
00:58:11.751 --> 00:58:12.770
<v Speaker 3>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an idiot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's a pause going on,</v>

1372
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:21.430
<v Speaker 2>but as far as it being all over or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is just so far.</v>

1373
00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:22.643
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

1374
00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:25.530
<v Speaker 3>do you fall boxing a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit?</v>

1375
00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernard Hopkins Story?</v>

1376
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.920
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernard Hopkins,</v>

1377
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:30.720
<v Speaker 3>one of the greatest boxer of all time</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1378
00:58:30.721 --> 00:58:33.150
<v Speaker 3>And he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll fight December 17th for his last</v>

1379
00:58:33.151 --> 00:58:36.690
<v Speaker 3>fight at 51 years old because he's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn defensive wizard.</v>

1380
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:39.780
<v Speaker 3>He's still does commentary for Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still sharp as a tack,</v>

1381
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:45.350
<v Speaker 3>but Bernard Hopkins went to jail and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he decided when he went to jail,</v>

1382
00:58:45.451 --> 00:58:49.290
<v Speaker 3>when he was young man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he decided that from that point on he</v>

1383
00:58:49.291 --> 00:58:52.320
<v Speaker 3>was going to be disciplined and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no more bullshit and his life,</v>

1384
00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:57.390
<v Speaker 3>no more robbery or assault or any of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that got him into the position.</v>

1385
00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in and then he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>dedicate his life to being a world</v>

1386
00:59:00.151 --> 00:59:03.270
<v Speaker 3>champion boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from that point on,</v>

1387
00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:06.240
<v Speaker 3>he became one of the most disciplined</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxers ever.</v>

1388
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Never ate bad food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never drank,</v>

1389
00:59:08.401 --> 00:59:10.680
<v Speaker 3>never did anything stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always was in shape.</v>

1390
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.350
<v Speaker 3>And we'll go down in history as one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the all time greats,</v>

1391
00:59:13.351 --> 00:59:18.351
<v Speaker 3>guaranteed shoeing hall of Famer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like Bernard Hopkins was</v>

1392
00:59:18.481 --> 00:59:22.580
<v Speaker 3>created by the darkest moment of him</v>
<v Speaker 3>being and him doing time in jail.</v>

1393
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.110
<v Speaker 3>And when he came out of that jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first things that I'm.</v>

1394
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:29.300
<v Speaker 3>One of the corrections officers said to</v>
<v Speaker 3>him was,</v>

1395
00:59:29.301 --> 00:59:31.520
<v Speaker 3>you'll be back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

1396
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:35.240
<v Speaker 3>he used that as fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he knew that like,</v>

1397
00:59:35.241 --> 00:59:37.820
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking way I'm going to look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that dude again.</v>

1398
00:59:37.821 --> 00:59:40.160
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way he's right.</v>

1399
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately Bernard Hopkins escaped</v>

1400
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:46.970
<v Speaker 3>his demons by facing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by being in hell.</v>

1401
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:48.950
<v Speaker 3>But being in hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was in jail for,</v>

1402
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:52.040
<v Speaker 3>I forget how many years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just enough,</v>

1403
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:57.100
<v Speaker 3>just enough to cement and his eyes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardened him to the fact that what he</v>

1404
00:59:57.231 --> 00:59:59.750
<v Speaker 3>needed was discipline and control over</v>
<v Speaker 3>his own destiny.</v>

1405
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:04.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think that for a guy like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take all those dark moments that</v>

1406
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:08.000
<v Speaker 3>you've experienced over the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think about it,</v>

1407
01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:09.380
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got away pretty light.</v>

1408
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.510
<v Speaker 3>That girl could have died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1409
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.630
<v Speaker 3>a horrible things could have happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you were drunk driving when you</v>

1410
01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:16.610
<v Speaker 3>slammed into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Bentley into the truth.</v>

1411
01:00:16.611 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Although all these terrible things could</v>
<v Speaker 3>have gone wrong that you kind of got</v>

1412
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:21.610
<v Speaker 3>away with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kind of mean you.</v>

1413
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:22.640
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1414
01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to think that someone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking out for you,</v>

1415
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:27.710
<v Speaker 3>you've got all the evidence in the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that points to someone actually looking</v>

1416
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 3>out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great for sure.</v>

1417
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Something out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's luck or whether it's</v>

1418
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 3>intention or whether it's God or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

1419
01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:39.140
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the bottom line is right now at</v>

1420
01:00:39.141 --> 01:00:42.260
<v Speaker 3>this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are still in your athletic prime.</v>

1421
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.950
<v Speaker 3>You're still only six months away from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>

1422
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:46.940
<v Speaker 3>When is your suspension?</v>
<v Speaker 3>About eight months,</v>

1423
01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.280
<v Speaker 3>eight months away from our suspension</v>
<v Speaker 3>being released.</v>

1424
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:53.180
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all a great thing.</v>

1425
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Speaker 3>How old are you now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're 30,</v>

1426
01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.520
<v Speaker 3>29,</v>
<v Speaker 3>29 be when?</v>

1427
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:57.850
<v Speaker 3>When's your birthday?</v>
<v Speaker 3>July notice.</v>

1428
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:59.660
<v Speaker 3>So you'd be 30 when you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1429
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.510
<v Speaker 3>20 nights though would prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's you.</v>

1430
01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:04.280
<v Speaker 3>That's you at your best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really,</v>

1431
01:01:04.281 --> 01:01:05.660
<v Speaker 3>your prime is like 32.</v>

1432
01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.260
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1433
01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.060
<v Speaker 2>I put the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put the Jordan,</v>

1434
01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.720
<v Speaker 2>the Jordan crying face as my twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

1435
01:01:15.721 --> 01:01:16.554
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that?</v>

1436
01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:22.300
<v Speaker 3>I put that up with you with the belt on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jordan phase.</v>

1437
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.370
<v Speaker 3>The reason why</v>

1438
01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:29.340
<v Speaker 2>that up is because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because,</v>

1439
01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:34.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that right now I'm in a position</v>

1440
01:01:34.201 --> 01:01:36.810
<v Speaker 2>to do some magnificent and extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1441
01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1442
01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:40.560
<v Speaker 2>I know that because I've made so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistakes,</v>

1443
01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I make the perfect role model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make the perfect person to,</v>

1444
01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.650
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1445
01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.000
<v Speaker 2>to still be able to inspire millions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1446
01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:56.010
<v Speaker 2>There's very few people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are perfect and flawless and just</v>

1447
01:01:56.011 --> 01:01:57.900
<v Speaker 2>that clean cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never did anything wrong.</v>

1448
01:01:57.901 --> 01:02:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Athlete a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's way more people who are like me</v>

1449
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:07.560
<v Speaker 2>who has struggled with drugs or just</v>
<v Speaker 2>being an idiot or just doing wild shit</v>

1450
01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.530
<v Speaker 2>way more people who have lived their</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents don't let their families down.</v>

1451
01:02:10.531 --> 01:02:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Let their friends don't let themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1452
01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because,</v>

1453
01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:17.600
<v Speaker 2>because I've made so many mistakes on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1454
01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 2>on such a public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1455
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.850
<v Speaker 2>such a big scale and so public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1456
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I feel like all the great things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do from here on out,</v>

1457
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:28.630
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be that much greater</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of where it came from to,</v>

1458
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.420
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm,</v>

1459
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel like my best is yet to come and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

1460
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.420
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm in a position to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to really touch a lot of people and</v>

1461
01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:41.640
<v Speaker 2>inspire a lot of people because of where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came from.</v>

1462
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:43.770
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1463
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.540
<v Speaker 3>is that something you concentrate on</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than you constantly mean?</v>

1464
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Do you concentrate on that as much as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you concentrate on just doing it for</v>

1465
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:51.340
<v Speaker 3>yourself?</v>

1466
01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want it for doing it for other</v>

1467
01:02:53.721 --> 01:02:54.980
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1468
01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.610
<v Speaker 2>motivates me probably more than doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for myself.</v>

1469
01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

1470
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:03.450
<v Speaker 3>Is that from all of the accolades that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've received from all the fans</v>

1471
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.510
<v Speaker 3>realize that you have all this love out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there from all these people?</v>

1472
01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1473
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like I don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need it anymore.</v>

1474
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.180
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1475
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've done everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

1476
01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I've been in all the wildest situations</v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

1477
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I've had all the craziest experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed at the nicest hotels.</v>

1478
01:03:21.061 --> 01:03:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the world of eight at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nicest rest.</v>

1479
01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Like there's nothing else that I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>need out of this,</v>

1480
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this thing.</v>

1481
01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I've literally been there and done that</v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

1482
01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:31.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1483
01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm,</v>

1484
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like ultimately I've already</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten so much out of this sport and</v>

1485
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:44.010
<v Speaker 2>what I need to do is to truly get</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1486
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:46.500
<v Speaker 2>What I really need is to know that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing lives.</v>

1487
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Like that motivates me more than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than anything else right now.</v>

1488
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the legacy.</v>

1489
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.020
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the reason why I put that laugh in</v>

1490
01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.290
<v Speaker 2>meme up is because I'm laughing at my</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain and my struggle is right now I'm</v>

1491
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:05.100
<v Speaker 2>laughing at what I'm going through right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now because I know my future is just so</v>

1492
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.830
<v Speaker 2>incredibly bright and I know the impact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have.</v>

1493
01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I know I know what I can do and what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do it.</v>

1494
01:04:14.161 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Like right now I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a waiting period where I have to</v>

1495
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:20.840
<v Speaker 2>wait before I can show the world what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually capable of,</v>

1496
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 2>what I can be and what I'm going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>for someone else one day.</v>

1497
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also laughing at like people</v>

1498
01:04:28.801 --> 01:04:31.380
<v Speaker 2>who actually think that I'm out down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1499
01:04:31.381 --> 01:04:34.820
<v Speaker 2>like people who actually think that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>story is over or you know,</v>

1500
01:04:34.821 --> 01:04:38.580
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just laughing at it all because what</v>

1501
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I have done is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some athletes come back from</v>

1502
01:04:42.781 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 2>way worse stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape charges and murder and attempted</v>

1503
01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:47.640
<v Speaker 2>murder and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Didn't blockers that a lot of people</v>

1558
01:07:08.861 --> 01:07:11.500
<v Speaker 1>associate with people who take steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People take steroids,</v>

1559
01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:14.950
<v Speaker 1>they want to restart their system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you want a testosterone boost,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you take clomid or clomiphene and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1561

<v Speaker 2>So I took a,</v>

1565

<v Speaker 2>brand.</v>

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:37.490

<v Speaker 2>We don't have the resources to get it</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1605
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get a lot of stuff from China.</v>

1606
01:09:06.091 --> 01:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what happened with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson.</v>

1607
01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Anderson got liquid cialis from China</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was tainted.</v>

1608
01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens.</v>

1609
01:09:13.171 --> 01:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I know for a fact that everyone knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a fact that happens.</v>

1610
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>The supplement industry has a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with the people that mix the</v>

1611
01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you have a VAT and you're mixing</v>

1612
01:09:22.921 --> 01:09:25.620
<v Speaker 1>up whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatine or something like that and</v>

1613
01:09:25.621 --> 01:09:26.401
<v Speaker 1>right before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1614
01:09:26.401 --> 01:09:30.030
<v Speaker 1>if this is done in some country or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>place that doesn't have excellent</v>

1615
01:09:30.031 --> 01:09:31.770
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not scrupulous.</v>

1616
01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>You could have been scooping up steroids</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the batch before that and you just</v>

1617
01:09:35.791 --> 01:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>throw the creatine in it and some of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets contaminated and they don't clean</v>

1618
01:09:39.121 --> 01:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1619

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.090
<v Speaker 2>the level of hurt and just and</v>
<v Speaker 2>confusion.</v>

1652
01:10:53.091 --> 01:10:56.690
<v Speaker 2>And I literally had an anxiety attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had never had one of those before.</v>

1653
01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:00.260
<v Speaker 2>What does that feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like the whole room just came in</v>

1654
01:11:00.261 --> 01:11:03.080
<v Speaker 2>on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the whole room came down on me and</v>

1655
01:11:03.081 --> 01:11:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't breathe.</v>

1656
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:08.270
<v Speaker 2>I remember opening up his hotel window</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for a balcony.</v>

1657
01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:12.290
<v Speaker 2>So I could just breathe and realize that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like not trapped.</v>

1658
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's was literally the window opened</v>

1659
01:11:16.661 --> 01:11:17.291
<v Speaker 2>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1660
01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:20.860
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't drop out my hotel in Vegas</v>

1661
01:11:20.861 --> 01:11:23.620
<v Speaker 2>where it was in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking brick and I'm breathing.</v>

1662
01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.200
<v Speaker 2>They don't want gamblers leaping through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the banking.</v>

1663
01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm breathing through the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm myself down.</v>

1664
01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:32.970
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I instantly started thinking about</v>

1665
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 2>the weight of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the weight of the world literally</v>

1666
01:11:35.401 --> 01:11:38.150
<v Speaker 2>on my back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that I knew that I wasn't going</v>

1667
01:11:38.151 --> 01:11:40.470
<v Speaker 2>to be fighting a few hours before</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else knew,</v>

1668
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:43.800
<v Speaker 2>the public knew and I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could already start hearing</v>

1669
01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.600
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even my own coaches,</v>

1670
01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:49.410
<v Speaker 2>we looking at me like just their hearts</v>
<v Speaker 2>were on the floor.</v>

1671
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Like I had done so much to get back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting at UFC 200.</v>

1672
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 2>Like getting my life in order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the people around me in order to</v>

1673
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:00.780
<v Speaker 2>get in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my health,</v>

1674
01:12:00.781 --> 01:12:02.340
<v Speaker 2>my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1675
01:12:02.341 --> 01:12:05.220
<v Speaker 2>just being in order to beat DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1676
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:09.690
<v Speaker 2>and like literally right now I've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

1677
01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.980
<v Speaker 2>So much of the right things to be back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a good position and right now you</v>

1678
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.660
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people look at me as if I still don't</v>

1679
01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:19.320
<v Speaker 2>have my shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the only thing that I did was I took</v>

1680
01:12:19.321 --> 01:12:23.830
<v Speaker 2>a pill that I thought was gonna get me a</v>
<v Speaker 2>boner and it literally,</v>

1681
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:28.910
<v Speaker 2>it's caused me a lot of heartache and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of disappointment and a lot of them</v>

1682
01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.700
<v Speaker 2>threw me back here in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

1683
01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.010
<v Speaker 2>When someone gives you this pill and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know where it came from,</v>

1684
01:12:34.011 --> 01:12:35.750
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think,</v>

1685
01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.040
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's in this.</v>

1686

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

1687
01:12:38.361 --> 01:12:40.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think of it because I'm,</v>

1688
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I had been dealing with the athletic</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>

1689
01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:47.700
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the UFC for a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've taken a little gas station Dick</v>

1695
01:12:56.631 --> 01:12:59.120

<v Speaker 2>you're doing sketchy shit.</v>

1733
01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Like if I go to La for the weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a little sad to know that I'm in</v>

1734
01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:38.170
<v Speaker 2>La because they test me at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing I really knew</v>

1735
01:14:38.171 --> 01:14:40.420
<v Speaker 2>about Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

1736
01:14:40.421 --> 01:14:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Doing something that I had done several</v>
<v Speaker 2>times before,</v>

1737
01:14:42.441 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 2>it could ultimately lose me a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm.</v>

1738
01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:50.590
<v Speaker 2>The only difference was I had taken like</v>
<v Speaker 2>little gas station pills and I've taken</v>

1739
01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.330
<v Speaker 2>by Agora before this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this teammate gave me something that was</v>

1740
01:14:54.331 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Seattle is I thought the only thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would do is make me bigger and</v>

1741
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:02.200
<v Speaker 2>stronger for longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all I thought was going to be</v>

1742
01:15:02.201 --> 01:15:05.230
<v Speaker 2>happening and then when I find out that</v>

1743
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:09.590
<v Speaker 1>that I just felt that drug test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that via Viagra is actually</v>

1744
01:15:09.591 --> 01:15:12.110
<v Speaker 1>illegal in the Olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1745
01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>You can't take that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Viagra is a performance enhancer</v>

1746
01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.533
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a vassal.</v>

1747
01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Dilate or I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's how they describe it</v>

1748
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:24.830
<v Speaker 1>and it actually has athletic performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing product properties to it.</v>

1749
01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:26.060
<v Speaker 1>How does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does it help you?</v>

1750
01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:27.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to look into that,</v>

1751
01:15:27.681 --> 01:15:31.570
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's similar to in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to nitric oxide supplement,</v>

1752
01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:33.830
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pre workout and get your.</v>

1753
01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1754
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:38.440
<v Speaker 1>It does something to open up your blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells and get you pumped.</v>

1755
01:15:38.441 --> 01:15:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does something not just to your Dick</v>

1756
01:15:40.221 --> 01:15:42.710
<v Speaker 1>but to all of your muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:45.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would want it to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumped up during a fight.</v>

1758
01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it works that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1759
01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:50.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it actually can possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially help endurance.</v>

1760
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:52.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1761
01:15:52.611 --> 01:15:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that athletes take it for</v>

1762
01:15:54.681 --> 01:15:56.360
<v Speaker 1>that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's banned from the</v>

1763
01:15:56.361 --> 01:15:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Olympics.</v>

1764
01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1765
01:15:58.001 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1766
01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1767
01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I understand that it wasn't your</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention.</v>

1768
01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:04.320
<v Speaker 1>It was not my intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no,</v>

1769
01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I had no clue that I needed to report</v>
<v Speaker 1>this to the side of because I thought,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally I was report and everything</v>

<v Speaker 1>how'd you narrow it down to this pill?</v>

1777
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through my supplements and I,</v>

1778
01:16:26.661 --> 01:16:28.700

1796
01:17:08.161 --> 01:17:10.030
<v Speaker 1>We found out about that said John</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsored</v>

1797
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.080
<v Speaker 2>by Gat Nutrition.</v>

<v Speaker 2>let's check that out.</v>

1799
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Get nutrition to some fucking dude is</v>

<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great products.</v>

1801
01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:21.710
<v Speaker 2>If you want to get bigger and stronger</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you can definitely go to them,</v>

1802
01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:23.660
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as we saw that,</v>

1803
01:17:23.661 --> 01:17:25.800
<v Speaker 2>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the holy fuck is he taking?</v>

1804
01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1805
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:29.520
<v Speaker 2>but people saw you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got gigantic.</v>

1806
01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That radically,</v>

1807
01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:32.590
<v Speaker 2>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1808
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:35.180
<v Speaker 2>completely natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I have great pride in</v>

1809
01:17:35.181 --> 01:17:36.880
<v Speaker 2>being the natural athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1810
01:17:36.881 --> 01:17:38.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1811
01:17:38.801 --> 01:17:40.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they got,</v>

1812
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:43.450
<v Speaker 2>they got all the cat stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>test it and clear,</v>

1813
01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.650
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything was clear.</v>

1814
01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gets to have other things that you</v>

1815
01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:50.320
<v Speaker 2>don't regulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1816
01:17:50.321 --> 01:17:53.840
<v Speaker 2>But the things that they gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were super smart about and uh,</v>

1817
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.740
<v Speaker 2>out in all the products I was clear and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1818
01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.790
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my managers,</v>

1819
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.240
<v Speaker 2>I think outside of the box did you take</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that could have possibly been?</v>

1820
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:05.800
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1821
01:18:05.801 --> 01:18:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1822
01:18:06.971 --> 01:18:09.730
<v Speaker 2>one of my teammates did give me this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dick pill.</v>

1823
01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.950
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need those.</v>

1824
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.370
<v Speaker 2>So we got those pills tested and sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

1825
01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.233
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1826
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:21.340
<v Speaker 2>in their ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they listed about five products in their</v>

1827
01:18:21.341 --> 01:18:26.341
<v Speaker 2>ingredients and they actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually seven products too that</v>

1828
01:18:28.571 --> 01:18:32.200
<v Speaker 2>weren't listed in the ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two estrogen blockers were never in</v>

1829
01:18:32.201 --> 01:18:33.390
<v Speaker 2>their ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1830
01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.240
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1831
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:37.630
<v Speaker 2>it was a tainted pill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1832
01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Say what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1833
01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:40.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1834
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:45.400
<v Speaker 2>so the you cited was able to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1835
01:18:45.401 --> 01:18:47.160
<v Speaker 2>this was totally inattention and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

1836
01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:52.740
<v Speaker 2>No way in Hell I'm John would take these</v>
<v Speaker 2>estrogen blockers on purpose.</v>

1837
01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:55.780
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very small traces,</v>

1838
01:18:55.781 --> 01:18:59.900
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't like I was loaded up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>estrogen blockers and um,</v>

1839
01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.070
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck would they put estrogen</v>
<v Speaker 2>blockers and a pill?</v>

1840
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:06.910
<v Speaker 2>We believe that the factory that created</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1841
01:19:06.911 --> 01:19:09.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these dick pills were maybe</v>

1842
01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:12.430
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing these pills in a dirty</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory,</v>

1843
01:19:12.431 --> 01:19:14.920
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were just tainted.</v>

1844
01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because each pill that we,</v>

1845
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:21.340
<v Speaker 2>that we had tested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them had more estrogen blockers,</v>

1846
01:19:21.341 --> 01:19:24.430
<v Speaker 2>some had almost no estrogen blockers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some head small traces.</v>

1847
01:19:24.431 --> 01:19:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Actually none of the pills were</v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent.</v>

1848
01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:27.900
<v Speaker 2>So it was obvious that it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

1849
01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.180
<v Speaker 2>we tested several different packages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was obviously that,</v>

1850
01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:35.140
<v Speaker 2>that these pills were probably getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>made in the same machine and there was</v>

1851
01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:39.190
<v Speaker 2>just traces a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is enough to show up in your</v>

1852
01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:42.760
<v Speaker 2>system when you get at some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>dick pills that had none.</v>

1853
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.530
<v Speaker 2>No estrogen blockers and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1854
01:19:44.531 --> 01:19:45.910
<v Speaker 2>why didn't I get that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1855
01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:47.300
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1856
01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I took one that was just contaminated</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough and literally I got tested two</v>

1857
01:19:50.681 --> 01:19:54.400
<v Speaker 2>days later and it was in my system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was,</v>

1858
01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.120
<v Speaker 2>it was obvious that it was complete</v>
<v Speaker 2>accident and even,</v>

1859
01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.300
<v Speaker 2>and even if I would have reported the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deq pill to Usada,</v>

1860
01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.930
<v Speaker 2>they would have read the label and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>label would have never said that it was</v>

1861
01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:07.440
<v Speaker 2>estrogen blocker in there and I still</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have had a dirty.</v>

1862
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.633
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1863
01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 1>That attainment contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that leave you?</v>

1864
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:15.180
<v Speaker 1>How much time did they suspend you for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got suspended for a year back from</v>

1865
01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:18.540
<v Speaker 1>starting from back in July.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I fight in July of two subs.</v>

1866
01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what they're doing.</v>

1867
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with things like that.</v>

1868
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Because what you took does not enhance</v>
<v Speaker 1>your performance?</v>

1869
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:27.803
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

1870
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Especially in such a trace amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like in certain circumstances,</v>

1871
01:20:32.491 --> 01:20:35.010
<v Speaker 1>like there's been several fighters like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez,</v>

1872
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.940
<v Speaker 1>he has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he has eczema and he was</v>

1873
01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:42.550
<v Speaker 1>taking an Eczema cream that had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a.</v>

1874
01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:45.990
<v Speaker 1>was it a hormone precursor or a hormone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peptide,</v>

1875
01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a hormone,</v>

1876
01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:54.111
<v Speaker 1>peptide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that enhances the use of this</v>

1877
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.000
<v Speaker 1>cream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1878
01:20:56.001 --> 01:20:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously not a doctor or a</v>

1879
01:20:58.801 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about suspending</v>

1880
01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.440
<v Speaker 1>someone for something like that.</v>

1881
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:06.350
<v Speaker 1>That seems ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1882
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.240
<v Speaker 1>in my situation they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they</v>

1883
01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:13.380
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evening you said his lawyer,</v>

1884
01:21:13.381 --> 01:21:15.780
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he showed a little bit of remorse.</v>

1885
01:21:15.781 --> 01:21:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could feel that he felt bad about what</v>

1886
01:21:17.641 --> 01:21:19.580
<v Speaker 1>was happening to me because I think he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could really,</v>

1887
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:23.280
<v Speaker 1>even the arbitrators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could tell what had actually</v>

1888
01:21:23.281 --> 01:21:27.190
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their problem was they said John was</v>

1889
01:21:27.191 --> 01:21:28.650
<v Speaker 1>just negligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you didn't.</v>

1890
01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:32.110
<v Speaker 1>You should have reported this pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't.</v>

1891
01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:35.510
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's even if I would have</v>

1892
01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.440
<v Speaker 1>reported the pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would've read the ingredients and</v>

1893
01:21:37.441 --> 01:21:39.480
<v Speaker 1>they would've never saw that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trace of,</v>

1894
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:42.210
<v Speaker 1>of something that wasn't advertised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why?</v>

1895
01:21:42.211 --> 01:21:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Why suspend someone for something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1896
01:21:43.921 --> 01:21:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Because they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they have a zero tolerance</v>

1897
01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:49.050
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like I was the first fighter</v>

1898
01:21:49.051 --> 01:21:54.051
<v Speaker 1>to ever take them to operation and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were more upset that I didn't let</v>

1899
01:21:54.601 --> 01:21:55.610
<v Speaker 1>them know that I took the pill.</v>

1900
01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Then what actually happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule,</v>

1901
01:21:59.041 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 1>as you tell us what you take and we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>point you in a different direction,</v>

1902
01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:05.550
<v Speaker 1>but I never told him what I took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole argument.</v>

1903
01:22:05.551 --> 01:22:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Was it if I told you what I took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still was never on the label.</v>

1904
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so unless you guys were going to spend</v>

1905
01:22:11.641 --> 01:22:15.570
<v Speaker 1>all the money to take it to a private</v>
<v Speaker 1>law or take it to a laboratory to test</v>

1906
01:22:15.571 --> 01:22:17.520
<v Speaker 1>this individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what I'm saying?</v>

1907
01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I still ran into the same situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's great to protect people</v>

1908
01:22:21.781 --> 01:22:24.810
<v Speaker 1>from people that are cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's great to punish</v>

1909
01:22:24.811 --> 01:22:28.260
<v Speaker 1>someone for taking something that has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trace amount of something that does the</v>

1910
01:22:28.261 --> 01:22:31.740
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no benefit whatsoever and</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly it wasn't supposed to be in that</v>

1911
01:22:31.741 --> 01:22:35.820
<v Speaker 1>pill and wasn't supposed to be in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill and clearly wasn't being taken to</v>

1912
01:22:35.821 --> 01:22:37.200
<v Speaker 1>enhance athletic performance.</v>

1913
01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems silly.</v>

1914
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a mask that,</v>

1915
01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1916
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I understand their zero tolerance</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>

1917
01:22:44.401 --> 01:22:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is more of the Chad Mendez</v>

1918
01:22:46.771 --> 01:22:47.820
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1919
01:22:47.821 --> 01:22:49.980
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's weird ones like Yoel Romero.</v>

1920
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.830
<v Speaker 1>He tested positive for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found out that it was a,</v>

1921
01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:54.750
<v Speaker 1>in one of the protein powders or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1922
01:22:54.751 --> 01:22:56.280
<v Speaker 1>He was taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't supposed to be in there,</v>

1923
01:22:56.281 --> 01:22:59.670
<v Speaker 1>wasn't listed that way and they gave him</v>
<v Speaker 1>an abbreviated sentence.</v>

1924
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.490
<v Speaker 1>He should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1925
01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:01.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no punishment whatsoever.</v>

1926
01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.300
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole thing,</v>

1927
01:23:04.301 --> 01:23:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I'm so grateful.</v>

1928
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm still optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1929
01:23:08.141 --> 01:23:10.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm always looking for light in</v>

1930
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:12.270
<v Speaker 2>every situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1931
01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.340
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's the way I deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1932
01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always trying.</v>

1933
01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I always believe there's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at the end of the day,</v>

1934
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.730
<v Speaker 2>that's just how I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just so grateful where most people</v>

1935
01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:24.640
<v Speaker 2>would be so upset with themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this type of stuff.</v>

1936
01:23:24.641 --> 01:23:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm really not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm upset about the fans that are let</v>

1937
01:23:26.981 --> 01:23:29.200
<v Speaker 2>down who flew out to UFC 200 and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1938
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:32.860
<v Speaker 2>But as far as the whole situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just glad that that my,</v>

1939
01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:35.950
<v Speaker 2>my name will no longer be associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with steroids,</v>

1940
01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:38.530
<v Speaker 2>but I'd rather be vulnerable or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to call me,</v>

1941
01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:41.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call me.</v>

1942
01:23:41.651 --> 01:23:43.420
<v Speaker 2>But steroids that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1943
01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:45.820
<v Speaker 2>that would have really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really bothering me.</v>

1944
01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:48.160
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just glad that it's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What actually happened?</v>

1945
01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Why did they choose to suspend you for</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long?</v>

1946
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Just because of the negligence behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1947
01:23:53.771 --> 01:23:57.550
<v Speaker 2>They didn't like the fact that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was handed a sex pill and I never</v>

1948
01:23:57.551 --> 01:24:00.730
<v Speaker 2>returned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never turned it into a them to check</v>

1949
01:24:00.731 --> 01:24:01.110
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>

1950
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:02.820
<v Speaker 3>And if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still would've kicked you off at</v>

1951
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:03.663
<v Speaker 3>UFC too.</v>

1952
01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1953
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:05.730
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1954
01:24:05.730 --> 01:24:06.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would have given you a more,</v>

1955
01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:09.360
<v Speaker 3>maybe a more abbreviated suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still it's,</v>

1956
01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:14.730
<v Speaker 2>it just seems ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder when we hand pills into Usada</v>

1957
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:17.670
<v Speaker 2>or hand anything into these Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they read the label and say,</v>

1958
01:24:17.671 --> 01:24:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take this or do they actually</v>

1959
01:24:19.501 --> 01:24:21.720
<v Speaker 2>take it somewhere and test it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they read the label.</v>

1960
01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:23.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean if they still would have been in</v>

1961
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.201
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1962
01:24:24.201 --> 01:24:25.770
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to test things.</v>

1963
01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's expensive.</v>

1964
01:24:27.121 --> 01:24:29.010
<v Speaker 3>And if it doesn't say it's on there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason.</v>

1965
01:24:29.011 --> 01:24:31.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean if somebody gives you whey</v>
<v Speaker 3>protein powder,</v>

1966
01:24:31.411 --> 01:24:33.990
<v Speaker 3>well hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's test this and make sure that it</v>

1967
01:24:33.991 --> 01:24:35.390
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have clomid in it or say</v>

1968
01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:38.420
<v Speaker 2>it would take weeks to get it back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cost thousands of dollars and if</v>

1969
01:24:38.421 --> 01:24:40.910
<v Speaker 2>you're doing that for every UFC fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1970
01:24:40.911 --> 01:24:41.840
<v Speaker 2>that's my whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1971
01:24:41.841 --> 01:24:43.460
<v Speaker 2>even about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you guys I took it,</v>

1972
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:45.860
<v Speaker 2>you guys would have read the label and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gave me the okay,</v>

1973
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:48.700
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we were allowed to have what's</v>

1974
01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:50.180
<v Speaker 2>an vagrancy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alice and us,</v>

1975
01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:55.220
<v Speaker 2>we're actually allowed to but because</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine's was tainted and I didn't ask,</v>

1976
01:24:55.670 --> 01:24:57.260
<v Speaker 2>they were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you never asked so we're going to</v>

1977
01:24:57.261 --> 01:24:59.630
<v Speaker 2>suspend you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't really know why they decided</v>

1978
01:24:59.631 --> 01:25:01.910
<v Speaker 2>to go ahead with the full maximum</v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment.</v>

1979
01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:05.920
<v Speaker 2>But I tend not to question things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

1980
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:09.980
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really young and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1981
01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I believe that my best years of my prime</v>
<v Speaker 2>is even still ahead of me,</v>

1982
01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:15.200
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not even tripping about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1983
01:25:15.201 --> 01:25:15.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1984
01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:16.430
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1985
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I try to always point things back</v>

1986
01:25:18.711 --> 01:25:19.230
<v Speaker 2>towards God.</v>

1987
01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:20.063
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1988
01:25:20.210 --> 01:25:21.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is God's plan for me.</v>

1989
01:25:21.891 --> 01:25:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I need this time away from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport just to continue working on my own</v>

1990
01:25:26.271 --> 01:25:28.100
<v Speaker 2>personal development and growth as a man</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1991
01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:30.680
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe I'm in a good place right</v>

1992
01:25:30.681 --> 01:25:32.540
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm excited to see where I will be</v>

1993
01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.260
<v Speaker 2>back in July when it's time for me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually compete with Glen.</v>

1994
01:25:36.261 --> 01:25:37.950
<v Speaker 2>In July you released?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1995
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I think around July</v>
<v Speaker 2>when was used 200 July,</v>

1996
01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:47.900
<v Speaker 2>eighth July fifth GFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 was December 10th or 11th?</v>

1997
01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.240
<v Speaker 2>December 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

1998
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:55.260
<v Speaker 2>that was a ufc 205 UFC 200 was July</v>
<v Speaker 2>ninth.</v>

1999
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So July seventh I'll be eligible to</v>

2000
01:25:57.411 --> 01:26:00.880
<v Speaker 2>fight two days before UFC 200 July.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventh,</v>

2001
01:26:00.881 --> 01:26:03.470
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be able to compete and I'd like to</v>

2002
01:26:03.471 --> 01:26:04.820
<v Speaker 2>fight right in July.</v>

2003
01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a big UFC July fourth car that</v>

2004
01:26:07.711 --> 01:26:09.480
<v Speaker 3>we put on every year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to miss that.</v>

2005
01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:11.070
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>

2006
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:14.300
<v Speaker 3>What do you think now when you look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC title?</v>

2007
01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Picture cormier just had to pull out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He injured himself and a rumble.</v>

2008
01:26:18.471 --> 01:26:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Johnson decided not to fight Luke saucy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He decided to step back and wait for</v>

2009
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:23.720
<v Speaker 3>cormier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2010
01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a smart idea.</v>

2011
01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Musashi is capable.</v>

2012
01:26:28.771 --> 01:26:31.830
<v Speaker 2>He's a very smart fighter of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>rumble.</v>

2013
01:26:31.831 --> 01:26:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Johnson and I'm.</v>

2014
01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:37.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low,</v>

2015
01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.700
<v Speaker 3>low return,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low return.</v>

2016
01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need to be Sassy?</v>

2017
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:41.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2018
01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The title fight picture is sort of</v>

2019
01:26:44.291 --> 01:26:46.060
<v Speaker 3>waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is waiting on you.</v>

2020
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:48.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Waiting on you to return.</v>

2021
01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited to go back and get my baby.</v>

2022
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.760
<v Speaker 3>I have they had conversations with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>about when you do return,</v>

2023
01:26:54.761 --> 01:26:58.060
<v Speaker 3>what kind of fight you would have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you go right to a title fight?</v>

2024
01:26:58.290 --> 01:26:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Fight a contender?</v>

2025
01:26:59.280 --> 01:26:59.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2026
01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:04.130
<v Speaker 2>No one's spoken to me about whether I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get an immediate shot or a,</v>

2027
01:27:04.131 --> 01:27:08.610
<v Speaker 2>whether they make me a fight at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>once or twice before or no,</v>

2028
01:27:08.611 --> 01:27:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I have no clue what they're actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>planning on doing.</v>

2029
01:27:10.291 --> 01:27:11.000
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

2030
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.920
<v Speaker 3>how often do you communicate with UFC?</v>

2031
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally haven't spoken to Dana</v>

2032
01:27:15.190 --> 01:27:15.820
<v Speaker 2>White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2033
01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.580
<v Speaker 2>since uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a week before ufc 200</v>

2034
01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.570
<v Speaker 3>now that the UFC has been sold.</v>

2035
01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Well actually not a week before a fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>week of UFC 200 years anyways.</v>

2036
01:27:26.290 --> 01:27:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Now the UC has been sold and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>these new owners.</v>

2037
01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.520
<v Speaker 3>What's your thoughts on all this?</v>

2038
01:27:30.930 --> 01:27:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2039
01:27:33.490 --> 01:27:35.230
<v Speaker 2>to get to know the new owners of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UCL.</v>

2040
01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a few interactions with ra</v>

2041
01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:39.200
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2042
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:41.540
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I've never dealt with them on</v>

2043
01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:43.600
<v Speaker 2>a business level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm excited.</v>

2044
01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I do Miss Lorenzo Fertitta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I had a great relationship with</v>

2045
01:27:46.811 --> 01:27:48.790
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always the calm,</v>

2046
01:27:48.791 --> 01:27:49.630
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collected one,</v>

2047
01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:51.640
<v Speaker 2>the one that I could actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2048
01:27:51.641 --> 01:27:56.641
<v Speaker 2>like leave emotion behind it and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really have a good conversation with.</v>

2049
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2050
01:27:57.730 --> 01:28:00.360
<v Speaker 2>we had a great relationship in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2051
01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.710
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2052
01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited about the new leadership.</v>

2053
01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:05.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting,</v>

2054
01:28:05.591 --> 01:28:08.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a new chapter in it is a lot of who</v>

2055
01:28:08.681 --> 01:28:11.030
<v Speaker 3>knows that that's what gets exciting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2056
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:16.210
<v Speaker 3>they're obviously very entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 3>business savvy and see where it,</v>

2057
01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:21.570
<v Speaker 3>where it leads to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the state of mixed</v>

2058
01:28:21.841 --> 01:28:25.350
<v Speaker 3>martial arts today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what problems do you see in mma?</v>

2059
01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:28.713
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2060
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:31.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you see anything that stands out</v>
<v Speaker 3>glaringly?</v>

2061
01:28:31.530 --> 01:28:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

2062
01:28:32.401 --> 01:28:35.820
<v Speaker 3>here's some things that I think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight cutting weight,</v>

2063
01:28:35.821 --> 01:28:39.810
<v Speaker 3>cuttings of giant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see all this work that's being</v>

2064
01:28:39.811 --> 01:28:44.370
<v Speaker 3>put in by Usada to make sure that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't taking things to the point where</v>

2065
01:28:44.371 --> 01:28:47.880
<v Speaker 3>someone like you who's taking something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a performance enhancer,</v>

2066
01:28:47.881 --> 01:28:50.760
<v Speaker 3>get suspended for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is that you're supposed to</v>

2067
01:28:50.761 --> 01:28:54.210
<v Speaker 3>be protecting fighters from someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's doing something that's dangerous,</v>

2068
01:28:54.211 --> 01:28:56.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the tape behind it.</v>

2069
01:28:56.281 --> 01:29:00.360
<v Speaker 3>The cheating and somehow could cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>potential danger or damage to people.</v>

2070
01:29:00.570 --> 01:29:01.950
<v Speaker 3>But what about cutting man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

2071
01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't extreme weight cutting.</v>

2072
01:29:03.691 --> 01:29:05.370
<v Speaker 3>One of the most dangerous things.</v>

2073
01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to put this on pause.</v>

2074
01:29:07.661 --> 01:29:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I have to pee.</v>

2075
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:08.941
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2076
01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:09.774
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

2077
01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I was drinking this water and coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2078
01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Talk about weight cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John's going to be right back.</v>

2079
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Go right to that door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the eggs on light and don't let</v>

2080
01:29:18.391 --> 01:29:20.130
<v Speaker 1>your publicist talk you to coming back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in here.</v>

2081
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:21.780
<v Speaker 1>She's probably listening.</v>

2082
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:26.090
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very forthcoming with the boner pill</v>

2083
01:29:26.091 --> 01:29:27.890
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's important.</v>

2084
01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean if anyone's going to believe him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only way to really get it out</v>

2085
01:29:31.551 --> 01:29:33.740
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hate weight cutting.</v>

2086
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a conversation with Ari Emanuel</v>

2087
01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:43.400
<v Speaker 3>about it and I'm going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation soon with Novitsky about it</v>

2088
01:29:43.401 --> 01:29:48.401
<v Speaker 3>and I just think is the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most unnecessary and dangerous</v>

2089
01:29:48.531 --> 01:29:53.330
<v Speaker 3>aspect and fighting the most important</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect in fighting his fighters,</v>

2090
01:29:53.331 --> 01:29:58.280
<v Speaker 3>being healthy and in shape and competing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the best of our abilities and if</v>

2091
01:29:58.281 --> 01:30:01.520
<v Speaker 3>there's anything that inhibits that</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than not training,</v>

2092
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:04.400
<v Speaker 3>it's the dehydration effect of Wake</v>
<v Speaker 3>County.</v>

2093
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:08.420
<v Speaker 3>I think weight cutting is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible and now that they can't</v>

2094
01:30:08.421 --> 01:30:10.280
<v Speaker 3>use ivs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously again,</v>

2095
01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:13.910
<v Speaker 3>hate to say this again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a doctor so I don't know what.</v>

2096
01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:18.050
<v Speaker 3>What is the most effective method of</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehydrating?</v>

2097
01:30:18.051 --> 01:30:22.070
<v Speaker 3>But I've talked to doctors and I guess</v>
<v Speaker 3>they vary in their opinions because some</v>

2098
01:30:22.071 --> 01:30:26.180
<v Speaker 3>people say it's orally is the best way</v>
<v Speaker 3>through drinking water slowly,</v>

2099
01:30:26.181 --> 01:30:28.640
<v Speaker 3>but some people say it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some doctors say no.</v>

2100
01:30:28.641 --> 01:30:32.240
<v Speaker 3>Ivy is a far superior method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to rehydrating</v>

2101
01:30:32.241 --> 01:30:35.240
<v Speaker 3>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which could take as much as 72 hours.</v>

2102
01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's interesting that in boxing</v>

2103
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:43.090
<v Speaker 3>most of the deaths have come from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lighter weight divisions and they</v>

2104
01:30:43.491 --> 01:30:45.640
<v Speaker 3>attribute that also to weight cutting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and did</v>

2105
01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:46.720
<v Speaker 2>duration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2106
01:30:46.721 --> 01:30:49.520
<v Speaker 2>So you have a bag that I'm talking way</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>

2107
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it.</v>

2108
01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like you said too much about the</v>

2109
01:30:53.761 --> 01:30:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Dick Pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom on the dick pills longer,</v>

2110
01:30:57.661 --> 01:30:58.680
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder Jones.</v>

2111
01:30:58.681 --> 01:31:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much we</v>

2112
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:03.830
<v Speaker 2>do you cut?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2113
01:31:03.831 --> 01:31:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't really cut a lot of weight at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2114
01:31:05.511 --> 01:31:06.344
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2115
01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:11.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get myself down to about</v>

2116
01:31:12.850 --> 01:31:17.850
<v Speaker 2>2:20 on fight week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what do you weigh right now?</v>

2117
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Write down to 30 2:30 to 2:30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I get myself down to about 2:20</v>

2118
01:31:24.501 --> 01:31:29.030
<v Speaker 2>during fight week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I make sure that the day of</v>

2119
01:31:29.031 --> 01:31:32.240
<v Speaker 2>winds I cut about five pounds of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>

2120
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.233
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nothing.</v>

2121
01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:35.910
<v Speaker 2>But that's a testament to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2122
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing it for so long now I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know my job is to be,</v>

2123
01:31:40.330 --> 01:31:41.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have my weight together.</v>

2124
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:44.720
<v Speaker 2>When you see conor mcgregor weigh in at</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:45 and it looks like,</v>

2125
01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:46.480
<v Speaker 2>like death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2126
01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:49.910
<v Speaker 2>You know that when I see those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's what scares the shit out of</v>

2127
01:31:49.911 --> 01:31:53.900
<v Speaker 2>me when I see people that are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly cutting way too much weight or</v>

2128
01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:57.280
<v Speaker 3>when I ever saw was travis Luder when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought Anderson Silva,</v>

2129
01:31:57.670 --> 01:32:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Travis Luder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he like his lips were dried up and</v>

2130
01:32:00.911 --> 01:32:03.650
<v Speaker 3>cracked and he was shuffling to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>scale.</v>

2131
01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:06.610
<v Speaker 3>Like he couldn't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't have the strength to pick his</v>

2132
01:32:06.611 --> 01:32:08.660
<v Speaker 3>feet up and walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2133
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:10.990
<v Speaker 3>just shuffling towards the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still didn't make the way.</v>

2134
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.780
<v Speaker 3>It's shitty but scares me the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a,</v>

2135
01:32:14.781 --> 01:32:16.830
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of options when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to weight classes.</v>

2136
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:18.730
<v Speaker 3>If someone's one 85 and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2137
01:32:18.731 --> 01:32:20.740
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a hard time fighting one 85.</v>

2138
01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Then they look at you and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

2139
01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 3>This is two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh five.</v>

2140
01:32:23.711 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 3>That's a 20 pound jump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty pounds is a big jump.</v>

2141
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:28.690
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2142
01:32:29.490 --> 01:32:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as will it come for me,</v>

2143
01:32:31.071 --> 01:32:32.480
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2144
01:32:32.481 --> 01:32:34.970
<v Speaker 2>it's never really been an issue for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always made way.</v>

2145
01:32:34.971 --> 01:32:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I've never come close to missing way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2146
01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't you</v>

2147
01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.860
<v Speaker 3>lucky though that you are in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood of two?</v>

2148
01:32:40.861 --> 01:32:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what have you.</v>

2149
01:32:42.421 --> 01:32:46.330
<v Speaker 3>We're just a little bigger and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the heavyweight.</v>

2150
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.390
<v Speaker 2>If I was a little bigger than I will</v>
<v Speaker 2>let,</v>

2151
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I would go to heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2152
01:32:50.381 --> 01:32:51.440
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of,</v>

2153
01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.880
<v Speaker 2>of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our job is to keep our weight under</v>

2154
01:32:54.881 --> 01:32:56.280
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2155
01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:57.910
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna be fine at two.</v>

2156
01:32:57.911 --> 01:32:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no business walking around it,</v>

2157
01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:01.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a to 50.</v>

2158
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:03.310
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2159
01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:04.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>

2160
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's enough weight classes.</v>

2161
01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.081
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2162
01:33:08.081 --> 01:33:10.780
<v Speaker 2>I would like there to be at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>another weight class when it comes to</v>

2163
01:33:10.781 --> 01:33:11.620
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Boys,</v>

2164
01:33:11.710 --> 01:33:14.280

2168
01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:22.120
<v Speaker 2>You feel like that would be a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight class for you?</v>

2169

2192
01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.310
<v Speaker 2>That's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2193
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:19.110
<v Speaker 2>but have you thought about doing heavy</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight?</v>

2194
01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.390
<v Speaker 2>I do want to challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2195
01:34:21.450 --> 01:34:23.040
<v Speaker 2>for the heavyweight title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2196
01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:24.960
<v Speaker 2>but I'm waiting for the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent.</v>

2197
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:28.000
<v Speaker 3>And when you do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you challenge for the heavyweight</v>

2198
01:34:28.001 --> 01:34:30.160
<v Speaker 3>title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to gain weight?</v>

2199
01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to fight it the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were at?</v>

2200
01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight right around two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2:30.</v>

2201
01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:39.590
<v Speaker 2>So you will not lose any weight at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would try to eat a lot and make sure</v>

2202
01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:42.170
<v Speaker 2>my endurance and speed and agility is</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it needs to be.</v>

2203
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:45.430
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've beaten up a lot of heavyweights.</v>

2204
01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2205
01:34:46.341 --> 01:34:48.860
<v Speaker 2>the only people who are at Jackson's</v>
<v Speaker 2>have seen that.</v>

2206
01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:52.730
<v Speaker 2>I've submitted a lot of heavyweights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've slammed a lot of heavyweights of</v>

2207
01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:54.890
<v Speaker 2>manhandled a lot of heavyweights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2208
01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:57.133
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2209
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:59.360
<v Speaker 2>and I've done it right at the weight I</v>
<v Speaker 2>am now,</v>

2210
01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:01.570
<v Speaker 2>so I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

2211
01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:04.010
<v Speaker 2>that I'm capable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to make sure that I</v>

2212
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:07.550
<v Speaker 2>compete against the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right stylistic matchup for me when</v>

2213
01:35:07.551 --> 01:35:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I do go to heavyweight and challenge for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that title.</v>

2214
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:11.600
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you said earlier that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought was really intense.</v>

2215
01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said you're not going to spar hard</v>

2216
01:35:14.021 --> 01:35:14.580
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2217
01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:15.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2218
01:35:15.570 --> 01:35:19.290
<v Speaker 2>not until it was time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've been majorly preserving</v>

2219
01:35:19.291 --> 01:35:22.730
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm leading up to the oven st proof.</v>

2220
01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:23.460
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2221
01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:26.130
<v Speaker 2>I took almost as if no concussions</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

2222
01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:30.970
<v Speaker 2>And then I've been a suspended now for</v>
<v Speaker 2>another year and I've taken no</v>

2223
01:35:30.971 --> 01:35:31.920
<v Speaker 2>concussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2224
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:33.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I feel like a lot of these guys</v>

2225
01:35:33.901 --> 01:35:36.600
<v Speaker 2>are in this race to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get better,</v>

2226
01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a lot stronger.</v>

2227
01:35:39.810 --> 01:35:42.000
<v Speaker 2>My wrestling and Jujitsu was getting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot sharper.</v>

2228
01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>

2229
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I've completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain is feeling great right now.</v>

2230
01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:51.330
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been polluting it with shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't damaged it.</v>

2231
01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.430
<v Speaker 2>And so I just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2232
01:35:53.431 --> 01:35:57.300
<v Speaker 2>you got the best fighter in light</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight history,</v>

2233
01:35:57.870 --> 01:36:02.280
<v Speaker 2>who's still the youngest guy in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>division who hasn't taken any damage</v>

2234
01:36:02.281 --> 01:36:05.610
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever and it's completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>regenerating himself and I'm going to</v>

2235
01:36:05.611 --> 01:36:08.790
<v Speaker 2>come back and have this explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive second half of my career.</v>

2236
01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of guys that are doing</v>

2237
01:36:11.471 --> 01:36:13.120
<v Speaker 3>that now where they're not sparring</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

2238
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:15.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cowboy barely spars at all.</v>

2239
01:36:15.941 --> 01:36:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think even spars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does some tactical sparring where,</v>

2240
01:36:18.761 --> 01:36:20.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just tap touch,</v>

2241
01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.630
<v Speaker 3>just move around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's mostly just doing drills.</v>

2242
01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.690
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm going to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he changed that after the Dos</v>

2243
01:36:25.690 --> 01:36:27.720
<v Speaker 3>Anjos fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said when he lost a hot failed Dos</v>

2244
01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Anjos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just felt like maybe he had</v>

2245
01:36:29.291 --> 01:36:31.420
<v Speaker 3>diminished himself too much with hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>sparring.</v>

2246
01:36:31.450 --> 01:36:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Do a lot of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2247
01:36:32.611 --> 01:36:35.080
<v Speaker 2>they leave their career in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2248
01:36:35.081 --> 01:36:36.390
<v Speaker 2>like you get no points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

2249
01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:38.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a few guys that come to mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>who get punched in the head.</v>

2251

<v Speaker 2>watch a lot of fighting and I'm still a</v>

2252
01:36:43.421 --> 01:36:45.010
<v Speaker 2>huge student of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2253

<v Speaker 2>but I'm not doing it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys laugh and like,</v>

2254
01:36:48.101 --> 01:36:48.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll get punched in,</v>

2255
01:36:48.831 --> 01:36:52.120
<v Speaker 2>they start giggling or are they just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the dumbest shit to me.</v>

2256
01:36:52.121 --> 01:36:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Every like getting punched in the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>pisses me off if I leave practice with a</v>

2257

<v Speaker 2>headache,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pissed,</v>

2258
01:36:57.670 --> 01:36:58.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

2259
01:36:58.421 --> 01:37:01.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just took away from myself or just</v>

2260
01:37:01.410 --> 01:37:03.810
<v Speaker 2>there was one more punch I could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>saved for an actual event.</v>

2261
01:37:03.811 --> 01:37:05.770
<v Speaker 2>And so right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2262
01:37:06.850 --> 01:37:07.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a great chin.</v>

2263
01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I've never been wrapped or wobble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2264
01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.520
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to keep it that way.</v>

2265
01:37:12.521 --> 01:37:14.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to preserve my myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2266
01:37:14.890 --> 01:37:16.500
<v Speaker 2>because the skills will come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2267
01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.120
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that brain wants,</v>

2268
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:20.440
<v Speaker 2>wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a yellow,</v>

2269
01:37:20.441 --> 01:37:21.430

2270
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Jello forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a security thing when you see</v>

2271
01:37:24.321 --> 01:37:26.890
<v Speaker 3>guys go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see a guy like maybe chuck</v>

2272
01:37:26.891 --> 01:37:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Liddell was one of the best examples</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever because he had an iron jaw at one</v>

2273
01:37:30.771 --> 01:37:32.630
<v Speaker 3>point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just indestructable.</v>

2274
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 3>And then he saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just get wobbled by shots that</v>

2275
01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:38.330
<v Speaker 3>normally he would just eat like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a tic TAC.</v>

2276
01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2277
01:37:39.231 --> 01:37:41.600
<v Speaker 3>And when it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just goes and it does not come back.</v>

2278
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:42.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm saving my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2279
01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I hear you saying I want you to now</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jackson's is such a crazy place because</v>

2280
01:37:47.961 --> 01:37:52.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a hotbed of mma talent and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a magnet for talented people to</v>

2281
01:37:52.431 --> 01:37:54.530
<v Speaker 3>come there to get better because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>know they're gonna be training with a</v>

2282
01:37:54.531 --> 01:37:58.350
<v Speaker 3>bunch of animals there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm hearing now with the opening of</v>

2283
01:37:58.351 --> 01:38:01.830
<v Speaker 3>the new place that you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys just got so many tough dudes</v>

2284
01:38:01.831 --> 01:38:03.240
<v Speaker 3>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to make a name.</v>

2285
01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have an issue with that when it</v>

2286
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:08.550
<v Speaker 3>comes to sparring where guys want to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a names barring,</v>

2287
01:38:08.551 --> 01:38:08.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2288
01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:10.540
<v Speaker 2>I personally don't have an issue with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2289
01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:11.680
<v Speaker 2>So me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2290
01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:14.140
<v Speaker 2>since we've had our new gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2291
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:17.750
<v Speaker 2>it's this gigantic facility and we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to pay the bills.</v>

2292
01:38:17.751 --> 01:38:21.700
<v Speaker 2>So we literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we allow a lot of people to come into</v>

2293
01:38:21.701 --> 01:38:24.580
<v Speaker 2>the gym who I don't think are always</v>
<v Speaker 2>qualified to be in the gym,</v>

2294
01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:27.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we allow everybody to come.</v>

2295
01:38:27.190 --> 01:38:29.830
<v Speaker 2>And so anybody off the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like any normal person?</v>

2296
01:38:29.831 --> 01:38:30.664
<v Speaker 2>No you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2297
01:38:30.670 --> 01:38:32.950
<v Speaker 2>So our gym manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does have an extensive,</v>

2298
01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:36.850
<v Speaker 2>like a tryout thing that he does where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts you through his jujitsu</v>

2299
01:38:36.851 --> 01:38:40.300
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and kicking and striking and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure you are knowledgeable about</v>

2300
01:38:40.301 --> 01:38:41.950
<v Speaker 2>the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to have experience,</v>

2301
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.550
<v Speaker 3>like how much experience do they have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have?</v>

2302
01:38:43.670 --> 01:38:45.350
<v Speaker 3>They have to be like an amateur MMA</v>

2303
01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:47.610
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of damage belt in Jujitsu.</v>

2304
01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

2305
01:38:48.901 --> 01:38:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you can't be a guy off the street who</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

2306
01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:52.680
<v Speaker 2>She has no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But outside of that,</v>

2307
01:38:52.710 --> 01:38:54.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a general idea of martial</v>

2308
01:38:54.861 --> 01:38:57.540
<v Speaker 2>arts and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were opening the door to a lot</v>

2309
01:38:57.541 --> 01:38:58.500
<v Speaker 2>of people right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2310
01:38:59.170 --> 01:39:01.950
<v Speaker 3>pro fight jam or do they offer classes</v>
<v Speaker 3>for beginners</v>

2311
01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:03.500
<v Speaker 2>amateur classes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2312
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:05.000
<v Speaker 2>so have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2313
01:39:05.001 --> 01:39:07.340
<v Speaker 2>almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in the amateur classes.</v>

2314
01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:10.820
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the pro pro pro</v>
<v Speaker 2>practices where you literally get,</v>

2315
01:39:11.170 --> 01:39:13.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who aren't very knowledgeable</v>

2316
01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.940
<v Speaker 2>training next to me and Holly Holm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cowboy cerrone,</v>

2317
01:39:15.941 --> 01:39:17.290
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

2318
01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:19.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fan experience for sure.</v>

2319
01:39:19.551 --> 01:39:22.910
<v Speaker 2>And it's an experience of a lifetime for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people.</v>

2320
01:39:22.911 --> 01:39:26.250
<v Speaker 2>And I'm happy for a lot of these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>who come in here inspiring my shield.</v>

2321
01:39:26.251 --> 01:39:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I was against the train with me and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of us,</v>

2322
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:32.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I can only imagine wanting to,</v>

2323
01:39:32.210 --> 01:39:34.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to play ball with Lebron James</v>

2324
01:39:34.701 --> 01:39:37.850
<v Speaker 2>and you just got out of college or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>never went to college.</v>

2325
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I am happy for them as long as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get in my way.</v>

2326
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the big difference though,</v>

2327
01:39:43.221 --> 01:39:46.210
<v Speaker 3>is someone who wants to come and play</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Lebron James,</v>

2328
01:39:46.530 --> 01:39:48.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to make a name for yourself.</v>

2329
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:50.920
<v Speaker 3>So with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could dunk on Lebron James and were</v>

2330
01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:51.790
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2331
01:39:51.791 --> 01:39:52.870
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

2332
01:39:52.871 --> 01:39:54.580
<v Speaker 3>So the difference between that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting</v>

2333
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a way of,</v>

2334
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:59.280
<v Speaker 2>of not letting this affect my game</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

2335
01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

2336
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm a decent judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can read people's character a</v>

2337
01:40:03.961 --> 01:40:05.710
<v Speaker 2>little bit and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2338
01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:09.800
<v Speaker 2>have I see you for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are obviously about to 62.</v>

2339
01:40:09.801 --> 01:40:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five whatever to 20 and you,</v>

2340
01:40:11.911 --> 01:40:15.930
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the way you look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you come into the gym and you even</v>

2341
01:40:15.931 --> 01:40:20.340
<v Speaker 2>look like you have an ounce of a chip on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shoulder or like an ounce of Holy</v>

2342

<v Speaker 2>I just know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2372
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:28.360
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2373
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not where your mind should be at</v>

2374
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:31.840
<v Speaker 2>facebook page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2375
01:41:31.841 --> 01:41:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2376
01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:34.660
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wide trailer today is just like I told</v>

2377
01:41:34.661 --> 01:41:36.510
<v Speaker 2>you I was bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Or Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that they'll tag you in a</v>

2379
01:41:38.231 --> 01:41:41.830
<v Speaker 2>pitcher and his thing had just trained</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the boat and really we didn't even</v>

2380
01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:43.690
<v Speaker 2>train together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like you were just in the room.</v>

2381
01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:49.480
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do see the benefits of habits.</v>

2382
01:41:49.481 --> 01:41:52.610
<v Speaker 2>So many new people coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everyone has something to teach</v>

2383
01:41:52.710 --> 01:41:55.870
<v Speaker 2>and you can learn from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from anybody from any country if you</v>

2384
01:41:55.871 --> 01:41:57.220
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have an open mind enough.</v>

2385
01:41:57.221 --> 01:42:01.330
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of the guys come in with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great attitude and they're just really</v>

2386
01:42:01.331 --> 01:42:03.040
<v Speaker 2>grateful to be there and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

2387
01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go with a lot of the top dogs and</v>

2388
01:42:05.490 --> 01:42:08.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can kind of beat him up a little bit,</v>

2389
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:10.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're the new guy or whatever.</v>

2390
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every once in a while you get that</v>

2391
01:42:13.391 --> 01:42:15.530
<v Speaker 2>one guy was something improving it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've really found,</v>

2392
01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.580
<v Speaker 2>came up with a great way to protect</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself from those types of people.</v>

2393
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:21.370
<v Speaker 2>But you've run into those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2394
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.500
<v Speaker 2>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people,</v>

2395
01:42:23.501 --> 01:42:27.040
<v Speaker 2>like I'm always very defensive when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going with the guy who I felt like he</v>

2396
01:42:27.041 --> 01:42:29.500
<v Speaker 2>could be trying to prove something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even when we're drilling,</v>

2397
01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:31.300
<v Speaker 2>my defense is always on.</v>

2398
01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give someone the opportunity to</v>

2399
01:42:33.581 --> 01:42:37.720
<v Speaker 2>take a swing or ticket punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had one guy hit me with a monster</v>

2400
01:42:37.730 --> 01:42:39.580
<v Speaker 2>is overhand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right while we're drilling.</v>

2401
01:42:39.610 --> 01:42:42.460
<v Speaker 2>And that was intentionally to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to knock me out.</v>

2402
01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.770
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of retaliating,</v>

2403
01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.300
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2404
01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:47.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2405
01:42:47.771 --> 01:42:48.604
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you okay?</v>

2406
01:42:48.730 --> 01:42:49.563
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2407
01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:50.351
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm around.</v>

2408
01:42:50.351 --> 01:42:51.101
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2409
01:42:51.101 --> 01:42:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

2410
01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:54.370
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was,</v>

2411
01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.120
<v Speaker 2>that was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2412
01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:58.780
<v Speaker 2>that's working with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will never ever work with you again.</v>

2413
01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:02.170
<v Speaker 2>At one guy punched me in the balls</v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally to not too long ago.</v>

2414
01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:05.620
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was his last time ever trained</v>

2415
01:43:05.621 --> 01:43:07.720
<v Speaker 2>with me as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's</v>

2416
01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:15.540
<v Speaker 2>smart to stay away from you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do find those disturbed people</v>

2417
01:43:15.551 --> 01:43:20.140
<v Speaker 2>that get involved in fighting and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do want to take a chance at a guy</v>

2418
01:43:20.141 --> 01:43:22.090
<v Speaker 2>like Jon Jones take a swing at you.</v>

2419
01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll connect and knocked him out,</v>

2420
01:43:23.890 --> 01:43:28.890
<v Speaker 2>knocked out Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go like a few times that it has</v>

2421
01:43:29.141 --> 01:43:29.974
<v Speaker 2>happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2422
01:43:30.190 --> 01:43:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let my teammates,</v>

2423
01:43:31.391 --> 01:43:33.610
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to match what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do to me.</v>

2424
01:43:34.210 --> 01:43:35.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2425
01:43:35.081 --> 01:43:38.830
<v Speaker 2>don't be surprised if I fuck you up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's a little bit more than</v>

2426
01:43:38.831 --> 01:43:40.920
<v Speaker 2>what you would do to a trading partner</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2427
01:43:41.230 --> 01:43:43.780
<v Speaker 2>if I realize you're trying to hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you meditate,</v>

2428
01:43:43.781 --> 01:43:45.730
<v Speaker 2>John?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to meditate a lot.</v>

2429
01:43:45.731 --> 01:43:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm more big into visualization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did you use to meditate?</v>

2430
01:43:49.450 --> 01:43:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm right around 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around 2010,</v>

2431
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:55.660
<v Speaker 2>2011.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2432
01:43:55.670 --> 01:43:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I went through this huge spiritual thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I,</v>

2433
01:43:58.971 --> 01:44:00.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became obsessed with,</v>

2434
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:04.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of the mind and um,</v>

2435
01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I got into a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really deep just um,</v>

2436
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:12.980
<v Speaker 2>meditation and visualization and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing how powerful our minds</v>

2437
01:44:12.981 --> 01:44:15.830
<v Speaker 2>actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how we really do paint our world</v>

2438
01:44:15.831 --> 01:44:18.170
<v Speaker 2>with our thoughts and our level of self</v>
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>

2439
01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:19.720
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2440
01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:22.190
<v Speaker 2>right around 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2441
01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I just took myself to this different</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental level where I took myself on</v>

2442
01:44:27.441 --> 01:44:31.280
<v Speaker 2>being an average joe kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably hate every show.</v>

2443
01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's aggressive.</v>

2444
01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:39.460
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't used to that name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a goofy name.</v>

2445
01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:40.630
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a blank.</v>

2446
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:42.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like cardboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to it.</v>

2447
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I took myself on being very average</v>

2448
01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.580
<v Speaker 2>minded to actually believing that I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit and believing that I could be</v>

2449
01:44:51.581 --> 01:44:54.850
<v Speaker 2>the shit and that I could be the goat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be the greatest and never lose into</v>

2450
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:57.190
<v Speaker 2>like I take myself to a different place</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally.</v>

2451
01:44:57.191 --> 01:44:58.420
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it came from,</v>

2452
01:44:58.810 --> 01:45:01.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental practice and meditation and</v>

2453
01:45:01.931 --> 01:45:06.310
<v Speaker 2>visualization and just seeking knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 2>from people who are strong believers</v>

2454
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.320
<v Speaker 2>because like I'm Les Brown and Tony</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robbins and guys like that.</v>

2455
01:45:11.801 --> 01:45:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I just became really obsessed with just</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn about the power of the mind.</v>

2456
01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:18.880
<v Speaker 2>So I used to meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I just kind of,</v>

2457
01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of things that have stuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>

2458
01:45:21.730 --> 01:45:24.580
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ways of believing that stuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me that just subconsciously I know</v>

2459
01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:30.970
<v Speaker 2>who I am and what I'm capable of and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe apart from my mind actually is</v>

2460
01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:35.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm a firm believer in meditation</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I believe that human beings can</v>

2461
01:45:35.061 --> 01:45:37.820
<v Speaker 3>get caught up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially someone involved in a very</v>

2462
01:45:37.821 --> 01:45:41.330
<v Speaker 3>difficult endeavor like you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get caught up in the momentum of</v>

2463
01:45:41.331 --> 01:45:44.810
<v Speaker 3>your life and sometimes it's very hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reset.</v>

2464
01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:49.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a very hard to separate yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>from it and get a balanced and as much</v>

2465
01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:54.560
<v Speaker 3>as you can objective perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think one of the best ways to do</v>

2466
01:45:54.561 --> 01:45:59.000
<v Speaker 3>that is to take time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We sit and you close your eyes and you</v>

2467
01:45:59.001 --> 01:46:04.001
<v Speaker 3>do nothing and just concentrate on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing and just just set it all aside</v>

2468
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:10.850
<v Speaker 3>and extract yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extract your consciousness from the</v>

2469
01:46:10.851 --> 01:46:14.420
<v Speaker 3>momentum of your life and I think a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people don't do that and they get</v>

2470
01:46:14.421 --> 01:46:18.800
<v Speaker 3>caught up in this hurricane of existence</v>
<v Speaker 3>where everything is just constantly</v>

2471
01:46:18.801 --> 01:46:20.630
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your phone won't stop ringing.</v>

2472
01:46:20.631 --> 01:46:22.970
<v Speaker 3>There's fucking people knocking at your</v>
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>

2473
01:46:22.971 --> 01:46:25.960
<v Speaker 3>You got this going on that going on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to go catch this flight.</v>

2474
01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:28.130
<v Speaker 3>No Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got fight coming up and Oh shit,</v>

2475
01:46:28.131 --> 01:46:31.850
<v Speaker 3>you got this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes you lose yourself.</v>

2476
01:46:32.210 --> 01:46:34.090
<v Speaker 3>You lose yourself in that wave of life.</v>

2477
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I definitely lost myself at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

2478
01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like right now I'm at this</v>

2479
01:46:39.821 --> 01:46:44.821
<v Speaker 2>position where I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am myself and I can see John Bones</v>

2480
01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Jones and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can like look at my career from a fan</v>

2481
01:46:52.681 --> 01:46:55.020
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get what I'm saying?</v>

2482
01:46:55.110 --> 01:46:58.470
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually make fun of myself like,</v>

2483
01:46:58.471 --> 01:47:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Damn you fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what have you done?</v>

2484
01:47:02.730 --> 01:47:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2485
01:47:03.571 --> 01:47:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2486
01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2487
01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.440
<v Speaker 2>I have a good way of detaching something</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of me and,</v>

2488
01:47:10.450 --> 01:47:13.470
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and seeing what's happening and okay,</v>

2489
01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:14.370
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not over.</v>

2490
01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:16.020
<v Speaker 2>You've got to do is just do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>

2491
01:47:16.021 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get what I'm saying.</v>

2492
01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2493
01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:23.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not necessarily meditating these</v>

2494
01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:27.180
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do have the capability of taking</v>

2495
01:47:27.181 --> 01:47:32.160
<v Speaker 2>away who I actually am at this point and</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing that this is just a part of me</v>

2496
01:47:32.161 --> 01:47:33.960
<v Speaker 2>or this is just a situation in my life.</v>

2497
01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:36.150
<v Speaker 2>This is my actual life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't my,</v>

2498
01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.650
<v Speaker 2>this isn't my final destination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just a small moment in time that</v>

2499
01:47:40.651 --> 01:47:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm going through right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get what I'm saying?</v>

2500
01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2501
01:47:44.071 --> 01:47:46.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

2502
01:47:46.301 --> 01:47:51.210
<v Speaker 2>that's my form of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I step away from terrible situations and</v>

2503
01:47:51.211 --> 01:47:54.840
<v Speaker 2>look and look at myself as if it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future and I'm looking back on what's</v>

2504
01:47:54.841 --> 01:47:56.610
<v Speaker 2>happened to me or what's happening and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2505
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:58.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I get myself out of this?</v>

2506
01:47:58.801 --> 01:48:00.960
<v Speaker 2>How can I make this better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I need to do to turn this</v>

2507
01:48:00.961 --> 01:48:01.794
<v Speaker 2>around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I,</v>

2508
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:05.760
<v Speaker 2>you get what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being completely emerged in the moment</v>

2509
01:48:05.761 --> 01:48:06.571
<v Speaker 2>and thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2510
01:48:06.571 --> 01:48:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I can't get out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I did like a small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a grappling event.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like I did one Jujitsu match my whole</v>

<v Speaker 2>career and I want it but for some issues</v>

2543
01:49:06.171 --> 01:49:07.640

<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

2544
01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:09.830
<v Speaker 2>the guy who challenged me was like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>purple belt or something.</v>

2545
01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:12.110
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2546
01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:13.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't do that type of stuff.</v>

2547
01:49:13.971 --> 01:49:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2548
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.060

<v Speaker 2>I don't have any clothes or anything.</v>

2549
01:49:17.061 --> 01:49:17.541
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we were selling gs over here in rash</v>
<v Speaker 2>guards.</v>

2551
01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:21.440
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2552
01:49:21.441 --> 01:49:23.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm going to real man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

2553
01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.250
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's like a,</v>

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.760
<v Speaker 2>well at least come over and say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of kids over there.</v>

2555
01:49:28.761 --> 01:49:30.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people who would just love to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see you come.</v>

2556
01:49:30.261 --> 01:49:32.270
<v Speaker 2>So some support to the Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

2557
01:49:32.690 --> 01:49:33.523
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2558
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I went over there after my</v>

2559
01:49:35.691 --> 01:49:39.020
<v Speaker 2>autograph signing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of people standing</v>

2560
01:49:39.021 --> 01:49:43.070
<v Speaker 2>around and I was greeting everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was like,</v>

2561
01:49:43.071 --> 01:49:44.210
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like are you going to roll with me or</v>

2562
01:49:44.211 --> 01:49:45.560
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

2563
01:49:45.650 --> 01:49:47.530
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of people heard them and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

2564
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I feel like when someone's trying to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like someone wins when they call</v>

2565
01:49:53.141 --> 01:49:55.230
<v Speaker 2>you out and you don't oblige them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2566
01:49:56.150 --> 01:49:56.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2567
01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:59.770
<v Speaker 2>So I was just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy's head is,</v>

2568
01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a small victory knowing that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>backed down and it's,</v>

2569
01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:05.170
<v Speaker 2>we're not punching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2570
01:50:05.210 --> 01:50:06.310
<v Speaker 2>it's Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2571
01:50:06.311 --> 01:50:08.410
<v Speaker 2>So no one's going to get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

2572
01:50:08.411 --> 01:50:11.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me live a little and just do this,</v>

2573
01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:12.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the kids are gonna,</v>

2574
01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:14.360
<v Speaker 2>love it and people are going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2575
01:50:14.361 --> 01:50:15.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2576
01:50:15.281 --> 01:50:16.540
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a rash guard.</v>

2577
01:50:16.541 --> 01:50:18.070
<v Speaker 2>So they gave me a rash guard and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>

2578
01:50:18.071 --> 01:50:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even warm up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got to do one of these.</v>

2579
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:25.030
<v Speaker 2>And then I ended up tapping these two</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys out fairly quick.</v>

2580
01:50:25.090 --> 01:50:28.120
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some of these people are from</v>

2581
01:50:28.121 --> 01:50:30.580
<v Speaker 2>submission underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They saw those videos and they're,</v>

2582
01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:34.810
<v Speaker 2>they're starting this new promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2583
01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.650
<v Speaker 2>where they're actually paying fighters</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty with that.</v>

2584
01:50:36.670 --> 01:50:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Like they're taking care of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes.</v>

2585
01:50:38.171 --> 01:50:39.004
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2586
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2587
01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Do People Watch it on paper view?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

2588
01:50:42.261 --> 01:50:45.650
<v Speaker 3>So I think you can watch it online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could stream it online for a price.</v>

2589
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2590
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.750
<v Speaker 3>so here it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2591
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:52.070
<v Speaker 3>it's flow grappling.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>F L O grappling.com,</v>

2592
01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>December 11th at 2:30.</v>

2593
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:59.690
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is Ebi rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this is the shale sunnen thing,</v>

2594
01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:02.300
<v Speaker 3>so to see if that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could see that in there,</v>

2595
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:04.280
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scroll up and see what the rules are.</v>

2596
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still don't even know what the rules</v>

2597
01:51:06.551 --> 01:51:08.320
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the mission only.</v>

2598
01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>submission only,</v>

2599
01:51:09.651 --> 01:51:14.180
<v Speaker 3>but I think Ebi rules is a Ebi rules is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very interesting to get me.</v>

2600
01:51:14.181 --> 01:51:16.730
<v Speaker 3>But Ebi is Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>invitational rules.</v>

2601
01:51:16.731 --> 01:51:21.590
<v Speaker 3>What he did is he figured out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid draws and what he does is he has</v>

2602
01:51:21.591 --> 01:51:25.330
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fight for a or they grapple for a</v>

2603
01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:28.160
<v Speaker 3>determined time period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then at the end of the time period</v>

2604
01:51:28.190 --> 01:51:29.001
<v Speaker 3>minutes I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2605
01:51:29.001 --> 01:51:33.050
<v Speaker 3>they exchange a bad positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one guy will start off.</v>

2606
01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:36.270
<v Speaker 3>Well you start off what's called spider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So spiderweb aside,</v>

2607
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:38.720
<v Speaker 3>control with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the arm bar locked up,</v>

2608
01:51:38.721 --> 01:51:42.040
<v Speaker 3>but the arm hooked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the arm hooked so your you have</v>

2609
01:51:42.041 --> 01:51:45.440
<v Speaker 3>your legs across the arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trapped and ready go.</v>

2610
01:51:45.441 --> 01:51:47.090
<v Speaker 3>So the guy on the bottom is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>escape.</v>

2611
01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:51.800
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to hold him down or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can start off with the over under from</v>

2612
01:51:51.801 --> 01:51:54.260
<v Speaker 3>back control so you don't have a choke</v>
<v Speaker 3>locked in,</v>

2613
01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:55.460
<v Speaker 3>but you have over under.</v>

2614
01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:58.370
<v Speaker 3>You have both hooks in and you're on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and they say ready,</v>

2615
01:51:58.371 --> 01:52:00.590
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's how fast the person could escape</v>

2616
01:52:00.591 --> 01:52:04.950
<v Speaker 3>versus how fast you could submit them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the exchange back of what?</v>

2617
01:52:04.951 --> 01:52:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Say if you submit your guy and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>has an opportunity to try to submit you.</v>

2618
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:11.100
<v Speaker 3>If you submit him faster than he</v>
<v Speaker 3>submitted you,</v>

2619
01:52:11.101 --> 01:52:13.940
<v Speaker 3>you went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you submit him and he doesn't submit</v>

2620
01:52:13.941 --> 01:52:15.400
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went with your escape.</v>

2621
01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Both escape and he'd do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you both escape again,</v>

2622
01:52:18.981 --> 01:52:22.550
<v Speaker 3>you do it one more time and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>calculate all the time it took for each</v>

2623
01:52:22.551 --> 01:52:24.440
<v Speaker 3>one to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the person who has the least amount</v>

2624
01:52:24.441 --> 01:52:27.050
<v Speaker 3>of time and escape the quickest winds up</v>
<v Speaker 3>winning.</v>

2625
01:52:27.051 --> 01:52:29.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm winning this shit.</v>

2626
01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson quite a bit smaller than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you two.</v>

2627
01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>

2628
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much you weigh right now.</v>

2629
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:41.330
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think he's cutting a whole</v>

2630
01:52:41.331 --> 01:52:42.680
<v Speaker 3>lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a big guy,</v>

2631
01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.140
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2632
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:47.090
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting like him fighting</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisping,</v>

2633
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:49.100
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably going to be his</v>
<v Speaker 3>last fight.</v>

2634
01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:50.930
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people thought he should have</v>
<v Speaker 3>won that fight.</v>

2635
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Super close fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He retired and he argued in.</v>

2636
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:55.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he did.</v>

2637
01:52:55.011 --> 01:52:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I think he decided that's it.</v>

2638
01:52:56.290 --> 01:52:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure this means a lot to them to</v>

2639
01:52:58.041 --> 01:53:00.280
<v Speaker 2>be able to be able to beat me even in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling match.</v>

2640
01:53:00.281 --> 01:53:02.110
<v Speaker 2>That's quite the way to end your career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2641
01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:04.930
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know how hard he's training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>

2642
01:53:05.170 --> 01:53:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting a little effort into it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2643
01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you tell me before you just getting</v>

2644
01:53:09.230 --> 01:53:10.370
<v Speaker 3>really in love with Gigi?</v>

2645
01:53:10.590 --> 01:53:12.060
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
