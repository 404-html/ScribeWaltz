00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring it on.</v>

10
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel liberated.</v>

11
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Not Know what the real sounded to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slim and healthy.</v>

12
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>What have you been doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

13
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.413
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got back in the gym and I'm doing </v>

14
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>boxing and kickboxing still and active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.410
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm in Oregon a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the meth is awesome up there.</v>

17
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>They do have good speed rate for weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

18
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>I would think that Oregon would be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like a calm down type of state as far</v>

19
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>as drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just there for four times.</v>

20
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I emailed you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

21
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I love it up there man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would bet they're fucking the winter,</v>

22
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>so goddamn depressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would still do it.</v>

23
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>This winter has been just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rained for nine months straight.</v>

24
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>There were like 500 inches in my county.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus this winter,</v>

25
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>but a beautiful green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

26
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It's so lush when I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get out of the PDX airport,</v>

27
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you smell pine trees as soon as you walk</v>

28
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:10.404
<v Speaker 1>out of the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's amazing and after being an </v>

29
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:12.744
<v Speaker 1>la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just basically like this giant </v>

30
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>desiccated Turd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

31
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so nice.</v>

32
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be like the best place to </v>

33
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:19.824
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had a place there and a </v>

34
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:22.044
<v Speaker 1>place here you go back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you deal with total dry and total when </v>

35
00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it kind of balance itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nailed it.</v>

36
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Mr Russell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

37
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>You nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm commuting every week and people say,</v>

38
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you get sick of this?</v>

39
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I actually love it so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far.</v>

40
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my son here,</v>

41
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>my son is here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes to school here.</v>

42
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>In fact he goes to school right near </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're sitting and uh,</v>

43
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>so I have an apartment here and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>house in Salem,</v>

44
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Oregon and I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going back and forth.</v>

45
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of like a shark.</v>

46
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to keep moving.</v>

47
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't like I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel claustrophobic and like the world</v>

48
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>is passing me by if I'm sitting in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>place too long.</v>

49
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Have you always been like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm digging it.</v>

50
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

51
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I always need to be doing something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>

52
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I get I am literally claustrophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And have you ever done an isolation </v>

54
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:05.094
<v Speaker 1>tank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

55
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know when you talk about that I'm </v>

56
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my worst nightmare.</v>

57
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.151
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

58
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>and I'm also a little bit afraid of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>

59
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>I knew you were going to laugh at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>

60
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Call me a girl again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

61
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Wrong with being a girl by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>

62
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll get into that.</v>

63
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 1>We'll get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

64
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like pitch black that,</v>

65
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>that freaks me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really can't see anything.</v>

66
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.053
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind a very dark room if you </v>

67
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as I can see something.</v>

68
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>But if it's pitch black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I freak the fuck out.</v>

69
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>You know what freaks me out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vision Goggles.</v>

70
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I want right then.</v>

71
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool if I hadn't seem so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put them on.</v>

72
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.613
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're in a horror movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're in one of those scenes and </v>

73
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>most stupid ghostbuster shows where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're down in the basement.</v>

74
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>They always have night vision on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried them on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

76
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some.</v>

77
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Of course you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you do.</v>

78
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>For like nighttime boar hunting over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

79
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.163
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the reasons why they use </v>

80
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.454
<v Speaker 1>them</v>

81
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's scopes.</v>

82
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 2>They have night vision scopes or where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the infrared version of the pigs</v>

83
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 2>moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird to look through them,</v>

84
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.363
<v Speaker 2>but people often mistake other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>for pigs like deer and not like that </v>

85
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't tried them on,</v>

86
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.104
<v Speaker 2>but I liked that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know like spelunking is </v>

87
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>definitely out for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

88
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 2>claustrophobic and afraid of the dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>spelunking caving.</v>

89
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.783
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the idea of being like in a </v>

90
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:23.974
<v Speaker 2>tight one of those tight little caves </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to like squeeze your body </v>

91
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 2>through in the pitch dark and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>headlamp goes out.</v>

92
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.240
<v Speaker 2>I was just listening to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was my worst night,</v>

93
00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:31.074
<v Speaker 2>asked about this family that owns a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranch in Texas and they had these small </v>

94
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:39.780
<v Speaker 2>caves and these kids would explore and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then um,</v>

95
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 2>they allowed some cavers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some local,</v>

96
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cave explorers to go and check it out </v>

97
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 2>and they crawl through this really </v>
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>

98
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.304
<v Speaker 2>like three foot diameter hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally crawled through it and </v>

99
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:51.934
<v Speaker 2>found two football field size caves </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside and then found out that there's </v>

100
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 2>literally miles of cave systems in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

101
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

102
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I weren't terrified of it because</v>

103
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I love all the other stuff in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outdoors and backpacking and camping and</v>

104
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 2>hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do all that.</v>

105
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:10.294
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But going underground is the worst </v>

106
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.223
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only backpack and camp when it's a </v>

107
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:15.574
<v Speaker 2>full moon.</v>

108
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 2>A No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool with the stars.</v>

109
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 2>That's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good enough.</v>

110
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Headlamps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

111
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 2>it was pitch black when you can't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hand in front of your face.</v>

112
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 2>That freaks me out and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand why people,</v>

113
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.803
<v Speaker 2>other people don't freak out about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll wake up in a hotel room and I </v>

114
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:32.584
<v Speaker 2>forgot to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or there's no light at all on for </v>

115
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:34.924
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll freak out because I don't know </v>

116
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.470
<v Speaker 2>where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

117
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.383
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what I'm already admitting to </v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't remember something.</v>

128
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Something really critically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty girlish pretty.</v>

129
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 2>So it's been um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>portland,</v>

130

<v Speaker 2>What are you doing up there?</v>

131
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.633
<v Speaker 2>So my girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I live with as a vice president at </v>

<v Speaker 2>time just for the hell of it at </v>

133
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:13.924
<v Speaker 2>Willamette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But mostly I'm developing all these </v>

134
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.080
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

135
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.230
<v Speaker 2>and mostly just enjoying Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because man you can,</v>

136
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 2>you can afford a hell of a house in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Salem,</v>

137
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Oregon for what you were paying in La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you.</v>

138
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.193
<v Speaker 2>So we're just living a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Time in my life I've been in a </v>

139
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 2>house that I enjoyed being in and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

140
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's great and it's given me a </v>

141
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:33.634
<v Speaker 2>base to do these projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my new podcast and renegade university </v>

142
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 2>and write my book.</v>

143
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.713
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my own studio in the house and I </v>

144
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.154
<v Speaker 2>have my own office in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like kind of the command center </v>

145
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

146
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's been,</v>

147
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>it's been pretty awesome lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fascinating how some places</v>

148
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:52.474
<v Speaker 2>like some cities have like a mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a field that you get from the </v>

149
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 2>city and liked the field that you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Portland.</v>

150
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like it's a aware city,</v>

151
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a dumb city because they're</v>

152
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 2>aware they're woke woke as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

153
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.920
<v Speaker 2>But it's like a white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a white bloke,</v>

154
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 2>white work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

155
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.493
<v Speaker 2>It might logos a little pretentious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think somewhere along the line </v>

156
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Portland became like a place that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretentious people gravitated to because</v>

157
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to identify like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm white and I have dreadlocks.</v>

158
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Here I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

159
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Like they make really good food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those pretentious people,</v>

160
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 2>their food carts or coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

161
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

162
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 2>They make great food and those food </v>
<v Speaker 2>trucks are out of this world.</v>

163
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:33.321
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

164
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland is a great city,</v>

165
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.640
<v Speaker 2>except have you noticed the hid all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people this four or five of them?</v>

166
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only seen mountain lions.</v>

167
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:43.004
<v Speaker 2>I keep waiting to like come across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage where they keep them in the one </v>

168
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 2>corner of the city because then it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

169
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Especially in like the core of Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maine part.</v>

170
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 2>All you do not see any black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see the Mexicans,</v>

171
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 2>you don't see Japanese people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is just white people.</v>

172
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.923
<v Speaker 2>Dude with beards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a Pacific northwest selling </v>

173
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 2>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see more of it in.</v>

174
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 2>You definitely see more black people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Seattle.</v>

175
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 2>So it's definitely pretty diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not fully,</v>

176
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of Asian folks for sure.</v>

177
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.013
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

178
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.711
<v Speaker 2>Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

179
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:12.190
<v Speaker 2>not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even Latinos and Asians,</v>

180
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 2>like how do you do that on the west </v>
<v Speaker 2>coast?</v>

181
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Where do you put all those people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're on the west side,</v>

182
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.890
<v Speaker 2>pass by there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go with it.</v>

183
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Let's keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vancouver's right up the street.</v>

184
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Hey you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you took a wrong turn.</v>

185
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:23.961
<v Speaker 2>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just keep walking.</v>

186
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Let's just keep going north.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a small city.</v>

188
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think Portland has more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than a million people.</v>

189
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it now?</v>

190
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like half a million.</v>

191
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Is it really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think something like that.</v>

192
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's small.</v>

193
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.663
<v Speaker 2>I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lack of diversity actually is the </v>

194
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 2>only problem I have with it and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly big problem,</v>

195
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:43.454
<v Speaker 2>but that's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But otherwise it's the best city in </v>

196
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:46.900
<v Speaker 2>America I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

197
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.230
<v Speaker 2>It's my favorite city in America.</v>

198
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

199
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn good.</v>

200
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence Krauss lives there I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>

201
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two of us to complete to.</v>

202
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Cool people are smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't live in Portland,</v>

203
00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:57.891
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Salem,</v>

204
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 2>which is an hour south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're still important that a lot,</v>

205
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:01.064
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of is that because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university will and because it's way </v>

206
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 2>cheaper to live there and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>really beautifully centrally located.</v>

207
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:09.434
<v Speaker 2>So we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're an hour and 10 minutes from the </v>

208
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 2>coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is gorgeous.</v>

209
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Have you been to the Oregon coast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.223
<v Speaker 2>And then we're an hour and a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the cascade mountains on the other </v>

212
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:17.894
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all around Salem is the </v>

213
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:21.224
<v Speaker 2>Willamette valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like Napa Valley and Sonoma </v>

214
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.910
<v Speaker 2>county meet Vermont.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is so beautiful.</v>

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.773
<v Speaker 2>Just readily beautiful farmland all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around there to make a lot of wine up </v>

222
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.120

<v Speaker 2>so we do have a little diversity because</v>

223
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.313
<v Speaker 2>all the farm workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a substantial population of </v>

00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he was a kid and then he became a </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion wrestler and then they went </v>

246
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 1>So your knee is.</v>

247
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about this before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast you need,</v>

248
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:40.434
<v Speaker 1>feels like it's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really would love to start </v>

249
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 1>grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never have.</v>

250
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>And I'm scared of it because of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes,</v>

251
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>especially the take downs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the leg locks and all that.</v>

252
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.560
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm doing it.</v>

253
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.220

260
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.700

<v Speaker 1>like static yoga positions for your back</v>

261
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 1>and for your knees and your feet until </v>
<v Speaker 1>this does.</v>

262

<v Speaker 1>So I'll stop right now.</v>

263
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.413
<v Speaker 1>Lost people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People listening to this podcast like </v>

<v Speaker 1>we don't have to talk.</v>

267
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

268
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.803
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

269
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm all about that drink gatorade man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is terrible for you that you might </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

274
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:35.400

<v Speaker 1>He's scared of the dark.</v>

275
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Scared of scary looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Muscles.</v>

276
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that you're all leaned out,</v>

277
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 1>you're scared of muscle people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:44.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

279
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

280
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

281
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a truly sort of like it's trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

282
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 1>trump country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

283
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.913
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dudes with beards who are not </v>

284
00:10:55.261 --> 00:11:00.261
<v Speaker 1>hipsters who drive pickup drugs real and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of guns and um,</v>

285
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a fuck basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of,</v>

286
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:05.694
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a conservative socially </v>

287
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:08.274
<v Speaker 1>conservative place is more of a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian thing and basically this is </v>

288
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>my land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't mess with me.</v>

289
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.330
<v Speaker 1>So it very much was the libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>option kind of kind of,</v>

290
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most Libertarians hated him,</v>

291
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.393
<v Speaker 1>so they would be better off with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an actual libertarian like Ron </v>

292
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's type character.</v>

293
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 1>He's the only reason libertarians were </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted.</v>

294
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two reasons,</v>

295
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:30.954
<v Speaker 1>but the main one was that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to him because during the </v>

296
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:33.744
<v Speaker 1>campaign at least he was saying things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounded like he was a non </v>

297
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:39.540
<v Speaker 1>interventionist in foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

298
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I was at least interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in him.</v>

299
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I thought there was a possibility there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course he would like,</v>

300
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 30 minutes he would talk like Ron </v>

301
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.923
<v Speaker 1>Paul about foreign policy and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 30 minutes of his speech he would </v>

302
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>sound like an old republican about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to bomb the shit out of</v>

303
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who knows.</v>

304
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:56.344
<v Speaker 2>But now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what's happened is that the </v>

305
00:11:58.271 --> 00:11:59.104
<v Speaker 2>generals have taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think establishment has just taken </v>

306
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

307
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.853
<v Speaker 2>it seems like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way one person can run every </v>

308
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 2>single facet of being the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially not him.</v>

309
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's got 100 different businesses </v>

310
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 2>worldwide that are constantly ongoing </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

311
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:14.683
<v Speaker 2>Anything about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course he's going to rely on </v>

312
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:18.850
<v Speaker 2>experts and he also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all knew this all along.</v>

313
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:21.340
<v Speaker 2>He loves generals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves that thing.</v>

314
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.220
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

315
00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty clear that madness came in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and just took over his mind.</v>

316
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.820
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

317
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:28.391
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

318
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I guess you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was right about all that shit.</v>

319
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially said I'm going to get out of</v>

320
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:35.540
<v Speaker 2>their way and let the military do their </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

321
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.453
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I know guys that are like </v>

322
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 2>re-enlisting because they're pumped.</v>

323
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 2>They think that the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Tim Kennedy a UFC fighter,</v>

324
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 2>he reenlisted enlisted because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes that the UFC forever,</v>

325
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.243
<v Speaker 2>the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believes that the military now has </v>

326
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:49.714
<v Speaker 2>the backing and the support from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president and that this is going to be </v>

327
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 2>great and they can do their job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

328
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one to,</v>

329
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serve in combat because he really was.</v>

330
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.200
<v Speaker 2>He really wants to go to oil and </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly die.</v>

331
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.123
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing that right now because he </v>

332
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:07.100
<v Speaker 2>believes in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he belong to percent?</v>

333
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where?</v>

334
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Which part?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him about it.</v>

335
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he want?</v>

336
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 2>He wants to kill his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's about Isis.</v>

337
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

340
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a long conversation though.</v>

341
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I bet you would want six hours.</v>

342
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.743
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would want to take pee breaks and </v>

343
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 2>drink water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this.</v>

344
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Let's get into this from top to bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to want this smoothed out.</v>

345
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 2>CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven minute presentation in between two</v>

346
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:36.730

<v Speaker 2>You don't want that.</v>

347
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 2>You want the long form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is Tim Kennedy had?</v>

348
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:42.250

<v Speaker 2>Why does Tim Kennedy feel this way?</v>

349
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:44.440
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I will do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An experience that's my podcast,</v>

350
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.570
<v Speaker 2>unregistered podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do.</v>

351
00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:47.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a,</v>

352
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's precisely what we're doing.</v>

353
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.703
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in people's personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>histories and how it's connected to </v>

354
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 2>their current ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

355
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:57.790
<v Speaker 2>The roots of their political ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do they come from?</v>

356
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.310
<v Speaker 2>So it requires people who are self aware</v>
<v Speaker 2>about themselves and a lot of,</v>

357
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.153
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so far my guests are people who </v>

358
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:08.080
<v Speaker 2>really have a sense of the connections </v>
<v Speaker 2>between what happened in their childhood</v>

359
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 2>and the early development and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they're thinking now.</v>

360
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a really interesting thing if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get people to do that,</v>

361
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:16.540
<v Speaker 2>to connect those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to weave them together.</v>

362
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:18.610
<v Speaker 2>So if Tim Kaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Tim Kennedy might know,</v>

363
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where his ideas about serving in the </v>

364
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:23.220
<v Speaker 2>military come from other than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

365
00:14:23.221 --> 00:14:25.300
<v Speaker 2>my dad did it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it was.</v>

366
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:26.134
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I'm interested in doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and this form like what you're doing </v>

367
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:30.310
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the long form.</v>

368
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so much better.</v>

369
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I think this is why I've know a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people didn't know me.</v>

370
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:38.440
<v Speaker 2>I take most of the people who know me </v>
<v Speaker 2>know me from my podcast appearances here</v>

371
00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:40.990
<v Speaker 2>and elsewhere have been on a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts and I just,</v>

372
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:42.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just more comfortable with it.</v>

373
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.233
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's the best way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate being on cable news where it's </v>

374
00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:46.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.553
<v Speaker 2>two minutes or 30 seconds and get this </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated idea out right then and </v>

376
00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

377
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.810
<v Speaker 2>And even radio have done a lot of radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>which just sucks,</v>

378
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

379
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Twenty second sound bytes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even 20 minute interviews.</v>

380
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I always find frustrating either as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewer or as a guest,</v>

381
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 2>even our long interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh totally.</v>

382
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.623
<v Speaker 2>I did an interview with Ron miscavige is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the father of data and we only did an </v>

383
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we did like three or four hours,</v>

384
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I probably get deeper and deeper into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the student and find out,</v>

385
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:17.541
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

386
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do.</v>

387
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:19.443
<v Speaker 2>So you go kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always going in and out of </v>

388
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 2>people's personal histories and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and then into their ideas and</v>

389
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:24.824
<v Speaker 2>into big abstract stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then history and philosophy and </v>

390
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:26.931
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

391
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:27.764
<v Speaker 2>You're going in and always back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth and ended up connecting those </v>

392
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:30.800
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weaving together.</v>

393
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

394
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.193
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the only way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the deepest understanding of </v>

395
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:35.834
<v Speaker 2>people and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of makes it impossible to do </v>

396
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:38.744
<v Speaker 2>what most people do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has just put people in a little </v>

397
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:41.910
<v Speaker 2>box and throw them away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

398
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Dismissed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

399
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a libertarian,</v>

400
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:45.500
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a socialist or whatever,</v>

401
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.423
<v Speaker 2>dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

402
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

403
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 2>he's Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

404
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:51.440
<v Speaker 2>he's the UFC guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gone,</v>

405
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.323
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure people do that to you all </v>

406
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:54.560
<v Speaker 2>the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or he's Joe Rogan,</v>

407
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:57.320
<v Speaker 2>the masculine macho dude not interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

408
00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is so complex.</v>

409
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.593
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people are and most people are not </v>

410
00:16:02.121 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 2>the same person who they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're pulling a quote from them from</v>

411
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:07.280
<v Speaker 2>two years ago or five years ago or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

412
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not that person anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody evolves.</v>

413
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:10.903
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can box someone into some sort </v>

414
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:16.100
<v Speaker 2>of a corner by like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to defend them,</v>

415
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:16.934
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grab them by the Pussy speech from 2005 </v>

416
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:19.800
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

417
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 2>It's your boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy in the corner who's trying to make</v>

418
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Speaker 2>another guy laugh on a bus and he's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>being gross.</v>

419
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Greg's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you take that and go,</v>

420
00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 2>is this the guy who won for president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

421
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about that a lot.</v>

422
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.663
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you on that when I heard you </v>

423
00:16:32.371 --> 00:16:34.850
<v Speaker 2>talking about that the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

424
00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 2>it's the trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot to say about that.</v>

425
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

426
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

427
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I think the podcasting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's changing the game and it's,</v>

428
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.823
<v Speaker 2>it's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives people something to do while </v>

429
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:47.370
<v Speaker 2>they're doing other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

430
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I think we're like 90 percent audio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only downloads versus youtube,</v>

431
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.260
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in route.</v>

432
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.453
<v Speaker 2>So most people are either listening </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the commute or while they're at </v>

433
00:16:58.311 --> 00:16:59.144
<v Speaker 2>the gym or a lot of people even at work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll put on headphones while they're </v>

434
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.440
<v Speaker 2>doing mindless bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think what it does is it humanizes</v>

435
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

436
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.623
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get not the full humanity of a </v>

437
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:11.054
<v Speaker 2>person of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you get much more of who they are </v>

438
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:14.204
<v Speaker 2>really and the complexities of them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so people talk about how we are all </v>

439
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:19.550
<v Speaker 2>being siloed now because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

440
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.413
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we just go to the websites we do </v>

441
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.920
<v Speaker 2>that agree with us and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for sure.</v>

442
00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's.</v>

443
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I actually think the overall effect is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the opposite.</v>

444
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.214
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that we have much </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper understandings of people who are </v>

445
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 2>not like us because of things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

446
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.713
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the podcasts and because </v>

447
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.753
<v Speaker 2>there's just much more exposure to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's ideas and personalities and </v>

448
00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:41.720
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more people talking in public,</v>

449
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

450
00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:43.820
<v Speaker 2>just imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

451
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Like in the 19 seventies and eighties </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you and I were growing up,</v>

452
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 2>there were three broadcast that all</v>

453
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.813
<v Speaker 1>said the same thing on the new shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were three also said the same </v>

454
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 1>thing because the FCC wouldn't allow any</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitors to come into the market.</v>

455
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean they just wouldn't allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Rupert Murdoch broke that open.</v>

456
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.463
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then since then it's just been </v>

457
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 1>flooded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we have how many channels,</v>

458
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 1>how many networks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to end up podcasts and so when</v>

459
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I was coming up as an academic in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

460
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.743
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your book didn't get reviewed in the </v>

461
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.253
<v Speaker 1>New York Times or if you're an author of</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind and your book didn't get </v>

462
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:20.850
<v Speaker 1>reviewed in the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were not going to make a living as a</v>

463
00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

464
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.063
<v Speaker 1>You had to get reviewed in the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>Times and it had to be a positive </v>

465
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:25.734
<v Speaker 1>review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the only gatekeeper to success </v>

466
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:28.944
<v Speaker 1>as an author.</v>

467
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Now the New York Times is one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:31.944
<v Speaker 1>a hundred different places are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand different places that matter </v>

469
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.920
<v Speaker 1>when you're writing books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My book renegade history,</v>

470
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:41.880
<v Speaker 1>the United States was ignored entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the New York Times and I know why,</v>

471
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People fly.</v>

472
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.293
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it says all the things you're </v>

473
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:46.794
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to say if you're a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal left liberal by coastal elite </v>

474
00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:52.770
<v Speaker 1>person from university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

475
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

476
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King was a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hated black culture,</v>

477
00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

478
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

479
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.153
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a very conservative person </v>

480
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.343
<v Speaker 1>culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was basically an opponent of </v>

481
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:07.150
<v Speaker 1>black culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

482
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was opposed to rock and roll.</v>

483
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.013
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even mention jazz until the </v>

484
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late,</v>

485
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.253
<v Speaker 1>late into his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And only once he thought black people </v>

486
00:19:15.691 --> 00:19:18.640
<v Speaker 1>should sing classical music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European classical music or,</v>

487
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.980
<v Speaker 1>or Gospel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:22.260
<v Speaker 1>very respectable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very Christian,</v>

489
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 1>very good citizen kind of stuff.</v>

490
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 1>And he hated the flamboyant black </v>
<v Speaker 1>preachers who were hooping and hollering</v>

491
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:29.964
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their churches and speak in black </v>

492
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:32.880
<v Speaker 1>dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted every,</v>

493
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:36.660
<v Speaker 1>all black people to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct American English.</v>

494
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.003
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was opposed to a lot of dancing that </v>

495
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:41.670
<v Speaker 1>was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

496
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.430
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff that we love in black </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

497
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.623
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King was opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't because he was just an </v>

498
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 1>uptight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puritanical prick.</v>

499
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.200
<v Speaker 1>It was because of his strategy and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective,</v>

500
00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:54.860
<v Speaker 1>which was to seek full citizenship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

501
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And he understood right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way it wasn't his fault entirely.</v>

502
00:19:59.130 --> 00:19:59.963
<v Speaker 1>You have to prove yourself always in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country historically that you are </v>

503
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:04.014
<v Speaker 1>just like white people to get all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good stuff to get the vote to get equal </v>

504
00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 1>protection under the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what his mission was.</v>

505
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.453
<v Speaker 1>Assimilation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilation has always been the ticket </v>

506
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:14.880
<v Speaker 1>to full citizenship man.</v>

507
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sucks that that's even a thought that</v>

508
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:20.034
<v Speaker 1>the only way to achieve quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 1>full citizenship is to ignore all the </v>

509
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:27.630
<v Speaker 1>things that make black culture special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like comedy,</v>

510
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.240
<v Speaker 1>like Jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rap,</v>

511
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.420
<v Speaker 1>like just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just slang,</v>

512
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 1>just all the cool shit that black people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have figured out.</v>

513
00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Like the things to say that white people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have ruined.</v>

514
00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Like bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro used to be like a cool thing.</v>

515
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.183
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people say to each other and now </v>

516
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like an insult for a like a frat </v>
<v Speaker 1>dummies a bro.</v>

517
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Now we'll just think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about America now,</v>

518
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.750
<v Speaker 1>if black people had never been here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it be like?</v>

519
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Which I'm not sure I'd want to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

520
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.150
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't even have blues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what kind of musical we have.</v>

521
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Blues is the roots of all pop music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all music comes out of blues.</v>

522
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Everything that's pop music that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>European.</v>

523
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Classical music has comes from black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

524
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Original roots basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course whites were involved in it,</v>

525
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course all that music but,</v>

526
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 1>but all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roots of it are in this lives.</v>

527
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 1>It will even European rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like led Zeppelin will.</v>

528
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 1>They borrowed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys asked the Beatles.</v>

529
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.560
<v Speaker 1>They talked about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stones,</v>

530
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.600
<v Speaker 1>you talked about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like a,</v>

531
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

532
00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.450
<v Speaker 1>we are not the rolling stones without </v>
<v Speaker 1>muddy waters.</v>

533
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.313
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Les said it to all of that sort of </v>

534
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:35.944
<v Speaker 1>stemmed from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating when you really think </v>

535
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:40.210
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the whole history of.</v>

536
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.373
<v Speaker 1>That's African American history actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a ordinary black people who aren't </v>

537
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 1>interested in being just like white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and doing their thing,</v>

538
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since slavery,</v>

539
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing their thing and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>called niggers by whites and also,</v>

540
00:21:57.101 --> 00:22:00.460
<v Speaker 1>and this is what people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil rights leaders since slavery,</v>

541
00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:02.980
<v Speaker 1>like black political leaders who wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizenship,</v>

542
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.960
<v Speaker 1>attacking them for their culture just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>harshly as the Ku Klux Klan did.</v>

543
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.793
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not exaggerating if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Frederick Douglas said about slave </v>

544
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:15.450
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at what Web Dubois sometimes</v>

545
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.820
<v Speaker 1>said about slave culture and black </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture than Martin Luther King,</v>

546
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:20.830
<v Speaker 1>a Philip Randolph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Jackson,</v>

547
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Al Sharpton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way through,</v>

548
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 1>they are saying the harshest nastiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about black working class,</v>

549
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:31.060
<v Speaker 1>popular culture you could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

550
00:22:31.061 --> 00:22:31.894
<v Speaker 1>it was for this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to convince whites that we </v>

551
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 1>are just like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll let us in the.</v>

552
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Let us sit at the table of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll give us the vote.</v>

553
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:45.910
<v Speaker 1>We can then become president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so guess what happened?</v>

554
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:51.450
<v Speaker 1>They finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy came along who was black looking,</v>

555
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.153
<v Speaker 1>but who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who lived in this perfect nuclear </v>

556
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Christian family wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two kids didn't drink,</v>

557
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.330
<v Speaker 1>didn't do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he smoked,</v>

558
00:23:04.331 --> 00:23:06.430
<v Speaker 1>but he stopped smoking pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

559
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Very dignified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke perfect English.</v>

560
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guess what happened?</v>

561
00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 1>He became our first black president.</v>

562
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.950
<v Speaker 1>So Obama is absolutely the apotheosis is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good academic word.</v>

563
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.450
<v Speaker 1>He's the pinnacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>

564
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.480
<v Speaker 1>he's the full achievement of that long </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt by civil rights leaders,</v>

565
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:29.611
<v Speaker 1>black political leaders to assimilate </v>
<v Speaker 1>blacks and they won in that way.</v>

566
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.100
<v Speaker 1>They got a president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what else did they win?</v>

567
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.593
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And doing that.</v>

568
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean race relations.</v>

569
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they better now?</v>

570
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do Black people still say stuff in their</v>

571
00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 1>hip hop songs that is not respectable </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more than ever.</v>

572
00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and white people or black people are </v>

573
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:51.470
<v Speaker 1>thinking when they're doing their hip </v>
<v Speaker 1>hop songs,</v>

574
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 1>they're not thinking that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing.</v>

575
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:56.360
<v Speaker 1>All black people are thinking they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing their vision right there,</v>

576
00:23:56.361 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 1>representing what they see on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

577
00:23:58.401 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 1>what they see in their neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

578
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:00.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

579
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:02.140
<v Speaker 1>That's always going to be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

580
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.450
<v Speaker 1>The people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing,</v>

581
00:24:03.451 --> 00:24:04.284
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people who actually are from </v>

582
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 1>those neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

583
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:09.770
<v Speaker 1>where there really aren't any white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

584
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:11.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're from the projects are,</v>

585
00:24:11.091 --> 00:24:12.400
<v Speaker 1>they're from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 1>these poor black neighborhoods that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous,</v>

587
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:14.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

588
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:15.603
<v Speaker 1>I mean by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know this from what they say in </v>

589
00:24:17.421 --> 00:24:19.160
<v Speaker 1>their art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

590
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.490
<v Speaker 1>don't give a shit about what white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think about them,</v>

591
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not interested in citizenship.</v>

592
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:27.020
<v Speaker 1>They're not interested in being good </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

593
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.700
<v Speaker 1>They're doing their thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you just said.</v>

594
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:30.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're interested in represent seems to</v>

595
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:31.214
<v Speaker 1>me they're interested in representing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their aspirations and their interested </v>

596
00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:38.840
<v Speaker 1>in having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds trivial to a lot of people,</v>

597
00:24:38.841 --> 00:24:40.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually revolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

598
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:41.354
<v Speaker 1>If you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested only in having a </v>

599
00:24:42.831 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 1>good time and pleasure and succeeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>and achieving things for yourself,</v>

600
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 1>that's actually not American because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not interested in America.</v>

601
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.470
<v Speaker 1>You're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in yourself.</v>

602
00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:52.304
<v Speaker 1>So that's a person who's very unlikely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to volunteer like Tim Kennedy to go </v>

603
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:57.600
<v Speaker 1>serve in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

604
00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely that that person will</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a cop.</v>

605
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.800
<v Speaker 1>It's unlikely that that person will obey</v>
<v Speaker 1>the laws,</v>

606
00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:04.670
<v Speaker 1>will obey the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

607
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.220
<v Speaker 1>the actual laws and then the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>

608
00:25:07.221 --> 00:25:08.054
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be good Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out for themselves and I think </v>

609
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.653
<v Speaker 1>that's actually always historically for </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 200 years provided this </v>

610
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:15.854
<v Speaker 1>alternative for white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've always looked at that like with </v>

611
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:22.610
<v Speaker 1>this sort of Split Lens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like part of it says,</v>

612
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at those.</v>

613
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Look at those primitive black people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

614
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.590
<v Speaker 1>They're doing the bad stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were not like them.</v>

615
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:30.560
<v Speaker 1>We're better than that and always </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously,</v>

616
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 1>most or many white people have looked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

617
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.100
<v Speaker 1>hm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks.</v>

618
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.020
<v Speaker 1>That looks more fun than what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

619
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll do that for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly young white,</v>

620
00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:41.570
<v Speaker 1>suburban kids that grow up in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe,</v>

621
00:25:41.571 --> 00:25:46.571
<v Speaker 1>sheltered environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always adopt that sort of a radical</v>

622
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:52.170
<v Speaker 1>bad ass black rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of listening to their music,</v>

623
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 1>wearing their pants low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sag and doing all that stuff.</v>

624
00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Coopting various aspects of black </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that seemed to be dangerous.</v>

625
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.130
<v Speaker 1>You know who you just described who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My son.</v>

626
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

627
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:06.231
<v Speaker 1>Don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

628
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:09.360
<v Speaker 1>it's good as you sagging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I'm pro wigger,</v>

629
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.430
<v Speaker 1>son sags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't sag anymore.</v>

630
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.380
<v Speaker 1>This is the new thing is these ripped </v>
<v Speaker 1>jeans.</v>

631
00:26:15.381 --> 00:26:18.640
<v Speaker 1>That's hip hop style chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genes behind the top,</v>

632
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.780
<v Speaker 1>kind of like fitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't sag,</v>

633
00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:23.030
<v Speaker 1>but they're like just shredded almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an eighties look.</v>

634
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.270
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to my son,</v>

635
00:26:24.271 --> 00:26:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

636
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the eighties,</v>

637
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:28.304
<v Speaker 1>like we laughed at those genes but for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different reason and now that's </v>

638
00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:32.240
<v Speaker 1>the coolest thing that black people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

639
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

641
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:38.390
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He studies rap lyrics.</v>

642
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.640
<v Speaker 1>He knows all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old is he?</v>

643
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 1>He's making beats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 15.</v>

644
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to get them in there a couple </v>

648
00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:50.844
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for discipline that Joe Schilling </v>

649
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 2>and I think that scared scared of me </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I met Joe.</v>

650
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:56.334
<v Speaker 2>Scary Dude was my first gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked in the first day and I had </v>

651
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 2>never done anything like that and I walk</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and there was job and I was like,</v>

652
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:04.314
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people like that are going to be </v>

653
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:06.480
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not having any part of this name is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just terrifying,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's a teddy bear.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

659
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just think for a young boy,</v>

660
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 2>like it's a great way to sort your head </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

661
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I think life is so I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I didn't find martial arts when I was</v>

662
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:22.404
<v Speaker 2>that age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows what started when I </v>

663
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:24.210
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

664
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started when I was 41.</v>

665
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

666
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I took my suffering is doxing lesson </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 41.</v>

667
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's Your Double Jab?</v>

668
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Church street really took off the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

669
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you started at 41.</v>

670
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got some speed to it.</v>

671
00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

672
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I got a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

673
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:40.554
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

674
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:41.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

675
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Told this tall guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got some holes in my game.</v>

676
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Think about Klitschko a Joshua.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This weekend's during fight pouring.</v>

677
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joshua's got nice job,</v>

678
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.080
<v Speaker 2>was not boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

679
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 2>He's got great power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Techniques okay?</v>

680
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:56.790
<v Speaker 2>He's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Klitschkos got a nice jacket,</v>

681
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 2>put people to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is why the heavyweight division,</v>

682
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 2>no one cares about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

683
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:06.300
<v Speaker 2>People to sleep the other way by being </v>
<v Speaker 2>boring and being not silly,</v>

684
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.290
<v Speaker 2>but Joshua puts people to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh,</v>

685
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.160
<v Speaker 2>he knocks people out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fun to watch and I'm into that,</v>

686
00:28:11.161 --> 00:28:12.180
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

687
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just love technique.</v>

688
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like Loma Chenko Guy.</v>

689
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 2>So thank you for bringing La Loma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for bringing him up.</v>

690
00:28:18.691 --> 00:28:22.380
<v Speaker 2>We got to talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget my career podcast.</v>

691
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 2>History.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all this shit.</v>

692
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Who Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go on right now.</v>

693
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.253
<v Speaker 2>And Google Vasiliy Loma Chenko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be the best boxer that's ever </v>

694
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:33.680
<v Speaker 2>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be.</v>

695
00:28:33.681 --> 00:28:36.030
<v Speaker 2>So I was worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were going to fight about this,</v>

696
00:28:36.031 --> 00:28:39.660
<v Speaker 2>but I think we're on the same page here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's on such another level.</v>

697
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.680
<v Speaker 2>So I footwork and movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't come up with a comparable.</v>

698
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.723
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's been some amazing boxers </v>
<v Speaker 2>way back to sugar ray Robinson and </v>

699
00:28:48.541 --> 00:28:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Willie pap and all those guys paved the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

700
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like everything evolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

701
00:28:54.061 --> 00:28:54.894
<v Speaker 2>Every combat sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even art and music evolves to the </v>

702
00:28:57.601 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 2>current state it's at now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you get the best of the best right</v>

703
00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:01.620
<v Speaker 2>now and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

704
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:02.603
<v Speaker 2>They've learned from Ali and Sugar Ray </v>
<v Speaker 2>Leonard and Roy Jones and Bernard </v>

705
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins and Loma Chenko is in my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the best way he moves is insane.</v>

706
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's super aggressive.</v>

707
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.250
<v Speaker 2>He's not like floyd mayweather who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguably the best ever,</v>

708
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple time world champion in multiple</v>

709
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 2>divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty nine in.</v>

710
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only been like hit solid maybe seven,</v>

711
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.183
<v Speaker 2>eight times his whole salary once when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he got a little rock by Shane once and </v>

712
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.453
<v Speaker 2>then my donna cracked him once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's like over the course of this </v>

713
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:40.830
<v Speaker 2>spectacular career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but much more defensive oriented,</v>

714
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.840
<v Speaker 2>brilliantly defensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very economical with this approach,</v>

715
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.080
<v Speaker 2>but brutal hands hurts them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurts his hand,</v>

716
00:29:46.081 --> 00:29:47.590
<v Speaker 2>breaks his hands a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of power.</v>

717
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.453
<v Speaker 2>Loma Chenko is on you like glue stands </v>
<v Speaker 2>right in front of you and you can't hit </v>

718
00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's going left and he's going right</v>

719
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:54.514
<v Speaker 2>and he's in and he's out and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know where the fuck he is and he's </v>

720
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:57.180
<v Speaker 2>lightening you up.</v>

721
00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.590
<v Speaker 2>So what does this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's why Wassily Lemme check goes.</v>

722
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Now the number one pound for pound </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter in boxing.</v>

723
00:30:02.141 --> 00:30:03.920
<v Speaker 2>What's that in Forbes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

724
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.793
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technically he can't be because his </v>

725
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:07.630
<v Speaker 2>record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't.</v>

726
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:09.650
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't really been tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

727
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.391
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

728
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:10.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

729
00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.713
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying technically he doesn't </v>

730
00:30:13.691 --> 00:30:15.620
<v Speaker 2>have enough fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck to be number one.</v>

731
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I know he's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me just say so here's my history.</v>

732
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.443
<v Speaker 2>Let me try again so I can figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like four or five years ago I </v>

733
00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:23.404
<v Speaker 2>thought Gary Russell Jr was the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing since sliced bread and I still </v>

734
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:28.690
<v Speaker 2>think he's just phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredibly fast.</v>

735
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.900
<v Speaker 2>The fastest hands since Roy Jones easily</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe even faster,</v>

736
00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:35.620
<v Speaker 2>just technically just perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was unbeatable.</v>

737
00:30:35.621 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was the next thing and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>still great.</v>

738
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:38.711
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great fighter.</v>

739
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>

740
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.630
<v Speaker 2>He fought Lemme check on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

741
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:42.020
<v Speaker 2>who's this Russian dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

742
00:30:42.021 --> 00:30:43.090
<v Speaker 2>He's your cranium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never heard of him.</v>

743
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 2>And he took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took russell apart.</v>

744
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a highlight reel.</v>

745
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Look it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He stands right in front of people.</v>

746
00:30:49.841 --> 00:30:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just has such brilliant movement,</v>

747
00:30:53.381 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

748
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.233
<v Speaker 2>he's like the perfect example of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new wave like this state right </v>

749
00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:04.940
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want this side to movement?</v>

750
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does this.</v>

751
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.760
<v Speaker 2>He does this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hop.</v>

752
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:07.594
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hops inside and he'll throw a body </v>

753
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:11.950
<v Speaker 2>shot off of it when it gets inside on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

754
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.020
<v Speaker 2>but he's basically standing at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

755
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:14.721
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right there.</v>

756
00:31:14.721 --> 00:31:17.230
<v Speaker 2>I did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a brutal puncher.</v>

757
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.630
<v Speaker 2>He'll step in or hop in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing is,</v>

758
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.360
<v Speaker 2>so I've been hopping around Jim's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lately,</v>

759
00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:23.650
<v Speaker 2>boxing gyms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

760
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.930
<v Speaker 2>he did it like three times in a row and </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how.</v>

761
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Here's how I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's always there.</v>

762
00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Here's why I think that he is the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ali,</v>

763
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.960
<v Speaker 2>which is that just in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every boxing gym up,</v>

764
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.813
<v Speaker 2>gone to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have taught Loma Chanko moves </v>

765
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.830
<v Speaker 2>like as a standard part of classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

766
00:31:41.831 --> 00:31:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning that he's changing the game.</v>

767
00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda what you were saying.</v>

768
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.023
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Mike Tyson did a lot of that </v>

769
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

770
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.140
<v Speaker 2>People can to this lunch is hard as Mike</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson.</v>

771
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.480
<v Speaker 2>You can actually do some of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

772
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 2>He's a phenomenal athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loma Chanko is,</v>

773
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:55.114
<v Speaker 2>and not everyone can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are some things here that you </v>

774
00:31:57.701 --> 00:32:01.150
<v Speaker 2>can do that had never been done before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in particular,</v>

775
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:02.590
<v Speaker 2>that little hop step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>

776
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:03.563
<v Speaker 2>I had a coach call it the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the Loma Chieko </v>

777
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.670
<v Speaker 2>jump or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can do that.</v>

778
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:07.983
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just step in like that really </v>

779
00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:10.114
<v Speaker 2>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people for some reason just never </v>

780
00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:12.160
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>

781
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson did do it.</v>

782
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.030
<v Speaker 2>Tyson learned it from customer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

783
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.920
<v Speaker 2>custom motto was teaching this way back </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the fifties,</v>

784
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.233
<v Speaker 2>but his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his style was Mike Tyson style was so </v>

785
00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:24.450
<v Speaker 2>much different because he was throwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>howitzers at you.</v>

786
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.610
<v Speaker 2>It's Loma Chanko is not knocking anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>out with one punch.</v>

787
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:27.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

788
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 2>He's hitting you with multiple barrage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of punches,</v>

789
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.800
<v Speaker 2>but the thing about they dropped him </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a liver shot,</v>

790
00:32:32.801 --> 00:32:37.420
<v Speaker 2>but the thing about like what Loma </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chanko is doing with this steady barrage</v>

791
00:32:37.421 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 2>is very similar to what I've always said</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Jujitsu.</v>

792
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.293
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to really learn Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu from a small man because small </v>

793
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:50.570
<v Speaker 2>men can't use strength and weight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the physical advantages they have to</v>

794
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:51.404
<v Speaker 2>use perfect technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you deal with guys like Eddie </v>

795
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Bravo or Heuler gracie or a Barrett </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoshida,</v>

796
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 2>like the really little guys are the guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have this stellar techniques because</v>

797
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:04.400
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the physical strength </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Loma Chanko,</v>

798
00:33:04.401 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 2>you've seen the same thing.</v>

799
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:05.953
<v Speaker 2>He's not a one punch guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have like some Tommy hearns </v>

800
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:09.773
<v Speaker 2>Nacada ability or Mike Tyson type power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's forced to have this brilliant </v>

801
00:33:14.271 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 2>movement and footwork which is complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>next level.</v>

802
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:17.983
<v Speaker 2>The footwork I think is the best of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and now he's literally embracing </v>

803
00:33:21.561 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of him being in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Matrix.</v>

804
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Has Matrix shorts on now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

805
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I like the matrix comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of him as the nightcrawler.</v>

806
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:29.721
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

807
00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 2>he's just teleporting around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

808
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.400
<v Speaker 2>he just shows up suddenly right next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

809
00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He disappears and shows up right next to</v>

810
00:33:37.521 --> 00:33:38.354
<v Speaker 2>you in a different location there that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little movement and the </v>

811

<v Speaker 2>nother level.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Rhys Millen to same year I think.</v>

829
00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.483
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

830
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 2>like any university has so much power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he catches a human being on the chin,</v>

831
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.270
<v Speaker 2>not perfect technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but men,</v>

832
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.000
<v Speaker 2>but nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty power.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

836
00:34:34.551 --> 00:34:35.384
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

837
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.530
<v Speaker 2>it's funny that we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

838
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy I want to do well.</v>

839
00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

840
00:34:42.261 --> 00:34:46.990
<v Speaker 2>It's not real format to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all noticed joe millions of us and</v>

841
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.690
<v Speaker 2>notice what is great about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

842
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't going to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

843
00:34:51.201 --> 00:34:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

844
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:52.603
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the first time I was on here a </v>

845
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:54.224
<v Speaker 2>couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said at the end that I wanted to be a </v>

846
00:34:55.491 --> 00:34:56.780
<v Speaker 2>surfer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deep Down,</v>

847
00:34:56.781 --> 00:34:57.614
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I love what I do and being a </v>

848
00:34:58.701 --> 00:34:59.750
<v Speaker 2>historian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>

849
00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:02.570
<v Speaker 2>But deep down I wanted to be a surfer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't want to be a surfer.</v>

850
00:35:02.571 --> 00:35:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a boxing coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

851
00:35:04.491 --> 00:35:05.324
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

852
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:10.640
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that are intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that live on almost like</v>

853
00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:13.550
<v Speaker 2>a sedentary lifestyle because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly in front of books or computer</v>

854
00:35:13.551 --> 00:35:15.620
<v Speaker 2>screens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They long for this sense of adventure,</v>

855
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a backpack or I want to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Nepal and most most academics,</v>

856
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:20.714
<v Speaker 2>and maybe this is one of the reasons I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to leave that profession or I'm </v>

857
00:35:24.171 --> 00:35:25.004
<v Speaker 2>trying to leave that profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I've always been a physical </v>

858
00:35:26.841 --> 00:35:29.240
<v Speaker 2>person to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been,</v>

859
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just in touch with my body in various </v>

860
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been into sports,</v>

861
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:34.870
<v Speaker 2>playing them and doing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

862
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most academics I'd say or least a </v>

863
00:35:37.321 --> 00:35:38.310
<v Speaker 2>lot of them seem</v>

864
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 1>to be completely cut off from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>

865
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 1>They just don't care what's below the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>

866
00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't care what they wear,</v>

867
00:35:44.071 --> 00:35:45.770
<v Speaker 1>they don't care how they feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They certainly don't care.</v>

868
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.960
<v Speaker 1>They look many of them and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about the body.</v>

869
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't talk about things like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

870
00:35:51.211 --> 00:35:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And in full they looked down on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the looking down on it.</v>

871
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:55.643
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very shortly this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation right now we had about </v>

872
00:35:57.271 --> 00:35:58.104
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just took that clip that last 10 </v>

873
00:35:59.101 --> 00:36:02.340
<v Speaker 1>minutes and you put that in front of and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sent that to every historian and the</v>

874
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:03.174
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

875
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.100
<v Speaker 1>my reputation will be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

876
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 1>it's already pretty much done yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you serious?</v>

877
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate box.</v>

878
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I love talking to people who aren't from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world.</v>

879
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:13.470
<v Speaker 1>When I tell them about these things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

880
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:14.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that couldn't be.</v>

881
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

882
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:18.310
<v Speaker 1>what a silly world that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's bad.</v>

883
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 1>They would think less of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

884
00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

885
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:22.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a boxing coach.</v>

886
00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely.</v>

887
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

888
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know if I can really make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happen professionally,</v>

889
00:36:26.971 --> 00:36:29.040
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least on the side,</v>

890
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to have a couple fights.</v>

891
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.610
<v Speaker 1>So anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm wondering.</v>

892
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:33.181
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

893
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I certainly can't coach pros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I'm talking about people sort</v>

894
00:36:37.501 --> 00:36:40.470
<v Speaker 1>of like at my levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who spar maybe,</v>

895
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe some amateur fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

896
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:43.344
<v Speaker 1>I'm working like a little bit with a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my gym who's trying to be an amateur </v>

897
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:47.070
<v Speaker 1>boxer now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not his coach.</v>

898
00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:47.904
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying I'm sort of like trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see because he's brand new to this </v>

899
00:36:50.011 --> 00:36:50.980
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

900
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.350
<v Speaker 1>and I just love it.</v>

901
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love teaching,</v>

902
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.413
<v Speaker 1>I love teaching and that's the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about academia that have always just </v>

903
00:36:56.071 --> 00:36:56.904
<v Speaker 1>loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I entered it because I </v>

904
00:36:58.081 --> 00:36:58.914
<v Speaker 1>just felt like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just natural for me teaching </v>

905
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:02.820
<v Speaker 1>people things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teaching is fun,</v>

906
00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're good at it,</v>

907
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.550
<v Speaker 1>but most people are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

908
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you teach Jujitsu,</v>

909
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.063
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

910
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.380
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this goes for anything.</v>

911
00:37:10.381 --> 00:37:11.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're teaching how to fix a bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

912
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.733
<v Speaker 1>You take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking all these complex ideas </v>

913
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:14.814
<v Speaker 1>and this is what you're a master at a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take all these really complex ideas </v>

914
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 1>and you package them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

915
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you break them down into little bite </v>
<v Speaker 1>sized components and then hand them over</v>

916
00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:23.634
<v Speaker 1>to the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

917
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.473
<v Speaker 1>You give them so that they can consume </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and understand it instead of just </v>

918
00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:27.710
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

919
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that's the Japanese necktie.</v>

920
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

921
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Which is what you'll see a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers do.</v>

922
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Here's how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how you do a Japanese necktie.</v>

923
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Now go ahead and do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

924
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:35.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

925
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:36.783
<v Speaker 1>the elbow goes here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of Jujitsu instructors do </v>

926
00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:39.661
<v Speaker 1>this too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

927
00:37:39.661 --> 00:37:41.580
<v Speaker 1>But like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elbow goes right here,</v>

928
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.670
<v Speaker 1>an inch down there and then the knees </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and then.</v>

929
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Right and so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's just like what I do,</v>

930
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:46.763
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take these really complex abstract </v>

931
00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:48.924
<v Speaker 1>concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that and you give them back to </v>

932
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.980
<v Speaker 1>two people who are completely new to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

933
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to package it.</v>

934
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not dumb it down,</v>

935
00:37:57.571 --> 00:38:00.520
<v Speaker 1>but distill it right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to like bring the,</v>

936
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.350
<v Speaker 1>the essential components down and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of all the extraneous stuff and then</v>

937
00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:06.450
<v Speaker 1>just hand it over to them and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear,</v>

938
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 1>simple way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can give them,</v>

939
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.233
<v Speaker 1>give them the next part and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect that and then you connect that </v>

940
00:38:11.551 --> 00:38:12.384
<v Speaker 1>and next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this new radical concept of </v>

941
00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King or they can do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese necktie.</v>

942
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.753
<v Speaker 1>That's what separates someone who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good teacher versus someone who </v>

943
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:27.410
<v Speaker 1>has maybe some real skill at something </v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't good at communicating here.</v>

944
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Like breaking it down into a system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a step by step progression system.</v>

945
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My coach I was talking about in Salem,</v>

946
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Nick Gelardi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got</v>

947
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.300
<v Speaker 2>to give them a shout out because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

948
00:38:37.301 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

949
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I said powerful nick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

950
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:41.460
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

951
00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:42.580
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

952
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:43.414
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the best coaches I've ever </v>

953
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 2>seen because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really a coach's coach.</v>

954
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 2>Like he really cares about coaching and </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching.</v>

955
00:38:48.221 --> 00:38:49.660
<v Speaker 2>He really cares about teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he does.</v>

956
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:50.520
<v Speaker 2>I could stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll.</v>

957
00:38:50.521 --> 00:38:52.730
<v Speaker 2>So he said he was at team quest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes down.</v>

958
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:56.290
<v Speaker 2>So Robert Follis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is also an awesome coach who know he</v>

959
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:58.270
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started out with them and now he's a,</v>

960
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.620
<v Speaker 2>he's extreme coture now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

961
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 2>he's worked with a lot of like top level</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

962
00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:03.364
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's when the sport was being </v>

963
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:06.060
<v Speaker 2>invented by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

964
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:06.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was at the beginning of that as a </v>

965
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:10.300
<v Speaker 2>kid with Dan Henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Lindland,</v>

966
00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:11.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randy coture,</v>

967
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.190
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's just that I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about his context.</v>

968
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about who he is as a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like me.</v>

969
00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:19.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one trained me to be a teacher.</v>

970
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was taking,</v>

971
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 2>when I entered college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea was going to be a teacher,</v>

972
00:39:24.101 --> 00:39:24.934
<v Speaker 2>but I remember sitting in his college </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes that kind of weren't very good </v>

973
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:31.750
<v Speaker 2>and I remember that I'd spent a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my time thinking about how I would teach</v>

974
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:33.520
<v Speaker 2>this differently than this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching it.</v>

975
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.740
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh wait,</v>

976
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:36.570
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

977
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually studying the teaching more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the subject itself,</v>

978
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:41.853
<v Speaker 2>how to communicate these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was studying more than the subject </v>

979
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:46.480
<v Speaker 2>itself and then I just do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It dawned on me finally.</v>

980
00:39:46.481 --> 00:39:46.871
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

981
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:48.850
<v Speaker 2>well that means you probably should be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher.</v>

982
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:52.000
<v Speaker 2>And when I finally started doing it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate school at Columbia,</v>

983
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.130
<v Speaker 2>I was teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

984
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.640
<v Speaker 2>philosophy actually.</v>

985
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

986
00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:57.970
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just my passion.</v>

987
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.833
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will is you teach things that it helps </v>

988
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:04.630
<v Speaker 2>you better understand them too because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go over them from a real fundamental</v>

989
00:40:04.631 --> 00:40:05.740
<v Speaker 2>perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

990
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:06.671
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

991
00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:07.504
<v Speaker 2>so you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the first thing I learned </v>

992
00:40:08.981 --> 00:40:12.370
<v Speaker 2>when I started teaching was that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I knew plato really well,</v>

993
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I started,</v>

994
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.350
<v Speaker 2>until I knew that I had to teach him the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next day and I was like,</v>

995
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

996
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't quite actually get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection there between those two ideas</v>

997
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.360
<v Speaker 2>in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

998
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

999
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.930
<v Speaker 2>I tell my students this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1000
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.033
<v Speaker 2>you need to be as comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so comfortable with this text that you </v>

1001
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:32.170
<v Speaker 2>can teach it to your roommate who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>never read it before.</v>

1002
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.660
<v Speaker 2>That means what that means is you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to think all the way through the ideas.</v>

1003
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:38.643
<v Speaker 2>You have to go all with your mind all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way through the ideas and then come </v>

1004
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:43.840
<v Speaker 2>back through them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1005
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just like it's like martial arts or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else,</v>

1006
00:40:46.251 --> 00:40:47.084
<v Speaker 2>like you have to actually do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese neck necktie all the way </v>

1007
00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:53.770
<v Speaker 2>through and come back all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it and then you can teach it all</v>

1008
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 2>the way through taekwondo career I </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught.</v>

1009
00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I taught at Boston University.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I taught my own school.</v>

1010
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I taught classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I taught the entire time.</v>

1011
00:41:02.311 --> 00:41:03.580
<v Speaker 2>It's one other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a living.</v>

1012
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that and it helped me </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendously.</v>

1013
00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:07.024
<v Speaker 2>It helped me understand it and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize how much it helped me until I </v>

1014
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:10.654
<v Speaker 2>started doing Jujitsu and I watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people who started teaching </v>

1015
00:41:13.901 --> 00:41:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu just jump ahead by leaps and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounds from where they were.</v>

1016
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.863
<v Speaker 2>A good example is my friend Brent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a like a purple belt and he was </v>

1017
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:24.634
<v Speaker 2>always like a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a static level and then not </v>

1018
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 2>static,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know improving,</v>

1019
00:41:29.861 --> 00:41:31.120
<v Speaker 2>but nothing crazy.</v>

1020
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.410
<v Speaker 2>It was like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1021
00:41:32.411 --> 00:41:33.290
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is hard.</v>

1022
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:35.780
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time to get better and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're around other people that are also</v>

1023
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:38.150
<v Speaker 2>getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's hard to look really measure,</v>

1024
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he started teaching and </v>

1025
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:43.243
<v Speaker 2>teaching full time and then all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden I would roll with him and I'd be </v>

1026
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:49.850
<v Speaker 2>in great danger and I be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus and I had a conversation with them</v>

1027
00:41:49.851 --> 00:41:51.530
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a training with them,</v>

1028
00:41:51.531 --> 00:41:52.364
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1029
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your,</v>

1030
00:41:54.401 --> 00:41:57.080
<v Speaker 2>your game has jumped like four or five </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps ahead.</v>

1031
00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like I'm the same as I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1032
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:00.914
<v Speaker 2>seven months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like years ahead and he said </v>

1033
00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:04.610
<v Speaker 2>it was all just teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1034
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:08.630
<v Speaker 2>and I remember now that that was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time I really felt confident as an</v>

1035
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:09.720
<v Speaker 2>intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 2>as when you were teaching the subjects </v>
<v Speaker 2>at once I had taught them,</v>

1037
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:13.041
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1038
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:13.874
<v Speaker 2>now I actually feel I was always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody's wracked with </v>

1039
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:18.320
<v Speaker 2>insecurity and especially in graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>school about these things.</v>

1040
00:42:18.321 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody feels like an imposter because</v>

1041
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:21.554
<v Speaker 2>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all,</v>

1042
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.510
<v Speaker 2>all of us have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.353
<v Speaker 2>500 bucks that everyone else has read </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should have read that we </v>

1044
00:42:25.401 --> 00:42:26.234
<v Speaker 2>haven't read.</v>

1045
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:29.083
<v Speaker 2>And I came from this little dip shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>college in Ohio and I was like a c </v>

1046
00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 2>student in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had an extra insecurity,</v>

1047
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:37.640
<v Speaker 2>but once I started teaching it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing myself to,</v>

1048
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.250
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like learn the thing all the way through</v>

1049
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:42.410
<v Speaker 2>it and master it and then teaching it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I felt,</v>

1050
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:43.730
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I belong here.</v>

1051
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:44.623
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do have some solid </v>

1052
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:50.810
<v Speaker 2>understanding of plato now and I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really can do this thing.</v>

1053
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting that you're saying that</v>

1054
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:54.880
<v Speaker 2>because that's a big issue with </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians too.</v>

1055
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.960
<v Speaker 2>And like as they're becoming successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially they feel like frauds.</v>

1056
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody I know says that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>said it.</v>

1057
00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:04.004
<v Speaker 2>Everybody I know that's sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to make it like as they're </v>

1058
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.270
<v Speaker 2>starting to headline and go on the road </v>
<v Speaker 2>places and do television sets and things</v>

1059
00:43:11.271 --> 00:43:11.770
<v Speaker 2>along those lines.</v>

1060
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like a fraud when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful?</v>

1061
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a fraud.</v>

1062
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:15.980
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1063
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you'll look at yourself and then</v>

1064
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:19.320
<v Speaker 2>you'll look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1065
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:22.100
<v Speaker 2>a Dave Chappelle or someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Rock and you're like,</v>

1066
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:23.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking fraud.</v>

1067
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that guy.</v>

1068
00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not Richard,</v>

1069
00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Jenny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fraud.</v>

1070
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.393
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm sure it takes a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you feel comfortable enough to </v>

1071
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm doing in academia.</v>

1072
00:43:34.581 --> 00:43:37.070
<v Speaker 2>It's called the Charlatans Syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1073
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:39.380
<v Speaker 2>We all feel like we're charlatan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it exists in everything.</v>

1074
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.353
<v Speaker 2>Everything difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprised and I think it's also </v>

1075
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:44.360
<v Speaker 2>probably a hallmark of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>cares.</v>

1076
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:45.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1077
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.130
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes you better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think every academic has that,</v>

1079
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 2>but I think those who do are the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were interesting and get better.</v>

1080
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.393
<v Speaker 2>I think the worst would be the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's like super confident way </v>

1081
00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 2>before their time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1082
00:43:59.001 --> 00:43:59.800
<v Speaker 2>that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.180
<v Speaker 2>They're going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that too though,</v>

1084
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:03.014
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.450
<v Speaker 2>A lot of weirdness in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1086
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:06.403
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine the stuff that you guys </v>

1087
00:44:08.151 --> 00:44:09.920
<v Speaker 2>go through politically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1088
00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:10.913
<v Speaker 2>because just you saying that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't talk about boxing because you </v>

1089
00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:16.220
<v Speaker 2>would be thought of as a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing.</v>

1090
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:22.280
<v Speaker 2>I know you're really interested in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I am too and I'm the.</v>

1091
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.400
<v Speaker 2>There are some misconceptions and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1092
00:44:25.401 --> 00:44:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say their misconceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that there's a distortion of</v>

1093
00:44:29.121 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 2>what's going on and this is not to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1094
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

1095
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.290
<v Speaker 1>actually to say that it's worse than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it is.</v>

1096
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.633
<v Speaker 1>So what most people who are outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia think is going on is not quite </v>

1097
00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:41.810
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think it's something worse.</v>

1098
00:44:41.811 --> 00:44:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know because I've heard her do.</v>

1099
00:44:42.881 --> 00:44:43.714
<v Speaker 1>You have lots and lots of other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about and it's not your fault at </v>

1100
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 1>all because you're not there and all you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is get the media reports about it.</v>

1101
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:48.833
<v Speaker 1>So I think what most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it from Gad sad and Jordan </v>

1102
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Peterson or professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they end day.</v>

1103
00:44:53.821 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually they will.</v>

1104
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:56.243
<v Speaker 1>They themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about it a little </v>

1105
00:44:56.851 --> 00:44:57.684
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people still consume it differently </v>

1106
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:03.651
<v Speaker 1>because the news right is all about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy thing that the 18 year old said at</v>

1107
00:45:04.441 --> 00:45:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Wesleyan or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's not the 18 year old.</v>

1108
00:45:06.811 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's the 45 year old sometimes the 45 </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old.</v>

1109
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:10.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1110
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:11.364
<v Speaker 1>But here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that stuff that really sort of loony </v>

1111
00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1112
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:18.630
<v Speaker 1>that you hear coming out or protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1113
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:23.040
<v Speaker 1>people saying that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die because you said a word</v>

1114
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:25.650
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1115
00:45:25.651 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 1>That's all true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all there.</v>

1116
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:27.804
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen it maybe at most one time </v>

1117
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:35.580
<v Speaker 1>a year in the colleges where I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not even less than that.</v>

1118
00:45:35.581 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>

1119
00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And if it were just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not actually a big deal.</v>

1120
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:41.933
<v Speaker 1>It's much worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's what's worse is that if there is </v>

1121
00:45:46.081 --> 00:45:51.081
<v Speaker 1>a self censorship going on that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal and profound,</v>

1122
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:55.500
<v Speaker 1>constant omnipresent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>

1123
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never talk about my love for boxing </v>

1124
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.800
<v Speaker 1>around academics or I'm very careful if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

1125
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that we know that there are certain</v>

1126
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 1>things that can't be set on a college </v>
<v Speaker 1>campus and so we just don't say them,</v>

1127
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:11.130
<v Speaker 1>therefore there's no need to police us.</v>

1128
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.413
<v Speaker 1>There's no need to yell at us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming us in protest and what's the </v>

1129
00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 1>motivation for the for which are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are holding back on thoughts</v>

1130
00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:21.260
<v Speaker 1>that maybe they would normally express.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1131
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Well here's what I think it is for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>senior faculty who have tenure,</v>

1132
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.570
<v Speaker 1>meaning lifetime appointments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice.</v>

1133
00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.630
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're cowards.</v>

1134
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:31.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are an adjunct like me with no </v>

1135
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:38.130
<v Speaker 1>job security or if you're an assistant </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor up for tenure and if you don't</v>

1136
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 1>get tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no career.</v>

1137
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1138
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.053
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've done too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I police myself because you have to to </v>

1139
00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:46.260
<v Speaker 1>stay in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have tenure,</v>

1140
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.510
<v Speaker 1>lifetime appointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a senior professor.</v>

1141
00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:50.460
<v Speaker 1>You make the decisions there on </v>
<v Speaker 1>curriculum,</v>

1142
00:46:50.461 --> 00:46:54.870
<v Speaker 1>hiring and firing and tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The faculty make those decisions and you</v>

1143
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.620
<v Speaker 1>don't challenge these crazy ideas in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1144
00:46:58.650 --> 00:46:59.483
<v Speaker 1>Or if you police yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stop yourself from saying things </v>

1145
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:03.150
<v Speaker 1>that you think are right that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in.</v>

1146
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.940
<v Speaker 1>You're a coward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1147
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Those people are cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

1148
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:10.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just overrun by cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1149
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:11.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1150
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:12.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this.</v>

1151
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.430
<v Speaker 1>They are very though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing.</v>

1152
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't prove this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just,</v>

1153
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my belief,</v>

1154
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:19.283
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's pretty well informed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been around these people a </v>

1155
00:47:21.001 --> 00:47:23.880
<v Speaker 1>long time and in part I share this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1156
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.773
<v Speaker 1>I think the worst fear of all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is being called a or a sexist </v>

1157
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:31.383
<v Speaker 1>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is their version of being </v>

1158
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.613
<v Speaker 1>in a cave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crawling on their bellies in the pitch </v>

1159
00:47:38.381 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's their worst.</v>

1160
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Fear it and for not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not entirely irrational,</v>

1161
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:45.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1162
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be publicly shamed.</v>

1163
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.753
<v Speaker 1>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole campus will think you're a </v>

1164
00:47:49.631 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 1>racist even if you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1165
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.073
<v Speaker 1>it might even make the media and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>pump and then the whole world thinks </v>

1166
00:47:55.061 --> 00:47:56.230
<v Speaker 1>you're a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a minute,</v>

1167
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to lose your job if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have tenure,</v>

1168
00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

1169
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:04.420
<v Speaker 1>unless you actually did say it did say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's truly racist.</v>

1170
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just cowardice.</v>

1171
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need those professors,</v>

1172
00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:10.114
<v Speaker 1>the ones with the power and I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about they have absolute power on these </v>

1173
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:12.844
<v Speaker 1>campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1174
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.520
<v Speaker 1>These aren't even like politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go up for a vote.</v>

1175
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:16.543
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there forever unless they </v>

1176
00:48:17.741 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 1>basically killed somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1177
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.093
<v Speaker 1>they need to stand up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like Jordan Peterson and I have </v>

1178
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:28.831
<v Speaker 1>major differences with him on sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content of his ideas.</v>

1179
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not about academia but on academia.</v>

1180
00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:33.850
<v Speaker 1>He's right completely and I'm totally in</v>
<v Speaker 1>solidarity with him,</v>

1181
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.770
<v Speaker 1>what they did to him and what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing to him.</v>

1182
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need more people like him standing up</v>

1183
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.190
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1184
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say what I want in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>classrooms and on twitter and in because</v>

1185
00:48:48.281 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been punished for that too.</v>

1186
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Was it trying to get him to stop doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is youtube black rhino,</v>

1187
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 1>which is fascinating because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>very measured.</v>

1188
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.823
<v Speaker 1>Their long form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets to expand on his thoughts as </v>

1189
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.910
<v Speaker 1>much as he likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

1190
00:49:00.911 --> 00:49:03.740
<v Speaker 1>very informed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I again,</v>

1191
00:49:03.741 --> 00:49:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have major disagree.</v>

1192
00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.673
<v Speaker 1>What is the disagreement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disagreements with him on gender and </v>

1193
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:13.030
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's completely off,</v>

1194
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 1>but you know how solid and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

1195
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.580
<v Speaker 1>and I know you agree with him on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1196
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.473
<v Speaker 1>well maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1197
00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1198
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.560
<v Speaker 1>it's this idea that there just are two </v>
<v Speaker 1>genders.</v>

1199
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:26.030
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're good.</v>

1200
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems to think that I'm.</v>

1201
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:29.973
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a spectrum of humans in </v>

1202
00:49:31.421 --> 00:49:34.120
<v Speaker 1>every single aspect of being a person I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should say.</v>

1203
00:49:34.121 --> 00:49:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I heard your conversation with them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see,</v>

1204
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:37.750
<v Speaker 1>and this was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was exciting because I could actually</v>

1205
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:38.584
<v Speaker 1>see you moving in a direction that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>found to be much more interesting than </v>

1206
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:42.850
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is closer to mine,</v>

1207
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:43.720
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1208
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:44.351
<v Speaker 1>that it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1209
00:49:44.351 --> 00:49:47.210
<v Speaker 1>it's fluid feminine men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's masculine women there.</v>

1210
00:49:47.211 --> 00:49:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand,</v>

1211
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:50.141
<v Speaker 1>in fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speeding.</v>

1212
00:49:50.141 --> 00:49:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merging all these topics together.</v>

1213
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the top Moitai fighters recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she's still fighting,</v>

1214
00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:59.410
<v Speaker 1>is a ladyboy in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1215
00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:01.480
<v Speaker 1>once she became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you got the operation,</v>

1216
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.420
<v Speaker 1>her performance dropped off pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical.</v>

1217
00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's just the lack of a Felon Fox,</v>

1218
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:09.520
<v Speaker 1>so I agree with you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing.</v>

1219
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different story.</v>

1220
00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree with you on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular thing.</v>

1221
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:14.194
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether she should have been allowed to </v>

1222
00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:16.420
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1223
00:50:16.421 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not that she should have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to fight.</v>

1224
00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I think she should be allowed to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>women as long as the women know that she</v>

1225
00:50:22.391 --> 00:50:23.430
<v Speaker 1>used to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

1226
00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Tim was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first two fights,</v>

1227
00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 1>she didn't disclose it because she said </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a medical procedure</v>

1228
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.353
<v Speaker 3>and she didn't have to give up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal details of her medical </v>

1229
00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 3>procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

1230
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:33.150
<v Speaker 3>that's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1231
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.741
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1232
00:50:33.741 --> 00:50:34.574
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a chromosomal issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with the fact that you </v>

1233
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:38.130
<v Speaker 3>have a different bone structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1234
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Different mechanical advantages and 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of testosterone in your body.</v>

1235
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:43.850
<v Speaker 3>It's just not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

1236
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.370
<v Speaker 3>but as long as someone knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1237
00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine with drained Germain de </v>
<v Speaker 3>Randamie.</v>

1238
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.620
<v Speaker 3>She knocked out a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you ever saw this,</v>

1239
00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:52.350
<v Speaker 3>but she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just,</v>

1240
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:56.750
<v Speaker 3>she's not choose to fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking bad ass.</v>

1241
00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if she's taking anything in</v>

1242
00:50:59.211 --> 00:51:01.610
<v Speaker 3>her entire career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would just be pure speculation.</v>

1243
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't look like she has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean anything either.</v>

1244
00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1245
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:08.330
<v Speaker 3>But she's so fucking bad ass and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>tactical and so tough.</v>

1246
00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:11.750
<v Speaker 3>I know she's fought men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she knew there were a man going in.</v>

1247
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:12.583
<v Speaker 3>She made a decision just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be allowed to sky </v>

1248
00:51:14.261 --> 00:51:15.094
<v Speaker 3>dive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like I think you should be allowed </v>

1249
00:51:15.891 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 3>to ride bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's smart,</v>

1250
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 3>but you should be able to do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck you want to do.</v>

1251
00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:20.474
<v Speaker 3>I'm all for freedom of expression of </v>
<v Speaker 3>participation in any sort of dangerous </v>

1252
00:51:24.471 --> 00:51:25.304
<v Speaker 3>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My issue 100 percent was that people </v>

1253
00:51:27.721 --> 00:51:31.790
<v Speaker 3>were trying to pretend that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage whatsoever and that's crazy.</v>

1254
00:51:31.791 --> 00:51:33.710
<v Speaker 3>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the thing is what they're.</v>

1255
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Speaker 3>So within that framework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the rules we are operating in,</v>

1256
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:41.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's in fighting or whether it's</v>

1257
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:45.860
<v Speaker 3>in this particular society and wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl and read all about that too.</v>

1258
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.461
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1259
00:51:46.461 --> 00:51:48.250
<v Speaker 3>So those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a particular route you're,</v>

1260
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:50.540
<v Speaker 3>you are agreeing to play a particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>

1261
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1262
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.690
<v Speaker 3>And you're just breaking the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

1263
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have soil body.</v>

1264
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Well they're letting them break the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules.</v>

1265
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:00.163
<v Speaker 3>The rules are not and I think a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is people worried about being called </v>

1266
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:08.051
<v Speaker 3>transphobic or homophobic or in any way </v>
<v Speaker 3>prejudice where they're allowing certain</v>

1267
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 3>people to compete in these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this woman in Australia,</v>

1268
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:12.464
<v Speaker 3>the Trans Woman in Australia that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke all these world records in </v>

1269
00:52:14.751 --> 00:52:15.584
<v Speaker 3>weightlifting because she was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>man or a whole life and all of a sudden </v>

1270
00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:20.040
<v Speaker 3>became a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just killing everybody.</v>

1271
00:52:20.041 --> 00:52:20.874
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the runners and I think they're from </v>

1272
00:52:22.881 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Kenya or South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1273
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:26.060
<v Speaker 3>the one from South Africa to color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget her name,</v>

1274
00:52:26.061 --> 00:52:26.894
<v Speaker 3>but what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that's like a Hermaphrodite who </v>

1275
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.050
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what she is,</v>

1276
00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:32.480
<v Speaker 3>but she's broken every record by like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1277
00:52:32.481 --> 00:52:33.314
<v Speaker 3>huge insane amounts and thinks she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a woman with an abnormally large </v>

1278
00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:38.660
<v Speaker 3>amount of testosterone.</v>

1279
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.490
<v Speaker 3>I think they've actually done </v>
<v Speaker 3>chromosomal tests.</v>

1280
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I saw her in the Olympics,</v>

1281
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.680
<v Speaker 3>I just jumped out at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just pulled that up because I'm pretty</v>

1282
00:52:45.681 --> 00:52:46.514
<v Speaker 3>sure that that woman actually has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>tested and then there was a real issue </v>

1283
00:52:49.701 --> 00:52:50.534
<v Speaker 3>behind it and she felt terrible about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was just the way she was </v>

1284
00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:53.270
<v Speaker 3>born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1285
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:53.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1286
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1287
00:52:54.801 --> 00:52:55.750
<v Speaker 3>a spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1288
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's men.</v>

1289
00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.000
<v Speaker 3>What a tremendous amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>

1290
00:52:59.001 --> 00:52:59.834
<v Speaker 3>There's men that have like almost none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually the major point we need </v>

1291
00:53:02.031 --> 00:53:03.800
<v Speaker 3>to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're totally on the right track there.</v>

1292
00:53:03.801 --> 00:53:06.020
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the most important thing,</v>

1293
00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:07.580
<v Speaker 3>which is that there's a spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1294
00:53:07.581 --> 00:53:08.414
<v Speaker 3>And so to say that there are that 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the world is male and 50 </v>

1295
00:53:13.191 --> 00:53:16.650
<v Speaker 3>percent is female nonsense or men and </v>
<v Speaker 3>men are right.</v>

1296
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:18.590
<v Speaker 3>That's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say to my students,</v>

1297
00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:19.424
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1298
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.290
<v Speaker 3>there's 7 billion people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1299
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Imagine in your mind lining all of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1300
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>naked in front of you.</v>

1301
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 3>How many sections do</v>

1302
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.880
<v Speaker 2>you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1303
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:27.714
<v Speaker 2>This is what I want you to do is get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture of Yoel Romero and put it next </v>

1304
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:33.930
<v Speaker 2>to a picture of Andy Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me they're the same thing.</v>

1305
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Telling me this is even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both men.</v>

1306
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Tell me it's even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nonsense.</v>

1307
00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:42.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1308
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:43.130
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1309
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:43.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1310
00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:45.150
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard a guy on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets?</v>

1311
00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:45.421
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1312
00:53:45.421 --> 00:53:46.660
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1313
00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Well that suggests there are women who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are less women to them.</v>

1314
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1315
00:53:51.631 --> 00:53:52.464
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a spectrum and spectrum and </v>

1316
00:53:54.271 --> 00:53:56.040
<v Speaker 2>sizes mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was to ask you this.</v>

1317
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's push a little further.</v>

1318
00:53:57.241 --> 00:53:57.661
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1319
00:53:57.661 --> 00:54:00.610
<v Speaker 2>so far you're doing very well in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>

1320
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Some people are screaming at their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking computer.</v>

1321
00:54:03.601 --> 00:54:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1322
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1323
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

1324
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:10.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1325
00:54:10.531 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 2>I think you already are.</v>

1326
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.440
<v Speaker 2>I think you already went all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

1327
00:54:13.441 --> 00:54:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

1328
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:16.380
<v Speaker 2>There's two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1329
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 2>there's the Jordan Peterson view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hang on,</v>

1330
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me put it out there and let me.</v>

1331
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think is he saying,</v>

1332
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:29.660
<v Speaker 2>which is that gender is fixed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically determined.</v>

1333
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he does believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1334
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:36.420
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would call sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional conservative.</v>

1335
00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Conventional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those both men.</v>

1336
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1337
00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Or you know what or like there's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than two categories in the world.</v>

1338
00:54:45.271 --> 00:54:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Andy Dick would be one.</v>

1339
00:54:47.461 --> 00:54:48.294
<v Speaker 2>And where would you put me there mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>neither one of those guys are in the </v>

1340
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:53.820
<v Speaker 2>middle there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm neither.</v>

1341
00:54:53.821 --> 00:54:58.821
<v Speaker 2>One of them you will see the deal is </v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them can procreate with women.</v>

1342
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:01.853
<v Speaker 2>They'll both met but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whole lot of tech people who are </v>

1343
00:55:04.981 --> 00:55:08.190
<v Speaker 2>called men cannot procreate with women a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole lot.</v>

1344
00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:10.260
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been trans women.</v>

1345
00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Trans men live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't.</v>

1346
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.440
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1347
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.890
<v Speaker 2>so they don't develop sperm or Sophia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1348
00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I really common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1349
00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Once you tested when you were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get pregnant?</v>

1350
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:22.980
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just knocked her up.</v>

1351
00:55:22.981 --> 00:55:23.814
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1352
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1353
00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:28.830
<v Speaker 2>it certainly wasn't in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And watch the fireworks.</v>

1354
00:55:28.831 --> 00:55:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1355
00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.253
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're more of a man you've just </v>

1356
00:55:32.911 --> 00:55:34.530
<v Speaker 2>proven yet again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1357
00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.550
<v Speaker 2>the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1358
00:55:35.551 --> 00:55:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you.</v>

1359
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a great picture.</v>

1360
00:55:38.081 --> 00:55:43.081
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't give you a sense of how it </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the thighs and the bolts bulge.</v>

1361
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three times as high as most women.</v>

1362
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:46.411
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1363
00:55:46.411 --> 00:55:50.160
<v Speaker 2>So reports leaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't really mean anything.</v>

1364
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she's ever really been </v>
<v Speaker 2>tested.</v>

1365
00:55:51.991 --> 00:55:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I believe she has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if she's been tested.</v>

1366
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.470
<v Speaker 2>What does the test set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it leaked.</v>

1367
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:58.343
<v Speaker 2>She was subjected to sex verification </v>
<v Speaker 2>test after she won the world </v>

1368
00:56:00.811 --> 00:56:02.910
<v Speaker 2>championships in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does it say?</v>

1369
00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Yellow results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to be confidential,</v>

1370
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:08.484
<v Speaker 2>but reports leaked out that she had </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone levels three times as high </v>

1371
00:56:10.861 --> 00:56:12.930
<v Speaker 2>as most women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other intimate details,</v>

1372
00:56:12.931 --> 00:56:13.764
<v Speaker 2>better anatomy were also reported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Somalia became targeted Semenya </v>

1373
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Semenya how brutal your first name is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The purse party named his semen.</v>

1374
00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.173
<v Speaker 2>Seaman</v>

1375
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:27.790
<v Speaker 3>became targeted with abuse on social </v>
<v Speaker 3>media,</v>

1376
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 3>but what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

1377
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.273
<v Speaker 3>So is it saying that she's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hermaphrodite because they were talking </v>

1378
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:31.620
<v Speaker 3>to</v>

1379
00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.200
<v Speaker 1>about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the clitoral size me.</v>

1380
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:35.063
<v Speaker 1>It's the equivalent of pretty much every</v>
<v Speaker 1>article written about trump by the New </v>

1381
00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:39.390
<v Speaker 1>York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1382
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:40.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1383
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:42.510
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a report was leaked by,</v>

1384
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>senior officials said,</v>

1385
00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:47.940
<v Speaker 1>where's the actual evidence of any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff?</v>

1386
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:49.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:50.640
<v Speaker 1>What does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't say anything.</v>

1388
00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:52.470
<v Speaker 1>So she passed the test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>

1389
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.300
<v Speaker 1>He must have passed the test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>

1390
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I recall,</v>

1391
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:59.760
<v Speaker 1>if I were a woman athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1392
00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1393
00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I would want rules established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1394
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:10.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like I would want rules established</v>
<v Speaker 1>defining the physical characteristics of</v>

1395
00:57:11.521 --> 00:57:13.920
<v Speaker 1>any of my potential opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1396
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:18.690
<v Speaker 1>So it could be whatever bone density,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle mass,</v>

1397
00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:20.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone levels,</v>

1398
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.211
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1399
00:57:21.211 --> 00:57:22.044
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could probably speak to this better </v>

1400
00:57:22.531 --> 00:57:23.364
<v Speaker 1>than I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure there's all sorts of ways </v>

1401
00:57:24.181 --> 00:57:26.970
<v Speaker 1>you could actually define that pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely.</v>

1402
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:28.710
<v Speaker 1>And you can test those things and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>

1403
00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:29.850
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to be in this.</v>

1404
00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:32.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like weight classes and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no different really.</v>

1405
00:57:32.581 --> 00:57:33.414
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1406
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to fight someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's 30 pounds lighter than you are.</v>

1407
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:40.710
<v Speaker 1>And so you could do that in any sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

1408
00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:41.933
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're above a certain height or </v>

1409
00:57:42.991 --> 00:57:45.210
<v Speaker 1>above a certain weight or have this much</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>

1410
00:57:45.211 --> 00:57:48.270
<v Speaker 1>are that much testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed in this category.</v>

1411
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.520
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing sexist about that.</v>

1412
00:57:50.521 --> 00:57:53.840
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing anti-trans about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different candidate,</v>

1413
00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:55.170
<v Speaker 1>but that's all that matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1414
00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:58.710
<v Speaker 1>That if that is the problem was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fallon Fox had,</v>

1415
00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:00.450
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more muscle,</v>

1416
00:58:00.451 --> 00:58:01.284
<v Speaker 1>more testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these physical characteristics that </v>

1417
00:58:03.751 --> 00:58:04.584
<v Speaker 1>were fundamentally different than all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other women fighting in that </v>

1418
00:58:07.441 --> 00:58:09.270
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that particular game.</v>

1419
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:10.900
<v Speaker 1>That's all you gotta do.</v>

1420
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Problem is that you can do damage to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>person and it's not as simple as playing</v>

1421
00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.090
<v Speaker 3>basketball against someone who had more </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>

1422
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:18.003
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also like there's a type of </v>

1423
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:24.110
<v Speaker 3>thinking that's involved in discussing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this were the you.</v>

1424
00:58:24.111 --> 00:58:27.680
<v Speaker 3>You have to follow a line of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't follow line,</v>

1425
00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:30.550
<v Speaker 3>thank you're transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a hateful person,</v>

1426
00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:33.700
<v Speaker 3>you're a bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that line of thinking is not science</v>

1427
00:58:33.701 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 3>based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not.</v>

1428
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:35.674
<v Speaker 3>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you talk to board certified </v>

1429
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:39.640
<v Speaker 3>endocrinologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they talk about Trans People?</v>

1430
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that they talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the fact that when you take estrogen,</v>

1431
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:44.403
<v Speaker 3>it actually maintains bone densities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why they give estrogen to </v>

1432
00:58:47.351 --> 00:58:48.184
<v Speaker 3>women who have osteoporosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this idea that your bone density </v>

1433
00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:54.160
<v Speaker 3>decreases when you go from being a man </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a woman.</v>

1434
00:58:54.161 --> 00:58:56.620
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're taking testosterone.</v>

1435
00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Your bone density is going to stay the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same or get thicker,</v>

1436
00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:01.053
<v Speaker 3>but if you're taking estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bone density is also going to </v>

1437
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:05.314
<v Speaker 3>maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to help you maintain so when </v>

1438
00:59:07.481 --> 00:59:10.420
<v Speaker 3>you remove the body's ability to produce</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone its own.</v>

1439
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:15.960
<v Speaker 3>There was a whole article and I'm bloody</v>
<v Speaker 3>elbow of MMA by this board,</v>

1440
00:59:16.361 --> 00:59:17.194
<v Speaker 3>certified endocrinologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Ramona sick and which she did </v>

1441
00:59:20.741 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 3>different than everything else.</v>

1442
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.930
<v Speaker 2>All these other articles is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not a gender reassignment surgeon,</v>

1443
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:27.973
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these other people that are </v>

1444
00:59:28.821 --> 00:59:33.710
<v Speaker 2>commenting on this have a vested </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in it being completely neutral.</v>

1445
00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:34.663
<v Speaker 2>There's all these people that are trans </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are commenting on it and </v>

1446
00:59:36.981 --> 00:59:37.814
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it from a very biased </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective because we're not talking </v>

1447
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:44.510
<v Speaker 2>about mountain biking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which there was a woman who used to be a</v>

1448
00:59:44.511 --> 00:59:47.930
<v Speaker 2>man who dominated mountain biking and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>became a giant issue with people.</v>

1449
00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.650
<v Speaker 2>They first supported her and then she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was winning by such enormous margins.</v>

1450
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:52.101
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1451
00:59:52.101 --> 00:59:54.290
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same as the woman in Australia.</v>

1452
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:56.600
<v Speaker 2>That's the weightlifter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is different.</v>

1453
00:59:56.601 --> 00:59:57.434
<v Speaker 2>This is fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think fighting Fox almost killed </v>

1454
01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:02.750
<v Speaker 2>that woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She beat the shit out of a few girls,</v>

1455
01:00:02.751 --> 01:00:06.350
<v Speaker 2>but then she lost Ashley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evan Smith who is a biological female,</v>

1456
01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's.</v>

1457
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:10.010
<v Speaker 2>You can beat someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1458
01:00:10.011 --> 01:00:10.844
<v Speaker 2>Ronda Rousey probably beat the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of most 135 pound men in the world that </v>

1459
01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 2>she meets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1460
01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a matter of skill level.</v>

1461
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:20.780
<v Speaker 2>It's no different than ped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like banning pdds.</v>

1462
01:00:20.781 --> 01:00:24.740
<v Speaker 2>We want to do that same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's altering the body's chemistry,</v>

1463
01:00:24.741 --> 01:00:25.850
<v Speaker 2>its abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1464
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:27.500
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't want to compete against</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

1465
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 2>show us that difference or unless you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1466
01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:31.323
<v Speaker 2>right as you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can or unless you're </v>

1467
01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:35.780
<v Speaker 2>allowed to do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's all fair,</v>

1468
01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.270
<v Speaker 2>but you couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would.</v>

1469
01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.430
<v Speaker 2>The woman would have to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone and balance it out and then</v>

1470
01:00:40.431 --> 01:00:41.264
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to find out how would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance out 30 years of my body </v>

1471
01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:44.804
<v Speaker 2>naturally producing testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing your ligaments strength and </v>

1472
01:00:46.681 --> 01:00:48.460
<v Speaker 2>conditioning attendant strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also have,</v>

1473
01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:52.700
<v Speaker 2>there's mechanical advantages of male </v>
<v Speaker 2>hips are very different when it comes to</v>

1474
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:53.480
<v Speaker 2>kicking.</v>

1475
01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.340
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to certain types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

1476
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Women's hips go out and then their legs </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of come in at an angle and it's not</v>

1477
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.260
<v Speaker 2>not the best for kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the best for a lot of different</v>

1478
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:04.640
<v Speaker 2>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different.</v>

1479
01:01:04.641 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 2>So I would just say that a trans woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely,</v>

1480
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:09.950
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman,</v>

1481
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.480
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1482
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's their identity and I respect that</v>

1483
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:17.840
<v Speaker 2>however they want to identify because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the category of woman,</v>

1484
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.100
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so fluid,</v>

1485
01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:20.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let.</v>

1486
01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:21.403
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say there's any </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute about that either that it can </v>

1487
01:01:23.691 --> 01:01:24.670
<v Speaker 2>change and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1488
01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:25.523
<v Speaker 2>comes from her ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still I respect that and I'll call </v>

1489
01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:29.780
<v Speaker 2>you a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll treat you like a woman,</v>

1490
01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:32.810
<v Speaker 2>but that means we have to change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>

1491
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:33.703
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have to have just different </v>

1492
01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:35.054
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of women's sports and man's </v>

1493
01:01:36.991 --> 01:01:37.824
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to have an woman and man </v>

1494
01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:41.000
<v Speaker 2>categories in those sports.</v>

1495
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.833
<v Speaker 2>We need to have different categories </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are about people's physical </v>

1496
01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.430
<v Speaker 2>composition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're made up of.</v>

1497
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.293
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just like weight classes and pe </v>

1498
01:01:48.481 --> 01:01:49.640
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no difference to me.</v>

1499
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:50.563
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or there could be the argument that a </v>

1500
01:01:52.401 --> 01:01:54.560
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trans woman is a woman,</v>

1501
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:57.500
<v Speaker 2>but when you're talking about athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>

1502
01:01:57.501 --> 01:01:59.390
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a very biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1503
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.253
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying if you take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have to say that someone has </v>

1504
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:03.740
<v Speaker 2>to be a biological female to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1505
01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying take the gender out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport,</v>

1506
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:06.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take that,</v>

1507
01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.450
<v Speaker 2>if you stopped calling these gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>names,</v>

1508
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:10.730
<v Speaker 2>then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's definitely not a trans issue.</v>

1509
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.770
<v Speaker 2>It's just about what your body's made up</v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1510
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.760
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjust weight class Germane to random,</v>

1511
01:02:15.761 --> 01:02:18.260
<v Speaker 2>he is pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know Rhonda Rousey more likely.</v>

1512
01:02:18.261 --> 01:02:20.610
<v Speaker 2>It's probably made just physically</v>

1513
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>more like closer to a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to Yoel Romero than Andy Dick.</v>

1514
01:02:25.471 --> 01:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going to find this and she's going</v>

1515
01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:29.280
<v Speaker 1>to find you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

1516
01:02:29.281 --> 01:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone likes to be hit,</v>

1517
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>it really choked out real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1518
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1519
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.340
<v Speaker 1>so that means I would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1520
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>there should be a category you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of in the sport,</v>

1521
01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people who are made up of that </v>

1522
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:44.964
<v Speaker 1>composition and that could be people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the society identifies as men and </v>

1523
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>who are or who identify as women or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1524
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:50.641
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

1525
01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1526
01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:54.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of work there because like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1527
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.553
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you define it and what </v>

1528
01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>parameters would use bone density?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1529
01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of African American women have</v>

1530
01:03:01.261 --> 01:03:02.094
<v Speaker 1>similar bone density to white males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does that mean you should be able to </v>

1531
01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 1>fight black checks?</v>

1532
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.893
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

1533
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:08.911
<v Speaker 1>It depends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1534
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:09.541
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1535
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:10.374
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the kind of aren't doing it up </v>

1536
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.180
<v Speaker 1>the old man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not messing with that and we'll even</v>

1537
01:03:15.181 --> 01:03:15.690
<v Speaker 1>though she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1538
01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>60 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets down to 50.</v>

1539
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.370
<v Speaker 1>You could crush me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1540
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean they are doing it.</v>

1541
01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.080
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just saw this with,</v>

1542
01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.600
<v Speaker 1>what's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A caster Semenya.</v>

1543
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.660
<v Speaker 1>But what are they doing with all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing about testosterone level.</v>

1544
01:03:27.661 --> 01:03:29.400
<v Speaker 1>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually they mentioned her.</v>

1545
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1546
01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a number for testosterone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be below,</v>

1547
01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1548
01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>to compete in that sport as a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1549
01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just add more categories,</v>

1550
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.880
<v Speaker 1>not just testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have.</v>

1551
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:43.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what this says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1552
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.600
<v Speaker 1>It says your testosterone goes above a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain level.</v>

1553
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to compete as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

1554
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:51.180
<v Speaker 1>So I'm saying have that category and add</v>
<v Speaker 1>more categories like that.</v>

1555
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.760
<v Speaker 1>And don't call it women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And men just say it's category x.</v>

1556
01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:57.030
<v Speaker 1>You get to compete in this category if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your testosterone,</v>

1557
01:03:57.530 --> 01:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>androgens what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so ridiculously loose.</v>

1558
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.160
<v Speaker 1>It's saying a female with Hypo Androgen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ism who is recognized as a female in law</v>

1559
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:08.693
<v Speaker 1>shall be eligible to compete and women's</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition in athletics provided that </v>

1560
01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:14.550
<v Speaker 1>she has androgen levels below the male </v>
<v Speaker 1>range,</v>

1561
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 1>like all you have to do is just be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple notches below the male range,</v>

1562
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:18.803
<v Speaker 1>which is way above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying that's all objectively </v>

1563
01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:23.514
<v Speaker 1>determined you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get her to take </v>

1564
01:04:25.021 --> 01:04:27.660
<v Speaker 1>suppression medication or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1565
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.393
<v Speaker 1>This is all proving my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are objectively determine with </v>

1566
01:04:31.761 --> 01:04:35.310
<v Speaker 1>them making her tone it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have numbers.</v>

1567
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>We say if you hit this number for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

1568
01:04:38.551 --> 01:04:41.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to compete here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is so,</v>

1569
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>so rare.</v>

1570
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean she has a disease essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>where she produces too much to stop.</v>

1571
01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:47.520
<v Speaker 1>This would apply to trans people is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying.</v>

1572
01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you.</v>

1573
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:50.183
<v Speaker 1>But what it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even so you're still dealing </v>

1574
01:04:52.561 --> 01:04:54.650
<v Speaker 1>with the mechanical advantages of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>male frame.</v>

1575
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:56.850
<v Speaker 1>The wider shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to hitting.</v>

1576
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.090
<v Speaker 1>We could do that too and we do it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight already.</v>

1577
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Why not a height?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1578
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1579
01:05:03.961 --> 01:05:06.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot of work I thought about that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

1580
01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have to like in weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes,</v>

1581
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a huge advantage.</v>

1582
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I always use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm six,</v>

1583
01:05:12.511 --> 01:05:15.300
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 65 and I've really long arms,</v>

1584
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>so like most the time</v>

1585
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 2>people can't get inside my job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just put it out there.</v>

1586
01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:21.904
<v Speaker 2>They can and it's just a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I often feel like this </v>

1587
01:05:24.071 --> 01:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>isn't really fair in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1588
01:05:26.081 --> 01:05:26.914
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to be as good as they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be looser and it's true for a lot </v>

1589
01:05:30.191 --> 01:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>of fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once they get inside on you,</v>

1590
01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.213
<v Speaker 2>they have an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Mike Tyson used that advantage of </v>

1591
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:38.530
<v Speaker 2>being 5:10 on a lot of fighters an </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage.</v>

1592
01:05:38.531 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 2>I think he just was really good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcoming it.</v>

1593
01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:41.663
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an in fighting and </v>

1594
01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:44.584
<v Speaker 2>having shorter arms and he did the lower</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did the peekaboo past the jab </v>

1595
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.970
<v Speaker 2>maximize really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1596
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:52.460
<v Speaker 2>He did that thing where it's did rocky </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marciano and Danny,</v>

1597
01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:53.603
<v Speaker 2>he had a really good way of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of slipping the jab and moving </v>

1598
01:05:58.001 --> 01:05:58.834
<v Speaker 2>constantly until he was inside on you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he will crush you with this </v>

1599
01:06:00.431 --> 01:06:02.170
<v Speaker 2>huge left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once he's there,</v>

1600
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have an advantage on you.</v>

1601
01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:04.683
<v Speaker 2>He's just there and he's Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't think it's harder for a </v>

1602
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:07.534
<v Speaker 2>guy with a long ass spider arms to punch</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who is in tight on you with short </v>

1603
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:14.110
<v Speaker 2>arms and is throwing shots to the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Tyson.</v>

1604
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:15.890
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1605
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:19.270
<v Speaker 2>I think there's advantages as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are physically competent.</v>

1606
01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:20.104
<v Speaker 2>There's advantages in particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements and positions to all sorts of </v>

1607
01:06:22.961 --> 01:06:25.840
<v Speaker 2>different body styles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very true in Jujitsu guys with long</v>

1608
01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:29.020
<v Speaker 2>arms and long legs and digits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have massive advantages with chokes.</v>

1609
01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 2>You guys can get Darcis and guillotines </v>
<v Speaker 2>and triangles easier,</v>

1610
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:33.723
<v Speaker 2>but you can also get arm barred easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the mechanical advantages and </v>

1611
01:06:36.221 --> 01:06:37.410
<v Speaker 2>armbarring you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1612
01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:38.363
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some weird advantages to being </v>

1613
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.570
<v Speaker 2>like a twosome are Paul Horez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stocky short guy.</v>

1614
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Here's basket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about basketball?</v>

1615
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:45.911
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1616
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:47.350
<v Speaker 2>it's all advantages tall.</v>

1617
01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact there are leagues,</v>

1618
01:06:49.481 --> 01:06:50.314
<v Speaker 2>not an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually there might be professional </v>

1619
01:06:51.161 --> 01:06:51.910
<v Speaker 2>leagues which are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1620
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:53.600
<v Speaker 2>six feet and under leagues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant.</v>

1621
01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many leads.</v>

1622
01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:56.123
<v Speaker 2>Many P,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very common because most people </v>

1623
01:06:57.401 --> 01:06:58.630
<v Speaker 2>are under six feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1624
01:06:58.631 --> 01:06:59.464
<v Speaker 2>So who could never play in the NBA even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though they're amazing basketball </v>

1625
01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:03.004
<v Speaker 2>players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just don't have the arm length </v>

1626
01:07:04.211 --> 01:07:05.440
<v Speaker 2>and they don't have the height and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1627
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:07.870
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we just need more divisions.</v>

1628
01:07:07.871 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 2>The UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have like,</v>

1629
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:09.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welter weight,</v>

1630
01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:13.250
<v Speaker 2>it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be heights within it to was</v>

1631
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:14.680
<v Speaker 2>only five nines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a current.</v>

1632
01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Isaiah Thomas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a good player for the number ones.</v>

1633
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:18.723
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the guys that are under six foot </v>

1634
01:07:20.651 --> 01:07:21.281
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great,</v>

1635
01:07:21.281 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 2>great player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Around six foot.</v>

1636
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.800
<v Speaker 2>They get listed higher to the cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So interesting.</v>

1637
01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:26.610
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1638
01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.360
<v Speaker 2>He's sort of the exception that proves </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rule.</v>

1639
01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.170
<v Speaker 2>He's five nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's really successful.</v>

1640
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's five,</v>

1641
01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:32.260
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1642
01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.970
<v Speaker 2>six or something like three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1643
01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:35.110
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1644
01:07:35.111 --> 01:07:38.180
<v Speaker 2>three and dunked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spicy.</v>

1645
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Did five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1646
01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mugs,</v>

1647
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:41.620
<v Speaker 2>you'd pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

1648
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Jamie is my wheelhouse and you're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's wheelhouse in a big way,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bogues.</v>

1651
01:07:50.641 --> 01:07:53.020
<v Speaker 2>He may not have been a super clean dunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a dunk.</v>

1652
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let go with a video.</v>

1654
01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.680
<v Speaker 2>That's my life goal was to say pull it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up Jamie.</v>

1655
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This spot web was mugsy.</v>

1657
01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never seen it in my google.</v>

1658
01:08:10.171 --> 01:08:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Muggsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bogues.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Muggsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bogues dunk and he did it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Google that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muggsy.</v>

1662
01:08:17.151 --> 01:08:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Bogues dunk Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number two on Google.</v>

1663
01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Let's say I got to watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

1664
01:08:21.771 --> 01:08:25.330
<v Speaker 2>ever seen this in my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1665
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 2>He just in a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably not real.</v>

1666
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1667
01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:30.963
<v Speaker 2>but he really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promise you in Mba life is in my </v>

1668
01:08:33.021 --> 01:08:35.180
<v Speaker 2>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it wasn't a clean,</v>

1669
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.193
<v Speaker 2>super clean dunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did get the ball above the rim </v>

1670
01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:38.624
<v Speaker 2>with his hand on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get to the bottom of </v>

1671
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.090
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1672
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.983
<v Speaker 2>join,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get to that place is pretty </v>

1673
01:08:43.401 --> 01:08:47.150
<v Speaker 2>essential if we don't solve this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure of a podcast.</v>

1674
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference I think between</v>
<v Speaker 2>team sports where you know,</v>

1675
01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:51.183
<v Speaker 2>you could have an advantage of having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spud webb or muggsy bogues very mobile </v>

1676
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:58.370
<v Speaker 2>agile kind of guy who can set plays up </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus guy like Shaq,</v>

1677
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:59.383
<v Speaker 2>big giant guy who can get in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and I think there's all sorts of </v>

1678
01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:04.484
<v Speaker 2>advantages and disadvantages of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>size when you're talking about </v>

1679
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:08.450
<v Speaker 2>individuals against individuals.</v>

1680
01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.553
<v Speaker 2>That's where things get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're talking about </v>

1681
01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:14.430
<v Speaker 2>combat sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where people have just.</v>

1682
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.480
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that just have these</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous advantages.</v>

1683
01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1684
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Paul Daley is ridiculous power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like almost unfair.</v>

1685
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Like he hits guys and just obliterate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1686
01:09:25.341 --> 01:09:27.230
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not just strength.</v>

1687
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.250
<v Speaker 2>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also geometry.</v>

1689
01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Body geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1690
01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1691
01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Lot of skinny dudes like me have power </v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

1692
01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:36.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

1693
01:09:36.730 --> 01:09:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1694
01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.020
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of big Tommy hearns was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best example is a bunch of them,</v>

1695
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.983
<v Speaker 2>but he's also like this wide and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>his waist is like this and this angle </v>

1696
01:09:45.631 --> 01:09:48.830
<v Speaker 2>just I've thought it's actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually thought his shoulder with.</v>

1697
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what I'm saying.</v>

1698
01:09:50.001 --> 01:09:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get that slide.</v>

1699
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:54.830
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shoulders like that torque.</v>

1700
01:09:54.831 --> 01:09:55.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1701
01:09:55.431 --> 01:09:57.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's more to swing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1702
01:09:57.681 --> 01:09:58.010
<v Speaker 2>That way.</v>

1703
01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1704
01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Wide shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1705
01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:01.880
<v Speaker 2>rotate around the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1706
01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:03.003
<v Speaker 2>Oftentimes equate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when they learn striking </v>

1707
01:10:04.911 --> 01:10:05.744
<v Speaker 2>sports at an early age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They learn how to develop that snap and </v>

1708
01:10:08.091 --> 01:10:10.130
<v Speaker 2>fluidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tenants to a lot of muscle bound.</v>

1709
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Guys don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

1710
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.320
<v Speaker 2>So they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have it.</v>

1711
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I want you to go talk to Dana and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1712
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:18.100
<v Speaker 2>get this going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

1713
01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:20.170
<v Speaker 2>we need a height,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1714
01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.450
<v Speaker 2>divisions we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1715
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:24.060
<v Speaker 2>we need testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1716
01:10:24.061 --> 01:10:25.940
<v Speaker 2>division to comp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone level,</v>

1717
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:28.040
<v Speaker 2>division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to have estrogen level divisions.</v>

1718
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.053
<v Speaker 2>I think we're where are literally one </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation away from being able to use </v>

1719
01:10:33.411 --> 01:10:34.244
<v Speaker 2>crispr and all these new genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering tools to make people </v>

1720
01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:38.924
<v Speaker 2>whatever style of person you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to be able to </v>

1721
01:10:41.901 --> 01:10:42.734
<v Speaker 2>develop six foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four super athletes that look like </v>

1722
01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Josh or Vitali Klitschko or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vladimir Klitschko.</v>

1723
01:10:48.651 --> 01:10:52.160
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be able to make those </v>
<v Speaker 2>now what I would give for bionic knees,</v>

1724
01:10:52.161 --> 01:10:52.870
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1725
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:54.510
<v Speaker 2>These are fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but never when they're not,</v>

1726
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:55.271
<v Speaker 2>they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>

1727
01:10:55.271 --> 01:10:56.660
<v Speaker 2>They're problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can.</v>

1728
01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.480
<v Speaker 2>I can function fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they could go out and anytime.</v>

1729
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.460
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've never been worried about that,</v>

1730
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.200
<v Speaker 2>he never had to worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1731
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1732
01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:05.564
<v Speaker 2>if you could just reduce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you what they were </v>

1733
01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:10.070
<v Speaker 2>talking about before the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing now with stem cells,</v>

1734
01:11:10.071 --> 01:11:12.710
<v Speaker 2>with soft tissue injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tremendous.</v>

1735
01:11:12.711 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really amazing.</v>

1736
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.863
<v Speaker 2>It's never happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're able to do to people that </v>

1737
01:11:17.401 --> 01:11:18.234
<v Speaker 2>have meniscus injuries is literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot stem cells in there and you've </v>

1738
01:11:21.421 --> 01:11:23.200
<v Speaker 2>regenerate meniscus tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1739
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:27.120
<v Speaker 2>that's just never happened before and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that this is baby steps.</v>

1740
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I think what we're at right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1741
01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:31.140
<v Speaker 2>really young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think 20,</v>

1742
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.310
<v Speaker 2>30 years from now because 20 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't really use it at all.</v>

1743
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be insane.</v>

1744
01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:38.491
<v Speaker 2>Got to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1745
01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 2>they're regenerated a woman's bladder </v>
<v Speaker 2>using her skin tissue.</v>

1746
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:45.360
<v Speaker 2>They built her a bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had bladder cancer.</v>

1747
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.220
<v Speaker 2>They built her a bladder and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>reinstalled it in her body.</v>

1748
01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Now she has a functional bladder that </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out of her own body.</v>

1749
01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.330
<v Speaker 2>They're regenerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're gonna be able to do that</v>

1750
01:11:54.331 --> 01:11:56.760
<v Speaker 2>with tendons and ligaments and all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of tissue.</v>

1751
01:11:56.761 --> 01:11:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully this is really promising.</v>

1752
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:02.040
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be able to do that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain tissue,</v>

1753
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:05.590
<v Speaker 2>so people that have had brain injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have had cte,</v>

1754
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:06.623
<v Speaker 2>they're hopefully going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use some of these therapies to </v>

1755
01:12:08.401 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 2>regenerate brain tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1756
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's huge.</v>

1757
01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Neurogenesis is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1758
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:16.410
<v Speaker 2>that's the promise land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless him.</v>

1759
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about science.</v>

1760
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a complete idiot when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to math and science.</v>

1761
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:22.350
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go for it.</v>

1762
01:12:22.351 --> 01:12:23.970
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as universities,</v>

1763
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1764
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I am the harshest critics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities generally,</v>

1765
01:12:28.321 --> 01:12:29.154
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly what I'm talking about it </v>

1766
01:12:29.651 --> 01:12:31.950
<v Speaker 2>actually the humanities and social </v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences when I do that,</v>

1767
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.710
<v Speaker 2>what goes on in the biology building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chemistry building,</v>

1768
01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.240
<v Speaker 2>the physics building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1769
01:12:36.241 --> 01:12:40.650
<v Speaker 2>but I know that what comes out of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a better life for me and all of us,</v>

1770
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 2>they're making this stuff that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about and so go for it.</v>

1771
01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:45.140
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1772
01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:46.380
<v Speaker 2>renegade universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1773
01:12:46.381 --> 01:12:47.850
<v Speaker 2>we're not gonna do no science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to let,</v>

1774
01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.130
<v Speaker 2>we're going to let Harvard and mit keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

1775
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Have that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1776
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:52.913
<v Speaker 2>because you're doing great stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no critique of that as far as I </v>

1777
01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:55.374
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing going on there that's </v>

1778
01:12:55.711 --> 01:12:56.544
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the humanities and social </v>

1779
01:12:58.021 --> 01:12:59.430
<v Speaker 2>sciences that are utterly corrupt.</v>

1780
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:00.323
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got way off the track here with what </v>

1781
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.260
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about initially was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson.</v>

1782
01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:05.403
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with him when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender and what you agree with him when </v>

1783
01:13:07.771 --> 01:13:08.604
<v Speaker 2>it comes to the suppression of </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of professors and all the </v>

1784
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:13.673
<v Speaker 2>people worried about being called racist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sexist and anything else stifling </v>

1785
01:13:17.161 --> 01:13:20.870
<v Speaker 2>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what he's facing is even worse than,</v>

1786
01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:24.060
<v Speaker 2>than what goes on in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense.</v>

1787
01:13:24.061 --> 01:13:26.310
<v Speaker 2>And that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now legal persecution.</v>

1788
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.140
<v Speaker 2>He is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1789
01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:33.240
<v Speaker 2>it's against the law to not use these </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender pronouns in your class.</v>

1790
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that suppression of speech,</v>

1791
01:13:36.571 --> 01:13:37.404
<v Speaker 2>that suppression of Academic Freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a complete violation of those </v>

1792
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:40.261
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact.</v>

1793
01:13:40.261 --> 01:13:43.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's totalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's nothing,</v>

1794
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:46.520
<v Speaker 2>no two ways around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My uncle at Canada has these,</v>

1795
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:48.020
<v Speaker 2>these laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1796
01:13:48.021 --> 01:13:49.920
<v Speaker 2>And they have a human rights commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called or human,</v>

1797
01:13:49.921 --> 01:13:51.960
<v Speaker 2>something conditioned human rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>council council.</v>

1798
01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:52.794
<v Speaker 2>And they do this body of people who sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and decide who should have a </v>

1799
01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:57.720
<v Speaker 2>website or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my uncle is actually happened to him</v>

1800
01:13:57.721 --> 01:13:58.554
<v Speaker 2>about 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was accused of being a Holocaust </v>

1801
01:13:59.821 --> 01:14:00.654
<v Speaker 2>denier because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't even know exactly what he </v>

1802
01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:04.224
<v Speaker 2>was saying on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a Ukrainian and I think he was </v>

1803
01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:06.834
<v Speaker 2>sorta just defending these Ukrainians </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were accused of being Nazis during </v>

1804
01:14:10.121 --> 01:14:11.680
<v Speaker 2>the World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1805
01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't</v>

1806
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.960
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if he were a holocaust denier,</v>

1807
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.790
<v Speaker 1>he should have his website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1808
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:17.710
<v Speaker 1>The Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to that url,</v>

1809
01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:18.840
<v Speaker 1>it's shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In effect,</v>

1810
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:19.683
<v Speaker 1>they put a banner now it says this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now controlled by the Canadian </v>

1811
01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:24.240
<v Speaker 1>government or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1812
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:24.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1813
01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:26.650
<v Speaker 1>They have no free speech in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no.</v>

1814
01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:27.484
<v Speaker 1>There's no sort of doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legal or otherwise in Canada of free </v>

1815
01:14:30.611 --> 01:14:33.010
<v Speaker 1>speech is bad and that's what Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's facing.</v>

1816
01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:33.844
<v Speaker 1>It's because he's Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would not happen in the United </v>

1817
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>States until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1818
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:37.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sociologists take control and then </v>

1819
01:14:40.331 --> 01:14:42.190
<v Speaker 1>they will have these laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have them here,</v>

1820
01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.160
<v Speaker 1>so he actually could go to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's,</v>

1821
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:50.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could go to prison for not saying xer</v>

1822
01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:53.520
<v Speaker 3>in his class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an article that vice published</v>

1823
01:14:53.521 --> 01:14:54.354
<v Speaker 3>that someone linked to me today about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this that I did not read yet because I </v>

1824
01:14:57.781 --> 01:14:58.614
<v Speaker 3>announced the Jordan is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>returning to the podcasts and someone </v>

1825
01:15:00.751 --> 01:15:05.460
<v Speaker 3>was saying that his interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these laws is greatly exaggerated.</v>

1826
01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:08.850
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very recent advice article.</v>

1827
01:15:08.851 --> 01:15:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it's illegal and illegal</v>
<v Speaker 3>means you can go to prison.</v>

1828
01:15:11.791 --> 01:15:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Jordan's wrong and I don't</v>

1829
01:15:13.861 --> 01:15:14.550
<v Speaker 3>think he would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1830
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1831
01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:15.680
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked into this.</v>

1832
01:15:15.681 --> 01:15:18.020
<v Speaker 1>It's elite because that matters a lot to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1833
01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:20.323
<v Speaker 1>I am a hundred percent and solidarity </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him on that and he's completely </v>

1834
01:15:24.531 --> 01:15:25.364
<v Speaker 1>right that the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one should be telling him to what to </v>

1835
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:28.783
<v Speaker 1>say in his classroom and certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be going to prison for it or </v>

1836
01:15:30.801 --> 01:15:34.490
<v Speaker 1>being threatened in any way legally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just a fine a fine.</v>

1837
01:15:34.491 --> 01:15:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't understand this.</v>

1838
01:15:35.721 --> 01:15:36.554
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible how people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that everything the state </v>

1839
01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:43.190
<v Speaker 1>does is enforced by the threat of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate violence.</v>

1840
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my mother even said this recently.</v>

1841
01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:46.701
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1842
01:15:46.701 --> 01:15:47.534
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no violence with parking </v>

1843
01:15:48.591 --> 01:15:49.820
<v Speaker 1>tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just send you a fine.</v>

1844
01:15:49.821 --> 01:15:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1845
01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.790
<v Speaker 1>So if you get the fine and you don't pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1846
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:54.223
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we get another notice and another </v>

1847
01:15:55.341 --> 01:15:55.941
<v Speaker 1>notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1848
01:15:55.941 --> 01:15:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Mom and then another notice and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally what happens?</v>

1849
01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Korryn gaines is black woman in Maryland</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago.</v>

1850
01:16:01.701 --> 01:16:02.534
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a bunch of traffic tickets and </v>

1851
01:16:03.951 --> 01:16:07.370
<v Speaker 1>she's refused to pay them and ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened,</v>

1852
01:16:07.371 --> 01:16:08.204
<v Speaker 1>the Swat team came to her house and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled a gun and they shot her in the </v>

1853
01:16:12.681 --> 01:16:16.190
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was over traffic fines.</v>

1854
01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

1855
01:16:17.841 --> 01:16:21.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means to make something </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal at the end of the day,</v>

1856
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.810
<v Speaker 1>for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For it to be meaningful as a law,</v>

1857
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.883
<v Speaker 1>the state has to use lethal violence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforce it or the potential for lethal </v>

1858
01:16:30.051 --> 01:16:30.771
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1859
01:16:30.771 --> 01:16:34.310
<v Speaker 1>if you don't pay your taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's $100 in taxes,</v>

1860
01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.160
<v Speaker 1>ultimately otherwise the law is </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless,</v>

1861
01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:38.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to eat.</v>

1862
01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.370
<v Speaker 1>They have to put you in prison or kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1863
01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.373
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what was most offensive about </v>

1864
01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:43.900
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sandra Bland case,</v>

1865
01:16:43.901 --> 01:16:46.960
<v Speaker 3>when you got to hear the interaction </v>
<v Speaker 3>between her and the cop,</v>

1866
01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:48.063
<v Speaker 3>she did nothing wrong and this cop is </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragging her out of the car and then </v>

1867
01:16:51.551 --> 01:16:54.530
<v Speaker 3>ultimately she died and they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>how she died and there's,</v>

1868
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:55.383
<v Speaker 3>she was pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She talked back because he pulled her </v>

1869
01:16:57.131 --> 01:16:58.680
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fleet told her to put out her cigarette.</v>

1870
01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:00.003
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

1871
01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:02.730
<v Speaker 3>because she was being disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1872
01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:04.600
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you listen to the,</v>

1873
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:05.810
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual record.</v>

1874
01:17:05.811 --> 01:17:06.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1875
01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 3>She just wasn't following him to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

1876
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.250
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't treating him with respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he felt he deserved hold on there.</v>

1877
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I think she was being disrespectful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why she's my hero.</v>

1878
01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because think she was disrespectful.</v>

1879
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:20.563
<v Speaker 1>That's why she's a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think she was because you </v>

1880
01:17:23.781 --> 01:17:25.400
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't respect that.</v>

1881
01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.253
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's dangerous and that's why </v>

1882
01:17:26.841 --> 01:17:28.450
<v Speaker 1>she's a martyr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

1883
01:17:28.451 --> 01:17:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it to people.</v>

1884
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't tell my son to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he deserved no respect.</v>

1885
01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:40.310
<v Speaker 1>The law enforcing that law in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating her in that way,</v>

1886
01:17:40.311 --> 01:17:41.144
<v Speaker 1>in that moment was deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No respect whatsoever and that's to me </v>

1887
01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:47.000
<v Speaker 1>why she's the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that she was a victim,</v>

1888
01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.073
<v Speaker 1>she was a victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me what was great about her was </v>

1889
01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:51.410
<v Speaker 1>that she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1890
01:17:51.411 --> 01:17:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna put up my cigarette and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why did you pull me over for this?</v>

1891
01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:54.830
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1892
01:17:54.831 --> 01:17:55.664
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no reason to pull me over and </v>

1893
01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:58.100
<v Speaker 1>do this to me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my way to someplace.</v>

1894
01:17:58.101 --> 01:18:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is she getting pulled over for.</v>

1895
01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was as it was a lighter.</v>

1896
01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.030
<v Speaker 1>So she like didn't turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a turn signal.</v>

1897
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something really trivial.</v>

1898
01:18:07.541 --> 01:18:08.374
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he has the right to tell </v>

1899
01:18:09.621 --> 01:18:13.700
<v Speaker 1>her to put out her cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not a disrespectful thing.</v>

1900
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:14.893
<v Speaker 1>He's overstepping his boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do in your car smoking a </v>

1901
01:18:19.221 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 1>cigarette in her car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the right,</v>

1902
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:21.703
<v Speaker 1>they have the right and I think in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>municipalities the obligation because </v>

1903
01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you are supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing where Joe,</v>

1904
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.393
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the other thing is this is the </v>

1905
01:18:29.841 --> 01:18:31.160
<v Speaker 1>thing that La rests upon.</v>

1906
01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.580
<v Speaker 1>It rests upon us respecting legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities.</v>

1907
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.620
<v Speaker 1>If we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there ain't no law.</v>

1908
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:37.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no legal authority for you </v>

1909
01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:43.901
<v Speaker 1>to stop you from doing a lawful act like</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she has a cigarette lit in our car.</v>

1910
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.800
<v Speaker 1>When she gets pulled over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cops says,</v>

1911
01:18:45.801 --> 01:18:48.380
<v Speaker 1>put your cigarette out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's doing is just controlling her.</v>

1912
01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.750
<v Speaker 1>They don't think they give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>latitude.</v>

1913
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.793
<v Speaker 1>They give the cops latitude in </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining who is obeying their orders </v>

1914
01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:56.660
<v Speaker 1>and not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if this could be.</v>

1915
01:18:56.661 --> 01:18:59.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure this yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending this.</v>

1916
01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that in court,</v>

1917
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:02.114
<v Speaker 1>I would bet you anything he would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that show that she wasn't listening to </v>

1918
01:19:05.421 --> 01:19:07.610
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't obeying my orders.</v>

1919
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:08.653
<v Speaker 1>I think he told her to put her hands on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car or something and she had a </v>

1920
01:19:10.521 --> 01:19:11.354
<v Speaker 1>cigarette or enhance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she had to take the cigarette out of </v>

1921
01:19:13.191 --> 01:19:14.510
<v Speaker 1>her hand to do what he was asking.</v>

1922
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.493
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that's all worthy of </v>

1923
01:19:18.381 --> 01:19:20.240
<v Speaker 1>disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defending it at all.</v>

1924
01:19:20.241 --> 01:19:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing though about this,</v>

1925
01:19:23.061 --> 01:19:25.580
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I've been working </v>
<v Speaker 1>on lately and uh,</v>

1926
01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing some work with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at free think media about this,</v>

1927
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've changed my mind about this.</v>

1928
01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:35.373
<v Speaker 1>This has been a new thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have thought about race my whole life </v>

1929
01:19:37.131 --> 01:19:38.540
<v Speaker 1>basically really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

1930
01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've changed my mind about this when,</v>

1931
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.800
<v Speaker 1>when things like that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandra Bland,</v>

1932
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Mike Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Garner,</v>

1933
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.943
<v Speaker 1>even Walter Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was shot in the back in </v>

1934
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.130
<v Speaker 1>South Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have you got where they planted the</v>

1935
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Taser?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1936
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:54.320
<v Speaker 1>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on there.</v>

1937
01:19:55.070 --> 01:20:00.070
<v Speaker 1>So I like everyone in the country pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>much saw those things and thought a,</v>

1938
01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:05.090
<v Speaker 1>that's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A and B,</v>

1939
01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:06.650
<v Speaker 1>that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1940
01:20:06.651 --> 01:20:07.484
<v Speaker 1>And that what people do overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>is they focus on what they believe is </v>

1941
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:16.470
<v Speaker 1>the racism of the cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual,</v>

1942
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:21.360
<v Speaker 1>that that's what caused those cops to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot those guns in those moments.</v>

1943
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:23.333
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a mistake for one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will never know why they chose to </v>

1944
01:20:28.441 --> 01:20:29.850
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull the trigger in that moment.</v>

1945
01:20:29.851 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 1>We will never know that it was racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to prove that.</v>

1946
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:35.170
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to demonstrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1947
01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:38.760
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing we can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1948
01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:43.320
<v Speaker 1>What can you do to change people's ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>about race or black people?</v>

1949
01:20:43.321 --> 01:20:44.154
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not anytime soon what all </v>

1950
01:20:47.731 --> 01:20:49.810
<v Speaker 1>those cops were doing and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>instances.</v>

1951
01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:50.723
<v Speaker 1>And this is why they got off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were following the law and they </v>

1952
01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:58.350
<v Speaker 1>were following police procedure which </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually obligated them to do,</v>

1953
01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.590
<v Speaker 1>to do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Walter Scott,</v>

1954
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:05.820
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was convinced that was a racist cop,</v>

1955
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.710
<v Speaker 1>that that was clearly a bad killing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a bad killing,</v>

1956
01:21:10.711 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 1>but not for the reasons that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1957
01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I have no way to know whether that cop </v>
<v Speaker 1>was racist and that's why he did that.</v>

1958
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.810
<v Speaker 1>But if we do know and people have done </v>
<v Speaker 1>work on this,</v>

1959
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:24.290
<v Speaker 1>that he is very reasonable to assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was doing in that moment what he</v>

1960
01:21:24.631 --> 01:21:25.464
<v Speaker 1>was obligated to do by law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is if you look at the video </v>

1961
01:21:27.241 --> 01:21:28.074
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he very well could have thought that </v>

1962
01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:35.811
<v Speaker 1>Scott was still holding his taser </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Scott grabbed the Taser and then</v>

1963
01:21:36.661 --> 01:21:37.494
<v Speaker 1>dropped it immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at where the cop is </v>

1964
01:21:39.451 --> 01:21:40.284
<v Speaker 1>looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he may not have seen that we're talking </v>

1965
01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:42.933
<v Speaker 1>about different thing then because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the cop that shot the guy </v>

1966
01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:49.080
<v Speaker 1>and then drop the Taser near his body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the same thing.</v>

1967
01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:50.653
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I grabbed the Taser that </v>

1968
01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:53.650
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1969
01:21:53.651 --> 01:21:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walter Scott grabs his taser.</v>

1970
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.110
<v Speaker 1>He grabbed the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taser crab footage,</v>

1971
01:21:57.130 --> 01:21:57.990
<v Speaker 1>just ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled,</v>

1972
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 1>not pulled the Taser out of his holster </v>
<v Speaker 1>and had it for a second and then,</v>

1973
01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:02.970
<v Speaker 1>and then started to run.</v>

1974
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And as he's turning to run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he drops it immediately and he's running</v>

1975
01:22:07.111 --> 01:22:07.860
<v Speaker 1>away and it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1976
01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:08.700
<v Speaker 1>a good whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

1977
01:22:08.701 --> 01:22:10.470
<v Speaker 1>20 yards away and the cop shoots him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>

1978
01:22:10.471 --> 01:22:11.304
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So according to South Carolina police </v>

1979
01:22:14.041 --> 01:22:14.874
<v Speaker 1>procedure and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and according to the Supreme Court </v>

1980
01:22:16.051 --> 01:22:17.810
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1981
01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:18.683
<v Speaker 1>the cop not only was had the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the obligation to use lethal force </v>

1982
01:22:22.711 --> 01:22:23.544
<v Speaker 1>because he could have believed in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment that Scott still held the Taser </v>

1983
01:22:27.121 --> 01:22:27.954
<v Speaker 1>in his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a person takes a police officer's </v>

1984
01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.280
<v Speaker 1>weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>police are obligated to use lethal force</v>

1985
01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:37.740
<v Speaker 1>to stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look,</v>

1986
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:38.760
<v Speaker 1>you just have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1987
01:22:38.761 --> 01:22:41.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a documentary about this.</v>

1988
01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It's called frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the number,</v>

1989
01:22:43.471 --> 01:22:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's three 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be able to find it,</v>

1990
01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:46.883
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1991
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:49.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not definite,</v>

1992
01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.040
<v Speaker 1>but this is what happened.</v>

1993
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.840
<v Speaker 1>But it is plausible if you look the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1994
01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:54.970
<v Speaker 1>where the cop was looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he may not have seen that,</v>

1995
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.963
<v Speaker 1>that the Taser was on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super confused because I thought </v>

1996
01:22:58.231 --> 01:22:59.640
<v Speaker 1>that the cough drop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

1997
01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not venting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1998
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:01.170
<v Speaker 1>let me finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

1999
01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:03.330
<v Speaker 1>so Scott running away 20 yard shots in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>

2000
01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Then the cop walks over to him during </v>
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>

2001
01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 1>He does see that the tasers on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground next to him,</v>

2002
01:23:09.761 --> 01:23:11.500
<v Speaker 1>next to the cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he picks up the Taser.</v>

2003
01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:15.940
<v Speaker 1>The cop does walks over and drops it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground next to Scott momentarily and</v>

2004
01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:18.380
<v Speaker 1>then picks it back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2005
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 1>so who knows what was going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2006
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:24.340
<v Speaker 1>he may have been insured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he may have been trying to cover himself</v>

2007
01:23:24.341 --> 01:23:27.370
<v Speaker 1>in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually he didn't need to that cop.</v>

2008
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:28.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what happened with that trial?</v>

2009
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a hung jury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2010
01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:35.480
<v Speaker 1>he's free because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm sure we don't know for sure,</v>

2011
01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:38.920
<v Speaker 1>but I know that this was the argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>made by by the cops lawyer,</v>

2012
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:44.430
<v Speaker 1>was that it is totally reasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that he believed he was.</v>

2013
01:23:44.591 --> 01:23:49.591
<v Speaker 1>He had reason to shoot him legally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one part of that story,</v>

2014
01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:52.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is that the law is the problem.</v>

2015
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:53.523
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not The cops stopped focusing on that </v>

2016
01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:56.890
<v Speaker 1>copy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never find out.</v>

2017
01:23:56.891 --> 01:23:59.290
<v Speaker 1>You'll never be able to prove that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it because he's a racist.</v>

2018
01:23:59.291 --> 01:24:00.990
<v Speaker 1>And even if we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that going to give two?</v>

2019
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.863
<v Speaker 1>What's that going to get us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to save anybody the </v>

2020
01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:04.600
<v Speaker 1>next time this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2021
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:06.550
<v Speaker 1>but what will save people's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we,</v>

2022
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:07.623
<v Speaker 1>if we change those laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the worst law that really made </v>

2023
01:24:10.151 --> 01:24:12.880
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing happened in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that no one's talking about.</v>

2024
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.030
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing started when Scott was </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving through North Charleston,</v>

2025
01:24:16.031 --> 01:24:18.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Cop,</v>

2026
01:24:18.071 --> 01:24:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a suspended license plate</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>

2027
01:24:20.771 --> 01:24:22.540
<v Speaker 1>or a tail light tail light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was taillight.</v>

2028
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Something trivial pulls them over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>

2029
01:24:25.181 --> 01:24:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Scott was in arrears on child support </v>
<v Speaker 1>payments.</v>

2030
01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:29.643
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go to.</v>

2031
01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to prison if you.</v>

2032
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.370
<v Speaker 1>If you get behind on your child support </v>
<v Speaker 1>payments,</v>

2033
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:34.263
<v Speaker 1>and he had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think put in jail a few times in his </v>

2034
01:24:35.741 --> 01:24:36.574
<v Speaker 1>life for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get put in prison and there's a </v>

2035
01:24:39.611 --> 01:24:43.270
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of men right now as we speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>in prison for that very reason,</v>

2036
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:45.940
<v Speaker 1>and these child support payments by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2037
01:24:45.941 --> 01:24:50.941
<v Speaker 1>are set by judges often in a system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>read that massively favors the women,</v>

2038
01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 1>the mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole system.</v>

2039
01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:56.560
<v Speaker 1>You've never been divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2040
01:24:57.010 --> 01:24:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2041
01:24:58.391 --> 01:24:59.224
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you enter it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see right away that the whole thing </v>

2042
01:25:01.511 --> 01:25:03.700
<v Speaker 1>is stacked against us and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2043
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2044
01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:07.270
<v Speaker 1>you look into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't believe me,</v>

2045
01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:11.980
<v Speaker 1>you have to basically nine friends and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through the mildest divorce.</v>

2046
01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean my ex wife was as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as easy on me as you could be,</v>

2047
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:17.343
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless I ended up paying a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more child support than she really </v>

2048
01:25:19.331 --> 01:25:22.270
<v Speaker 1>deserved and very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not a lot.</v>

2049
01:25:22.271 --> 01:25:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a lot of men.</v>

2050
01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:24.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2051
01:25:24.611 --> 01:25:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you do have a friend just happened to I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2052
01:25:26.351 --> 01:25:27.184
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2053
01:25:27.190 --> 01:25:28.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go into these courtrooms and it's </v>

2054
01:25:29.201 --> 01:25:30.034
<v Speaker 1>basically down to a judge as to a friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has to pay alimony for the rest of </v>

2055
01:25:32.081 --> 01:25:32.914
<v Speaker 1>his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2056
01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:35.740
<v Speaker 1>He was married for 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been divorced for 14.</v>

2057
01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:39.340
<v Speaker 1>He still has to pay his ex wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's married to a new woman.</v>

2058
01:25:39.341 --> 01:25:41.320
<v Speaker 1>He has a new family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even have kids with.</v>

2059
01:25:41.321 --> 01:25:43.480
<v Speaker 1>This woman has to pay her forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2060
01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.353
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if.</v>

2061
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if they had kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucked her so hard.</v>

2062
01:25:47.051 --> 01:25:51.040
<v Speaker 1>She can't work anymore forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

2063
01:25:51.490 --> 01:25:53.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy little lot to say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2064
01:25:53.091 --> 01:25:53.924
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2065
01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:54.843
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy law when they have </v>

2066
01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:57.190
<v Speaker 1>windows kids involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2067
01:25:57.210 --> 01:25:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very sexist law by the way,</v>

2068
01:25:59.950 --> 01:26:02.980
<v Speaker 1>because that law is implying that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman is incapable of making it on her.</v>

2069
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By</v>

2070
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.690
<v Speaker 2>definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's antifeminist.</v>

2071
01:26:05.691 --> 01:26:06.524
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's antifeminist and it's sexist and </v>

2072
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:10.190
<v Speaker 2>it's patriarchal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally patriarchal.</v>

2073
01:26:10.191 --> 01:26:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Women who support it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're supporting it because they don't</v>

2074
01:26:13.191 --> 01:26:15.320
<v Speaker 2>like men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that literally what it is,</v>

2075
01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:16.210
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

2076
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're supporting a woman,</v>

2077
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.033
<v Speaker 2>never having to work again because she </v>
<v Speaker 2>married a guy for a certain amount of </v>

2078
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:23.570
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like relationships come and go.</v>

2079
01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:25.910
<v Speaker 2>People get tired of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have the right to change.</v>

2080
01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:26.953
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be financially obligated </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take care of someone for the rest of </v>

2081
01:26:29.031 --> 01:26:32.060
<v Speaker 2>their life just because you were married</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one point in time.</v>

2082
01:26:32.061 --> 01:26:33.620
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Completely agree with you.</v>

2083
01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Especially in today's Day and age where </v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend is 54,</v>

2084
01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:40.310
<v Speaker 2>I think he is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could live to be 100,</v>

2085
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:41.323
<v Speaker 2>so what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to pay for her for another 46 </v>

2086
01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:43.730
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2087
01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.350
<v Speaker 2>That's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phenomenal.</v>

2088
01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:45.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

2089
01:26:45.921 --> 01:26:47.810
<v Speaker 2>when you that I agree with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely,</v>

2090
01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.230
<v Speaker 2>but what you said just then about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>being sexist,</v>

2091
01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.093
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a radical concept that hasn't </v>

2092
01:26:55.131 --> 01:26:55.964
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think registered with most people and </v>

2093
01:26:57.451 --> 01:26:58.284
<v Speaker 2>if many people heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would think you are a sexist </v>

2094
01:26:59.811 --> 01:27:01.430
<v Speaker 2>yourself for saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

2095
01:27:01.431 --> 01:27:04.880
<v Speaker 2>It is inescapable that that's what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

2096
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.860
<v Speaker 2>That sexism against men is very common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sexism against women too.</v>

2097
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're also sending them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the radical part of this,</v>

2098
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:12.523
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually patriarchal in the most </v>

2099
01:27:14.211 --> 01:27:15.044
<v Speaker 2>fundamental sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that the court is saying that </v>

2100
01:27:17.841 --> 01:27:20.090
<v Speaker 2>the man should be the provider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you a story.</v>

2101
01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:23.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a woman in Florida who is a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my act and I'm doing now.</v>

2102
01:27:23.781 --> 01:27:26.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a woman in Florida was a cop.</v>

2103
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:27.223
<v Speaker 2>She was 25 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She pretended to be a high school </v>

2104
01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:33.410
<v Speaker 2>student and she's attractive woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made friends with this boy.</v>

2105
01:27:33.411 --> 01:27:36.980
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was his girlfriend and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked him into selling her pot and then</v>

2106
01:27:36.981 --> 01:27:37.814
<v Speaker 2>she arrested him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That only works when you have a 17 year </v>

2107
01:27:42.021 --> 01:27:42.854
<v Speaker 2>old boy and a 25 year old woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had a 25 year old man throwing </v>

2108
01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.050
<v Speaker 2>dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your 17 year old daughter,</v>

2109
01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:51.920
<v Speaker 2>and then he gets her to sell him pot and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he arrests her.</v>

2110
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.910
<v Speaker 2>There would be people lining the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>street with torches to kill that guy,</v>

2111
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:57.283
<v Speaker 2>but people are sexist against boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They feel that boys should just keep it </v>

2112
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:00.524
<v Speaker 2>in his pants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that boys should know better and you </v>

2113
01:28:02.091 --> 01:28:04.490
<v Speaker 2>know as well as I know when you're 17 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

2114
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:05.443
<v Speaker 2>you are baffled bag of hormones with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boner just running through the world </v>

2115
01:28:10.641 --> 01:28:11.474
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what the fuck's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on and you're 12 months away from </v>

2116
01:28:13.311 --> 01:28:14.144
<v Speaker 2>being an adult.</v>

2117
01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:17.060
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's craziness to end to think that this</v>

2118
01:28:17.061 --> 01:28:17.894
<v Speaker 2>young boy should be able to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly in that moment while there's 25 </v>

2119
01:28:21.711 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 2>year old woman has manipulating them is </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane,</v>

2120
01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:28.220
<v Speaker 2>but they allowed it and this kid has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>felony on his fucking record right now.</v>

2121
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

2122
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 2>this is the root of the issue with </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism.</v>

2123
01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:36.440
<v Speaker 2>That is current feminism in its current </v>
<v Speaker 2>incarnation.</v>

2124
01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I am a feminist by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you can define the lead.</v>

2125
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Now's her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2126
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:43.660
<v Speaker 2>but I will just be an egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2127
01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:44.900
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2128
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:48.740
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that either.</v>

2129
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:50.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a nigger Alterian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2130
01:28:50.630 --> 01:28:51.480
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2131
01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.191
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

2132
01:28:52.191 --> 01:28:53.080
<v Speaker 2>Too many topics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2133
01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:54.373
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go off a lot of branches here and I </v>

2134
01:28:57.021 --> 01:28:57.854
<v Speaker 2>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2135
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:59.121
<v Speaker 2>where was I going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2136
01:28:59.121 --> 01:29:01.100
<v Speaker 2>this family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you did was you identified,</v>

2137
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.960
<v Speaker 2>and I think actually we,</v>

2138
01:29:02.050 --> 01:29:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I talked about this the first time I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2139
01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:04.980
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that know this is what's,</v>

2140
01:29:04.981 --> 01:29:05.814
<v Speaker 1>to me at the heart of this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling irony at the heart of </v>

2141
01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 1>contemporary feminism as practiced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>self-defined feminists.</v>

2142
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>

2143
01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.190
<v Speaker 1>not all guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not generally,</v>

2144
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying all feminists are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2145
01:29:19.831 --> 01:29:22.500
<v Speaker 1>but I'd say it's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the dominant strain right now,</v>

2146
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:26.130
<v Speaker 1>which is that it is at its heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal,</v>

2147
01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:31.080
<v Speaker 1>which it treats women as vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weak,</v>

2148
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.333
<v Speaker 1>powerless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or incapable of making their own way in </v>

2149
01:29:34.531 --> 01:29:38.400
<v Speaker 1>this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it treats men as the not just forget</v>

2150
01:29:38.401 --> 01:29:40.200
<v Speaker 1>about the men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about how they treat men.</v>

2151
01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:43.200
<v Speaker 1>It's how they treat women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sexist.</v>

2152
01:29:43.230 --> 01:29:47.430
<v Speaker 1>It says that they need protection from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>

2153
01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:48.683
<v Speaker 1>which is run by usually men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also this other institution or </v>

2154
01:29:51.751 --> 01:29:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>college presidents need to protect these</v>

2155
01:29:55.051 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 1>women from 19 year old boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to have sex with them.</v>

2156
01:29:58.290 --> 01:29:59.123
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly calling for women to </v>

2157
01:30:00.961 --> 01:30:04.920
<v Speaker 1>be protected by these institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state by men,</v>

2158
01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:07.660
<v Speaker 1>it is patriarchal and sexist right at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2159
01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:08.543
<v Speaker 1>at the heart of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same thing with family court and </v>

2160
01:30:11.071 --> 01:30:13.350
<v Speaker 1>divorce law and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they get treated.</v>

2161
01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:18.351
<v Speaker 1>They get treated like they're the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>who need to be taken care of by a man.</v>

2162
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.850
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 19 fifties.</v>

2163
01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Sexism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like madmen sexism.</v>

2164
01:30:23.730 --> 01:30:24.563
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what most feminists are calling </v>

2165
01:30:26.101 --> 01:30:26.934
<v Speaker 1>for now.</v>

2166
01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:27.853
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I disagree when you're talking about </v>

2167
01:30:28.581 --> 01:30:31.070
<v Speaker 3>child rearing because I think that</v>

2168
01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.570
<v Speaker 1>child support is,</v>

2169
01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.400
<v Speaker 3>should be absolutely mandatory and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>

2170
01:30:37.401 --> 01:30:40.970
<v Speaker 3>And if a woman is the only one raising </v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids on her own,</v>

2171
01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:43.940
<v Speaker 3>not only does she need the money for </v>
<v Speaker 3>food and housing,</v>

2172
01:30:43.941 --> 01:30:47.150
<v Speaker 3>but also probably for someone to babysit</v>
<v Speaker 3>her kids.</v>

2173
01:30:47.151 --> 01:30:49.550
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of factors involved and </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally agree.</v>

2174
01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:53.120
<v Speaker 3>And if the man's not in the scene like </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2175
01:30:53.121 --> 01:30:55.910
<v Speaker 3>he owes money for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a responsibility.</v>

2176
01:30:56.210 --> 01:31:00.260
<v Speaker 3>And as a father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the very least that's what you should</v>

2177
01:31:00.261 --> 01:31:02.720
<v Speaker 3>be doing is contributing financially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree.</v>

2178
01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:04.970
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not opposed to paying child support.</v>

2179
01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Alimony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alimony is weird.</v>

2180
01:31:07.701 --> 01:31:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes no sense at all.</v>

2181
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:09.501
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2182
01:31:09.501 --> 01:31:10.334
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a bad thing if </v>

2183
01:31:11.451 --> 01:31:13.190
<v Speaker 3>someone like say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about this?</v>

2184
01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:14.173
<v Speaker 3>Say let's turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say you had a wife who was wealthy and </v>

2185
01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.753
<v Speaker 3>she was taking care of you while you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going through school and she promised </v>

2186
01:31:23.241 --> 01:31:27.320
<v Speaker 3>that she was going to fund you all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way through your phd program.</v>

2187
01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.153
<v Speaker 3>She was going to give you money so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have to worry about anything but </v>

2188
01:31:29.541 --> 01:31:30.374
<v Speaker 3>your education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once you got out then you guys </v>

2189
01:31:32.241 --> 01:31:34.850
<v Speaker 3>could share income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But somewhere along the way,</v>

2190
01:31:34.851 --> 01:31:37.580
<v Speaker 3>she decided she was done with you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're fucked.</v>

2191
01:31:37.581 --> 01:31:39.530
<v Speaker 3>But during the middle of this program </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to pay for,</v>

2192
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:44.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's unreasonable to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that she should give you until you could</v>

2193
01:31:44.301 --> 01:31:48.740
<v Speaker 3>figure your own system out so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to quit your phd program and go get</v>

2194
01:31:48.741 --> 01:31:51.860
<v Speaker 3>a job somewhere and get an apartment and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a car.</v>

2195
01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:53.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2196
01:31:54.190 --> 01:31:55.023
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's unreasonable is saying that </v>

2197
01:31:57.441 --> 01:31:59.650
<v Speaker 3>because you guys were together for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of time,</v>

2198
01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 3>she has</v>

2199
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.720
<v Speaker 1>to pay you for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2200
01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:03.090
<v Speaker 1>That's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2201
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2202
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:06.310
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree that's a sexist.</v>

2203
01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:08.980
<v Speaker 1>But should that be legal though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that'd be legally enforced.</v>

2204
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Should courts be deciding how long the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alimony is paid and that's.</v>

2205
01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How has that happened?</v>

2206
01:32:17.201 --> 01:32:18.034
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the motivation behind that for </v>

2207
01:32:19.631 --> 01:32:22.660
<v Speaker 1>the courts to succumb to give in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just explain it to you?</v>

2208
01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.553
<v Speaker 1>It's sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's patriarchy and the feminists are </v>

2209
01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 1>playing along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2210
01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:28.173
<v Speaker 1>It's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2211
01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:30.360
<v Speaker 1>It's this idea that women can't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>words though,</v>

2212
01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.453
<v Speaker 1>isn't the courts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't there a lot of men involved in </v>

2213
01:32:33.071 --> 01:32:34.140
<v Speaker 1>those courts do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2214
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:34.983
<v Speaker 1>why are they allowing all this stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them think basically like </v>

2215
01:32:37.421 --> 01:32:38.254
<v Speaker 1>feminists or at least they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are expected to behave and make </v>

2216
01:32:40.241 --> 01:32:41.074
<v Speaker 1>decisions like feminist feminism has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become dominant in that way in our </v>

2217
01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:45.370
<v Speaker 1>culture going on for decades.</v>

2218
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Laws have existed long before feminism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so prevalent.</v>

2219
01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:50.800
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It went from sexism,</v>

2220
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:52.300
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those laws.</v>

2221
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:53.163
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

2222
01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:56.200
<v Speaker 1>So feminism is basically continuing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in.</v>

2223
01:32:56.201 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It's Nagy back on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And switching up the definition,</v>

2224
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:00.394
<v Speaker 1>let me say really loud and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have always been feminists who </v>

2225
01:33:04.151 --> 01:33:07.480
<v Speaker 1>hate this stuff as much as you and I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camille Paglia.</v>

2226
01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:09.493
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have been loud and clear about </v>

2227
01:33:11.651 --> 01:33:12.760
<v Speaker 1>this for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

2228
01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:14.800
<v Speaker 1>And I love them and they're my heroes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've learned from them.</v>

2229
01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.690
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned these things from them.</v>

2230
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the ones who really are powerful and</v>

2231
01:33:21.701 --> 01:33:22.534
<v Speaker 1>dominant in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones we hear from the public </v>

2232
01:33:23.861 --> 01:33:25.330
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the academics,</v>

2233
01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:26.563
<v Speaker 1>government leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who end up in the White </v>

2234
01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:30.700
<v Speaker 1>House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2235
01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:31.533
<v Speaker 1>Obama's staff in hhs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health and Human Services and the </v>

2236
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:35.913
<v Speaker 1>Department of Education became very </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear to me that all these sexual </v>

2237
01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:40.360
<v Speaker 1>assault laws and rules that came out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2238
01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:41.643
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were coming right out of colleges </v>

2239
01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.230
<v Speaker 1>and they were really have that.</v>

2240
01:33:44.290 --> 01:33:46.870
<v Speaker 1>They were of the sort of college </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist movement.</v>

2241
01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:51.310
<v Speaker 1>They were the ones who sent that letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2011 that made it basically mandatory</v>

2242
01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:54.040
<v Speaker 1>for colleges to set up these kangaroo </v>
<v Speaker 1>courts for sexual abuse,</v>

2243
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the nonsense.</v>

2244
01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:57.670
<v Speaker 1>You and I talked about a couple years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2245
01:33:57.671 --> 01:33:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2246
01:33:58.990 --> 01:33:59.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go.</v>

2247
01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Anybody interested in review those or </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier podcast about your college?</v>

2248
01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:05.060
<v Speaker 1>About oxide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:06.600
<v Speaker 1>As many colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2250
01:34:06.610 --> 01:34:07.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole backlash now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2251
01:34:07.751 --> 01:34:08.584
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all turning back and I knew it was </v>

2252
01:34:09.471 --> 01:34:13.180
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they are completely being decimated.</v>

2253
01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:14.014
<v Speaker 1>There's hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even thousands of men who are </v>

2254
01:34:15.371 --> 01:34:16.204
<v Speaker 1>suing in court and many of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning right now for good reason </v>

2255
01:34:18.641 --> 01:34:21.340
<v Speaker 1>because there was no due process because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't allowed to,</v>

2256
01:34:21.341 --> 01:34:23.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask questions.</v>

2257
01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.013
<v Speaker 1>That poor boy the mattress boy with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl put a mattress on her back and </v>

2258
01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:33.610
<v Speaker 1>drags around campus and then took her </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduation speech with a mattress.</v>

2259
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:35.530
<v Speaker 1>They live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went on stage with a mattress.</v>

2260
01:34:35.531 --> 01:34:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing was so fucking crazy.</v>

2261
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My uh,</v>

2262
01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:39.993
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this fantastic sex worker </v>

2263
01:34:41.111 --> 01:34:43.660
<v Speaker 1>activist named Christine Pereira,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's in Vegas.</v>

2264
01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:46.930
<v Speaker 1>She said she tweeted something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that happened,</v>

2265
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:47.920
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

2266
01:34:47.921 --> 01:34:48.754
<v Speaker 1>mattress girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of us who have really been </v>

2267
01:34:49.751 --> 01:34:51.550
<v Speaker 1>raped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking disgrace.</v>

2268
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:53.710
<v Speaker 1>She went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something like that.</v>

2269
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:54.544
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was.</v>

2270
01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:57.350
<v Speaker 1>That girl seems pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That mattress girl.</v>

2271
01:34:57.351 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an extreme</v>

2272
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:01.070
<v Speaker 2>example of them boys suing that school </v>
<v Speaker 2>there also.</v>

2273
01:35:01.071 --> 01:35:05.420
<v Speaker 2>And many of them are winning and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what happened in those cases.</v>

2274
01:35:05.421 --> 01:35:07.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mattress girl for sure.</v>

2275
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:08.263
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that there's all kinds of </v>

2276
01:35:08.691 --> 01:35:11.520
<v Speaker 2>evidence that sure looks like it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen the way she said it.</v>

2277
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know for sure and I never will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will never know.</v>

2278
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:17.540
<v Speaker 2>You can't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we do know for absolute sure is</v>

2279
01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:21.410
<v Speaker 2>that there's been terrible or no due </v>
<v Speaker 2>process in those cases.</v>

2280
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the problem.</v>

2281
01:35:22.701 --> 01:35:27.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean that basically the accuser gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>to win every time.</v>

2282
01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that was our legal system </v>
<v Speaker 2>writ large.</v>

2283
01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Put Him in jail.</v>

2286
01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:35.990
<v Speaker 2>That's basically what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2287
01:35:35.991 --> 01:35:36.824
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it got so crazy that even rolling</v>

2289
01:35:39.681 --> 01:35:40.514
<v Speaker 2>stone printed a false rape case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gang rape case and Uva k </v>

2290
01:35:45.001 --> 01:35:45.834
<v Speaker 2>astonishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just how did a company that's </v>

2291
01:35:48.591 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 2>been in the journalism business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as they've been,</v>

2292
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.350
<v Speaker 2>how did they fuck that up?</v>

2293
01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:55.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

2294
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:56.203
<v Speaker 2>That was the turning point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when that came out that it was </v>

2295
01:35:57.711 --> 01:35:58.544
<v Speaker 2>completely made up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think since then it started to turn </v>

2296
01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.660
<v Speaker 2>something that's good that things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happen so that you realize why it's</v>

2297
01:36:05.661 --> 01:36:07.460
<v Speaker 2>important to have checks and balances </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that people.</v>

2298
01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:08.294
<v Speaker 2>It reaffirms this idea of real </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism is important to have your </v>

2299
01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:17.021
<v Speaker 2>facts in order to have checks and double</v>
<v Speaker 2>check things and make sure you know what</v>

2300
01:36:17.391 --> 01:36:19.490
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you're printing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good for society.</v>

2301
01:36:19.491 --> 01:36:23.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it's terrible for John Doe all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the John Doe's out there,</v>

2302
01:36:23.150 --> 01:36:23.983
<v Speaker 2>all those men who were accused and </v>
<v Speaker 2>expelled and had their names ruined and </v>

2303
01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:27.314
<v Speaker 2>their careers ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>College careers destroyed and all that </v>

2304
01:36:29.541 --> 01:36:30.071
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2305
01:36:30.071 --> 01:36:31.220
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

2306
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.960
<v Speaker 2>you're also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're exonerated,</v>

2307
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:35.060
<v Speaker 2>the emotional turmoil that you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

2308
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.190
<v Speaker 2>there's no way they can reward you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2309
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 2>There are compensate you for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>

2310
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.510
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is part of that whole thing,</v>

2311
01:36:41.511 --> 01:36:42.344
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is part of this sort of ironic feminist </v>

2312
01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:48.860
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2313
01:36:48.861 --> 01:36:49.694
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2314
01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.350
<v Speaker 2>we need protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't,</v>

2315
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:56.270
<v Speaker 2>we can't because we can't say no to men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't stop them by saying,</v>

2316
01:36:56.271 --> 01:36:57.021
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need,</v>

2317
01:36:57.021 --> 01:36:58.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w w we need help.</v>

2318
01:36:58.701 --> 01:36:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Just there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to,</v>

2319
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:03.080
<v Speaker 2>we need the college president to save us</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the cops or someone.</v>

2320
01:37:03.081 --> 01:37:04.070
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an incredible,</v>

2321
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:05.563
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then there's this also this thing </v>

2322
01:37:07.011 --> 01:37:11.000
<v Speaker 2>where two people are drinking and if two</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are drinking,</v>

2323
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:12.680
<v Speaker 2>the girl is getting raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there you go.</v>

2324
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:13.703
<v Speaker 2>Same thing guys not getting ready </v>
<v Speaker 2>because women are incapable of </v>

2325
01:37:16.341 --> 01:37:17.990
<v Speaker 2>controlling themselves when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>

2326
01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Sexist as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2327
01:37:20.131 --> 01:37:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Because the man's drunk too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't.</v>

2328
01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

2329
01:37:23.331 --> 01:37:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Even if they're both like sending texts </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth.</v>

2330
01:37:25.911 --> 01:37:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Do you have condoms?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the Occidental case,</v>

2331
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:30.590
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our children,</v>

2332
01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:33.050
<v Speaker 2>their daughters going to be taken care </v>
<v Speaker 2>of by dad.</v>

2333
01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.780
<v Speaker 2>And the sons are men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:37:35.150 --> 01:37:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Even though they're just same age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're boys.</v>

2335
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2336
01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:39.050
<v Speaker 2>They have full agency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2337
01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:41.900
<v Speaker 2>And the women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The women are daughters.</v>

2338
01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is sexist.</v>

2339
01:37:43.011 --> 01:37:44.060
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2340
01:37:44.210 --> 01:37:45.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2341
01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.620
<v Speaker 2>so okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gender,</v>

2342
01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2343
01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:51.320
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely absolutely with him.</v>

2344
01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to that,</v>

2345
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.740
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to policing of language </v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

2346
01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

2347
01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:00.313
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2348
01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:01.243
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounded to me and I've listened </v>

2349
01:38:02.761 --> 01:38:03.594
<v Speaker 1>to him on your show and I've listed them</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere and a lot of people have </v>

2350
01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.073
<v Speaker 1>pointed him to me and vice versa because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think we agree on these things and </v>

2351
01:38:09.331 --> 01:38:12.480
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that he thinks seems to me that</v>

2352
01:38:12.481 --> 01:38:15.870
<v Speaker 1>gender is biologically determined that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two genders,</v>

2353
01:38:15.871 --> 01:38:16.704
<v Speaker 1>they're fixed in nature and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of that discussion off he's ever </v>

2354
01:38:18.691 --> 01:38:19.590
<v Speaker 1>said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>

2355
01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think he has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2356
01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:23.323
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said that when it comes to gender </v>

2357
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:26.124
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't believe that we need </v>

2358
01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:30.720
<v Speaker 1>more pronouns and so he thinks it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

2359
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:33.390
<v Speaker 1>If you think you're a woman when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were born with a penis,</v>

2360
01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:36.060
<v Speaker 1>it's just by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just sort of absolutely wrong.</v>

2361
01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:39.090
<v Speaker 1>I think you would have to find him </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that before.</v>

2362
01:38:39.150 --> 01:38:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm really glad to hear you say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wasn't sure where you stood on</v>

2363
01:38:41.881 --> 01:38:42.541
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2364
01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal.</v>

2365
01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can get super weird when.</v>

2366
01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:49.493
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about Rachel Dolezal she identifies </v>

2367
01:38:52.151 --> 01:38:53.640
<v Speaker 1>as being black?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2368
01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's use transracial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about that?</v>

2369
01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I think she's correct.</v>

2370
01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.331
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2371
01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:01.164
<v Speaker 1>hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

2372
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.070
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2373
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you what correct means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not in a,</v>

2374
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:08.400
<v Speaker 1>not in an absolute way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2375
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Not a scientific objective way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just as true as anything else.</v>

2376
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that because so race and here's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where a,</v>

2377
01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.273
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here comes Sam Harris now and I'm sure </v>

2378
01:39:21.361 --> 01:39:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson's in this boat to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2379
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:24.473
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just heard him talking about </v>

2380
01:39:25.561 --> 01:39:29.130
<v Speaker 1>this with Charles Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believes there's,</v>

2381
01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 1>there are races of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that race is a real thing.</v>

2382
01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:34.160
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely subtle about it.</v>

2383
01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:34.861
<v Speaker 1>Nuanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

2384
01:39:34.861 --> 01:39:35.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the divisions between races in the </v>

2385
01:39:37.441 --> 01:39:38.760
<v Speaker 1>lines are blurry and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2386
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.730
<v Speaker 1>but he believes there's a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis to race.</v>

2387
01:39:41.731 --> 01:39:45.300
<v Speaker 1>He's very clear about that and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

2388
01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:46.613
<v Speaker 1>absurd and completely unscientific and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easily disprovable by according to </v>

2389
01:39:51.121 --> 01:39:53.190
<v Speaker 1>his own standards and by scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>

2390
01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:55.980
<v Speaker 1>But you see a black guy from Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a white guy,</v>

2391
01:39:56.010 --> 01:39:59.250
<v Speaker 1>a Chinese guy from China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference?</v>

2392
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.450
<v Speaker 1>No difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

2393
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.240
<v Speaker 1>here's the answer you tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2394
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Which is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So historically,</v>

2395
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.660
<v Speaker 1>the differences between them have </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed that we people,</v>

2396
01:40:09.661 --> 01:40:10.494
<v Speaker 1>human beings have said different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>have created different categories and </v>

2397
01:40:15.031 --> 01:40:20.010
<v Speaker 1>filled those categories with different </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics over the centuries.</v>

2398
01:40:20.011 --> 01:40:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Those have changed constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2399
01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And my first time I was on here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a long discussion about what's in</v>

2400
01:40:24.901 --> 01:40:29.901
<v Speaker 1>my book renegade history on immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Irish and the Italians and the Jews.</v>

2401
01:40:30.181 --> 01:40:33.690
<v Speaker 1>When they got here to the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and in Europe,</v>

2402
01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:36.720
<v Speaker 1>they were largely considered to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>negroes.</v>

2403
01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.513
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2404
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And now there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does anybody.</v>

2405
01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:41.423
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are they at that time in the </v>

2406
01:40:44.221 --> 01:40:45.054
<v Speaker 1>early 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not like when I say common </v>

2407
01:40:49.261 --> 01:40:51.450
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was taught in schools.</v>

2408
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:53.010
<v Speaker 1>The following taught at</v>

2409
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:59.070
<v Speaker 2>the following that Europeans were made </v>
<v Speaker 2>up of three distinct races.</v>

2410
01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.930
<v Speaker 2>There were the nordics and northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>

2411
01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.730
<v Speaker 2>the Alpines in central Europe and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean and in southern Europe.</v>

2412
01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:09.640
<v Speaker 2>And they were very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically.</v>

2413
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:13.810
<v Speaker 2>The nordics where rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>

2414
01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.093
<v Speaker 2>disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were the ones who made </v>

2415
01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:18.940
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should run the country.</v>

2416
01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.300
<v Speaker 2>The alpines we're okay there could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>decent farmers,</v>

2417
01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:23.673
<v Speaker 2>but they're never going to do Algebra </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they certainly can't run a </v>

2418
01:41:25.241 --> 01:41:29.230
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mediterraneans were basically either</v>

2419
01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:30.123
<v Speaker 2>like negroes are really close and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore should be slaves or just </v>

2420
01:41:33.881 --> 01:41:35.140
<v Speaker 2>peasants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why people,</v>

2421
01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.290
<v Speaker 2>you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me you're talking about a</v>

2422
01:41:38.291 --> 01:41:39.780
<v Speaker 2>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2423
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:43.300
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which historically holding your breath,</v>

2424
01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:45.640
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you love ancient history.</v>

2425
01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at the whole sweep of</v>
<v Speaker 2>human history,</v>

2426
01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:48.610
<v Speaker 2>that's five minutes ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2427
01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:49.180
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2428
01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:53.110
<v Speaker 2>But it's still a long time in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how we address it today,</v>

2429
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:55.240
<v Speaker 2>but it will really address it today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking at it.</v>

2430
01:41:55.241 --> 01:41:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Someone from China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2431
01:41:56.511 --> 01:41:58.990
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at a dark black man from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenya.</v>

2432
01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something different about them.</v>

2433
01:42:01.150 --> 01:42:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's just melanin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2434
01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:04.840
<v Speaker 2>That's the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something different about them,</v>

2435
01:42:05.050 --> 01:42:05.883
<v Speaker 2>the many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you draw the line about around </v>

2436
01:42:08.081 --> 01:42:09.280
<v Speaker 2>races though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2437
01:42:09.281 --> 01:42:11.920
<v Speaker 2>So look at all the people in Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2438
01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Which ones are Kenyans and which ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>are they all Kenyans and what makes them</v>

2439
01:42:16.691 --> 01:42:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Kenyan or are they all Africans?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2440
01:42:19.511 --> 01:42:22.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do the all black right passed on</v>

2441
01:42:22.451 --> 01:42:25.210
<v Speaker 2>someone and find out where their origins</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2442
01:42:25.211 --> 01:42:28.300
<v Speaker 2>You can find out how much Irish you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>in you so much.</v>

2443
01:42:28.301 --> 01:42:29.560
<v Speaker 2>South African,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can me.</v>

2444
01:42:29.561 --> 01:42:30.394
<v Speaker 2>You can do all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go all the way back to your </v>

2445
01:42:32.081 --> 01:42:33.490
<v Speaker 2>family lineage through jeans.</v>

2446
01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:35.440
<v Speaker 2>I get that total.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to go all the way back.</v>

2447
01:42:35.441 --> 01:42:36.880
<v Speaker 2>We're all African.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2448
01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:37.803
<v Speaker 2>Well there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another way to disprove this </v>

2449
01:42:39.011 --> 01:42:39.730
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2450
01:42:39.730 --> 01:42:40.563
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's disproving it because we in </v>

2451
01:42:41.921 --> 01:42:44.170
<v Speaker 2>these proving it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

2452
01:42:44.171 --> 01:42:47.560
<v Speaker 2>that's a bad word to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is calling it out as a fiction,</v>

2453
01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:48.993
<v Speaker 2>as a social construct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that these lines have been </v>

2454
01:42:52.151 --> 01:42:52.984
<v Speaker 2>drawn all the time in all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways over the centuries by </v>

2455
01:42:58.331 --> 01:43:00.460
<v Speaker 2>human beings who just look at all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the world.</v>

2456
01:43:00.461 --> 01:43:01.294
<v Speaker 2>They line up the 7 billion people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in their mind and they draw lines </v>

2457
01:43:04.691 --> 01:43:05.021
<v Speaker 2>is say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2458
01:43:05.021 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 2>these people over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this side,</v>

2459
01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.410
<v Speaker 2>those are the negroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And over here,</v>

2460
01:43:08.411 --> 01:43:09.244
<v Speaker 2>these are the mongoloid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And over here these asiatics and over </v>

2461
01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:11.980
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the nordics.</v>

2462
01:43:11.981 --> 01:43:15.640
<v Speaker 2>And over here the areas and the Jews and</v>
<v Speaker 2>those change all the time.</v>

2463
01:43:15.970 --> 01:43:18.790
<v Speaker 2>But these are just categories we invent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2464
01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:21.430
<v Speaker 2>So who's black?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimi Hendrix,</v>

2465
01:43:21.431 --> 01:43:22.870
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2466
01:43:22.871 --> 01:43:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Jimi Hendrix has a mixed background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2467
01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't his mother white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his race?</v>

2468
01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Is he black or white?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

2469
01:43:31.901 --> 01:43:32.880
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

2470
01:43:32.890 --> 01:43:33.641
<v Speaker 2>A lot in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

2471
01:43:33.641 --> 01:43:34.474
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a big difference between </v>

2472
01:43:35.621 --> 01:43:40.210
<v Speaker 2>someone like Jimmy Hendrix and someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is like very,</v>

2473
01:43:40.211 --> 01:43:41.044
<v Speaker 2>very dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from a specific part of the world </v>

2474
01:43:43.901 --> 01:43:45.970
<v Speaker 2>where everyone around them is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dark.</v>

2475
01:43:45.971 --> 01:43:46.804
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are very obvious and repeatable </v>

2476
01:43:48.581 --> 01:43:49.810
<v Speaker 2>characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that.</v>

2477
01:43:49.811 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 2>So Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these come from Chicago,</v>

2478
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:53.550
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people there,</v>

2479
01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:56.390
<v Speaker 2>they're pygmies actually immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even the staff room,</v>

2480
01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:57.513
<v Speaker 2>you know what we can do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>West Africans were slaves were the west </v>

2481
01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:03.020
<v Speaker 2>where the western slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American slaves come from.</v>

2482
01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just across the continent,</v>

2483
01:44:06.711 --> 01:44:08.060
<v Speaker 2>not even that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2484
01:44:08.061 --> 01:44:10.790
<v Speaker 2>there's Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somalians look like,</v>

2485
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:11.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2486
01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Ethiopians,</v>

2487
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:14.343
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about them and how they look </v>

2488
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:17.190
<v Speaker 2>and think about how the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2489
01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:21.870
<v Speaker 2>west West Africans look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they the same race will very,</v>

2490
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:23.690
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very characteristic,</v>

2491
01:44:23.691 --> 01:44:24.524
<v Speaker 2>very dark Somali.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somalis looked different than everybody </v>

2492
01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:28.100
<v Speaker 2>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2493
01:44:28.101 --> 01:44:29.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Somali immediately,</v>

2494
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:31.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same continent,</v>

2495
01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:35.110
<v Speaker 2>same pigmentation basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2496
01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Other facial structured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

2497
01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Why are they black?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they the same race?</v>

2498
01:44:40.670 --> 01:44:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Is the question at the same race or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I'm saying about Somalians,</v>

2499
01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:46.070
<v Speaker 2>like would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you,</v>

2500
01:44:46.071 --> 01:44:46.904
<v Speaker 2>would you consider Somalians the same as</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Ethiopians or as the same as </v>

2501
01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thing is also Africa.</v>

2502
01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:54.770
<v Speaker 2>My thing is let's get rid of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>

2503
01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.620
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all silly made up categories.</v>

2504
01:44:57.830 --> 01:45:00.350
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all arbitrary.</v>

2505
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.393
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lines have been drawn between groups of </v>

2506
01:45:03.681 --> 01:45:08.010
<v Speaker 2>people arbitrarily over the centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you see,</v>

2507
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:10.100
<v Speaker 2>you're arguing against something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris said.</v>

2508
01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:12.380
<v Speaker 2>So what did Sam Harris say specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just him.</v>

2509
01:45:12.381 --> 01:45:13.214
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

2510
01:45:13.670 --> 01:45:16.490
<v Speaker 2>So you don't agree that there is any </v>
<v Speaker 2>race at all?</v>

2511
01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it's a fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's made,</v>

2512
01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:19.633
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a.</v>

2513
01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.950
<v Speaker 2>it's like is it a fiction or is it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way?</v>

2514
01:45:21.951 --> 01:45:22.784
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to define the variations </v>
<v Speaker 2>between human groups because there are </v>

2515
01:45:26.871 --> 01:45:27.704
<v Speaker 2>variations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's definitely what it's been </v>

2516
01:45:29.721 --> 01:45:31.910
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's definitely been the motivation.</v>

2517
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:33.403
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And think about what the consequences </v>

2518
01:45:34.611 --> 01:45:36.020
<v Speaker 2>have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2519
01:45:36.021 --> 01:45:36.854
<v Speaker 2>But it's never been good just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's never glances for variations or </v>

2520
01:45:39.891 --> 01:45:40.724
<v Speaker 2>recognizing variations doesn't mean you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should stop recognizing actual </v>

2521
01:45:43.311 --> 01:45:44.570
<v Speaker 2>variations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you make.</v>

2522
01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:46.340
<v Speaker 2>But they always make claims right after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2523
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't have to what Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 2>is Straw man,</v>

2524
01:45:49.251 --> 01:45:50.084
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean did you don't have to make a </v>

2525
01:45:50.781 --> 01:45:53.480
<v Speaker 2>claim that Chinese people are different </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they look different,</v>

2526
01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.753
<v Speaker 2>but then it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is what a Chinese person </v>

2527
01:45:56.850 --> 01:46:00.170
<v Speaker 2>generally they have these very stringent</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics.</v>

2528
01:46:00.170 --> 01:46:02.540
<v Speaker 2>They don't have blonde hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have blue eyes.</v>

2529
01:46:02.770 --> 01:46:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm not tall and skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look like Chinese.</v>

2530
01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>

2531
01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Chinese people all look the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's to say that,</v>

2532
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

2533
01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:12.164
<v Speaker 2>with a clear characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between a Chinese person </v>

2534
01:46:14.391 --> 01:46:17.230
<v Speaker 2>and a black person is very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2535
01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really well and not always Kenyan.</v>

2536
01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:21.513
<v Speaker 2>So lives in Kenya who was born and </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised multiple generations deep and </v>

2537
01:46:26.061 --> 01:46:28.280
<v Speaker 2>their parents are canyon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their grandparents at Kenyon.</v>

2538
01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:32.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a very big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and someone who lives in Shanghai.</v>

2539
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But who was born in Shanghai?</v>

2540
01:46:34.191 --> 01:46:37.190
<v Speaker 2>They're parents were born in Shanghai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd go all the way back.</v>

2541
01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many generations of being pure Chinese.</v>

2542
01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.513
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are infinite variations even </v>

2543
01:46:41.601 --> 01:46:43.790
<v Speaker 2>among people who have lived only in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shanghai,</v>

2544
01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:45.680
<v Speaker 2>but what do you want to call the </v>
<v Speaker 2>variations?</v>

2545
01:46:45.681 --> 01:46:46.514
<v Speaker 2>Nothing but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2546
01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:48.500
<v Speaker 2>but you're talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's clearly</v>

2547
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:52.890
<v Speaker 1>or you just ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that there's,</v>

2548
01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:55.470
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are genes that run in families and</v>

2549
01:46:55.471 --> 01:46:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2550
01:46:57.721 --> 01:47:00.450
<v Speaker 1>genes determine in large part how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

2551
01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:01.493
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can certainly say this person is </v>

2552
01:47:04.111 --> 01:47:07.070
<v Speaker 1>likely because of their genes connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that person,</v>

2553
01:47:07.090 --> 01:47:08.970
<v Speaker 1>last generation to that generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this,</v>

2554
01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:10.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his family lineage.</v>

2555
01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2556
01:47:11.761 --> 01:47:13.350
<v Speaker 1>what does that give you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2557
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

2558
01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:18.090
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that people have taken that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've said,</v>

2559
01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:18.953
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well these particular characteristics </v>

2560
01:47:20.761 --> 01:47:21.594
<v Speaker 1>are human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are talking about complexity and </v>

2561
01:47:22.441 --> 01:47:23.820
<v Speaker 1>human beings at the beginning of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2562
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:26.380
<v Speaker 1>People are infinitely complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2563
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing is,</v>

2564
01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:28.523
<v Speaker 1>what people have done historically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've just picked certain </v>

2565
01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:34.020
<v Speaker 1>characteristics among people and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2566
01:47:34.021 --> 01:47:36.810
<v Speaker 1>that is what determines your race is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

2567
01:47:36.811 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 1>The word race is maybe the issue.</v>

2568
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Like there are obvious physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>

2569
01:47:42.511 --> 01:47:46.620
<v Speaker 1>The difference between someone who is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mon goal versus someone who,</v>

2570
01:47:46.621 --> 01:47:49.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a Brazilian versus someone who is.</v>

2571
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:54.500
<v Speaker 1>There's some pretty obvious physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics for geographic areas.</v>

2572
01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:55.793
<v Speaker 1>What would you agree like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or common physical characteristics for </v>

2573
01:47:58.231 --> 01:47:59.064
<v Speaker 1>some geographic areas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say on average people in </v>

2574
01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.210
<v Speaker 1>China are shorter than people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polynesia.</v>

2575
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the place where you could do it.</v>

2576
01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2577
01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:09.893
<v Speaker 1>try to find a Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know what a Canadian </v>

2578
01:48:11.401 --> 01:48:13.170
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could be English,</v>

2579
01:48:13.171 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 1>they could be American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could was trying to entertain.</v>

2580
01:48:15.871 --> 01:48:17.520
<v Speaker 1>You're your strongest argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2581
01:48:17.521 --> 01:48:19.160
<v Speaker 1>So like China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2582
01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:22.470
<v Speaker 1>You can certainly say that people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China are on average,</v>

2583
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.480
<v Speaker 1>on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorter than people in Polynesia.</v>

2584
01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will they look different?</v>

2585
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:27.743
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way in which they look </v>

2586
01:48:28.691 --> 01:48:29.524
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2587
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Facial talking about physiognomy facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature.</v>

2588
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:32.683
<v Speaker 1>That bone structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polynesians find to be like really </v>

2589
01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:38.040
<v Speaker 1>stout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you could say,</v>

2590
01:48:38.041 --> 01:48:38.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2591
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.080
<v Speaker 1>the width of their eyes is narrower or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever on average and whatever.</v>

2592
01:48:43.081 --> 01:48:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2593
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>

2594
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did we.</v>

2595
01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

2596
01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:52.710
<v Speaker 1>they are likely to be in lineage from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of the world.</v>

2597
01:48:53.190 --> 01:48:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2598
01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I've got no problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what else do you want to say?</v>

2599
01:48:57.450 --> 01:48:58.650
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2600
01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:01.800
<v Speaker 1>no one stops there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always go on to that.</v>

2601
01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:05.250
<v Speaker 1>They always go on from there and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to make all these other claims.</v>

2602
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh well that race is really good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>math.</v>

2603
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Their Iq is higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what actually Sam Harrison,</v>

2604
01:49:11.491 --> 01:49:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Charles Murray were just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do the,</v>

2605
01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:16.050
<v Speaker 1>they can do the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2606
01:49:16.110 --> 01:49:18.780
<v Speaker 1>they can do the coding for Google better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

2607
01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:20.430
<v Speaker 1>than other people can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2608
01:49:20.431 --> 01:49:20.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2609
01:49:20.670 --> 01:49:23.280
<v Speaker 1>They are more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are more scrupulous.</v>

2610
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:25.740
<v Speaker 1>They smoked cigarettes more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2611
01:49:25.741 --> 01:49:26.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to be accused of being a more </v>

2612
01:49:27.781 --> 01:49:29.880
<v Speaker 1>easily addicted to opium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>

2613
01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:31.190
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things changed,</v>

2614
01:49:31.191 --> 01:49:34.080
<v Speaker 1>but that's the problem is that once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start there,</v>

2615
01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:39.290
<v Speaker 1>people have used those differences for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other reasons almost always,</v>

2616
01:49:40.230 --> 01:49:45.230
<v Speaker 1>which are nefarious and injurious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have done terrible things to people.</v>

2617
01:49:45.810 --> 01:49:46.643
<v Speaker 1>Your problem is recognizing those </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and those differences </v>

2618
01:49:50.351 --> 01:49:51.184
<v Speaker 1>and calling it a race and then attaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of other claims to this </v>

2619
01:49:56.081 --> 01:49:57.190
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

2620
01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:58.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what Sam and Charles </v>

2621
01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Murray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Charles Murray's thing,</v>

2622
01:50:01.721 --> 01:50:02.554
<v Speaker 1>although it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only a small part of his work and </v>

2623
01:50:04.511 --> 01:50:07.000
<v Speaker 1>he gets accused of it being central and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

2624
01:50:07.001 --> 01:50:07.834
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does still nonetheless believed this </v>

2625
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:10.234
<v Speaker 1>and so to Sam Harris and so did other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that there are differences in Iq </v>

2626
01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:16.810
<v Speaker 1>among races.</v>

2627
01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now on the surface level,</v>

2628
01:50:19.691 --> 01:50:22.570
<v Speaker 1>they are completely correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no question,</v>

2629
01:50:22.690 --> 01:50:23.523
<v Speaker 1>meaning that Iq scores among people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we identify as African American have </v>

2630
01:50:32.951 --> 01:50:37.951
<v Speaker 1>been lower than among the people we </v>
<v Speaker 1>define as white American.</v>

2631
01:50:38.530 --> 01:50:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Totally true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally true,</v>

2632
01:50:41.111 --> 01:50:42.970
<v Speaker 1>and they are right that that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressed,</v>

2633
01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.460
<v Speaker 1>that we are not allowed to even talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that data,</v>

2634
01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.770
<v Speaker 1>which is there and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem with that.</v>

2635
01:50:47.771 --> 01:50:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing though.</v>

2636
01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:55.240
<v Speaker 1>How do we define African American and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we define white first?</v>

2637
01:50:55.241 --> 01:50:57.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the first problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

2638
01:50:57.281 --> 01:51:00.250
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions have changed over time,</v>

2639
01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:01.413
<v Speaker 1>so Jews used to be in the African </v>
<v Speaker 1>American group and Italians used to be </v>

2640
01:51:04.151 --> 01:51:05.980
<v Speaker 1>in the African American group was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2641
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

2642
01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:08.770
<v Speaker 1>never called African Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

2643
01:51:08.771 --> 01:51:10.200
<v Speaker 1>they were called negroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2644
01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:12.080
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoes were called negroes.</v>

2645
01:51:12.090 --> 01:51:15.910
<v Speaker 1>A book written is in my book renegade </v>
<v Speaker 1>history in ninth in 1911,</v>

2646
01:51:15.911 --> 01:51:18.340
<v Speaker 1>there was a book written by a scholar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was one of many,</v>

2647
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:21.910
<v Speaker 1>the title of which his name was Arthur </v>
<v Speaker 1>abernethy.</v>

2648
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:25.300
<v Speaker 1>The title of which was the Jew is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>negro.</v>

2649
01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:28.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the title of it was common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what pieces,</v>

2650
01:51:28.930 --> 01:51:29.763
<v Speaker 1>what year this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all through the late 19th and </v>

2651
01:51:31.901 --> 01:51:32.734
<v Speaker 1>early 20th centuries from about the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties when the Jews started coming </v>

2652
01:51:34.451 --> 01:51:37.840
<v Speaker 1>over and big numbers from the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties until the 19 forties.</v>

2653
01:51:38.770 --> 01:51:39.460
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2654
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:40.293
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this is what was taught in </v>
<v Speaker 1>college classrooms that Jews were of a </v>

2655
01:51:44.951 --> 01:51:48.850
<v Speaker 1>different race and there was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference of opinion about whether they</v>

2656
01:51:48.851 --> 01:51:52.660
<v Speaker 1>were black or whether they were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other kind of inferior race,</v>

2657
01:51:52.661 --> 01:51:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but they certainly weren't white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

2658
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:58.990
<v Speaker 1>that was widely agreed upon until world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war two basically.</v>

2659
01:51:59.530 --> 01:52:02.700
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do we define African-american?</v>

2660
01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Is Jimi Hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>African-american?</v>

2661
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:05.251
<v Speaker 1>Does he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to.</v>

2662
01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:08.440
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there in the term African American</v>

2663
01:52:08.441 --> 01:52:10.060
<v Speaker 1>versus Negro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2664
01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Because like it's the same thing.</v>

2665
01:52:12.130 --> 01:52:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different name for the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

2666
01:52:13.661 --> 01:52:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's from Africa.</v>

2667
01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:17.500
<v Speaker 1>They knew that these Jews weren't from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

2668
01:52:17.501 --> 01:52:20.090
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the one drop system continent,</v>

2669
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:21.103
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe that they believe that the </v>

2670
01:52:22.421 --> 01:52:24.880
<v Speaker 1>genes and the right about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2671
01:52:24.881 --> 01:52:26.930
<v Speaker 1>That the genes come from Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2672
01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:28.420
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2673
01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:30.370
<v Speaker 1>and they're bright but so do all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>genes.</v>

2674
01:52:30.371 --> 01:52:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2675
01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was part of their claim and that</v>

2676
01:52:33.461 --> 01:52:34.390
<v Speaker 1>they were from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2677
01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:38.830
<v Speaker 1>part of Europe that was a bit closer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africanism when they said about Italians</v>

2678
01:52:38.831 --> 01:52:40.030
<v Speaker 1>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sicilians,</v>

2679
01:52:40.031 --> 01:52:40.530
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2680
01:52:40.530 --> 01:52:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look where it is.</v>

2681
01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:44.730
<v Speaker 1>That's why these people are fucking all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and having babies.</v>

2682
01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:48.290
<v Speaker 1>True and are lazy and can't work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight in the bars and get drunk and.</v>

2683
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:49.783
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2684
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:52.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do we define these terms?</v>

2685
01:52:52.101 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 1>What is white men that's totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>

2686
01:52:54.141 --> 01:52:55.140
<v Speaker 1>but how much of it is great?</v>

2687
01:52:55.190 --> 01:52:56.870
<v Speaker 1>They realize just how much of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural.</v>

2688
01:52:56.871 --> 01:53:00.230
<v Speaker 1>So there's that hold on and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I acu.</v>

2689
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2690
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it does measure something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's real.</v>

2691
01:53:04.971 --> 01:53:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2692
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I think there was something called the g</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>

2693
01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:08.740
<v Speaker 1>which it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2694
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tests,</v>

2695
01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:12.770
<v Speaker 1>it measures g factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that was invented,</v>

2696
01:53:12.771 --> 01:53:14.450
<v Speaker 1>this concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a category,</v>

2697
01:53:14.451 --> 01:53:16.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's a real category in the world we</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate in,</v>

2698
01:53:16.821 --> 01:53:19.850
<v Speaker 1>which is your ability to do rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

2699
01:53:19.851 --> 01:53:24.851
<v Speaker 1>reasoning like math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like writing scholarly essays,</v>

2700
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:26.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure my g factor is higher sort of </v>

2701
01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:32.330
<v Speaker 1>than other people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm terrible at math.</v>

2702
01:53:32.331 --> 01:53:35.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's yet another problematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrinkle for these people.</v>

2703
01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2704
01:53:37.161 --> 01:53:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that Iq measures that stuff,</v>

2705
01:53:41.210 --> 01:53:42.043
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is that what intelligence is and </v>

2706
01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:48.050
<v Speaker 1>only as clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2707
01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:48.953
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2708
01:53:48.970 --> 01:53:50.850
<v Speaker 1>A lot of variables that Iq test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>

2709
01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:52.130
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>

2710
01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.110
<v Speaker 1>write the tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of intelligence.</v>

2711
01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:54.993
<v Speaker 1>The test emotional intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they test the intelligence of Jimi </v>

2712
01:53:58.370 --> 01:54:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Hendrix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he was great at Calculus?</v>

2713
01:54:00.111 --> 01:54:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of doubt it.</v>

2714
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Was He smart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the intelligent clearly in different</v>

2715
01:54:05.691 --> 01:54:07.010
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clever with a guitar,</v>

2716
01:54:07.011 --> 01:54:09.410
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then how do you define intelligence?</v>

2717
01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:11.203
<v Speaker 1>Activity is unquestionably some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurement or expression of </v>

2718
01:54:14.391 --> 01:54:16.670
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We separate that off though,</v>

2719
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.890
<v Speaker 1>and we always have as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't.</v>

2720
01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:22.070
<v Speaker 1>That's why you don't do well unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really,</v>

2721
01:54:22.071 --> 01:54:22.904
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good if you're just creative in </v>

2722
01:54:24.471 --> 01:54:25.304
<v Speaker 1>the way we define that and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent in the way Iq tests to find </v>

2723
01:54:29.061 --> 01:54:31.130
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>

2724
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:34.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's all problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2725
01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:35.473
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all it does is it just keeps raising </v>

2726
01:54:37.791 --> 01:54:40.610
<v Speaker 1>new questions that never has answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that the attempt to.</v>

2727
01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.320
<v Speaker 1>There's this thing that goes on where </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain people just need to keep finding</v>

2728
01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:48.740
<v Speaker 1>racial differences that are innate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>

2729
01:54:48.741 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 1>fixed that can't be changed.</v>

2730
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:51.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2731
01:54:51.501 --> 01:54:54.890
<v Speaker 1>you've never done this because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid and you're always,</v>

2732
01:54:54.891 --> 01:54:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you never really answering it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what if you had,</v>

2733
01:54:57.411 --> 01:54:58.244
<v Speaker 1>did finally prove it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do with that </v>

2734
01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.260
<v Speaker 1>information?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2735
01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:04.370
<v Speaker 1>we just recognize that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>

2736
01:55:04.371 --> 01:55:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polynesian people,</v>

2737
01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:09.170
<v Speaker 1>are we talking about people from Tonga?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very stout,</v>

2738
01:55:09.171 --> 01:55:12.220
<v Speaker 1>strong people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>samoans tend to be very stout,</v>

2739
01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:13.820
<v Speaker 1>strong people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2740
01:55:13.821 --> 01:55:14.654
<v Speaker 1>that's a characteristic of actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive characteristic that's </v>

2741
01:55:17.991 --> 01:55:20.720
<v Speaker 1>attributed to people from that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ignore that?</v>

2742
01:55:20.721 --> 01:55:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you address that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>

2743
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I would say that people from Polynesia </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more likely.</v>

2744
01:55:25.311 --> 01:55:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Men from Polynesia are more likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive lineman in the NFL.</v>

2745
01:55:30.170 --> 01:55:33.220
<v Speaker 1>So your issue is calling it a itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2746
01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:34.243
<v Speaker 1>And then attributing other things to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm saying is guys from there tend </v>

2747
01:55:37.461 --> 01:55:38.160
<v Speaker 1>to be bigger.</v>

2748
01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>

2749
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:39.980
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so what?</v>

2750
01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:40.873
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a part of the world where </v>

2751
01:55:42.531 --> 01:55:46.140
<v Speaker 1>people are generally thought to be dumb?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2752
01:55:46.141 --> 01:55:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country that are that.</v>

2753
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:50.380
<v Speaker 1>The continent we've been talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2754
01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:53.190
<v Speaker 1>that's the history of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the history of Europe,</v>

2755
01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:54.053
<v Speaker 1>that's the history of the modern world </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the belief that people from Africa </v>

2756
01:55:56.971 --> 01:55:58.440
<v Speaker 1>are dumber than whites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2757
01:55:58.480 --> 01:55:59.313
<v Speaker 1>isn't the problem with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Africa is also where the pyramids </v>

2758
01:56:01.261 --> 01:56:02.970
<v Speaker 1>were created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what justified.</v>

2759
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what justified slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what justified colonialism.</v>

2760
01:56:05.641 --> 01:56:08.010
<v Speaker 1>That's what justifies has justified all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things.</v>

2761
01:56:08.011 --> 01:56:08.844
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the problem here is that </v>

2762
01:56:10.201 --> 01:56:11.034
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these attempts to define people by race </v>

2763
01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:15.240
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by gender,</v>

2764
01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:16.373
<v Speaker 1>have done nothing but terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but terrible things and you </v>

2765
01:56:20.011 --> 01:56:22.620
<v Speaker 1>can't do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's scientific bullshit.</v>

2766
01:56:22.621 --> 01:56:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It's total superstition is utterly </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>

2767
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:28.410
<v Speaker 1>The lines are always being redrawn by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who do this stuff,</v>

2768
01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:29.513
<v Speaker 1>so why are you still doing it guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's where do you draw the Goddamn </v>

2769
01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:34.890
<v Speaker 1>line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the people in Africa are black.</v>

2770
01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:35.933
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians are the same race as people </v>

2771
01:56:38.101 --> 01:56:43.101
<v Speaker 1>from the Congo as the people from South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa as the people from Somalia.</v>

2772
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are they the same race?</v>

2773
01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Because it's pigment skin pigment is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only determination will.</v>

2774
01:56:48.991 --> 01:56:49.824
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating thing when you call </v>
<v Speaker 1>people African Americans or call them a </v>

2775
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Italian Americans because Italy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a country.</v>

2776
01:56:56.311 --> 01:56:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Africa is a continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

2777
01:56:58.801 --> 01:57:01.580
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird to call people conduit,</v>

2778
01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because guess what?</v>

2779
01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Italy didn't even exist until the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

2780
01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:08.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just a bunch of city </v>
<v Speaker 1>states until then and there was no such </v>

2781
01:57:10.771 --> 01:57:11.604
<v Speaker 1>thing as an Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who lived there didn't call </v>

2782
01:57:13.471 --> 01:57:14.790
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a concept,</v>

2783
01:57:14.791 --> 01:57:15.360
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a name.</v>

2784
01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.193
<v Speaker 1>It was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they made it into this nation </v>

2785
01:57:18.901 --> 01:57:20.850
<v Speaker 1>state that they called Italy and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever since,</v>

2786
01:57:20.851 --> 01:57:23.550
<v Speaker 1>ever since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every sorry,</v>

2787
01:57:23.551 --> 01:57:26.230
<v Speaker 1>but every dipshit Italian American is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like really proud of that.</v>

2788
01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.073
<v Speaker 1>I'm Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that dude that has no meaning </v>

2789
01:57:28.561 --> 01:57:31.440
<v Speaker 1>really in the deepest history at a some </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight meaning sure.</v>

2790
01:57:31.441 --> 01:57:34.350
<v Speaker 1>But they talk about it as if it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted in nature.</v>

2791
01:57:34.351 --> 01:57:35.184
<v Speaker 1>Like I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love being a part of that stupid </v>

2792
01:57:37.171 --> 01:57:38.760
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sopranos,</v>

2793
01:57:39.170 --> 01:57:40.860
<v Speaker 1>the Sopranos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tribalism,</v>

2794
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:43.410
<v Speaker 1>tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is tribal and stupid.</v>

2795
01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And if it were just stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't care.</v>

2796
01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.370
<v Speaker 1>It's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has,</v>

2797
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:49.830
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just leads to bad stuff.</v>

2798
01:57:49.890 --> 01:57:52.710
<v Speaker 1>And it has historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go this popular opinion,</v>

2799
01:57:52.730 --> 01:57:54.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there are no races.</v>

2800
01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2801
01:57:56.010 --> 01:57:57.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2802
01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:58.313
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Anti academic academic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is where academics have </v>

2803
01:58:00.781 --> 01:58:01.860
<v Speaker 1>actually done their best work.</v>

2804
01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the second,</v>

2805
01:58:04.050 --> 01:58:05.880
<v Speaker 1>my second disagreement with Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>

2806
01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:11.040
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that all this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>college campuses that's crazy is because</v>

2807
01:58:11.041 --> 01:58:14.730
<v Speaker 1>of postmodernism and he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand postmodernism.</v>

2808
01:58:15.650 --> 01:58:16.483
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2809
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:17.383
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in college campuses as </v>
<v Speaker 1>people making all sorts of truth claims </v>

2810
01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:22.170
<v Speaker 1>about things like race and gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2811
01:58:22.650 --> 01:58:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore I will always be this,</v>

2812
01:58:25.831 --> 01:58:26.551
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing.</v>

2813
01:58:26.551 --> 01:58:28.440
<v Speaker 1>You're white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore you are this,</v>

2814
01:58:28.441 --> 01:58:29.131
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing.</v>

2815
01:58:29.131 --> 01:58:30.120
<v Speaker 1>No matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2816
01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:35.990
<v Speaker 1>That is actually old modernist </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific racist thinking.</v>

2817
01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:41.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what these old racist geneticists</v>
<v Speaker 1>eugenesis thought back in the day.</v>

2818
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2819
01:58:43.061 --> 01:58:43.894
<v Speaker 1>sjws are actually really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really conservative and ultimately </v>

2820
01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:48.970
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Social Justice Warriors folks,</v>

2821
01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:50.873
<v Speaker 1>your listeners must know that something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the assume that was a </v>

2822
01:58:53.410 --> 01:58:57.130
<v Speaker 1>shorthand to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So postmodernism.</v>

2823
01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.353
<v Speaker 1>This is where Jordan Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me want to like throw chairs when </v>

2824
01:59:00.131 --> 01:59:02.070
<v Speaker 1>he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2825
01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:05.620
<v Speaker 1>comes out of French philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2826
01:59:05.621 --> 01:59:07.720
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 sixties and seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>

2827
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Michel Foucault is the most famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of a,</v>

2828
01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:14.680
<v Speaker 1>of a French postmodernist and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get dumped on all the time,</v>

2829
01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:16.053
<v Speaker 1>but the central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the central argument that was made by </v>

2830
01:59:19.511 --> 01:59:20.344
<v Speaker 1>food co and postmodernists was that none</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things are biologically </v>

2831
01:59:27.491 --> 01:59:31.180
<v Speaker 1>determined that there is no natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>essence to anything.</v>

2832
01:59:31.690 --> 01:59:32.523
<v Speaker 1>That everything is a social construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that we now are free to </v>

2833
01:59:38.801 --> 01:59:42.580
<v Speaker 1>choose our own destiny as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2834
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to the 19 sixties and seventies,</v>

2835
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:51.850
<v Speaker 1>it was the dominant belief that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were born a woman,</v>

2836
01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:56.140
<v Speaker 1>you are going to be a wife and a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you weren't,</v>

2837
01:59:56.141 --> 01:59:58.000
<v Speaker 1>you were doing something unnatural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2838
01:59:58.640 --> 01:59:59.473
<v Speaker 1>That if you were black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could never be the head of a </v>

2839
02:00:02.171 --> 02:00:04.090
<v Speaker 1>business or the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2840
02:00:04.091 --> 02:00:05.770
<v Speaker 1>You could never do math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2841
02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:08.260
<v Speaker 1>If you were white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2842
02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:10.420
<v Speaker 1>you should do all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2843
02:00:10.630 --> 02:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's destiny was determined at </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth and everyone believed that.</v>

2844
02:00:15.370 --> 02:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Most people believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2845
02:00:17.710 --> 02:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>so postmodernist came along and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

2846
02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:20.373
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we found looking at history we </v>

2847
02:00:21.551 --> 02:00:22.384
<v Speaker 1>found is just what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just gave you the whole postmodern </v>

2848
02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>argument right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We looked at history and we saw first of</v>

2849
02:00:27.191 --> 02:00:28.024
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of these categories have </v>

2850
02:00:28.301 --> 02:00:29.134
<v Speaker 1>changed over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tells us that they're just </v>

2851
02:00:31.091 --> 02:00:31.924
<v Speaker 1>inventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just inventions that get </v>

2852
02:00:33.461 --> 02:00:35.390
<v Speaker 1>reinvented all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2853
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:37.263
<v Speaker 1>And second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have served the purposes of ruling </v>

2854
02:00:39.851 --> 02:00:40.684
<v Speaker 1>elites because they get to put people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their boxes and control them more </v>

2855
02:00:43.781 --> 02:00:45.100
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2856
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people over there,</v>

2857
02:00:46.571 --> 02:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>those are black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore they should be our slaves.</v>

2858
02:00:50.290 --> 02:00:52.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's okay for us to have a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slaves,</v>

2859
02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>those women over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want them,</v>

2860
02:00:54.930 --> 02:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working for NASA.</v>

2861
02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>So we will have a rule against women </v>
<v Speaker 1>working for NASA.</v>

2862
02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2863
02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So postmodern has said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this is biological.</v>

2864
02:01:04.601 --> 02:01:05.434
<v Speaker 1>None of this is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are now free to do what you want as </v>

2865
02:01:08.921 --> 02:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a liberating moment.</v>

2866
02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>It has become the dominant way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking in academia.</v>

2867
02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my view,</v>

2868
02:01:16.930 --> 02:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>it is the supreme achievement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>academics ever.</v>

2869
02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2870
02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:26.590
<v Speaker 1>But it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

2871
02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:27.993
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at how the world has changed </v>

2872
02:01:30.130 --> 02:01:31.930
<v Speaker 1>particularly in that in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States since then,</v>

2873
02:01:31.931 --> 02:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We no longer generally have those ideas.</v>

2874
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:35.833
<v Speaker 1>At least we don't operate as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So black people are allowed mostly into </v>

2875
02:01:40.791 --> 02:01:41.624
<v Speaker 1>places they weren't before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are allowed very much so into </v>

2876
02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:44.923
<v Speaker 1>places they weren't allowed before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the whole world has changed and I </v>

2877
02:01:48.111 --> 02:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>think principally from that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the trend,</v>

2878
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:53.833
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean now the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>these social justice warriors so called </v>

2879
02:01:57.741 --> 02:01:58.574
<v Speaker 1>on campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have used some of that language and </v>

2880
02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:03.530
<v Speaker 1>taking a shit on it.</v>

2881
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:08.240
<v Speaker 1>So the Trans Movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

2882
02:02:08.241 --> 02:02:11.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That started from postmodernism.</v>

2883
02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>That whole idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2884
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:13.641
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2885
02:02:13.641 --> 02:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>if you were born with a penis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a man and you should do x,</v>

2886
02:02:17.061 --> 02:02:18.350
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and z with your life.</v>

2887
02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:19.473
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Trans Movement needed that needed </v>

2888
02:02:21.891 --> 02:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism to make that intervention </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

2889
02:02:24.411 --> 02:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true,</v>

2890
02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:26.233
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can actually be a woman because a </v>

2891
02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:29.960
<v Speaker 1>woman is an invention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a social construct.</v>

2892
02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.800
<v Speaker 1>What Trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the Trans Movement now is doing,</v>

2893
02:02:33.801 --> 02:02:34.634
<v Speaker 1>which makes me so sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're saying that I am </v>

2894
02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:41.720
<v Speaker 1>biologically essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>

2895
02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my core,</v>

2896
02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2897
02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:48.910
<v Speaker 1>no one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one is you can't change.</v>

2898
02:02:49.190 --> 02:02:52.910
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of this movement used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be that you get to choose your gender or</v>

2899
02:02:52.911 --> 02:02:55.430
<v Speaker 1>choose not to be a gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to move around.</v>

2900
02:02:55.670 --> 02:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Your destiny is not determined for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the true.</v>

2901
02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the Trans Movement now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2902
02:03:00.771 --> 02:03:02.480
<v Speaker 1>This is a good word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reifying.</v>

2903
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:05.150
<v Speaker 1>They're making these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these abstractions real.</v>

2904
02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:06.013
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making these claims that are </v>

2905
02:03:07.881 --> 02:03:08.714
<v Speaker 1>similar to Sam Harris has claims and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>old racist claims and to old sexist </v>

2906
02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:14.870
<v Speaker 1>claims that if you're born in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular way,</v>

2907
02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:18.690
<v Speaker 1>biologically this is who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2908
02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Because you've heard a lot of trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say this,</v>

2909
02:03:20.181 --> 02:03:21.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born a woman.</v>

2910
02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:24.513
<v Speaker 1>That's where they often say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is no one was born </v>

2911
02:03:28.311 --> 02:03:29.144
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2912
02:03:30.190 --> 02:03:33.810
<v Speaker 2>You are losing me in a huge way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you don't think that women,</v>

2913
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:37.320
<v Speaker 2>that some women are born women and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think you're born a man.</v>

2914
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:38.970
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you born?</v>

2915
02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Why you men?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For all sorts of reasons,</v>

2916
02:03:42.930 --> 02:03:45.230
<v Speaker 2>for all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of them being just decided.</v>

2917
02:03:45.250 --> 02:03:46.890
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of them being the x,</v>

2918
02:03:46.891 --> 02:03:49.140
<v Speaker 2>y chromosome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have testicles.</v>

2919
02:03:49.141 --> 02:03:49.974
<v Speaker 2>Then we went to and you have a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of them being the fact that you </v>

2920
02:03:52.111 --> 02:03:55.350
<v Speaker 2>generally gravitate towards male </v>
<v Speaker 2>activities like boxing,</v>

2921
02:03:55.590 --> 02:03:56.960
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we just.</v>

2922
02:03:57.260 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 2>We just went through this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2923
02:03:58.521 --> 02:03:59.010
<v Speaker 2>you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2924
02:03:59.010 --> 02:04:00.030
<v Speaker 2>Romero and Andy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

2925
02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2926
02:04:00.690 --> 02:04:01.890
<v Speaker 2>they both men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you.</v>

2927
02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.800
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a man yet,</v>

2928
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.823
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about the broad </v>

2929
02:04:05.461 --> 02:04:07.860
<v Speaker 2>spectrum of masculine behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about.</v>

2930
02:04:07.861 --> 02:04:10.380
<v Speaker 2>No one is born a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not born a man.</v>

2931
02:04:10.381 --> 02:04:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm saying,</v>

2932
02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:13.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're getting silly.</v>

2933
02:04:13.230 --> 02:04:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Hold on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the category of men becomes</v>

2934
02:04:16.381 --> 02:04:18.120
<v Speaker 2>meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>

2935
02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just did this man.</v>

2936
02:04:19.591 --> 02:04:20.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't.</v>

2937
02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:21.233
<v Speaker 2>We didn't do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Romero and Andy Dick or put on category </v>

2938
02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:25.433
<v Speaker 2>jewelry at the ends of the spectrum and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they crossover the male female </v>

2939
02:04:29.851 --> 02:04:33.810
<v Speaker 2>lines do cross over when you get to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenyan runner and Andy Dick.</v>

2940
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I'm saying.</v>

2941
02:04:35.371 --> 02:04:38.850
<v Speaker 2>It's so broad that it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me pretty damn meaningless.</v>

2942
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers are incredibly small.</v>

2943
02:04:41.281 --> 02:04:43.440
<v Speaker 2>If those crossover marks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about us.</v>

2944
02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small percentage of the population.</v>

2945
02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Neither Andy Dick nor you'll ell Ramiro </v>
<v Speaker 1>are trans people,</v>

2946
02:04:49.130 --> 02:04:49.963
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2947
02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:52.560
<v Speaker 2>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are so different though.</v>

2948
02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:53.423
<v Speaker 2>Physically in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both put them in this silly category </v>

2949
02:04:56.491 --> 02:04:56.851
<v Speaker 2>called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2950
02:04:56.851 --> 02:04:59.160
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is that mean anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he has children.</v>

2951
02:04:59.161 --> 02:04:59.994
<v Speaker 2>He made them mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impregnated different women and got </v>

2952
02:05:02.341 --> 02:05:05.220
<v Speaker 2>babies from a lot of people called men </v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't and can't.</v>

2953
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2954
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's rare.</v>

2955
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:10.080
<v Speaker 2>They were rare in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty rare.</v>

2956
02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Not that rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2957
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:14.340
<v Speaker 2>it's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most most men,</v>

2958
02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:17.450
<v Speaker 2>when they have sex with a woman and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>put sperm in their body,</v>

2959
02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:19.890
<v Speaker 2>they can one maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one characteristic,</v>

2960
02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:20.880
<v Speaker 2>but hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2961
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:21.420
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2962
02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:22.253
<v Speaker 2>you're making it as if it's a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>common thing when you're talking about </v>

2963
02:05:24.961 --> 02:05:29.961
<v Speaker 2>like a small fraction of the men can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>make babies a incredibly small fraction.</v>

2964
02:05:31.861 --> 02:05:35.130
<v Speaker 2>So an incredibly vast majority of males </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the x,</v>

2965
02:05:35.131 --> 02:05:39.930
<v Speaker 2>y chromosome who have penises are </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of impregnating a female with an</v>

2966
02:05:39.931 --> 02:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>XX chromosome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2967
02:05:42.150 --> 02:05:45.990
<v Speaker 2>the male was born a male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The female was born a female,</v>

2968
02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:47.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you mean?</v>

2969
02:05:47.791 --> 02:05:50.730
<v Speaker 2>But you aren't born a man or you aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>born a female.</v>

2970
02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are many,</v>

2971
02:05:51.891 --> 02:05:53.240
<v Speaker 1>many characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2972
02:05:53.241 --> 02:05:56.090
<v Speaker 1>That we assigned to the categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them.</v>

2973
02:05:56.630 --> 02:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>That's one characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2974
02:05:59.930 --> 02:06:00.763
<v Speaker 1>so why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that characteristic in the man </v>

2975
02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if in particular that there are some men</v>

2976
02:06:05.301 --> 02:06:06.920
<v Speaker 1>who don't share that character </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic,</v>

2977
02:06:07.210 --> 02:06:10.480
<v Speaker 2>but which ones don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the aberration.</v>

2978
02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:11.733
<v Speaker 2>The aberrations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one operation to see these are all </v>

2979
02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:15.220
<v Speaker 2>images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get a woman pregnant.</v>

2980
02:06:15.221 --> 02:06:17.350
<v Speaker 2>They don't produce sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about like very,</v>

2981
02:06:17.351 --> 02:06:18.730
<v Speaker 2>very rare cases.</v>

2982
02:06:19.390 --> 02:06:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same with center for race.</v>

2983
02:06:21.521 --> 02:06:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Same thing happens with sickle cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>anemia,</v>

2984
02:06:23.321 --> 02:06:24.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what everybody invokes when they</v>

2985
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:25.743
<v Speaker 1>want to claim that race is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only black people get sickle cell </v>

2986
02:06:28.421 --> 02:06:29.650
<v Speaker 1>anemia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what?</v>

2987
02:06:29.710 --> 02:06:33.430
<v Speaker 1>The numbers there are about the same as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of men who are infertile.</v>

2988
02:06:34.030 --> 02:06:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Why then are people with sickle cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>anemia?</v>

2989
02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Definitely black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

2990
02:06:37.751 --> 02:06:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Definitely a black thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

2991
02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2992
02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:42.220
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we.</v>

2993
02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:43.213
<v Speaker 1>There's all these characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we draw this line called man </v>

2994
02:06:47.170 --> 02:06:49.570
<v Speaker 1>around all those different people?</v>

2995
02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't we do it with animals?</v>

2996
02:06:51.410 --> 02:06:53.570
<v Speaker 2>When you have a male dog and a female </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog,</v>

2997
02:06:53.571 --> 02:06:55.330
<v Speaker 2>isn't there a male dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a female dog?</v>

2998
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Eventually there's a male dog and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying his inventions.</v>

2999
02:06:57.681 --> 02:06:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

3000
02:06:58.220 --> 02:07:00.980
<v Speaker 2>so before you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

3001
02:07:00.981 --> 02:07:01.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

3002
02:07:01.401 --> 02:07:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's not an invention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them has a penis and testicles.</v>

3003
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:05.930
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing we see.</v>

3004
02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:07.290
<v Speaker 1>We call it a penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

3005
02:07:07.291 --> 02:07:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3006
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the world I live in.</v>

3007
02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I operate in this way,</v>

3008
02:07:11.881 --> 02:07:12.330
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

3009
02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:13.163
<v Speaker 2>So if a dog penis world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I would agree on all the things </v>

3010
02:07:15.451 --> 02:07:17.570
<v Speaker 2>in the world that are dogs right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3011
02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna.</v>

3012
02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Walk around and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no dude,</v>

3013
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:21.060
<v Speaker 2>that's not a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with humans,</v>

3014
02:07:21.061 --> 02:07:21.894
<v Speaker 2>you're making a distinction that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are certain feelings and the way you </v>

3015
02:07:25.530 --> 02:07:29.580
<v Speaker 2>interface with the world that may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less masculine or feminine,</v>

3016
02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:31.650
<v Speaker 2>but it does apply to dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point here,</v>

3017
02:07:31.651 --> 02:07:34.160
<v Speaker 2>which is that we did draw a line right </v>
<v Speaker 2>in those.</v>

3018
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 2>There's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do all dogs look alike?</v>

3019
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.600
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge variation.</v>

3020
02:07:37.601 --> 02:07:39.430
<v Speaker 2>They're not talking about race though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about gender,</v>

3021
02:07:39.431 --> 02:07:40.241
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way,</v>

3022
02:07:40.241 --> 02:07:41.800
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same principle,</v>

3023
02:07:41.801 --> 02:07:43.870
<v Speaker 2>dobermans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male Dobermans,</v>

3024
02:07:43.871 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 2>and female Dobermans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3025
02:07:45.070 --> 02:07:48.070
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to buy a male Doberman and the</v>

3026
02:07:48.071 --> 02:07:49.570
<v Speaker 2>guy gives you a female dove men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3027
02:07:49.571 --> 02:07:51.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she identifies as being a male.</v>

3028
02:07:51.490 --> 02:07:53.110
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just an invention,</v>

3029
02:07:53.111 --> 02:07:54.070
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a male,</v>

3030
02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.650
<v Speaker 2>but she's a male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't disrespect for by saying she's</v>

3031
02:07:56.651 --> 02:07:57.850
<v Speaker 2>not a male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would say,</v>

3032
02:07:57.851 --> 02:07:59.800
<v Speaker 2>that guy's crazy and you want your money</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

3033
02:07:59.830 --> 02:08:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Are there any two females who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>identical to female?</v>

3034
02:08:02.351 --> 02:08:03.430
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything?</v>

3035
02:08:04.630 --> 02:08:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a really good breeder,</v>

3036
02:08:07.211 --> 02:08:09.520
<v Speaker 2>you can get pretty God damn close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about dog.</v>

3037
02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:10.453
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3038
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:13.840
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no two into organisms that are</v>

3039
02:08:13.841 --> 02:08:14.674
<v Speaker 2>identical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly not down to the hair on </v>

3040
02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:18.653
<v Speaker 2>technicality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so you can still categorize them as </v>

3041
02:08:20.501 --> 02:08:21.334
<v Speaker 2>x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y,</v>

3042
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:22.343
<v Speaker 2>x chromosomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying we shouldn't </v>

3043
02:08:23.921 --> 02:08:28.840
<v Speaker 2>categorize anything ever because we must</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that to live in this world.</v>

3044
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.823
<v Speaker 2>What are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I am saying is we should probably </v>

3045
02:08:31.391 --> 02:08:36.391
<v Speaker 2>stop applying certain categories to </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings in the ways we have done.</v>

3046
02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:38.393
<v Speaker 2>Like how so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there were male and male and </v>

3047
02:08:40.121 --> 02:08:41.690
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are certain inventions,</v>

3048
02:08:41.691 --> 02:08:45.220
<v Speaker 2>certain social constructs that do </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but bad things to do.</v>

3049
02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:46.053
<v Speaker 2>No good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their only social constructs like </v>

3050
02:08:48.730 --> 02:08:50.110
<v Speaker 2>race and gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3051
02:08:50.111 --> 02:08:50.944
<v Speaker 2>tell me how race and gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about Doberman gender </v>

3052
02:08:53.651 --> 02:08:55.750
<v Speaker 2>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at gender definition and tell</v>

3053
02:08:55.751 --> 02:08:56.584
<v Speaker 2>me how it's only bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it only bad to find men as men </v>

3054
02:09:00.841 --> 02:09:02.770
<v Speaker 2>and women is women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you say it's,</v>

3055
02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:05.170
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about making the biological claim,</v>

3056
02:09:05.230 --> 02:09:06.063
<v Speaker 2>the bright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biological connection there will </v>

3057
02:09:07.481 --> 02:09:10.990
<v Speaker 2>making a definition which is saying a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who was born,</v>

3058
02:09:10.991 --> 02:09:14.380
<v Speaker 2>a guy who gravitates towards male </v>
<v Speaker 2>activities,</v>

3059
02:09:14.381 --> 02:09:16.000
<v Speaker 2>likes females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things.</v>

3060
02:09:16.001 --> 02:09:19.930
<v Speaker 2>By saying that that's a man that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a born man and you're saying,</v>

3061
02:09:19.931 --> 02:09:21.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one is.</v>

3062
02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:22.473
<v Speaker 2>So if you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if those characteristics are naturally </v>

3063
02:09:23.711 --> 02:09:27.760
<v Speaker 2>determined than all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us guys who don't do those things</v>

3064
02:09:27.761 --> 02:09:30.870
<v Speaker 2>are unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which things are those all the time?</v>

3065
02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:31.733
<v Speaker 2>All the things that women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that you characterize as </v>

3066
02:09:33.131 --> 02:09:33.964
<v Speaker 2>being male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so common with males and what is </v>

3067
02:09:37.930 --> 02:09:41.330
<v Speaker 2>being attracted to women really aging </v>
<v Speaker 2>and with women.</v>

3068
02:09:42.070 --> 02:09:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of gay people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3069
02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a small percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population of men.</v>

3070
02:09:47.730 --> 02:09:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it one percent?</v>

3071
02:09:49.481 --> 02:09:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Is Four percent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3072
02:09:51.881 --> 02:09:53.470
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3073
02:09:53.710 --> 02:09:54.543
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about the 350 million </v>

3074
02:09:56.921 --> 02:09:58.990
<v Speaker 2>people we have living in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

3075
02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Take all them in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do this.</v>

3076
02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Take all the men who are straight up </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexual.</v>

3077
02:10:02.711 --> 02:10:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Always have to hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can classify them as gay men.</v>

3078
02:10:06.190 --> 02:10:06.820
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

3079
02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:08.080
<v Speaker 2>So just take that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that is,</v>

3080
02:10:08.410 --> 02:10:10.120
<v Speaker 2>if it's one or two or five or 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

3081
02:10:10.121 --> 02:10:10.954
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only been homosexual hundred </v>

3082
02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:13.630
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never been attracted to a woman period.</v>

3083
02:10:13.631 --> 02:10:14.464
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3084
02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:16.150
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's still a really significant,</v>

3085
02:10:16.151 --> 02:10:17.230
<v Speaker 2>significant number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not done.</v>

3086
02:10:17.231 --> 02:10:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then.</v>

3087
02:10:18.281 --> 02:10:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Take the men who don't identify as </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexual,</v>

3088
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:24.700
<v Speaker 2>have had sex with women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been attracted to women,</v>

3089
02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:27.040
<v Speaker 2>but have fucked men prisoners.</v>

3090
02:10:27.070 --> 02:10:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Pretty Damn big number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty dense.</v>

3091
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

3092
02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:33.560
<v Speaker 2>How many guys do you think that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted to women but still fuck men?</v>

3093
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:35.900
<v Speaker 2>So Kinsey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kinsey study.</v>

3094
02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 19 forties and fifties.</v>

3095
02:10:37.730 --> 02:10:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Found that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 30 percent.</v>

3096
02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty percent of men.</v>

3097
02:10:42.531 --> 02:10:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man reached orgasm in a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience with another man.</v>

3098
02:10:46.641 --> 02:10:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty percent.</v>

3099
02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3100
02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:52.430
<v Speaker 2>It was a very large number of was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with freaks.</v>

3101
02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

3102
02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:55.010
<v Speaker 2>There were different numbers for women </v>
<v Speaker 2>and men,</v>

3103
02:10:55.011 --> 02:10:58.300
<v Speaker 2>but they were both very significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Percentages vary.</v>

3104
02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Not Majority's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very significant percentage as well.</v>

3105
02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:01.953
<v Speaker 2>I have personally known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've personally known many men who you </v>

3106
02:11:05.241 --> 02:11:07.730
<v Speaker 2>would consider straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who identify as straight,</v>

3107
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:11.150
<v Speaker 2>who have done something with men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either given him a blow job,</v>

3108
02:11:11.151 --> 02:11:14.300
<v Speaker 2>gotten a blow job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had full onset jerk each other off.</v>

3109
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised this is news to you.</v>

3110
02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's news in that way.</v>

3111
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:20.833
<v Speaker 2>Even if they did do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about individual sexual </v>

3112
02:11:23.001 --> 02:11:25.160
<v Speaker 2>acts between people who are male or </v>
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>

3113
02:11:25.161 --> 02:11:27.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're still talking about a man,</v>

3114
02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:30.050
<v Speaker 2>so talking about a man that's having sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>with other men.</v>

3115
02:11:30.051 --> 02:11:32.820
<v Speaker 2>You're defining it such in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're literally saying,</v>

3116
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:33.703
<v Speaker 2>know a guy you are know you are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know guys who sucked other guys' </v>

3117
02:11:37.581 --> 02:11:38.900
<v Speaker 2>dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy.</v>

3118
02:11:39.110 --> 02:11:42.110
<v Speaker 2>He's done it to a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying a man do it to a man.</v>

3119
02:11:42.150 --> 02:11:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotcha.</v>

3120
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3121
02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>identified as men,</v>

3122
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:48.530
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I meant.</v>

3123
02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:53.780
<v Speaker 2>People who were identified as men by </v>
<v Speaker 2>society have done these things,</v>

3124
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:56.360
<v Speaker 2>that society has to be unnatural for </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

3125
02:11:56.630 --> 02:11:59.530
<v Speaker 2>but when they were doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't they a man doing it to a man?</v>

3126
02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Look what happened to those guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Historically,</v>

3127
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:04.070
<v Speaker 2>not so much recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly still today,</v>

3128
02:12:04.071 --> 02:12:07.310
<v Speaker 2>but certainly historically we can't keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to 100 plus years.</v>

3129
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:08.143
<v Speaker 2>When I was talking about like right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>I am still talking about a man who's </v>

3130
02:12:11.150 --> 02:12:13.160
<v Speaker 2>having a sexual exchange with another </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3131
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Like you can be sexually attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another man.</v>

3132
02:12:16.011 --> 02:12:17.420
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that you're both not </v>
<v Speaker 2>met.</v>

3133
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:19.470
<v Speaker 2>So do you think homosexual men or men?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3134
02:12:19.490 --> 02:12:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're male.</v>

3135
02:12:21.081 --> 02:12:22.610
<v Speaker 2>They have a penis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have x,</v>

3136
02:12:22.611 --> 02:12:23.444
<v Speaker 2>y chromosomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can get a woman pregnant if they </v>

3137
02:12:24.861 --> 02:12:25.694
<v Speaker 2>wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could donate their sperm to their </v>

3138
02:12:27.351 --> 02:12:28.184
<v Speaker 2>lesbian pals and they just eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the characteristics that you </v>

3139
02:12:31.131 --> 02:12:33.530
<v Speaker 2>previously previously said was male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3140
02:12:33.850 --> 02:12:34.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3141
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Most men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most are attracted to women,</v>

3142
02:12:38.810 --> 02:12:43.700
<v Speaker 2>but a good percentage of them are gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not like complicated stuff.</v>

3143
02:12:43.701 --> 02:12:44.570
<v Speaker 2>There's still men.</v>

3144
02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3145
02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where to go from here.</v>

3146
02:12:50.271 --> 02:12:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've,</v>

3147
02:12:51.590 --> 02:12:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I think I've made the argument I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3148
02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:54.853
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because I thought you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally with me for like an hour and a </v>

3149
02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:01.760
<v Speaker 1>half and now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you're not there.</v>

3150
02:13:01.770 --> 02:13:02.603
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a giant spectrum of </v>

3151
02:13:05.371 --> 02:13:06.204
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to say that a guy is in born to a </v>

3152
02:13:07.351 --> 02:13:11.280
<v Speaker 2>man or a woman isn't born a woman I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is disingenuous.</v>

3153
02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

3154
02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:14.410
<v Speaker 1>it's where the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3155
02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand,</v>

3156
02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in India and I think</v>

3157
02:13:20.330 --> 02:13:24.770
<v Speaker 2>there's several Polynesian countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's several countries where there is</v>

3158
02:13:24.771 --> 02:13:28.490
<v Speaker 2>a legal and cultural and social category</v>

3159
02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:31.620
<v Speaker 1>that is neither man nor woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor male or female.</v>

3160
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Like in Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lady boys.</v>

3161
02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:34.913
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's other countries to have </v>

3162
02:13:35.581 --> 02:13:36.241
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look it up.</v>

3163
02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:36.930
<v Speaker 1>It's either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3164
02:13:36.930 --> 02:13:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3165
02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:38.760
<v Speaker 1>You know about this mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3166
02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about that?</v>

3167
02:13:41.250 --> 02:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>What about those people too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>

3168
02:13:43.190 --> 02:13:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3169
02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:44.930
<v Speaker 1>I think there's that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

3170
02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:46.043
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3171
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:49.110
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying people can be born a man,</v>

3172
02:13:49.111 --> 02:13:52.560
<v Speaker 3>but if people can be born a woman or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can get these andy,</v>

3173
02:13:52.561 --> 02:13:54.950
<v Speaker 3>Dick Yoel Romero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird variation.</v>

3174
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:55.440
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

3175
02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:56.273
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the lady boys from Thailand and </v>

3176
02:13:57.961 --> 02:14:00.450
<v Speaker 1>move them here to this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3177
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:02.670
<v Speaker 1>how will they be considered?</v>

3178
02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:05.810
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How will they be?</v>

3179
02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Americans don't have those categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3180
02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:12.480
<v Speaker 3>We have only two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of variables in Thailand.</v>

3181
02:14:12.481 --> 02:14:13.314
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with like really young </v>

3182
02:14:15.601 --> 02:14:18.440
<v Speaker 3>sex workers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird shit that goes on</v>

3183
02:14:18.441 --> 02:14:19.800
<v Speaker 3>in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of abuse.</v>

3184
02:14:19.801 --> 02:14:21.720
<v Speaker 3>So as the ladyboy category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real or not,</v>

3185
02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:25.010
<v Speaker 3>it certainly realizes the Trans category</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3186
02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:26.850
<v Speaker 3>They consider that real and here we do </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

3187
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:27.713
<v Speaker 3>but if it is real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think you agree it's Rio and I </v>

3188
02:14:30.361 --> 02:14:31.890
<v Speaker 3>agree it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3189
02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:32.763
<v Speaker 3>Trans people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means there's absolutely people </v>

3190
02:14:34.231 --> 02:14:35.760
<v Speaker 3>that feel like they're born in the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>

3191
02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:39.750
<v Speaker 3>so why isn't a man real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it a woman?</v>

3192
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:42.680
<v Speaker 1>If you want to say they're all equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

3193
02:14:42.681 --> 02:14:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

3194
02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:45.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3195
02:14:45.261 --> 02:14:46.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just that those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3196
02:14:46.131 --> 02:14:48.830
<v Speaker 1>those categories have no absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3197
02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.090
<v Speaker 1>biological meaning there's not a meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're fluid,</v>

3198
02:14:53.110 --> 02:14:53.690
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3199
02:14:53.690 --> 02:14:55.190
<v Speaker 1>basically arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

3200
02:14:55.191 --> 02:14:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean there that we invent them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's useless,</v>

3201
02:14:58.041 --> 02:14:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we should never have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

3202
02:14:59.961 --> 02:15:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that those categories </v>
<v Speaker 1>have changed and they changed,</v>

3203
02:15:02.730 --> 02:15:03.563
<v Speaker 3>but you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on where you are in the wild </v>

3204
02:15:05.011 --> 02:15:08.010
<v Speaker 3>disagreeing with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of did say that a man is born a</v>

3205
02:15:08.011 --> 02:15:12.240
<v Speaker 3>man and a woman isn't born and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for sure a lot of them are for sure.</v>

3206
02:15:12.241 --> 02:15:13.074
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people that have your </v>
<v Speaker 3>stereotypical classic female </v>

3207
02:15:17.041 --> 02:15:17.874
<v Speaker 3>characteristics were born female and for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure there's a lot of men who have </v>

3208
02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:26.370
<v Speaker 3>classic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stereotypical male behavior and patterns</v>

3209
02:15:26.371 --> 02:15:27.204
<v Speaker 3>and desires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're born men and then there's trans </v>

3210
02:15:29.431 --> 02:15:30.264
<v Speaker 3>people and then there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's asexual people to Charleston </v>

3211
02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:33.293
<v Speaker 3>needs to be considered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's people that just don't have any </v>

3212
02:15:34.381 --> 02:15:37.020
<v Speaker 3>desire to fuck anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to.</v>

3213
02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.230
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to be a man or a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can call themselves queer.</v>

3214
02:15:40.231 --> 02:15:41.520
<v Speaker 3>They can call themselves whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

3215
02:15:41.610 --> 02:15:44.880
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to be a female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to be a male,</v>

3216
02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:46.650
<v Speaker 3>they just want to be human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the deal.</v>

3217
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:47.683
<v Speaker 1>How about let's make a deal if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you have to say about it </v>

3218
02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:51.733
<v Speaker 1>and you want to not get in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people doing those things and making </v>

3219
02:15:54.171 --> 02:15:56.990
<v Speaker 1>those decisions for themselves and let </v>
<v Speaker 1>them do what they want to do.</v>

3220
02:15:57.290 --> 02:15:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I am totally with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3221
02:15:58.630 --> 02:15:59.463
<v Speaker 3>It's true for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get in the way of </v>

3222
02:16:00.221 --> 02:16:01.054
<v Speaker 3>anybody making it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get in the way of </v>

3223
02:16:02.051 --> 02:16:03.100
<v Speaker 3>furries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

3224
02:16:03.130 --> 02:16:05.830
<v Speaker 3>If you really identify with being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant squirrel,</v>

3225
02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:07.040
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

3226
02:16:07.070 --> 02:16:09.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3227
02:16:09.230 --> 02:16:13.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that claims and I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to end it here,</v>

3228
02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:15.253
<v Speaker 1>claims about these essential </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that it's biologically </v>

3229
02:16:18.441 --> 02:16:19.274
<v Speaker 1>determined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3230
02:16:19.850 --> 02:16:23.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the things that reinforce getting in</v>

3231
02:16:23.691 --> 02:16:25.040
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laws,</v>

3232
02:16:25.070 --> 02:16:26.090
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>

3233
02:16:26.091 --> 02:16:26.924
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>norms that get in the way of people </v>

3234
02:16:28.341 --> 02:16:30.370
<v Speaker 1>doing what they want to do with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own lives.</v>

3235
02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:32.410
<v Speaker 1>MM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3236
02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure with some people will be.</v>

3237
02:16:36.090 --> 02:16:39.740
<v Speaker 3>Variables are so extreme and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum is so broad.</v>

3238
02:16:39.850 --> 02:16:41.590
<v Speaker 1>So after I was on your show the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

3239
02:16:42.350 --> 02:16:43.183
<v Speaker 1>a got a whole bunch of comments from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people calling me a fag and a pussy and </v>

3240
02:16:46.601 --> 02:16:49.720
<v Speaker 1>a sissy and a this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read those feminizing me.</v>

3241
02:16:49.721 --> 02:16:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's not your fault for calling me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

3242
02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:52.550
<v Speaker 1>You can't read those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3243
02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever.</v>

3244
02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:54.153
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people like came to twitter and </v>

3245
02:16:55.061 --> 02:16:55.601
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3246
02:16:55.601 --> 02:16:56.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't read those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3247
02:16:56.620 --> 02:16:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned.</v>

3248
02:16:57.690 --> 02:16:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stopped.</v>

3249
02:16:58.350 --> 02:16:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't matter.</v>

3250
02:16:59.351 --> 02:17:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This didn't bother me at all.</v>

3251
02:17:01.450 --> 02:17:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually agreed so in other words,</v>

3252
02:17:03.641 --> 02:17:04.474
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of them they were really </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying and some of them elaborated on </v>

3253
02:17:07.121 --> 02:17:10.990
<v Speaker 1>this was that I was not really man </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

3254
02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was less of a man for whatever reason.</v>

3255
02:17:13.601 --> 02:17:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

3256
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:15.650
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>

3257
02:17:15.651 --> 02:17:16.484
<v Speaker 1>It was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really proves my point is that </v>

3258
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:20.103
<v Speaker 1>these things are very fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of were kicking me out of </v>

3259
02:17:22.211 --> 02:17:23.770
<v Speaker 1>the category of Man and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

3260
02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:24.840
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

3261
02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:25.673
<v Speaker 3>I think they were trying to get a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I now I don't think you could make a </v>

3262
02:17:28.831 --> 02:17:30.630
<v Speaker 3>rational argument dealing with Internet.</v>

3263
02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:32.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>

3264
02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's just one example of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes on generally,</v>

3265
02:17:34.441 --> 02:17:35.940
<v Speaker 1>which is that we do this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3266
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not even human.</v>

3267
02:17:37.321 --> 02:17:39.330
<v Speaker 3>Like when someone's interacting with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

3268
02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:42.690
<v Speaker 3>it's lacking all of the characteristics </v>
<v Speaker 3>of human interaction.</v>

3269
02:17:42.810 --> 02:17:44.820
<v Speaker 3>You're not there with a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not looking at them.</v>

3270
02:17:44.970 --> 02:17:46.650
<v Speaker 3>If someone was in front of you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3271
02:17:46.651 --> 02:17:47.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fag.</v>

3272
02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:48.660
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

3273
02:17:48.690 --> 02:17:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in danger.</v>

3274
02:17:49.651 --> 02:17:50.484
<v Speaker 3>There's a crazy person might have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend myself against this person </v>

3275
02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:54.600
<v Speaker 3>because if someone is treating me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3276
02:17:54.601 --> 02:17:56.490
<v Speaker 3>insulting me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking me in the eye.</v>

3277
02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:59.730
<v Speaker 3>We're so close to violence like anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>can happen here.</v>

3278
02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:01.560
<v Speaker 3>I guess as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not rational.</v>

3279
02:18:01.590 --> 02:18:02.423
<v Speaker 3>It is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

3280
02:18:03.010 --> 02:18:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Talking to my son as we were driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>over here,</v>

3281
02:18:04.991 --> 02:18:06.270
<v Speaker 1>because you know he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he reads,</v>

3282
02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:07.113
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he read all the comments when I was on </v>

3283
02:18:08.801 --> 02:18:10.600
<v Speaker 1>your shows and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so fun.</v>

3284
02:18:10.601 --> 02:18:11.051
<v Speaker 1>Is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toby,</v>

3285
02:18:11.051 --> 02:18:12.890
<v Speaker 1>don't read that shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3286
02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:15.750
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3287
02:18:16.210 --> 02:18:17.043
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is remarkable how many people do </v>

3288
02:18:18.701 --> 02:18:19.190
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3289
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:21.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just that they have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts about you,</v>

3290
02:18:21.371 --> 02:18:22.204
<v Speaker 1>it's that they go out of their way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write it in public to do something that </v>

3291
02:18:26.110 --> 02:18:26.943
<v Speaker 1>they'll actually sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what boggles my mind is that </v>

3292
02:18:29.171 --> 02:18:30.004
<v Speaker 1>someone will actually take the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy to like sit there and write this </v>

3293
02:18:32.951 --> 02:18:35.140
<v Speaker 1>thing on youtube or whatever you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

3294
02:18:35.170 --> 02:18:36.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this or that about me.</v>

3295
02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:38.440
<v Speaker 1>It's phenomenal.</v>

3296
02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes people have good points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3297
02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when they're insulting you,</v>

3298
02:18:43.541 --> 02:18:46.030
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they're making points while </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're insulting you.</v>

3299
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:48.970
<v Speaker 3>It's just hard to separate the wheat </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the chaff.</v>

3300
02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3301
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:53.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird way of interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that didn't exist.</v>

3302
02:18:54.010 --> 02:18:56.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was never a time in our past where</v>

3303
02:18:56.291 --> 02:18:57.124
<v Speaker 3>you could with real time during real </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously send something to </v>

3304
02:19:00.761 --> 02:19:01.594
<v Speaker 3>someone and then they read it right away</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they could be rude and all they are </v>

3305
02:19:04.601 --> 02:19:08.880
<v Speaker 3>is a twitter egg with a bunch of numbers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and letters and they call you a homo and</v>

3306
02:19:08.881 --> 02:19:09.714
<v Speaker 3>it's the real downside of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which otherwise is a miraculous boon to </v>

3307
02:19:13.001 --> 02:19:15.460
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's an adolescent stage.</v>

3308
02:19:15.550 --> 02:19:20.550
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we are finding our way </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this inescapable new technology,</v>

3309
02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:23.350
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this connection that we're sharing,</v>

3310
02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:24.760
<v Speaker 3>which is just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3311
02:19:24.761 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the reasons why I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have</v>

3312
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:31.010
<v Speaker 2>one on one conversations with people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I've noticed from</v>

3313
02:19:31.011 --> 02:19:31.844
<v Speaker 2>doing this podcast is how how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting people there are there out </v>

3314
02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:38.660
<v Speaker 2>there in the world like yourself that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could talk to,</v>

3315
02:19:38.661 --> 02:19:43.010
<v Speaker 2>but also how bad most people are in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3316
02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:47.960
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't ever have long conversations.</v>

3317
02:19:47.961 --> 02:19:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's checking their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

3318
02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:50.393
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's watching a television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worry about that because I'm very </v>

3319
02:19:53.661 --> 02:19:55.970
<v Speaker 2>pro technology and all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that does worry me.</v>

3320
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.863
<v Speaker 2>I want to go into a restaurant and I see</v>
<v Speaker 2>people sitting at the same table all </v>

3321
02:19:58.941 --> 02:19:59.960
<v Speaker 2>looking at their phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3322
02:19:59.961 --> 02:20:00.794
<v Speaker 2>Like 70 precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still like a group of seven that's </v>

3323
02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:03.433
<v Speaker 2>pressing and I and I have wondered about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quality of conversation generally </v>

3324
02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:07.880
<v Speaker 2>because just what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3325
02:20:07.881 --> 02:20:11.780
<v Speaker 2>I've been wondering and thinking it </v>
<v Speaker 2>might actually be declining.</v>

3326
02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:14.020
<v Speaker 2>The quality of our conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Personally.</v>

3327
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.863
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find myself continually disappointed </v>

3328
02:20:19.970 --> 02:20:23.420
<v Speaker 2>with very smart people that I meet that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have real conversation.</v>

3329
02:20:23.421 --> 02:20:25.440
<v Speaker 2>They talk over people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

3330
02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:26.353
<v Speaker 2>They're not listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not responding to what you're </v>

3331
02:20:29.151 --> 02:20:29.984
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're waiting for you to stop talking </v>

3332
02:20:30.741 --> 02:20:35.360
<v Speaker 2>so they can talk and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this self centered sort of way</v>

3333
02:20:35.361 --> 02:20:39.260
<v Speaker 2>of interacting with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems more prevalent than not.</v>

3334
02:20:40.010 --> 02:20:40.843
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to that because I'm around </v>
<v Speaker 2>academics a lot because they're used to </v>

3335
02:20:43.371 --> 02:20:44.204
<v Speaker 2>lecturing and that they're the smartest </v>
<v Speaker 2>person in the room and so all their job </v>

3336
02:20:46.161 --> 02:20:48.110
<v Speaker 2>is to do is to tell us what's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3337
02:20:48.111 --> 02:20:49.790
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very comfortable with that.</v>

3338
02:20:49.791 --> 02:20:50.624
<v Speaker 2>I was always amazed when I'd watch these</v>
<v Speaker 2>are really important famous professors </v>

3339
02:20:54.051 --> 02:20:54.920
<v Speaker 2>at Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3340
02:20:54.921 --> 02:20:56.870
<v Speaker 2>give these lectures to the hall of 500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in.</v>

3341
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:57.703
<v Speaker 2>It seemed to me they didn't even know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are other people in the room </v>

3342
02:21:00.530 --> 02:21:03.290
<v Speaker 2>the way they were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it didn't matter what the reactions</v>

3343
02:21:03.291 --> 02:21:04.490
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether people were asleep,</v>

3344
02:21:04.491 --> 02:21:06.270
<v Speaker 2>whether they're reading the newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just didn't care.</v>

3345
02:21:06.271 --> 02:21:08.300
<v Speaker 2>They just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept talking to talk and talk for two</v>

3346
02:21:08.301 --> 02:21:10.200
<v Speaker 2>hours straight ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3347
02:21:10.210 --> 02:21:11.150
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

3348
02:21:11.151 --> 02:21:11.984
<v Speaker 2>I'm the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I panic if I feel like the person I'm </v>

3349
02:21:14.571 --> 02:21:16.430
<v Speaker 2>talking to isn't listening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

3350
02:21:16.431 --> 02:21:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I panic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3351
02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:20.660
<v Speaker 2>And so when I see if I'm lecturing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>200 students,</v>

3352
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I see one kid kind of just get a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>distracted.</v>

3353
02:21:24.051 --> 02:21:24.884
<v Speaker 2>I freak and I feel like I have to up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>game right then and I have to go </v>

3354
02:21:27.111 --> 02:21:29.060
<v Speaker 2>directly address them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you care.</v>

3355
02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:29.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3356
02:21:29.871 --> 02:21:31.640
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care in a particular way.</v>

3357
02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:32.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's some,</v>

3358
02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:34.730
<v Speaker 2>it's another form of narcissism I </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppose,</v>

3359
02:21:34.731 --> 02:21:35.564
<v Speaker 2>but I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that's what makes me a good </v>

3360
02:21:36.951 --> 02:21:40.220
<v Speaker 2>teacher because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to have interaction will you want</v>

3361
02:21:40.221 --> 02:21:42.770
<v Speaker 2>to connect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to know what you're hearing,</v>

3362
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:44.063
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to know what you're hearing from </v>

3363
02:21:44.811 --> 02:21:46.550
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>

3364
02:21:46.551 --> 02:21:49.370
<v Speaker 2>and then we can really talk and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>also am really curious.</v>

3365
02:21:49.371 --> 02:21:50.204
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a curious person and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what you're thinking and let's do </v>

3366
02:21:53.451 --> 02:21:54.001
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3367
02:21:54.001 --> 02:21:54.834
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then let's have that chemistry that </v>

3368
02:21:55.761 --> 02:21:57.080
<v Speaker 2>happened just now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which got hot,</v>

3369
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:58.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like that's,</v>

3370
02:21:59.180 --> 02:22:02.270
<v Speaker 2>that's where life is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where real personal relationships</v>

3371
02:22:02.271 --> 02:22:03.104
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3372
02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:04.003
<v Speaker 2>Comics kind of do the same thing too </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're used to being the one </v>

3373
02:22:05.901 --> 02:22:08.660
<v Speaker 2>who's talking on stage or if they do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

3374
02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:11.140
<v Speaker 2>they're used to being the one who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking all the time.</v>

3375
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:12.980
<v Speaker 2>The ones who do crowd work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3376
02:22:13.220 --> 02:22:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it,</v>

3377
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:15.503
<v Speaker 2>if they're the ones who interact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a whole part of their act where </v>

3378
02:22:17.181 --> 02:22:19.130
<v Speaker 2>it's crowd work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most comics,</v>

3379
02:22:19.131 --> 02:22:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean don't they have some indirect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3380
02:22:21.171 --> 02:22:23.150
<v Speaker 2>definitely the interaction with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd and happens a lot.</v>

3381
02:22:23.151 --> 02:22:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're dealing with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking alcohol</v>

3382
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.903
<v Speaker 1>in a social environment and it's dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and it's nighttime and they're </v>

3383
02:22:29.361 --> 02:22:30.194
<v Speaker 1>having fun and they're laughing and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're talking about </v>

3384
02:22:32.341 --> 02:22:35.730
<v Speaker 1>controversial opinions in subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always,</v>

3385
02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:38.100
<v Speaker 1>all the comics talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3386
02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:41.330
<v Speaker 1>you feel the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel that interaction.</v>

3387
02:22:41.370 --> 02:22:42.203
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I'm talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors and they're tweed jackets at </v>

3388
02:22:44.551 --> 02:22:45.384
<v Speaker 1>Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God it didn't matter what </v>

3389
02:22:46.561 --> 02:22:48.920
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was happening and the lecturer is a</v>

3390
02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:53.420
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of arrogance and I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must get after being a professor,</v>

3391
02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:56.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a particular narcissism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live entirely in their heads,</v>

3392
02:22:56.821 --> 02:22:57.654
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just sit in their study and read </v>

3393
02:22:58.411 --> 02:22:59.244
<v Speaker 1>books and then they go out and then give</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lecture and then they come back and </v>

3394
02:23:01.321 --> 02:23:02.880
<v Speaker 1>read this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read the book and you know,</v>

3395
02:23:03.420 --> 02:23:04.253
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird narcissism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really get to interact with </v>

3396
02:23:05.881 --> 02:23:07.920
<v Speaker 1>other professors and go over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work together.</v>

3397
02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:09.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am stereotyping and generalizing.</v>

3398
02:23:09.811 --> 02:23:12.720
<v Speaker 1>This is not everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did see this a lot and I still do.</v>

3399
02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some interactions,</v>

3400
02:23:14.131 --> 02:23:15.150
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly through,</v>

3401
02:23:15.151 --> 02:23:15.984
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you write a paper and then you send it </v>

3402
02:23:16.921 --> 02:23:17.754
<v Speaker 1>out to the journal and then some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor reviews it write anonymously </v>

3403
02:23:21.121 --> 02:23:21.954
<v Speaker 1>often and sends it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all very weird passive aggressive </v>

3404
02:23:24.211 --> 02:23:25.044
<v Speaker 1>shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the other thing about </v>

3405
02:23:26.101 --> 02:23:30.660
<v Speaker 1>academia I can't stand is that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>allergic to direct conflict.</v>

3406
02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:32.093
<v Speaker 1>Like the argument you and I just had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much not allowed except </v>

3407
02:23:36.001 --> 02:23:38.280
<v Speaker 1>through writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do it through writing,</v>

3408
02:23:38.890 --> 02:23:39.723
<v Speaker 1>but they won't do it head to head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem because it takes </v>

3409
02:23:42.631 --> 02:23:44.490
<v Speaker 1>too long to work out an idea that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3410
02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:45.353
<v Speaker 1>Like real debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I went to college I had this idea </v>

3411
02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:53.220
<v Speaker 1>that it would be really smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like professors,</v>

3412
02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:56.190
<v Speaker 1>like more than one would be in a room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would have,</v>

3413
02:23:56.220 --> 02:23:58.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one major issue and they would debate it</v>

3414
02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.290
<v Speaker 1>that there would be argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3415
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:03.990
<v Speaker 1>There'll be conflict of ideas about an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

3416
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:06.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that.</v>

3417
02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It's never that I have been in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>around college campuses for 32 years.</v>

3418
02:24:14.490 --> 02:24:18.120
<v Speaker 1>I have never really seen a head to head </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

3419
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Like even I just had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

3420
02:24:20.610 --> 02:24:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Person to person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean here and there a little bit,</v>

3421
02:24:23.851 --> 02:24:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not what we're really,</v>

3422
02:24:25.831 --> 02:24:28.590
<v Speaker 1>really going at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever seen that.</v>

3423
02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean the enemy among faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some students do,</v>

3424
02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:33.450
<v Speaker 1>but faculty don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're scared of it.</v>

3425
02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem with cowardice and one</v>

3426
02:24:36.811 --> 02:24:39.180
<v Speaker 1>of the real tragedies with that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

3427
02:24:39.181 --> 02:24:43.590
<v Speaker 1>there's no real conflict of ideas which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is reinforced by the tenure system,</v>

3428
02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:46.350
<v Speaker 1>the accreditation system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3429
02:24:46.351 --> 02:24:50.910
<v Speaker 1>it's this monolith where there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why you get this uniformity,</v>

3430
02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:55.920
<v Speaker 1>the uniformity of the ideas on campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all this monolith that actually has</v>

3431
02:24:56.311 --> 02:24:57.810
<v Speaker 1>its head at the federal government.</v>

3432
02:24:58.950 --> 02:25:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about the accreditation </v>
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>

3433
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's the mafia,</v>

3434
02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:04.673
<v Speaker 1>people don't even know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get accredited as a college or </v>

3435
02:25:07.501 --> 02:25:08.334
<v Speaker 1>university in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be accredited by an agency </v>

3436
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:12.023
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is authorized by the Department of </v>

3437
02:25:14.970 --> 02:25:15.803
<v Speaker 1>Education in Washington DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The secretary of Education has to </v>

3438
02:25:19.770 --> 02:25:24.770
<v Speaker 1>authorize your existence as a legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal college or university.</v>

3439
02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:27.333
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So renegade university people were </v>

3440
02:25:29.231 --> 02:25:30.910
<v Speaker 1>asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted me,</v>

3441
02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:32.800
<v Speaker 1>they want some people want to call it </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit and I was like,</v>

3442
02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me look into this.</v>

3443
02:25:34.690 --> 02:25:35.523
<v Speaker 1>And so I did and I quickly found out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's the fucking mafia that I </v>

3444
02:25:38.621 --> 02:25:41.980
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get accredited because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all these,</v>

3445
02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:43.733
<v Speaker 1>they have all these standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a particular number of </v>

3446
02:25:46.481 --> 02:25:48.430
<v Speaker 1>buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a particular number of professors.</v>

3447
02:25:48.431 --> 02:25:51.040
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a library with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular number of books in it.</v>

3448
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:54.250
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to drop all these things and if</v>

3449
02:25:54.251 --> 02:25:56.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't have those things you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3450
02:25:57.790 --> 02:25:59.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get college credit,</v>

3451
02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:00.393
<v Speaker 1>no other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what if you did like I gave you five </v>

3452
02:26:02.381 --> 02:26:03.214
<v Speaker 1>credits for taking one of my courses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No other college and university would </v>

3453
02:26:06.401 --> 02:26:10.030
<v Speaker 1>recognize it if you want it to transfer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you wanted to go to graduate school</v>

3454
02:26:10.031 --> 02:26:10.960
<v Speaker 1>or go somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something.</v>

3455
02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:12.453
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>employers would look at it and see that </v>

3456
02:26:14.021 --> 02:26:17.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not an accredited university where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got those credits from.</v>

3457
02:26:17.290 --> 02:26:19.900
<v Speaker 1>So how do those degree mills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they do it?</v>

3458
02:26:20.050 --> 02:26:20.883
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's two different systems at the </v>

3459
02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:23.973
<v Speaker 1>Department of Education controls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is for the so called elite </v>

3460
02:26:25.721 --> 02:26:26.554
<v Speaker 1>prestigious schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are regional accreditation </v>

3461
02:26:28.841 --> 02:26:30.010
<v Speaker 1>agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3462
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:35.070
<v Speaker 1>all authorized by the Department of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Education and the for profit colleges.</v>

3463
02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:40.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a separate accreditation system </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the national accreditation system</v>

3464
02:26:40.061 --> 02:26:41.860
<v Speaker 1>and that's also controlled by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>department of education,</v>

3465
02:26:41.861 --> 02:26:44.460
<v Speaker 1>but everybody knows within it that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

3466
02:26:44.570 --> 02:26:47.290
<v Speaker 1>if you get accredited by one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>national accreditation system,</v>

3467
02:26:47.291 --> 02:26:50.110
<v Speaker 1>zero bullshit for profit the Greenville.</v>

3468
02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:50.973
<v Speaker 1>So those credits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't transfer them to Harvard or </v>

3469
02:26:54.461 --> 02:26:58.090
<v Speaker 1>occidental or any of the of the elite so</v>
<v Speaker 1>called elite schools.</v>

3470
02:26:58.450 --> 02:26:59.283
<v Speaker 1>So they're completely kept separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't even if you get a degree </v>

3471
02:27:02.291 --> 02:27:04.550
<v Speaker 1>from like Phoenix University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you can't.</v>

3472
02:27:04.551 --> 02:27:07.210
<v Speaker 1>You can get 5,000 degrees from Phoenix </v>
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

3473
02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:08.493
<v Speaker 1>My degree is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't take anywhere and I'm talking </v>

3474
02:27:09.581 --> 02:27:14.230
<v Speaker 1>about even even community colleges won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept those credits.</v>

3475
02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

3476
02:27:17.890 --> 02:27:19.780
<v Speaker 1>It's the mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about that,</v>

3477
02:27:19.781 --> 02:27:21.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Department of Education,</v>

3478
02:27:21.610 --> 02:27:24.910
<v Speaker 1>one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal government decides who's in,</v>

3479
02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:25.773
<v Speaker 1>who's out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then inside that system there's </v>

3480
02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:31.300
<v Speaker 1>tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime appointment.</v>

3481
02:27:32.110 --> 02:27:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Those people control the curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is taught.</v>

3482
02:27:35.170 --> 02:27:36.003
<v Speaker 1>They also control who's hired and fired </v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty control all the hiring and </v>

3483
02:27:39.101 --> 02:27:43.000
<v Speaker 1>firing of faculty and tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ultimately control that basically.</v>

3484
02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:44.433
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're there forever like dawns in </v>

3485
02:27:47.561 --> 02:27:48.910
<v Speaker 1>the Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

3486
02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:54.280
<v Speaker 1>So you wonder why when you walk into any</v>
<v Speaker 1>college classroom in this country,</v>

3487
02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:55.173
<v Speaker 1>you hear basically the same shit being </v>
<v Speaker 1>said and sociology classes and history </v>

3488
02:27:57.851 --> 02:28:02.830
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's astonishing.</v>

3489
02:28:02.831 --> 02:28:03.664
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't even know the full extent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it until I started renegade </v>

3490
02:28:06.041 --> 02:28:08.080
<v Speaker 1>university and people started asking me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

3491
02:28:08.170 --> 02:28:11.170
<v Speaker 1>What if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone allowed you to come along,</v>

3492
02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:12.500
<v Speaker 1>if Donald Trump said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

3493
02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I love your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3494
02:28:14.370 --> 02:28:16.330
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you do to fix that?</v>

3495
02:28:16.331 --> 02:28:20.260
<v Speaker 1>What would you offer as an alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to change it.</v>

3496
02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:21.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing I do.</v>

3497
02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean meaning,</v>

3498
02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:24.350
<v Speaker 2>if he wanted credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like college credit,</v>

3499
02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:26.510
<v Speaker 2>right now there's really nothing I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

3500
02:28:26.810 --> 02:28:27.643
<v Speaker 2>I can certainly give them a certificate </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe an employer will think it's </v>

3501
02:28:30.561 --> 02:28:31.394
<v Speaker 2>meaningful because my name's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it less and less valuable to have a </v>

3502
02:28:34.401 --> 02:28:35.234
<v Speaker 2>degree today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying I'm just completely outside </v>

3503
02:28:37.191 --> 02:28:37.700
<v Speaker 2>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3504
02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:38.630
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3505
02:28:38.631 --> 02:28:39.470
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

3506
02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:40.393
<v Speaker 2>if you admired me and my work right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you saw and I had and he had a </v>

3507
02:28:44.451 --> 02:28:48.890
<v Speaker 2>certificate saying this guy's great and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he took my course,</v>

3508
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:50.690
<v Speaker 2>you as an employer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would actually help.</v>

3509
02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:51.553
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in that case it would be </v>

3510
02:28:52.101 --> 02:28:53.450
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My credits,</v>

3511
02:28:53.451 --> 02:28:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

3512
02:28:55.641 --> 02:28:56.474
<v Speaker 2>It means nothing inside the system of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thousands and thousands of colleges </v>

3513
02:28:59.331 --> 02:29:01.490
<v Speaker 2>and universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for most employers,</v>

3514
02:29:01.570 --> 02:29:04.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most employers abide by this.</v>

3515
02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:06.290
<v Speaker 2>They think that if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>accredited,</v>

3516
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:07.363
<v Speaker 2>your bullshit.</v>

3517
02:29:08.210 --> 02:29:09.043
<v Speaker 2>So we have to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Betsy devoss for whatever her </v>

3518
02:29:13.821 --> 02:29:14.654
<v Speaker 2>problems are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be the first secretary of </v>

3519
02:29:17.571 --> 02:29:22.571
<v Speaker 2>education maybe we've ever had who could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be willing to challenge this.</v>

3520
02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.901
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3521
02:29:23.901 --> 02:29:24.734
<v Speaker 2>Because she's about deregulation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>privatization and all this stuff and </v>

3522
02:29:28.161 --> 02:29:29.740
<v Speaker 2>choice school choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3523
02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:30.673
<v Speaker 2>and we need a movement right now before </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's gone to get her to abolish the </v>

3524
02:29:35.331 --> 02:29:39.230
<v Speaker 2>national accreditation system all with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stroke of a pen,</v>

3525
02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:40.543
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe a congressional act probably </v>

3526
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:45.650
<v Speaker 2>takes a congressional act to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she herself I think could discredit.</v>

3527
02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:46.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure she could discredit all </v>

3528
02:29:47.451 --> 02:29:48.284
<v Speaker 2>those agencies right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think there's just this inherent </v>

3529
02:29:50.841 --> 02:29:51.674
<v Speaker 2>bottleneck that it's existed for so long</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that these people have been in </v>

3530
02:29:54.921 --> 02:29:57.710
<v Speaker 2>charge of saying what is true and what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not true?</v>

3531
02:29:57.711 --> 02:29:58.544
<v Speaker 2>What should it be taught in monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a monopoly ultimately controlled by the </v>

3532
02:30:01.071 --> 02:30:05.090
<v Speaker 2>federal government that it's also not </v>
<v Speaker 2>universally agreed that they're correct.</v>

3533
02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

3534
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:10.030
<v Speaker 2>In what they're teaching and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a,</v>

3535
02:30:10.031 --> 02:30:14.470
<v Speaker 2>an absolute standard for what needs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be taught if someone wants to get into.</v>

3536
02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:14.781
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3537
02:30:14.781 --> 02:30:16.910
<v Speaker 2>there are up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are absolute standards.</v>

3538
02:30:16.911 --> 02:30:18.710
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have to have this,</v>

3539
02:30:18.711 --> 02:30:19.544
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing on your college </v>

3540
02:30:20.061 --> 02:30:21.070
<v Speaker 2>campus to be accredited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3541
02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:22.050
<v Speaker 2>that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3542
02:30:22.430 --> 02:30:24.380
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3543
02:30:24.410 --> 02:30:25.243
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what constitutes a master's degree in </v>

3544
02:30:26.421 --> 02:30:27.410
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3545
02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there an absolute standard?</v>

3546
02:30:30.860 --> 02:30:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the.</v>

3547
02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3548
02:30:32.060 --> 02:30:33.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty absolute.</v>

3549
02:30:33.321 --> 02:30:34.154
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accreditation agencies mostly agree on </v>

3550
02:30:35.151 --> 02:30:35.984
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why couldn't you just reproduce that </v>

3551
02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:39.133
<v Speaker 2>in an environment where you're being </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught by someone who obviously has a </v>

3552
02:30:42.891 --> 02:30:45.070
<v Speaker 2>mastery of that particular subject?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what Joe.</v>

3553
02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:46.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3554
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:47.301
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3555
02:30:47.301 --> 02:30:48.540
<v Speaker 2>that's what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just me,</v>

3556
02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:49.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3557
02:30:49.050 --> 02:30:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3558
02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:51.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the pioneers.</v>

3559
02:30:51.261 --> 02:30:52.820
<v Speaker 2>But it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many other people are doing what?</v>

3560
02:30:52.821 --> 02:30:54.290
<v Speaker 2>You're doing a handful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3561
02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:57.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's becoming a new Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually looking at.</v>

3562
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:59.300
<v Speaker 2>When I heard him talking about that on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your show,</v>

3563
02:30:59.301 --> 02:30:59.991
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for it,</v>

3564
02:30:59.991 --> 02:31:00.441
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3565
02:31:00.441 --> 02:31:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Well he didn't grant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what he said.</v>

3566
02:31:02.031 --> 02:31:02.864
<v Speaker 2>He was no criticism at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know this either until </v>

3567
02:31:05.481 --> 02:31:06.260
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3568
02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:08.840
<v Speaker 2>he had this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it about accreditation?</v>

3569
02:31:08.841 --> 02:31:10.820
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was possible somehow to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get accredited,</v>

3570
02:31:10.821 --> 02:31:11.900
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

3571
02:31:11.901 --> 02:31:14.210
<v Speaker 2>We have to start an entirely separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>parallel,</v>

3572
02:31:14.211 --> 02:31:16.220
<v Speaker 2>different system Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3573
02:31:16.250 --> 02:31:19.800
<v Speaker 2>possibly it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be credited and possible.</v>

3574
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:21.030
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless,</v>

3575
02:31:21.031 --> 02:31:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I am all for him doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope he does.</v>

3576
02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was recently denied.</v>

3577
02:31:25.741 --> 02:31:27.980
<v Speaker 2>A grant for the first time is Debit </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea.</v>

3578
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they're not playing around.</v>

3579
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:33.420
<v Speaker 2>They're not playing around on this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>their castle.</v>

3580
02:31:33.570 --> 02:31:35.340
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to let us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Naves in.</v>

3581
02:31:35.610 --> 02:31:36.443
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is because of social </v>

3582
02:31:37.501 --> 02:31:38.334
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of coming on podcasts like mine </v>

3583
02:31:39.901 --> 02:31:40.734
<v Speaker 2>and his youtube presence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually got a large movement of </v>

3584
02:31:43.831 --> 02:31:48.420
<v Speaker 2>people that are interested in his ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a disastrous fucking conversation</v>

3585
02:31:48.421 --> 02:31:49.800
<v Speaker 2>with Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I heard it.</v>

3586
02:31:49.860 --> 02:31:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck was that all about?</v>

3587
02:31:51.901 --> 02:31:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's holding onto God.</v>

3588
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first one wasn't even that.</v>

3589
02:31:55.500 --> 02:31:57.660
<v Speaker 2>It was about truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was God though.</v>

3590
02:31:57.860 --> 02:31:58.693
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3591
02:31:58.770 --> 02:32:02.780
<v Speaker 2>because Jordan had religious and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes he's religious,</v>

3592
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:03.623
<v Speaker 2>so he wants to hold onto this idea about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is truth being valuable for </v>

3593
02:32:09.271 --> 02:32:12.360
<v Speaker 2>humankind versus what is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one plus one equals two.</v>

3594
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:13.583
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moral moral truth versus I was kind of </v>

3595
02:32:16.201 --> 02:32:20.130
<v Speaker 2>on either side and that one was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>verbose but was too many words.</v>

3596
02:32:20.270 --> 02:32:23.190
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys gotTa fucking edit this down.</v>

3597
02:32:23.191 --> 02:32:24.024
<v Speaker 2>It was tough with Jordan had to boil it </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and they did a way better podcast </v>

3598
02:32:27.151 --> 02:32:29.110
<v Speaker 2>the second time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear the second one?</v>

3599
02:32:29.370 --> 02:32:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>

3600
02:32:31.050 --> 02:32:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Much more concise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much clear,</v>

3601
02:32:32.970 --> 02:32:33.960
<v Speaker 2>but that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3602
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I think there was this certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>healed digging on both sides.</v>

3603
02:32:37.771 --> 02:32:39.720
<v Speaker 2>They dug their heels in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stood their ground.</v>

3604
02:32:39.721 --> 02:32:42.450
<v Speaker 2>This one really preposterous issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just like,</v>

3605
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:43.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're listening to this like Jesus </v>

3606
02:32:44.581 --> 02:32:45.690
<v Speaker 2>fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>

3607
02:32:45.691 --> 02:32:48.000
<v Speaker 2>you just talking about truth for an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half.</v>

3608
02:32:48.001 --> 02:32:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is truth?</v>

3609
02:32:48.990 --> 02:32:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fire Burns paper.</v>

3610
02:32:51.451 --> 02:32:53.280
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3611
02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Like take a piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Write it on fire.</v>

3612
02:32:55.560 --> 02:32:56.850
<v Speaker 2>So stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddammit.</v>

3613
02:32:57.630 --> 02:32:58.463
<v Speaker 2>You're going to make me go again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have this conversation </v>

3614
02:32:59.550 --> 02:33:01.020
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really important,</v>

3615
02:33:01.021 --> 02:33:03.660
<v Speaker 2>but let's leave it there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did agree with them,</v>

3616
02:33:03.690 --> 02:33:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Sam and Jordan.</v>

3617
02:33:04.350 --> 02:33:06.930
<v Speaker 2>That is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just disagree with them about what,</v>

3618
02:33:07.050 --> 02:33:08.010
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

3619
02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:10.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the definition of the word true,</v>

3620
02:33:10.561 --> 02:33:13.380
<v Speaker 2>but you know what should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should have had more leeway on both</v>

3621
02:33:13.381 --> 02:33:14.880
<v Speaker 2>sides with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3622
02:33:15.210 --> 02:33:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so either way,</v>

3623
02:33:16.711 --> 02:33:17.670
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

3624
02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:19.320
<v Speaker 2>fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

3625
02:33:19.470 --> 02:33:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I have major disagreements with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>

3626
02:33:22.650 --> 02:33:27.480
<v Speaker 2>but there's still heroic and I'm totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them because they are doing this.</v>

3627
02:33:27.481 --> 02:33:28.314
<v Speaker 2>I mean Sam's not doing it formally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's essentially part of this </v>

3628
02:33:30.001 --> 02:33:31.740
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a part of this movement.</v>

3629
02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:34.230
<v Speaker 2>You know what the Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what the election was about.</v>

3630
02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:38.400
<v Speaker 2>It was about a civil war in this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been going on for a long time.</v>

3631
02:33:38.401 --> 02:33:39.234
<v Speaker 2>That finally came to a head in November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a war between the people who </v>

3632
02:33:43.171 --> 02:33:44.004
<v Speaker 2>went to college and the elite colleges </v>
<v Speaker 2>in particular and who are of that </v>

3633
02:33:46.291 --> 02:33:49.980
<v Speaker 2>culture that's created in those colleges</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those who are not of that culture.</v>

3634
02:33:50.190 --> 02:33:52.020
<v Speaker 2>That's what that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that election was about.</v>

3635
02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:53.033
<v Speaker 2>I think there is this schism between </v>
<v Speaker 2>those two groups in this country and </v>

3636
02:33:57.751 --> 02:33:58.584
<v Speaker 2>that finally the people who are not of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the elite college culture one something </v>

3637
02:34:02.910 --> 02:34:06.330
<v Speaker 2>and it caused the elites to freak </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely out.</v>

3638
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:07.703
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was looking at the top podcast </v>

3639
02:34:11.191 --> 02:34:12.024
<v Speaker 2>because I just started a podcast and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>did get ranked and so I'm excited but </v>

3640
02:34:14.611 --> 02:34:17.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at it a lot and like you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>really see it clearly to look at the top</v>

3641
02:34:17.801 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 2>200</v>

3642
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:22.600
<v Speaker 1>podcasts right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 60 to 70 percent are like NPR,</v>

3643
02:34:23.290 --> 02:34:24.520
<v Speaker 1>cookie cutter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same shit.</v>

3644
02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Coastal elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal bland,</v>

3645
02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:28.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is,</v>

3646
02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:31.000
<v Speaker 1>tone of voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say,</v>

3647
02:34:31.001 --> 02:34:32.260
<v Speaker 1>who their guests are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the same.</v>

3648
02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:33.550
<v Speaker 1>You know exactly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3649
02:34:33.970 --> 02:34:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Is dominated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's you in there.</v>

3650
02:34:37.090 --> 02:34:40.270
<v Speaker 1>You're not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Sam Harris who sort of that,</v>

3651
02:34:40.271 --> 02:34:41.680
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3652
02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:44.020
<v Speaker 1>there's Dan Carlin here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another one,</v>

3653
02:34:44.170 --> 02:34:45.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's part of this movement.</v>

3654
02:34:45.461 --> 02:34:47.980
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's teaching people history.</v>

3655
02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teaching people history.</v>

3656
02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:52.720

<v Speaker 1>more people than any historic.</v>

3657
02:34:52.770 --> 02:34:55.970
<v Speaker 1>A Harvard professor will ever teach you </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than any historian,</v>

3658
02:34:55.980 --> 02:34:58.870
<v Speaker 1>more way more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets millions of downloads.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is anybody in the numbers like millions </v>

3660

02:35:05.171 --> 02:35:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Is he a serious historian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to him.</v>

3662
02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professionally trained historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivy League Phd.</v>

3663
02:35:11.050 --> 02:35:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

3664
02:35:12.310 --> 02:35:13.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with everything,</v>

3665
02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:16.750
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing serious academic,</v>

3666
02:35:16.751 --> 02:35:20.740
<v Speaker 1>professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important history and he is changing the</v>

3667
02:35:20.741 --> 02:35:21.760
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3668
02:35:21.790 --> 02:35:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on there,</v>

3669
02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:25.400
<v Speaker 1>so there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of us were there,</v>

3670
02:35:25.430 --> 02:35:27.460
<v Speaker 1>some of us we're making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're making it happen,</v>

3671
02:35:27.461 --> 02:35:28.294
<v Speaker 1>but you can just see as such a divide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's just such a divide between </v>

3672
02:35:31.721 --> 02:35:32.554
<v Speaker 1>like who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's on your podcast and who's on the </v>

3673
02:35:34.511 --> 02:35:37.870
<v Speaker 1>NPR podcasts is hardly any crossover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3674
02:35:37.871 --> 02:35:39.610
<v Speaker 1>but that's just my choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

3675
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:40.503
<v Speaker 1>That could know those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that I get that </v>

3676
02:35:42.821 --> 02:35:43.654
<v Speaker 1>are on NPR podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is that there's sort of two </v>

3677
02:35:46.211 --> 02:35:48.910
<v Speaker 1>different cultures that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

3678
02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:50.073
<v Speaker 1>There's just that culture like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is kind of a problem with my </v>

3679
02:35:52.301 --> 02:35:54.340
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and I have because she's of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that culture.</v>

3680
02:35:54.370 --> 02:35:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people I know are npr types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3681
02:35:56.561 --> 02:35:57.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what they want to hear.</v>

3682
02:35:57.400 --> 02:35:58.850
<v Speaker 1>It's comforting and soothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3683
02:35:58.851 --> 02:35:59.980
<v Speaker 1>It makes them feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3684
02:36:00.610 --> 02:36:02.230
<v Speaker 1>but they're really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's who they are.</v>

3685
02:36:02.231 --> 02:36:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like their identity and then,</v>

3686
02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:06.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they hear your podcast or my </v>

3687
02:36:08.681 --> 02:36:11.320
<v Speaker 1>podcast or anyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3688
02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:15.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a punk rock to a 80 year old.</v>

3689
02:36:15.550 --> 02:36:17.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just different culture,</v>

3690
02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:19.090
<v Speaker 1>different language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different way of behaving,</v>

3691
02:36:19.091 --> 02:36:22.360
<v Speaker 1>different ideas or questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different questions are asked.</v>

3692
02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

3693
02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:28.720
<v Speaker 1>there's this resentment to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the elites,</v>

3694
02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:32.050
<v Speaker 1>the MPR types I believe have basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked,</v>

3695
02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:32.913
<v Speaker 1>not basically they have looked down </v>
<v Speaker 1>their noses at those who didn't go to </v>

3696
02:36:36.371 --> 02:36:38.830
<v Speaker 1>college who don't speak the way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

3697
02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:42.610
<v Speaker 1>who don't talk about these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who aren't aware of these ideas.</v>

3698
02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:43.473
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Working class people like people in </v>

3699
02:36:44.561 --> 02:36:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Salem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people who,</v>

3700
02:36:46.390 --> 02:36:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3701
02:36:47.350 --> 02:36:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Meryl Streep said at best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right about mma,</v>

3702
02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:50.913
<v Speaker 1>right St.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3703
02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:51.753
<v Speaker 1>that was it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They clearly see all those people </v>

3704
02:36:55.841 --> 02:36:59.980
<v Speaker 1>outside this elite by coastal culture as</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing bad stuff,</v>

3705
02:36:59.981 --> 02:37:00.814
<v Speaker 1>inferior stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they shouldn't be allowed to run </v>

3706
02:37:02.441 --> 02:37:03.274
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said was so inherently ridiculous </v>

3707
02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:06.333
<v Speaker 1>and also ignorant because she was also </v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming that if you take out the </v>

3708
02:37:09.371 --> 02:37:10.870
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're left with mma.</v>

3709
02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:13.870
<v Speaker 1>MMA is 80 percent immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3710
02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:15.113
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3711
02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:16.173
<v Speaker 1>what she said was,</v>

3712
02:37:16.370 --> 02:37:17.780
<v Speaker 3>was stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ignorant,</v>

3713
02:37:17.781 --> 02:37:21.290
<v Speaker 3>and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think classist in that way.</v>

3714
02:37:21.291 --> 02:37:22.124
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3715
02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:25.010
<v Speaker 3>you're not smart enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not good enough.</v>

3716
02:37:25.011 --> 02:37:25.844
<v Speaker 3>She's so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of Americans that </v>

3717
02:37:27.831 --> 02:37:28.664
<v Speaker 3>engaged now in May for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many great fighters that </v>

3718
02:37:32.901 --> 02:37:34.880
<v Speaker 3>are immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a massive,</v>

3719
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:36.960
<v Speaker 3>massive amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not small mouth,</v>

3720
02:37:37.210 --> 02:37:38.043
<v Speaker 3>so she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take out all the immigrants you left </v>

3721
02:37:39.441 --> 02:37:41.240
<v Speaker 3>with mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so dumb,</v>

3722
02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:43.120
<v Speaker 3>but you know what those people do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

3723
02:37:43.170 --> 02:37:46.400
<v Speaker 3>The immigrants who do things like mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ignore them.</v>

3724
02:37:47.210 --> 02:37:49.730
<v Speaker 3>They pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pretend they don't exist.</v>

3725
02:37:49.731 --> 02:37:51.040
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't fit the narrow narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3726
02:37:51.370 --> 02:37:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Is the immigrant who also very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>

3727
02:37:54.021 --> 02:37:54.854
<v Speaker 1>They want the undocumented mom with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid who got stopped at the border and </v>

3728
02:37:57.771 --> 02:37:59.690
<v Speaker 1>sent back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who breaks my heart too?</v>

3729
02:37:59.790 --> 02:38:00.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my two.</v>

3730
02:38:00.810 --> 02:38:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they want them only to be what?</v>

3731
02:38:03.150 --> 02:38:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Victims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the solution to that?</v>

3732
02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:05.953
<v Speaker 3>That they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the solution to illegal </v>

3733
02:38:07.111 --> 02:38:09.480
<v Speaker 3>immigration in this country?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you just let everybody in?</v>

3734
02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:10.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm an open border sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3735
02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:11.813
<v Speaker 3>Open borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just let anybody in who wants to come </v>

3736
02:38:13.501 --> 02:38:14.334
<v Speaker 3>meeting of inventions and social </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructs that have done great harm to </v>

3737
02:38:16.381 --> 02:38:17.550
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Borders,</v>

3738
02:38:17.580 --> 02:38:18.550
<v Speaker 3>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3739
02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:21.630
<v Speaker 3>I agree that eventually that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a thing of the past.</v>

3740
02:38:21.631 --> 02:38:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I think there'll be a looked back when </v>
<v Speaker 3>we look back at history.</v>

3741
02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:29.600
<v Speaker 3>It'll be thought of as one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>barbaric ideas,</v>

3742
02:38:29.610 --> 02:38:30.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine?</v>

3743
02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:34.020
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it's barbaric and the way that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it used to be that you had a tribe,</v>

3744
02:38:34.021 --> 02:38:34.854
<v Speaker 3>then you invaded another tribe or they </v>
<v Speaker 3>invaded you and you had to put up a </v>

3745
02:38:37.531 --> 02:38:38.364
<v Speaker 3>fence and guard your border and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things became like larger </v>

3746
02:38:40.891 --> 02:38:41.724
<v Speaker 3>communities as communities became.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cities became countries became and then </v>

3747
02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:45.833
<v Speaker 3>you go back a few thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with these countries </v>

3748
02:38:49.351 --> 02:38:51.840
<v Speaker 3>invading other countries and so you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3749
02:38:52.290 --> 02:38:52.950
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3750
02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:53.783
<v Speaker 3>immigration policies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially now where we have border </v>

3751
02:38:56.100 --> 02:38:59.220
<v Speaker 3>patrols and this idea that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have your paperwork and you have to have</v>

3752
02:38:59.580 --> 02:39:00.413
<v Speaker 3>passports and numbers and otherwise you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were born in the wrong patch of </v>

3753
02:39:02.971 --> 02:39:03.720
<v Speaker 3>dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sir.</v>

3754
02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:07.350
<v Speaker 3>If you were just born 30 miles north,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have been in Texas,</v>

3755
02:39:07.351 --> 02:39:08.970
<v Speaker 3>but you're in Juarez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fuck,</v>

3756
02:39:08.971 --> 02:39:10.860
<v Speaker 3>so you stay over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3757
02:39:10.890 --> 02:39:11.570
<v Speaker 3>it's silly.</v>

3758
02:39:11.570 --> 02:39:12.403
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of social constructions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>social constructions that have changed </v>

3759
02:39:15.261 --> 02:39:16.600
<v Speaker 1>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3760
02:39:16.601 --> 02:39:20.210
<v Speaker 1>It's damn telling a Mexican they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>come here.</v>

3761
02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Are you crazy like this was Mexico five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes ago.</v>

3762
02:39:23.241 --> 02:39:24.074
<v Speaker 1>You assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck are you finishing the </v>

3763
02:39:26.241 --> 02:39:29.870
<v Speaker 1>arrogance of Americans who think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans have no place here?</v>

3764
02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there weren't no white people here long.</v>

3765
02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it not only that,</v>

3766
02:39:33.381 --> 02:39:34.214
<v Speaker 3>I mean you just got lucky you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were born into this like </v>

3767
02:39:36.681 --> 02:39:41.540
<v Speaker 3>economically prov promising area where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3768
02:39:41.541 --> 02:39:43.230
<v Speaker 3>you gotta better opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3769
02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:46.370
<v Speaker 3>And you're looking at these people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are born in a shit spot and you're like,</v>

3770
02:39:46.371 --> 02:39:47.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in that shit spot forever.</v>

3771
02:39:48.260 --> 02:39:50.210
<v Speaker 3>You can't come over here and take my </v>
<v Speaker 3>good spot.</v>

3772
02:39:50.270 --> 02:39:51.103
<v Speaker 1>It also works against us because then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes harder for us to travel </v>

3773
02:39:54.321 --> 02:39:56.330
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere because then they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>borders.</v>

3774
02:39:56.570 --> 02:39:58.580
<v Speaker 1>They don't like Americans because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do to them.</v>

3778
02:40:07.730 --> 02:40:08.720
<v Speaker 1>kind.</v>

<v Speaker 1>when you're down there and like,</v>

3780
02:40:09.981 --> 02:40:11.420
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the border integration and that drug </v>

3782
02:40:15.361 --> 02:40:16.620
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3783
02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:21.900
<v Speaker 1>the deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poverty that we've inflicted on them</v>

<v Speaker 1>our guts and they don't.</v>

3786
02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:28.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

02:40:34.900 --> 02:40:38.070
<v Speaker 1>credible place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to go out of my favorite places to</v>

3793
02:40:38.071 --> 02:40:40.560
<v Speaker 1>go on vacation for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know a lot of people.</v>

3794
02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of friends here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're scared.</v>

3795
02:40:42.450 --> 02:40:43.283
<v Speaker 1>They're scared of Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Mexico is all gang violence and </v>

3796
02:40:45.361 --> 02:40:46.194
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3797
02:40:46.290 --> 02:40:48.090
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read about Chicago.</v>

3798
02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:52.260
<v Speaker 1>You're not scared to go to Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago was fucking murders every day.</v>

3799
02:40:52.410 --> 02:40:55.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to trump Chicago,</v>

3800
02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:56.573
<v Speaker 1>Mexico violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he was saying about these </v>

3801
02:40:59.090 --> 02:41:01.500
<v Speaker 1>illegal immigrants being violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals and stuff.</v>

3802
02:41:01.650 --> 02:41:03.750
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't wrong entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

3803
02:41:03.810 --> 02:41:04.643
<v Speaker 1>here's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what people are ignoring that </v>

3804
02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:10.080
<v Speaker 1>it's true that the cartels have moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the Midwest.</v>

3805
02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:12.450
<v Speaker 1>You know about this in particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

3806
02:41:12.580 --> 02:41:13.413
<v Speaker 1>that Chapo and others too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have moved into the Midwest there </v>

3807
02:41:15.781 --> 02:41:16.614
<v Speaker 1>in Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do a google search for like Mexican </v>

3808
02:41:19.021 --> 02:41:22.290
<v Speaker 1>cartel and pick like a town in Kentucky </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ohio,</v>

3809
02:41:22.291 --> 02:41:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Indiana.</v>

3810
02:41:22.770 --> 02:41:24.960
<v Speaker 1>They're all over the midwest and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>competing.</v>

3811
02:41:24.961 --> 02:41:25.794
<v Speaker 1>They're kicking out the old gangs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why there's all this violence on </v>

3812
02:41:28.801 --> 02:41:31.290
<v Speaker 1>the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those black kids in Chicago who</v>

3813
02:41:31.291 --> 02:41:35.370
<v Speaker 1>are shooting each other are working for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those cartels basically,</v>

3814
02:41:35.730 --> 02:41:36.563
<v Speaker 1>so trump was right about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's totally wrong about the answer </v>

3815
02:41:38.701 --> 02:41:41.460
<v Speaker 1>to it and what liberals do in response </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it is even worse,</v>

3816
02:41:41.461 --> 02:41:43.530
<v Speaker 1>which is pretend it's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3817
02:41:43.531 --> 02:41:44.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are killing each other,</v>

3818
02:41:44.910 --> 02:41:46.170
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3819
02:41:46.350 --> 02:41:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Because drugs are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3820
02:41:48.750 --> 02:41:51.480
<v Speaker 1>because drugs are illegal and we want </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to be illegal.</v>

3821
02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:53.460
<v Speaker 1>We vote for those laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3822
02:41:53.461 --> 02:41:54.294
<v Speaker 1>I met a guy in Chicago who was a cop and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he explained it to me in great detail </v>

3823
02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:02.970
<v Speaker 1>and he said essentially what happened is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they moved in and they arrested a lot of</v>

3824
02:42:02.971 --> 02:42:03.804
<v Speaker 1>these drug lords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these local people that were in charge </v>

3825
02:42:06.721 --> 02:42:10.530
<v Speaker 1>of whatever areas and they were running </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever criminal organization.</v>

3826
02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:13.920
<v Speaker 1>They arrest them and they created a </v>
<v Speaker 1>power vacuum and the way he was saying,</v>

3827
02:42:13.921 --> 02:42:14.754
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than when we remove a </v>

3828
02:42:15.511 --> 02:42:16.344
<v Speaker 1>dictator in some foreign country that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people move in and then it creates </v>

3829
02:42:19.171 --> 02:42:20.310
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get isis.</v>

3830
02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3831
02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:22.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3832
02:42:22.531 --> 02:42:24.060
<v Speaker 1>but you don't hear people talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3833
02:42:24.090 --> 02:42:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

3834
02:42:25.081 --> 02:42:26.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3835
02:42:26.101 --> 02:42:27.450
<v Speaker 1>The cartels are here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3836
02:42:27.451 --> 02:42:28.284
<v Speaker 1>Trump has drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really trump is too god damn dumb to </v>

3837
02:42:30.181 --> 02:42:31.014
<v Speaker 1>make the full point and he's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>beholden to these asshole republicans </v>

3838
02:42:34.261 --> 02:42:37.050
<v Speaker 1>like jeff sessions who thinks that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that marijuana is dangerous.</v>

3839
02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:40.020
<v Speaker 1>He wants to bring back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's not saying he's not.</v>

3840
02:42:40.021 --> 02:42:40.854
<v Speaker 1>He has no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least he's not saying what the </v>

3841
02:42:42.031 --> 02:42:43.620
<v Speaker 1>actual causes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3842
02:42:43.770 --> 02:42:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And Liberals are sort of a betting him </v>
<v Speaker 1>by ignoring it,</v>

3843
02:42:46.741 --> 02:42:47.131
<v Speaker 1>but saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

3844
02:42:47.131 --> 02:42:50.100
<v Speaker 1>there is no violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no fuckers.</v>

3845
02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:54.480
<v Speaker 1>There is tremendous violence and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause is your laws against drugs.</v>

3846
02:42:54.860 --> 02:42:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the answer is really simple.</v>

3847
02:42:58.370 --> 02:42:59.600
<v Speaker 1>It's in glass trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3848
02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:00.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3849
02:43:00.541 --> 02:43:01.374
<v Speaker 1>but because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because our government is just a fight </v>

3850
02:43:03.301 --> 02:43:07.560
<v Speaker 1>between this moron trump and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>morons,</v>

3851
02:43:07.561 --> 02:43:10.260
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats who refused to address </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>

3852
02:43:10.830 --> 02:43:13.600
<v Speaker 1>there's no discussion about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do legalized drugs,</v>

3853
02:43:13.601 --> 02:43:14.434
<v Speaker 1>like how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if the United States just </v>

3854
02:43:16.601 --> 02:43:17.434
<v Speaker 1>decided we're going to decriminalize all</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and now that's not good enough </v>

3855
02:43:20.711 --> 02:43:22.390
<v Speaker 1>because someone's going to sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3856
02:43:22.391 --> 02:43:23.224
<v Speaker 1>You can't just decriminalize them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that just keeps people from getting </v>

3857
02:43:25.481 --> 02:43:27.370
<v Speaker 1>arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great step.</v>

3858
02:43:27.550 --> 02:43:29.620
<v Speaker 1>A good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good move in the right direction.</v>

3859
02:43:29.890 --> 02:43:34.450
<v Speaker 1>There's some insane number of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America that are in prison right now for</v>

3860
02:43:34.451 --> 02:43:36.150
<v Speaker 1>nonviolent drug offenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3861
02:43:36.370 --> 02:43:38.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nutty number.</v>

3862
02:43:38.290 --> 02:43:40.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a side note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a really important one.</v>

3863
02:43:40.930 --> 02:43:43.840
<v Speaker 1>There is now a debate among academics </v>
<v Speaker 1>who study this stuff,</v>

3864
02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:45.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of academics who are actually </v>

3865
02:43:46.301 --> 02:43:49.490
<v Speaker 1>more or less on the right side of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>are arguing that the drug war and,</v>

3866
02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:50.853
<v Speaker 1>and making drugs illegal is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>major cause of mass incarceration </v>

3867
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:57.040
<v Speaker 1>because the number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of people it is big,</v>

3868
02:43:57.041 --> 02:43:59.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's something like 10 percent who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are nonviolent drug offenders who were,</v>

3869
02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:03.970
<v Speaker 1>who were prosecuted and convicted of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just drug offenses.</v>

3870
02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:07.570
<v Speaker 1>That is a relatively small number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they're not taking into account</v>

3871
02:44:07.690 --> 02:44:12.690
<v Speaker 1>is all of the other crimes that stem </v>
<v Speaker 1>from drugs being illegal.</v>

3872
02:44:14.261 --> 02:44:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the murders,</v>

3873
02:44:15.721 --> 02:44:17.050
<v Speaker 1>all the assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the violent take,</v>

3874
02:44:17.051 --> 02:44:18.670
<v Speaker 1>all the homicides in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3875
02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:19.893
<v Speaker 1>I want to see a number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure it's really high of how </v>

3876
02:44:22.061 --> 02:44:24.940
<v Speaker 1>many were committed by a gang member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3877
02:44:25.150 --> 02:44:25.983
<v Speaker 1>And how many of the gangs in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States basically started by selling </v>

3878
02:44:28.691 --> 02:44:29.460
<v Speaker 1>drugs?</v>

3879
02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:30.293
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3880
02:44:30.370 --> 02:44:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that homicides,</v>

3881
02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:34.330
<v Speaker 1>assault gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

3882
02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:35.433
<v Speaker 1>there is larceny theft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who are hooked on drugs who are </v>

3883
02:44:38.471 --> 02:44:42.490
<v Speaker 1>broke in large part because drug prices </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so high.</v>

3884
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Why are they so high?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're illegal.</v>

3885
02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:46.503
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3886
02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:49.120
<v Speaker 1>They have to get them on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The black market always raises prices,</v>

3887
02:44:49.270 --> 02:44:51.460
<v Speaker 1>so they're forced to steal because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're poor people.</v>

3888
02:44:51.730 --> 02:44:52.563
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a huge percentage and they don't </v>

3889
02:44:54.191 --> 02:44:58.240
<v Speaker 1>track this because the convictions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3890
02:44:58.241 --> 02:44:59.074
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a junkie who steals from </v>

3891
02:45:01.091 --> 02:45:05.830
<v Speaker 1>somebody to score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't count that as a drug crime.</v>

3892
02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:08.110
<v Speaker 1>They counted as just Larson a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't know,</v>

3893
02:45:08.111 --> 02:45:08.944
<v Speaker 1>but I am sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what social scientists need </v>

3894
02:45:10.301 --> 02:45:11.134
<v Speaker 1>to do right now is start to make that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that work and find out exactly how </v>

3895
02:45:14.051 --> 02:45:14.884
<v Speaker 1>many people are in prison for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason related to the fact that drugs </v>

3896
02:45:18.761 --> 02:45:21.220
<v Speaker 1>are illegal and a Betcha it's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

3897
02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're right.</v>

3898
02:45:22.540 --> 02:45:26.050
<v Speaker 1>It's also like these gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't sell drugs,</v>

3899
02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:26.913
<v Speaker 1>they have no other method of income </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're just knocking over </v>

3900
02:45:29.981 --> 02:45:32.260
<v Speaker 1>trucks filled with equipment and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>reselling it.</v>

3901
02:45:32.261 --> 02:45:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Like where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>

3902
02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:34.390
<v Speaker 1>They have no income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no power.</v>

3903
02:45:34.420 --> 02:45:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3904
02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:36.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean the mafia in the 19 twenties </v>

3905
02:45:38.471 --> 02:45:41.200
<v Speaker 1>was enormously powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hugely powerful.</v>

3906
02:45:41.201 --> 02:45:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the prohibition.</v>

3907
02:45:42.941 --> 02:45:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's you take away.</v>

3908
02:45:44.831 --> 02:45:46.180
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said this to people like,</v>

3909
02:45:46.390 --> 02:45:47.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>

3910
02:45:47.561 --> 02:45:50.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great netflix series was about him,</v>

3911
02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:52.170
<v Speaker 1>the huge drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No champion.</v>

3912
02:45:53.490 --> 02:45:54.323
<v Speaker 1>Narcos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3913
02:45:54.410 --> 02:45:57.970
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was named Paul Escobar Escobar Escobar.</v>

3914
02:45:57.971 --> 02:46:01.270
<v Speaker 1>So take make drugs you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If drugs were legal,</v>

3915
02:46:02.110 --> 02:46:05.950
<v Speaker 1>how many people did Escobar kill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>None or two or one or something,</v>

3916
02:46:05.951 --> 02:46:07.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he killed thousands of people.</v>

3917
02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're legal,</v>

3918
02:46:09.650 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>here's the</v>

3919
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:13.070
<v Speaker 2>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who's profiting off of those?</v>

3920
02:46:13.071 --> 02:46:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets really slippery.</v>

3921
02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:18.560
<v Speaker 2>If you make drugs legal and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to be,</v>

3922
02:46:18.561 --> 02:46:19.394
<v Speaker 2>like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that are selling them are </v>

3923
02:46:20.961 --> 02:46:21.830
<v Speaker 2>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3924
02:46:21.970 --> 02:46:23.240
<v Speaker 2>If they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make it illegal,</v>

3925
02:46:23.241 --> 02:46:24.074
<v Speaker 2>they're going to still sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're just going to sell them </v>

3926
02:46:25.641 --> 02:46:26.660
<v Speaker 2>legally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3927
02:46:26.700 --> 02:46:27.533
<v Speaker 2>like how do you make this transition </v>
<v Speaker 2>between drugs being legal and then </v>

3928
02:46:32.151 --> 02:46:34.850
<v Speaker 2>people being able to sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that work?</v>

3929
02:46:35.090 --> 02:46:35.923
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that in an orderly way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you preserve sanity and humanity </v>

3930
02:46:39.471 --> 02:46:40.940
<v Speaker 2>and civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

3931
02:46:40.980 --> 02:46:41.751
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>33.</v>

3932
02:46:41.751 --> 02:46:42.990
<v Speaker 2>They ended prohibition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3933
02:46:42.991 --> 02:46:45.560
<v Speaker 2>But alcohol was something that did </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

3934
02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:47.990
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They regulated it heavily.</v>

3935
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:50.930
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>which made which created new problems,</v>

3936
02:46:51.460 --> 02:46:54.860
<v Speaker 2>it caused the state to be all up in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>business and all sorts of ways,</v>

3937
02:46:54.861 --> 02:46:59.030
<v Speaker 2>so like you had to get licensed to sell </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol,</v>

3938
02:46:59.040 --> 02:46:59.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3939
02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:00.313
<v Speaker 2>Which is what that meant was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspector from the state came to your </v>

3940
02:47:03.141 --> 02:47:03.974
<v Speaker 2>bar or restaurant or whatever and looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and asked you questions and </v>

3941
02:47:07.071 --> 02:47:09.020
<v Speaker 2>checked on who we're hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who worked there,</v>

3942
02:47:09.050 --> 02:47:11.240
<v Speaker 2>who your customers were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kinds of customers,</v>

3943
02:47:11.660 --> 02:47:16.430
<v Speaker 2>and if you didn't fit all the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 2>polite society or in.</v>

3944
02:47:16.431 --> 02:47:17.264
<v Speaker 2>This was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great histories have been done about </v>

3945
02:47:18.741 --> 02:47:19.574
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had the homosexuals coming into </v>

3946
02:47:22.041 --> 02:47:23.020
<v Speaker 2>your bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3947
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.863
<v Speaker 2>drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homos.</v>

3948
02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:27.470
<v Speaker 2>You don't want that for the prostitutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the prostitutes coming into your bar,</v>

3949
02:47:27.860 --> 02:47:30.320
<v Speaker 2>or even women who were a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>loose with their morality.</v>

3950
02:47:30.321 --> 02:47:31.880
<v Speaker 2>You didn't get a license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3951
02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:32.773
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women could stop you from getting a bar </v>

3952
02:47:34.191 --> 02:47:35.180
<v Speaker 2>license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3953
02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:36.433
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what kind of world we live </v>

3954
02:47:37.941 --> 02:47:40.850
<v Speaker 2>in telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just decriminalize.</v>

3955
02:47:40.970 --> 02:47:41.803
<v Speaker 2>We will be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you just decriminalized who's </v>

3956
02:47:43.311 --> 02:47:44.450
<v Speaker 2>selling it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3957
02:47:44.451 --> 02:47:46.160
<v Speaker 2>it's still going to be illegal to sell.</v>

3958
02:47:46.190 --> 02:47:47.001
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3959
02:47:47.001 --> 02:47:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Decriminalization doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>legalization in terms of profitability,</v>

3960
02:47:51.550 --> 02:47:52.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

3961
02:47:52.521 --> 02:47:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that all drugs essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>or decriminalized in Mexico,</v>

3962
02:47:55.581 --> 02:47:57.800
<v Speaker 2>including mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acid.</v>

3963
02:47:58.100 --> 02:48:01.430
<v Speaker 2>These are those definitions changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the industry,</v>

3964
02:48:01.431 --> 02:48:02.264
<v Speaker 2>which is a pain in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so sometimes decrim means just no </v>

3965
02:48:04.881 --> 02:48:06.140
<v Speaker 2>laws at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3966
02:48:06.250 --> 02:48:10.010
<v Speaker 2>none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Legalization usually means not always,</v>

3967
02:48:10.011 --> 02:48:12.780
<v Speaker 2>but usually means regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened with.</v>

3968
02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like with weed,</v>

3969
02:48:14.990 --> 02:48:15.823
<v Speaker 2>we've got legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got legalized and it's heavily </v>

3970
02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:18.854
<v Speaker 2>regulated and Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also was not that heavily were </v>

3971
02:48:20.930 --> 02:48:23.120
<v Speaker 2>regulated in Colorado it's pretty easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get.</v>

3972
02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was while the regulation </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in the banking,</v>

3973
02:48:26.270 --> 02:48:27.103
<v Speaker 2>the banking is weird because the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government still has it classified as a </v>

3974
02:48:29.871 --> 02:48:33.030
<v Speaker 2>schedule one substance and it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a huge issue isn't it?</v>

3975
02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:34.003
<v Speaker 2>For people having an accept cash only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they hired a bunch of seals and </v>

3976
02:48:36.971 --> 02:48:38.630
<v Speaker 2>burkes and all these fucking guys from </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3977
02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:41.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have probably worked for like</v>

3978
02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:43.033
<v Speaker 2>a mercenary organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're fucking Karen round drug </v>

3979
02:48:45.831 --> 02:48:49.280
<v Speaker 2>money from people selling pot and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to take it to the bank and put</v>

3980
02:48:49.281 --> 02:48:50.114
<v Speaker 2>it in safe deposit boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And deposited into these accounts in </v>

3981
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:55.070
<v Speaker 2>weird ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very fucking.</v>

3982
02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:56.033
<v Speaker 2>It's really problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that keeps a lot of people out of </v>

3983
02:48:58.371 --> 02:49:00.610
<v Speaker 2>the market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of participating in this.</v>

3984
02:49:00.670 --> 02:49:02.530
<v Speaker 2>It hire soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3985
02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:04.850
<v Speaker 2>stuff that peaceful unemployment </v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

3986
02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:06.470
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need more,</v>

3987
02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:07.920
<v Speaker 2>more hired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3988
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:11.650
<v Speaker 1>isn't it true that they give them jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want them not having jobs.</v>

3989
02:49:11.651 --> 02:49:12.484
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you teach people how to kill </v>

3990
02:49:13.501 --> 02:49:14.700
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be nice to them.</v>

3991
02:49:14.701 --> 02:49:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I certainly would rather them do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then killing Iraqis,</v>

3992
02:49:18.610 --> 02:49:19.443
<v Speaker 1>they also disallowed people with prior </v>
<v Speaker 1>felonies from participating in the </v>

3993
02:49:24.271 --> 02:49:25.080
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

3994
02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:28.230
<v Speaker 1>In Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've seen this and that meant it's</v>

3995
02:49:28.410 --> 02:49:29.900
<v Speaker 1>all white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know that.</v>

3996
02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:31.020
<v Speaker 1>All the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the.</v>

3997
02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a lot of black producers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celanese racist bastard.</v>

3998
02:49:34.470 --> 02:49:36.170
<v Speaker 1>How dare you got assigned to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>

3999
02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:38.340
<v Speaker 1>that was a complete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Huffington post item,</v>

4000
02:49:38.341 --> 02:49:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I just know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4001
02:49:40.250 --> 02:49:41.940
<v Speaker 1>And you call it racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4002
02:49:41.941 --> 02:49:44.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a system or a salon.</v>

4003
02:49:44.670 --> 02:49:47.250
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a salon.com.</v>
