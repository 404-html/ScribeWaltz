1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>does he didn't elaborate any further than that?</v>

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

4
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 1>I think he just leaves it that,</v>

5
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>but still man,</v>

6
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Sean connery gets away with that because he's handsome and he's got that cool</v>

7
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>accent.</v>

8
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.790
<v Speaker 1>But imagine somebody else saying that law.</v>

9
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.301
<v Speaker 1>It's just bad.</v>

11
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean ultimately Sean connery is just hitting women from an old school era,</v>

12
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of funny to hear them.</v>

13
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.871
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

15
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Because of like jude law,</v>

16
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>don't know why I'm saying jude law again,</v>

17
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but he has a proper accent.</v>

18
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Is a handsome guy.</v>

19
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>If he wound up saying that in an interview,</v>

20
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>it would ruin his career.</v>

21
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>absolutely ruined his career.</v>

23
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Like who's a famous movie star today?</v>

24
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Who's like a good example like Ryan Reynolds,</v>

25
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I guess at the handsome guy.</v>

26
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that it's one of those.</v>

27
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.213
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Ryan's.</v>

28
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if Ryan seacrest said that it would know he's gay.</v>

29
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>People would know that.</v>

30
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

31
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.973
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing,</v>

32
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.533
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.723
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

34
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.993
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

35
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.791
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

36
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:57.511
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's gay.</v>

37
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a workaholic.</v>

38
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Probably doesn't have time for sex.</v>

39
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.201
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

41
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Reynolds,</v>

42
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>this handsome bastard.</v>

43
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.523
<v Speaker 1>If he said that,</v>

44
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>if Ryan Reynolds said that sometimes you need to smack a mount holy shit with</v>

45
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>the backlash,</v>

46
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>be extraordinary.</v>

47
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Salon Dot Com would dedicate months and months of of front page articles.</v>

48
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>but what about all the sites defending him?</v>

50
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

51
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

52
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

53
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

54
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

55
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a few of those bugs in men's rights.</v>

56
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Sean Connery Fan clubs.</v>

57
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Few of those embarrassing men's rights sites were the right things like,</v>

58
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:28.261
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

59
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:28.840
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

60
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Why is you went too far?</v>

61
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:30.511
<v Speaker 1>You fucks.</v>

62
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>You ruined the whole argument.</v>

63
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>The whole argument is divorced laws.</v>

64
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:34.921
<v Speaker 1>The whole argument,</v>

65
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>the whole argument is how many guys get fucked over financials?</v>

66
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>So weird salon.com started attacking patent Oswald.</v>

67
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

68
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not salon.com.</v>

69
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

70
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a writer.</v>

71
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>A writer decided that they were going to pick a hot button topic that didn't</v>

72
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>necessarily jive or make sense,</v>

73
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>but they felt like because Patton Oswald was making fun of someone else's racism</v>

74
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>by showing like essentially very similar to a Co.</v>

75
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Barriers get in trouble for it except patton.</v>

76
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:06.831
<v Speaker 1>Oswald is a fucking like oBvious comedian and obviously known as a pretty</v>

77
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>sensitive aware guy,</v>

78
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that he would say something racist just for the joke,</v>

79
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.503
<v Speaker 1>like he was,</v>

80
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>they knew what he was doing and they decided to go for it anyway,</v>

81
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's when he attacked them,</v>

82
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>lit up and he should have,</v>

83
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>he should have their gross.</v>

84
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about their,</v>

85
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>their articles too.</v>

87
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>If you go to salon.com,</v>

88
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the things is almost every article starts with a question,</v>

89
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

91
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>is this the time to reconsider the argument of who's funnier men or women?</v>

93
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Question mark is this,</v>

94
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.203
<v Speaker 1>this is this.</v>

96
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with the right question mark,</v>

97
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:44.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

99
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

100
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.243
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

101
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>They're like opinion pieces that represent this article.</v>

102
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.221
<v Speaker 1>It just is like,</v>

103
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:50.371
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

104
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>it's amazingly this guess,</v>

105
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>guess what chicken butt does.</v>

106
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Anti vegan shaming beginning in preschool.</v>

107
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Is that they're a salon articles?</v>

108
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.251
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

110
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Show patriarchal hedge among in sketch show titles.</v>

111
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the man from nantucket anti transgender subtext and classic lillard's.</v>

112
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So true.</v>

113
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>It's so true.</v>

114
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.243
<v Speaker 1>Knock knock joke.</v>

115
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Not inclusive to the homeless salon articles.</v>

116
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>You dummies.</v>

117
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>You fucked with the wrong guy.</v>

118
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

119
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:23.891
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>

120
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:24.724
<v Speaker 1>Who lit them up?</v>

121
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.751
<v Speaker 1>She's right,</v>

122
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

123
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get angry sometimes.</v>

124
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Like the other day they were comparing tina fey to um,</v>

126
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>it's the age old argument.</v>

127
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:37.061
<v Speaker 1>Who's funnier?</v>

128
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:37.894
<v Speaker 1>Men or women?</v>

138
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:51.964
<v Speaker 1>She's funny.</v>

141
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>She's funny on shows.</v>

142
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>She's funny and in movies,</v>

143
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>but she's not louis ck.</v>

144
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Lucy get writes his own shit.</v>

145
00:03:58.421 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Performed his own shit.</v>

146
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>It's all his opinions on the world to save that,</v>

147
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>that there's some sort of a debate who's funnier.</v>

148
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Her him is completely distorting what the art form is in the first place.</v>

149
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>It's completely distorting it.</v>

150
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Like you're just looking for a fucking salacious article title.</v>

151
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>That's all you're doing.</v>

152
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I used to think,</v>

153
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

154
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were like,</v>

155
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>it seems like they were much more respected and now they've gone down this</v>

156
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>spiral where everyone's just rolling their eyes at it.</v>

157
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 1>They'll run out of shit to talk about.</v>

158
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

159
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just ridiculous.</v>

161
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>It gets to a certain.</v>

162
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>It gets a certain time when you're covering the same stories over and over and</v>

163
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over and over.</v>

181
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous character that says dumb shit.</v>

182
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Tongue in cheek every fucking step of the way it was it offensive to asian</v>

189
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.031
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull it up,</v>

190
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 1>but people are asking like hash tagging.</v>

191
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Hashtagging canceled co bear because of a fucking joke.</v>

192
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.521
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>here's the in.</v>

196
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>He's apparently responded to it,</v>

197
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>but let's find out what,</v>

00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:31.331
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

202
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>but they're all gross.</v>

203
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many people wondering how big,</v>

204
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 1>if it's an actual big,</v>

205
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.800
<v Speaker 1>now it's pretty mint is it?</v>

206
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>You can scan through it and it's not just canceled.</v>

207
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:40.271
<v Speaker 1>Cole bear,</v>

208
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:40.650
<v Speaker 1>there's like.</v>

209
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.471
<v Speaker 1>It's just like that.</v>

210
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like a place where all the outrage people have gone to express they're</v>

211
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>outrageous.</v>

212
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>They're pissed about anything,</v>

213
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>and they'll just hashtag page right now.</v>

214
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

215
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.651
<v Speaker 1>here's what they said.</v>

216
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:51.484
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

217
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>It all began thursday evening when the coal baer reports twitter account,</v>

218
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:55.571
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

219
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't even him.</v>

220
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even him that wrote that was someone that handles the kobe or account.</v>

221
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

222
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.471
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

223
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>StePhen colbert quoted a joke from a segment on wednesday's episode,</v>

224
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>so they quoted a joke from a segment.</v>

225
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>SO they took it out of context and that's where the outrage came.</v>

226
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Quoted a joke from a segment that aired that marked Washington redskins owner</v>

227
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 1>dan schneider for setting up a charity to aid native americans in lieu of</v>

228
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>changing the team's name,</v>

229
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.870
<v Speaker 1>the original bid,</v>

230
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 1>cole bear said he was inspired by schneider to start his own charity called the</v>

231
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>ching chong ding dong foundation for sensitivity to orientals or whatever.</v>

232
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.840
<v Speaker 1>That's in response to a guy who runs a team called the Washington redskins,</v>

233
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.270
<v Speaker 1>which is an anti native american slur making a charity for,</v>

234
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

235
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>for native americans,</v>

236
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 1>without changing the name.</v>

237
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>like here's the whole context to that joke.</v>

238
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

239
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>he's not saying that there should be a ching chong ding dong foundation.</v>

240
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.740
<v Speaker 1>He's mocking the racism of a guy whose team is called a racist name.</v>

241
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Donating without changing the name.</v>

242
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so obvious,</v>

243
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 1>but salon has had like seven fucking articles about it.</v>

244
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Some supportive,</v>

245
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>but some would say he needs to make it right.</v>

246
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just cannot put that string of words together in any context ever.</v>

247
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

248
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever he said,</v>

249
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that's exactly what they're saying.</v>

250
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:20.024
<v Speaker 1>You can't say change.</v>

251
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.841
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that.</v>

252
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the n word.</v>

253
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

254
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.103
<v Speaker 1>I mean to to,</v>

255
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

256
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.500
<v Speaker 1>to try to censor content content that much that you've taken things completely</v>

257
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:31.154
<v Speaker 1>out of context,</v>

258
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>completely out of the meaning and context is the reason why language exists in</v>

259
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>

260
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It's everything to be able to expand past really simple things like eat fuck</v>

261
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

262
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>you need context to to have a goddamn language and communicate each other.</v>

263
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>We have to recognize subtleties and when you pretend they don't exist,</v>

264
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.210
<v Speaker 1>that's when you get assholes sanctimonious fuckheads who get crazy about jokes</v>

265
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 1>that you can get people dedicated days and days of their life to something that</v>

266
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 1>fucking that tracy morgan says about stabbing his gay son.</v>

267
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy.</v>

268
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Everything is taken completely out of context and everything is something that</v>

269
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.250
<v Speaker 1>really warrants cancellation you.</v>

270
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>You'd be shamed.</v>

271
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>You need to be removed.</v>

272
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>This is over-sensitive fucking moron.</v>

273
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 2>It's weird how what you're expressing right now is you're offended.</v>

274
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.360
<v Speaker 2>They offend you.</v>

275
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 2>That's what's interesting is it's like they.</v>

276
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 2>What they are doing is so much more offensive in the thing they are offended by</v>

277
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 2>the way they're expressing themselves is so vile and disgusting that it makes</v>

278
00:08:39.421 --> 00:08:42.990
<v Speaker 2>whatever tracy morgan said or patent oswald said,</v>

279
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.250
<v Speaker 2>or cole bear say,</v>

280
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.910
<v Speaker 2>just seem like seem so tiny compared to what they are,</v>

281
00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:50.850
<v Speaker 2>which is they're like embryonic fascists.</v>

282
00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:53.670
<v Speaker 2>If you gave them power and they grew out of control,</v>

283
00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:54.240
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>

284
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 2>whoever's like running the show at salon,</v>

285
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.211
<v Speaker 1>matt,</v>

286
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 1>whoever's running the cancel,</v>

287
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:01.710
<v Speaker 1>cole bear in somehow they took power.</v>

288
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what kind of world would be living god if you they could decide what</v>

289
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 1>gets on these comedy shows.</v>

290
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Satire shows what you can and can't get away with.</v>

291
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 1>How many transgenders need to be represented?</v>

292
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>How many fucking gay people need to be represented?</v>

293
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 1>how many fucking straight white males need to be made fun of along with straight</v>

294
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>white females.</v>

295
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

296
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 1>is it going to be a a chart where everything's graft and made sure it's</v>

297
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>completely even across the board?</v>

298
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's not life,</v>

299
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:30.451
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

300
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll find something new to be pissed off about because that's really</v>

301
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 1>what they love is being pissed off about stuff.</v>

302
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.701
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

303
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 1>they'd where they'd realized that they lost their love,</v>

304
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:39.054
<v Speaker 1>which is the problem.</v>

305
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.250
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

306
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>it's when you say they,</v>

307
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>it's writers.</v>

308
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 1>It's writers that they're attracting.</v>

309
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily logical people.</v>

310
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily representative of the organization itself,</v>

311
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:54.820
<v Speaker 1>their individual writers who produce something and then somebody greenlights</v>

312
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>

313
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain point in time you're doing more harm than good because you're</v>

314
00:09:58.261 --> 00:09:59.270
<v Speaker 1>so easy to mock,</v>

315
00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>but if you're like super left wing when you get that far out on a fucking limb</v>

316
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and you want to cancel coca cola,</v>

317
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>bear about a really obvious joke like that.</v>

318
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.930
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking up everything cause you're.</v>

319
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>You're making yourself look unbelievably silly.</v>

320
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I know you feel right and I know that you have this righteous indignation</v>

321
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 1>behind what you're doing and you feel like the that people need to know.</v>

322
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.450
<v Speaker 1>You need to realize the harm that your word say.</v>

323
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 1>You need to realize that there's humor and humor.</v>

324
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.033
<v Speaker 1>People get hurt,</v>

325
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.331
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

326
00:10:29.331 --> 00:10:29.600
<v Speaker 1>hiding,</v>

327
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.040
<v Speaker 1>but you're a bigot.</v>

328
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Hiding behind the mask of a comedian,</v>

329
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.103
<v Speaker 1>people get hurt,</v>

330
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>people get hurt from jokes,</v>

331
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 1>and guess what?</v>

332
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>If you get hurt from jokes,</v>

333
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to get hurt from those jokes.</v>

334
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 1>If you can't make fun of something about yourself,</v>

335
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 1>that means that you haven't acknowledged that something about yourself that may</v>

336
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 1>or may not be hilarious,</v>

337
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.030
<v Speaker 1>and there's a big difference between someone saying something unbelievably cruel</v>

338
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:51.600
<v Speaker 1>and evil and someone's saying something where they're poking at you and laughing</v>

339
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.210
<v Speaker 1>and obviously he was doing that.</v>

340
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he was poking at the Washington redskins guy and laughing and to deny</v>

341
00:10:59.101 --> 00:10:59.934
<v Speaker 1>that it's just.</v>

342
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 1>It fucks up the whole argument.</v>

343
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.810
<v Speaker 1>It clouds the water was shitheads.</v>

344
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:04.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

345
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's strange to see salon.com in some way,</v>

346
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 1>like converging with nancy grace in some way,</v>

347
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:12.721
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

348
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

349
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Like they're meeting somehow.</v>

350
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Salon is like put itself in this tear.</v>

351
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>whoever the writers are.</v>

352
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Ours put themselves in that awful position where it's like,</v>

353
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.393
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

354
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm nancy.</v>

355
00:11:21.421 --> 00:11:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Grace and I were like singing the same song and it's not all that.</v>

356
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of great articles on there.</v>

357
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>I still go there because they have a lot of great articles.</v>

358
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just sometimes they just go out along.</v>

359
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need a good editor man,</v>

360
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>because you let a few riders fucking throw stuff out there and you do serious</v>

361
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 1>damage to your website or magazine.</v>

362
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Like you can really fuck your shit up where you could develop a reputation.</v>

363
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 1>You develop a bad reputation,</v>

364
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:47.490
<v Speaker 1>like a reputation for being ridiculous.</v>

365
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Oswald is attacking you for fun.</v>

366
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>if people are looking forward to it and it rings true,</v>

367
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem is true what he's saying.</v>

368
00:11:58.061 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

369
00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.740
<v Speaker 1>He read those titles.</v>

370
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.693
<v Speaker 1>They're all.</v>

371
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Those are great mock salon.com titles.</v>

372
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:04.294
<v Speaker 1>They're great.</v>

373
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

374
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.141
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

375
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 1>if you go to like I get an email from them every day and there's some great</v>

376
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>things like the thing with John Stewart mocking cnn for its continued coverage,</v>

377
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:12.844
<v Speaker 1>they've got that.</v>

378
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 1>They've got an interesting thing on chris christie,</v>

379
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>the governor to about are not all bad at all.</v>

380
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

381
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Not all bad at all,</v>

382
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 1>but a friend of mine hate advice for awhile.</v>

383
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.431
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

384
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 1>fuck that magazine because.</v>

385
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Because one article that he was offended by and they came up five years ago,</v>

386
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

387
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:31.361
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

388
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:35.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't blame the whole organization because one thing fucked up right.</v>
