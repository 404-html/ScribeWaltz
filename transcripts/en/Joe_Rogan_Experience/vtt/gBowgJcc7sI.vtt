1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.983
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 2>I found out about you,</v>

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 2>I guess there was so many,</v>

6
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:07.621
<v Speaker 2>just I,</v>

7
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 2>I get a lot of interesting stuff tweeted at me and uh,</v>

8
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I read one of your Breitbart pieces and I was like,</v>

9
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 2>check this motherfucker out.</v>

10
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 2>And then I found out that you're gay and you're,</v>

11
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 2>you're a part of this gamer gate,</v>

12
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 2>but you're in the game.</v>

13
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 2>You're on the,</v>

14
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 2>you were on the side of the people that were not the ultra progressive's like,</v>

15
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 2>and then you were in these debates against these radical feminism chicks and</v>

16
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 2>shutting them down.</v>

17
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 2>And I was very kind about me.</v>

18
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:36.961
<v Speaker 2>You've placed some video,</v>

19
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 2>look at this motherfucker.</v>

20
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 2>You're a unicorn.</v>

21
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't like people like you.</v>

22
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not supposed to exist into the progressive rules of the universe.</v>

23
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I should not be.</v>

24
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

25
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:46.471
<v Speaker 2>you should.</v>

26
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to be like fairly buttoned down and conservative and,</v>

27
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 2>and fare well also factually correct.</v>

28
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Like all the stuff that you would,</v>

29
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 2>the thing that I'd seen,</v>

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 2>you've gotten in his argument about why certain women and gravitate towards</v>

31
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 2>certain jobs and men gravitate towards jobs and this idea that,</v>

32
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of this is just cultural.</v>

33
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 2>A lot of this is something that we're pushing upon young men and young women.</v>

34
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.231
<v Speaker 2>And you were like,</v>

35
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 2>well this isn't the case at all,</v>

36
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's hilarious to watch someone confronted by.</v>

37
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Like they expect that to come from a me.</v>

38
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 2>They expected to come from some looking like I ought to be supporting the exam</v>

39
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 2>and on paper like paper,</v>

40
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:31.291
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>

41
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to,</v>

42
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm a metropolitan and the other circumstances I would be a liberal.</v>

43
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm a homosexual.</v>

44
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I listen.</v>

45
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd like pop culture,</v>

46
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

47
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>

48
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't really exist.</v>

49
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:44.490
<v Speaker 2>But I do unfortunately for that one 10th of your tweets are about how fabulous</v>

50
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 2>your Harris.</v>

51
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

52
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.051
<v Speaker 2>So Black Dick,</v>

53
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:46.884
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 2>any of those subjects,</v>

55
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:49.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 2>his hair or you know,</v>

57
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 2>the men that I'm into,</v>

58
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.161
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

59
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 2>very difficult for them to beat me for one simple reason,</v>

60
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 2>which is they've never been questioned.</v>

61
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 2>I've never been called in any of this stuff by anybody serious or anybody who's,</v>

62
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't conform to the progressive rules if identity politics.</v>

63
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 2>So when they come from me,</v>

64
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 2>they usual the usual response from a feminist to anybody bringing facts or,</v>

65
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

66
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 2>account as a serious counter argument is simply to dismiss them as a sexist or a</v>

67
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 2>bigot or misogynist.</v>

68
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 2>It's really tough to make the allegation against me.</v>

69
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 2>I love women.</v>

70
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 2>All my friends are women.</v>

71
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.783
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any,</v>

72
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a dog in the fight sexually speaking.</v>

73
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if,</v>

74
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.161
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

76
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to bang them whatever size they are,</v>

77
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:26.514
<v Speaker 2>however they behave.</v>

78
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 2>So they really don't,</v>

79
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 2>they don't have that over me as very,</v>

80
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to come up against a guy that you cannot make a convincing</v>

81
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

82
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.231
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:34.130
<v Speaker 2>of bigotry gains.</v>

84
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 2>So you have to argue on the facts.</v>

85
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 2>And of course the facts are on my side.</v>

86
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what the deal is.</v>

87
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:43.401
<v Speaker 2>They can't dismiss you instantaneously because of what you represent because</v>

88
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 2>what you represented,</v>

89
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

90
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 2>we got the dirt on him.</v>

91
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

92
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.331
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

93
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 2>he's gay and he's fabulous shit.</v>

94
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to do?</v>

95
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.903
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to say?</v>

96
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Well this is once you start,</v>

97
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 2>once you start to hit the right off,</v>

98
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 2>you note that you get calls from friends.</v>

99
00:02:58.891 --> 00:02:59.531
<v Speaker 2>You say said this,</v>

100
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 2>this person I emailed me trying to check you out.</v>

101
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 2>This happened to me about a year ago.</v>

102
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

103
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I sort of hit an a journalist for 10 years.</v>

104
00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:07.031
<v Speaker 2>It had some good staff,</v>

105
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.281
<v Speaker 2>broken,</v>

106
00:03:07.281 --> 00:03:07.931
<v Speaker 2>some big stories,</v>

107
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.501
<v Speaker 2>but I never really,</v>

108
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I never really kind of crossed over into entertainment into the mainstream and</v>

109
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 2>just started to happen about year ago and I start to get emails from friends and</v>

110
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 2>they were saying,</v>

111
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 2>so what's going on here?</v>

112
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.361
<v Speaker 2>Like people keep emailing me,</v>

113
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 2>asking me about you like trying to ask like in back in 2011 did he really do</v>

114
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:21.754
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

115
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 2>And what I've realized is when they,</v>

116
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 2>when they recognize you as a threat,</v>

117
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 2>when they identify you as somebody could do them damage,</v>

118
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.190
<v Speaker 2>they start going on maneuvers,</v>

119
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.210
<v Speaker 2>trying to find out everything about your,</v>

120
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 2>trying to find out what the worst stuff they have on you is so that he can</v>

121
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 2>dismiss you as a bigot or a sexist or a Neo Nazi or whatever.</v>

122
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 2>They can come up with anything they can grasp out because their strategy is to</v>

123
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 2>dismiss the,</v>

124
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 2>is to dismiss the speaker by attacking the speakers credibility.</v>

125
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Because that way they never have to even consider the merits of the argument.</v>

126
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 2>They haven't been able to do that with me.</v>

127
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

128
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 2>which is why feminists now refuse to bait me,</v>

129
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 2>debate me on TV because they know they'll lose.</v>

130
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.741
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

131
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 2>they can't bring out all,</v>

132
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.721
<v Speaker 2>they can't bring out,</v>

133
00:03:55.721 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 2>they've got this battery of dismissing just dismissal tactics that they've</v>

134
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>amassed over the last 30 years and they've got so complacent because they've</v>

135
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:04.061
<v Speaker 2>never had,</v>

136
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:04.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 2>a Sassy gay person and come up and say it.</v>

138
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 2>You're talking bullshit and you're hurting men and here are the facts.</v>

139
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.061
<v Speaker 2>They've never had it before,</v>

140
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>so they've never built up on arsenal to fight it,</v>

141
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:13.241
<v Speaker 2>so this is,</v>

143
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 2>this is why I went and why I'll cook.</v>

144
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep winning because they don't really know how to deal with an argument on</v>

145
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 2>its own merits.</v>

146
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.131
<v Speaker 2>And in any case,</v>

147
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 2>of course the facts are on our side.</v>

148
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

149
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 2>it's also this conversation that we're having right now is about war.</v>

150
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 2>You're saying winning and losing and they're taking tactics and strategies to</v>

151
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 2>look up dirt on the opposition.</v>

152
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 2>They're going,</v>

153
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.361
<v Speaker 2>they're treating.</v>

154
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:34.961
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

155
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:35.240
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

156
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>this is an ideological war is not a debate about the facts of the issue.</v>

157
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's of it because the left has always seen this as a war.</v>

158
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.700
<v Speaker 2>And the gender warriors,</v>

159
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:45.170
<v Speaker 2>have always been warriors.</v>

161
00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:46.910
<v Speaker 2>They've always seen this in strategic terms.</v>

162
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure people,</v>

163
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.250
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and naturally more self effacing conservatives tend to be a little</v>

164
00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:52.671
<v Speaker 2>bit cool,</v>

165
00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:54.540
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more chill about things they kind of don't really want.</v>

166
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Do you really big draw it though?</v>

167
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 2>How do you explain [inaudible]?</v>

168
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I think they get very angry about things.</v>

169
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Explain Ted Cruz,</v>

170
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.651
<v Speaker 2>what am I saying?</v>

171
00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Old Conservatives,</v>

172
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.263
<v Speaker 2>but he explained,</v>

173
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>what's her name,</v>

174
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.980
<v Speaker 2>the Pailin chick.</v>

175
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Palin.</v>

176
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.421
<v Speaker 2>How to explain that.</v>

177
00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:05.780
<v Speaker 2>These are the,</v>

178
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.820
<v Speaker 2>these are the outline is that Mike Huckabee,</v>

179
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 2>even most conservatives find these people a bit much.</v>

180
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.670
<v Speaker 2>How could be,</v>

181
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I think that guy's in isn't the end.</v>

182
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how much fatter now he was holding,</v>

183
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.073
<v Speaker 2>he ran last time.</v>

184
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

185
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

186
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:17.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 2>for like the lazy got that push TV gigs.</v>

188
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:24.020
<v Speaker 2>So fat he got so far I cannot vote for anyone that phenomena rock and rolling.</v>

189
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.520
<v Speaker 2>I want my Rubio just because he's hot.</v>

190
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

191
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.530
<v Speaker 2>if we call out Trump that I won't regret it.</v>

192
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that,</v>

193
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I think people are silly.</v>

194
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.280
<v Speaker 2>So whether or not it's a conservative thing or a liberal thing,</v>

195
00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a vast majority of people that aren't not very good at looking</v>

196
00:05:38.301 --> 00:05:41.660
<v Speaker 2>at themselves and they're not very good at looking at the momentum of their</v>

197
00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:42.141
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>

198
00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.570
<v Speaker 2>They just think that they're right because this is what they've,</v>

199
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.370
<v Speaker 2>they've been saying for so long.</v>

200
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.790
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's one of the most horrific things about these conversations</v>

201
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:50.391
<v Speaker 2>with these women.</v>

202
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Get in with you about cause like when,</v>

203
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 2>when they're talking about what they think are social constructs,</v>

204
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 2>like gender identities and the way people be.</v>

205
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 2>And when you shatter that with the facts,</v>

206
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for some other weapons and there's nothing there and you see it</v>

207
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:08.211
<v Speaker 2>in their eyes,</v>

208
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:08.431
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

209
00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

210
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's not really a debate about the idea itself.</v>

211
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just not what,</v>

212
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:12.921
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

213
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 2>What it's about is gender warfare.</v>

214
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 2>That's why people like Christina Hoff summers called them gender warriors</v>

215
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 2>because these aren't people who want any kind of social justice as they say.</v>

216
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 2>These are people who just hate men.</v>

217
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Well they hate men.</v>

218
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 2>They want to hurt man.</v>

219
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 2>They don't want equality for women.</v>

220
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 2>They want to,</v>

221
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 2>they want superiority for women.</v>

222
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's architected into the education system or you know,</v>

223
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 2>affirmative action or whatever it is.</v>

224
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to quality.</v>

225
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 2>They want superiority.</v>

226
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 2>And fundamentally,</v>

227
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this,</v>

228
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

229
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

230
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.320
<v Speaker 2>these crazy extremist,</v>

231
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

232
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

233
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 2>progressive third wave feminists,</v>

234
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 2>today's version of feminism.</v>

235
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 2>It basically boils down to [inaudible] and it takes a gay guy because it's so</v>

236
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 2>dangerous for men to even broached this subject anymore.</v>

237
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 2>And any man with a mainstream job puts that at risk by even talking on the</v>

238
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 2>subject no matter what his opinion is.</v>

239
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

240
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 2>it takes a gay guy to go on,</v>

241
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:54.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

242
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Sky News in the UK and say,</v>

243
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:55.941
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

244
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 2>the facts are not on your side and what you're doing is damaging to women.</v>

245
00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

246
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.080
<v Speaker 2>it's to me really an indictment on a,</v>

247
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 2>on debate in our public square that it is so dangerous for a man to even express</v>

248
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:08.310
<v Speaker 2>an opinion on this subject that it takes a fag to go and stick up for,</v>

249
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 2>for heterosexuals.</v>

250
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 2>If other men could say this,</v>

251
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:15.591
<v Speaker 2>they would be,</v>

252
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 2>but they can't because they would risk their careers.</v>

253
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Feminists always talking about silencing.</v>

254
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

255
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.171
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

256
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I see science to men that that is true.</v>

257
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of doxing and going after people and a lot of,</v>

258
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 2>a lot of anger when it comes to all this stuff.</v>

259
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 2>But I think what you have in many cases when you see this kind of like</v>

260
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 2>disjointed,</v>

261
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 2>illogical sort of way of thinking,</v>

262
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:41.321
<v Speaker 2>I think you have people that are assholes that find a cause that gives him the</v>

263
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 2>green light to be an asshole.</v>

264
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

265
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:44.661
<v Speaker 2>I read about this,</v>

266
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:44.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

267
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:45.471
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

268
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

269
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 2>no disrespect to any particular church,</v>

270
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's reasonable to say 50 years ago if you were a bully,</v>

271
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 2>if you are a sociopath,</v>

272
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 2>do you want you to take out in other people?</v>

273
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 2>You want it to Rick harm on the world that you thought would hurt you?</v>

274
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Reasonably good way of doing that would be to join the clergy and many and many</v>

275
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:00.110
<v Speaker 2>people did.</v>

276
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 2>And I think most of us who are religious,</v>

277
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 2>who have religious families know stories like that.</v>

278
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.230
<v Speaker 2>These days you're better off getting a job at Gorka.</v>

279
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

280
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

281
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 2>if you want to bully somebody,</v>

282
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to hurt them,</v>

283
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 2>if you have some sort of internal chaos or damage and you want to impose order</v>

284
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 2>on the world outside because you feel so confused and broken and messy,</v>

285
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.521
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

286
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:17.231
