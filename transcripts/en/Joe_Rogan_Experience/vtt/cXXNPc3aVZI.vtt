47
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when menace to society came </v>

48
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

49
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>these are my people.</v>

50
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember going home and being like,</v>

51
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't talk to me right now.</v>

52
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Like being all upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

53
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 or something.</v>

54
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to identify with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

55
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:37.011
<v Speaker 1>Now if you lived in that neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you were like around those </v>

57
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:41.421
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you have adopted that way of </v>

58
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:41.421
<v Speaker 1>talking that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:41.421
<v Speaker 1>first of all I would be dead if I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

60
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>if I lived in that neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think every,</v>

61
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think every white kid,</v>

62
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.350
<v Speaker 1>a lot of white kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suburban white kids can identify with </v>

63
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>that desire to be part of that culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you grew up.</v>

64
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>We grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>different areas and time places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was growing up,</v>

66
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>that's when hip hop had exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying part of pop culture,</v>

67
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you love,</v>

68
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:13.051
<v Speaker 1>we love the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I played sports so every </v>

69
00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:14.870
<v Speaker 1>basically every great sports figure was </v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

70
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
<v Speaker 2>And I'm saying it's a pretty good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to bring that junk.</v>

71
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Is that bid on a CD or anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

72
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

73
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great bit.</v>

74
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 2>I should do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's a few of those bits back in the </v>

101
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.260
<v Speaker 1>day that I did for awhile and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

102
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you get tired of them and they'd never </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it on anything.</v>

104
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 1>He just let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving.</v>

105
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't worry about that though.</v>

106
00:04:56.461 --> 00:05:01.461
<v Speaker 1>You just got to keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I have a recorded somewhere and </v>

107
00:05:01.461 --> 00:05:01.461
<v Speaker 1>I'll just put it online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be good.</v>

108
00:05:01.461 --> 00:05:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

109
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>that would be worth it because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how it is like once you get,</v>

110
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just you can't just keep doing it.</v>

111
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever let something go for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and then somebody's like,</v>

112
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:18.291
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that and you do it and it's like </v>

113
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:21.170
<v Speaker 1>something was lost in the time that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do it in the kind of sucks.</v>

114
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Then like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that going away better </v>

115
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.111
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also you have to record things </v>

116
00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:33.231
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes I forget like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny pieces of bits that make them super</v>

117
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:36.990
<v Speaker 1>important and you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one recently that I forgot,</v>

118
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.650
<v Speaker 1>like one aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I listened to an old recording.</v>

119
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

120
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:42.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

121
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:47.010
<v Speaker 1>that's such an important part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it's true.</v>

122
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Comedy's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to stay on if you don't stay on</v>

123
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:53.280
<v Speaker 1>a bit and you're not with it all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

124
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 1>you lose like the rhythm of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose how it goes.</v>

125
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I've bought</v>

126
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.070
<v Speaker 3>like five tracks of mine from itunes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are on my phone from being at shows</v>

127
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 3>and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

128
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Like how does that go again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not remembering.</v>

129
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.590
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like old.</v>

130
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.040
<v Speaker 3>So I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I buy it off of an old album to listen </v>

131
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.040
<v Speaker 3>to while you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I couldn't remember.</v>

132
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the bit like I know the framework</v>

133
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I forget the,</v>

134
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.490
<v Speaker 3>like all the little parts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I look like a real narcissists,</v>

135
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 3>like just listening to my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wake up,</v>

<v Speaker 3>watch my special every morning going.</v>

140
00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 3>of have to listen to your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to watch your stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you don't want anybody catching you </v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>

144
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:51.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were on a plane on your </v>

145
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:51.131
<v Speaker 3>laptop and you're watching your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>special crazy.</v>

146
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 3>There are people that do love to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

147
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.070
<v Speaker 3>They're usually new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

148
00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

149
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't like anything I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never like anything I do ever.</v>

150
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't like watching myself on </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

151
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:11.231
<v Speaker 3>on television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listening to my standup it during your </v>

152
00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:13.901
<v Speaker 3>own voice pains me and if I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's once I like it once and then after </v>

153
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 3>that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can wash it again because you'll go,</v>

154
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I do?</v>

155
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Like this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did I have more of a pause?</v>

156
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:24.071
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like I'm rushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm going too slow or I'm </v>

157
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 3>feeling I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's how you get good.</v>

158
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:30.041
<v Speaker 3>You got to be dissatisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you run into someone and they </v>

159
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:30.041
<v Speaker 3>love everything they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they almost always suck.</v>

160
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

161
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nothing's ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Letterman was said to hate </v>

164
00:07:39.161 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 3>everything he ever did come home and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

166
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend used to be his assistant and </v>

<v Speaker 3>He would just take a notebook filled </v>

171
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 3>with shit fucking slam against a window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't give a fuck who's angry?</v>

172
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Some guy told me a story once that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a guest on Letterman a while ago and</v>

173
00:08:03.001 --> 00:08:08.001
<v Speaker 3>that he was going after the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going to go to Montana for him to</v>

174
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:13.091
<v Speaker 3>see his family was during the holidays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the last episode before </v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

176
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.340
<v Speaker 3>and then letterman had a place in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana and so they discussed it on the </v>

177
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:18.470
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>

178
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:19.850
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>want to hang out with these,</v>

206
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.860

<v Speaker 1>It's a little presents as a friend,</v>

313
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.890

<v Speaker 1>That's what they were doing.</v>

314
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

315
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:41.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one girl that I was pretty close </v>

316
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:41.490
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was 18 years old.</v>

317
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.751
<v Speaker 1>I was 13 and like we hung out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take the bus to the beach from the </v>

318
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 1>valley and smoke cigarettes and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

319
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:53.311
<v Speaker 1>she took it in the but she was five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and new.</v>

320
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing if you're 30 and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>35,</v>

321
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.150
<v Speaker 1>that's totally normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 15 and 18,</v>

322
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>

323
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 and 18.</v>

324
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a giant gap.</v>

325
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five years is a giant five years and I </v>

326
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>think part of that is she was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheltered,</v>

327
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:17.950
<v Speaker 1>she'd grown up in such a strict Persian </v>
<v Speaker 1>family that maybe mentally she was 13.</v>

328
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I taught her to smoke cigarettes </v>

329
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:22.980
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

330
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:22.990
<v Speaker 1>You told her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:28.050
<v Speaker 1>She was real sheltered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus shed like we take the bus to the </v>

332
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.471
<v Speaker 1>beach and she would have to stop at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>payphone every hour to call her dad and </v>

333
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:32.500
<v Speaker 1>check in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how strict they were.</v>

334
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder what happened.</v>

335
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:37.730
<v Speaker 1>What was her rationale?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

336
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.750
<v Speaker 1>probably like buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times do you take in the ass </v>

337
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:48.181
<v Speaker 1>for everything breaks down prolapses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that rectal prolapse driving off road </v>

338
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:49.590
<v Speaker 1>with a car that's not designed for it.</v>

339
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like you got the wrong tires on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that vehicle.</v>

340
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 4>Do you understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

341
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.460
<v Speaker 4>I've never honestly listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never been to know about this,</v>

342
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 4>but with reasonably good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

343
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 4>it's chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of wrong,</v>

344
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.940
<v Speaker 4>mean first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'd be a lot of clean up,</v>

345
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 4>involved pre and post it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

346
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.370
<v Speaker 4>But second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this girl,</v>

347
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 4>what was her rationale to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 4>purity and that's a very common thing.</v>

348
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.750
<v Speaker 4>And like how did she explain it though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I have to be married a virgin,</v>

349
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:31.751
<v Speaker 4>that my father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they checked the bedsheets on your </v>

350
00:15:31.751 --> 00:15:34.350
<v Speaker 4>wedding night and dad eats you out if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a person and then he can tell.</v>

351
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 4>That's right Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly how it went.</v>

352
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

353
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 4>Normal finishes up and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eats you still good.</v>

354
00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:51.761
<v Speaker 4>So it's a little bloody fucking Christ </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

355
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:57.761
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when she explained it to where you </v>

356
00:15:57.761 --> 00:16:00.040
<v Speaker 4>like at 13,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're probably wait what mean?</v>

357
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 4>But in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like I knew about sex was.</v>

358
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't doing anything.</v>

359
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was getting my ass fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 13.</v>

360
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.180
<v Speaker 4>I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

361
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:16.190
<v Speaker 4>an experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just blown away.</v>

362
00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:17.210
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

363
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 4>she was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is so awesome memory I have of her.</v>

364
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.600
<v Speaker 4>I was wearing a tank top and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>summertime and I remember she poked my </v>

365
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.140
<v Speaker 4>armpit fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>

366
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.200
<v Speaker 4>Ooh girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to have big tvs where you grow </v>

367
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>arm pit giveaway and fatty,</v>

368
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 4>and I live in La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was right.</v>

369
00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was armpit fat.</v>

370
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.590
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

371
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 4>I thought that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was bizarre,</v>

372
00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:44.480
<v Speaker 4>but she explained that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious thing and this was to maintain</v>

373
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 4>her purity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God wants her to take in the.</v>

374
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:50.320
<v Speaker 4>But God wants you to do anal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is it that they,</v>

375
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.440
<v Speaker 4>they tell you to take in the ass instead</v>
<v Speaker 4>of in the vagina or that's like the </v>

376
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 4>option that you choose because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't.</v>

377
00:16:56.841 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 4>It's not written anywhere that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>

378
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.050
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a technical rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the UFC term is.</v>

379
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Technicalities like that in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The very unfortunate.</v>

380
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:08.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

381
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.720
<v Speaker 4>So it's like of kicking it down to </v>
<v Speaker 4>ponant no knees to the head when you're </v>

382
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.810
<v Speaker 4>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't there a back of the head rule too?</v>

383
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:15.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

384
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.100
<v Speaker 5>Which is kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

385
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.400
<v Speaker 5>it's only applicable when your on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground because in standup,</v>

386
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.030
<v Speaker 5>like guys get kicked in the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>head all the time because when you throw</v>

387
00:17:28.031 --> 00:17:31.420
<v Speaker 5>a kick like save two guys are standing </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and you throw a head kick.</v>

388
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:36.570
<v Speaker 5>When you throw a head kick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your foot wraps around the back of </v>

389
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:36.970
<v Speaker 5>someone's head and a lot of times that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>what hits first.</v>

390
00:17:36.971 --> 00:17:40.330
<v Speaker 5>The instep hits the back of their head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It happens all the time.</v>

391
00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:45.331
<v Speaker 5>Especially if someone's standing like if</v>
<v Speaker 5>the your opponent has his left foot </v>

392
00:17:45.331 --> 00:17:49.531
<v Speaker 5>forward and you have your left foot </v>
<v Speaker 5>forward and you throw a kick basically </v>

393
00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:49.550
<v Speaker 5>to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're hitting him the back of the head.</v>

394
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 5>It happens</v>

395
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that when that happens,</v>

396
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.830
<v Speaker 1>that's not considered a violation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

397
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 1>You guys get knocked out from getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked in the back of the head and when </v>

398
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.450
<v Speaker 1>they're standing and it's fine and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

399
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.620
<v Speaker 1>in wild punching exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys get hit in the back of the head and</v>

400
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:09.621
<v Speaker 1>no one ever gives him a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't give them a deliberate punch </v>

401
00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:10.230
<v Speaker 1>to when they're on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hit them in the back of the head,</v>

402
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.260
<v Speaker 1>then it's considered a foul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it a lot.</v>

403
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the foul.</v>

404
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.600
<v Speaker 1>The fouls happen a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets called a lot and it happens a </v>

405
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well because when you're,</v>

406
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.430
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when guys were on the ground and there's</v>

407
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:26.600
<v Speaker 1>a scramble going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are moving and you,</v>

408
00:18:26.601 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 1>you go to throw a punch but the guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not there.</v>

409
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Like from the time you go to throw the </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch to the punch landing,</v>

410
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a little space there so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

411
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.910
<v Speaker 1>half a second or whatever it is and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person sees it and they move a little </v>

412
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.291
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes when they move you </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally hit him in the back of the </v>

413
00:18:42.291 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 1>head and then sometimes you throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches that aren't totally specific.</v>

414
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:49.220
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to win and then some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them hit the back of the head or </v>

415
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.910
<v Speaker 1>there's intentional ones too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very hard to decipher what's </v>

416
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:52.910
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't a bag that,</v>

417
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but I've probably been to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

418
00:18:55.170 --> 00:19:00.170
<v Speaker 1>a dozen or more UFC is with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last one that I went to was in </v>

419
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:04.581
<v Speaker 1>Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that Brown Arlovski fight the </v>

420
00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 1>craziest things of all the rounds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights that I've witnessed.</v>

421
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I've ever seen a fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and I've never seen felt the </v>

422
00:19:13.621 --> 00:19:17.820
<v Speaker 1>energy shift and explode the way that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>did in that round.</v>

423
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.100
<v Speaker 1>It was really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a wild round.</v>

424
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even realize how crazy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

425
00:19:22.231 --> 00:19:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize I was standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

426
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.300
<v Speaker 1>we talked about that and we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the entire standing up he was doing </v>

427
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:29.300
<v Speaker 1>commentary.</v>

428
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a microphone in front of me</v>

429
00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:38.871
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a microphone that's attached to </v>

430
00:19:38.871 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 1>my headset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I stand up it's still attached.</v>

431
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 1>So it just goes to this box and all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>jazz.</v>

432
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 1>The wire connects to this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm standing up doing commentary.</v>

433
00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:50.841
<v Speaker 1>I literally didn't realize I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up until it was already </v>

434
00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:50.841
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was seated.</v>

435
00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

436
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Nobody know the tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people right around the octagon.</v>

437
00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Every single person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so crazy that you couldn't help </v>

438
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.530
<v Speaker 1>it because that happens during fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is,</v>

439
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.920
<v Speaker 1>and that's why while I'm working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know what was going on.</v>

440
00:20:09.921 --> 00:20:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Like while it was working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stood up.</v>

441
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea it was.</v>

442
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.310
<v Speaker 1>It was such an intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

443
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm like going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like home alone.</v>

444
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this,</v>

445
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:26.541
<v Speaker 1>this shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was happening there is what was so </v>

446
00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:29.391
<v Speaker 1>amazed that that would be my sell to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody that wasn't into it is just to </v>

447
00:20:29.391 --> 00:20:31.250
<v Speaker 1>experience the feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

448
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 1>of the energy in an arena like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

449
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.400
<v Speaker 1>for people that aren't into whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

450
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

451
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

452
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't bottle that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't deny that that's,</v>

453
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.850
<v Speaker 1>that currently exists like that in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other sport either.</v>

454
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:46.851
<v Speaker 1>There's great moments in sports where </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone scores a three pointer at the </v>

455
00:20:46.851 --> 00:20:48.020
<v Speaker 1>buzzer and wins the game or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

456
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 5>great pass gets delivered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy runs 100 yards.</v>

457
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.360
<v Speaker 5>There's those moments in sports,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's so different than a guy fucking</v>

458
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 5>another guy on fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

459
00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.280
<v Speaker 5>Or a woman fucking another woman up like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that fight that's passed when we can,</v>

460
00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:02.160
<v Speaker 5>that we were talking about before the </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast starts.</v>

461
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 5>You on a young jet check this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad ass bitch from Poland.</v>

462
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's good.</v>

463
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.220
<v Speaker 5>She might be like one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>strikers in all of MMA period.</v>

464
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 5>Cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>battered like top five.</v>

465
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 5>She battered her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's a six time world Moy Thai champion</v>

466
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.830
<v Speaker 5>and she's also from Poland and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a.</v>

467
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 5>something about the fucking.</v>

468
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:34.430
<v Speaker 6>I was watching Anthony Bourdain's parts </v>
<v Speaker 6>unknown and he went to Budapest and my </v>

469
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.841
<v Speaker 6>last name is Polish,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but were Hungarians and the whole </v>

470
00:21:38.841 --> 00:21:41.601
<v Speaker 6>episode was about the suffering and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>harshness and the misery of how </v>

471
00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:45.240
<v Speaker 6>everything sucks because they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>ravaged by world war one,</v>

472
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:50.270
<v Speaker 6>World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then the Russians came and screwed </v>

473
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.181
<v Speaker 6>up hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's essentially a hundred years of </v>

474
00:21:53.181 --> 00:21:53.181
<v Speaker 6>just misery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that breeds</v>

475
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.960
<v Speaker 5>titers walled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Russian Russians are known for being </v>

476
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.281
<v Speaker 5>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some of the best boxers in the </v>

477
00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:04.841
<v Speaker 5>world today are Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's they're coming over here and </v>

478
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:04.841
<v Speaker 5>droves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sergei Kovalev,</v>

479
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:07.250
<v Speaker 5>Gennady Golovkin and the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of them.</v>

480
00:22:07.251 --> 00:22:12.251
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of fucking fighters from</v>
<v Speaker 5>that part of the world that are just so </v>

481
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:16.181
<v Speaker 5>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think we'll see a triple g canelo </v>

482
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:16.181
<v Speaker 5>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

483
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:18.110
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think Canelo's going to fight cotto.</v>

484
00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:23.111
<v Speaker 5>If he gets past Codo we're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>him versus Golovkin and I think if he </v>

485
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:23.990
<v Speaker 5>doesn't guess past Cota we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>

486
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>versus Golovkin glove could.</v>

487
00:22:26.241 --> 00:22:31.241
<v Speaker 5>The only thing against him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from what I follow is that he doesn't </v>

488
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:32.080
<v Speaker 5>really have any names under his belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

489
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.940
<v Speaker 5>Because they're scared of him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people are scared they're running.</v>

490
00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.720
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to fight that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That dude is.</v>

491
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.200
<v Speaker 5>He's a dangerous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

492
00:22:39.201 --> 00:22:40.610
<v Speaker 5>he's from Kazakhstan.</v>

493
00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So his,</v>

494
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.960
<v Speaker 5>his floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His Dad called him a giant.</v>

495
00:22:44.961 --> 00:22:45.610
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

496
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.720
<v Speaker 5>no damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Johnny.</v>

497
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 5>Johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just won 60.</v>

498
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.110
<v Speaker 5>Hey you fights at one 60.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're black.</v>

499
00:22:51.111 --> 00:22:53.510
<v Speaker 5>That was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just so you know very much.</v>

500
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.890
<v Speaker 5>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's only six pounds heavier than </v>

501
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.471
<v Speaker 5>floyd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which in the UFC is nothing but that </v>

502
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:05.360
<v Speaker 5>happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the UFC guys that are 185 talk about</v>

503
00:23:05.361 --> 00:23:06.500
<v Speaker 5>fighting at two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh five.</v>

504
00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.740
<v Speaker 5>Which is 20 pounds difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Chris Weidman is talking about </v>

505
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.530
<v Speaker 5>fighting John Jones and unification </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight Madison Square Garden.</v>

506
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:13.790
<v Speaker 5>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the wide,</v>

507
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.900
<v Speaker 5>if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

508
00:23:14.901 --> 00:23:16.640
<v Speaker 5>he's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a fucking beast.</v>

509
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.720
<v Speaker 5>Weidman versus going forward now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was not a team wide window joined </v>

510
00:23:22.731 --> 00:23:23.900
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

511
00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:28.310
<v Speaker 5>but that's a giant jump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty pound jump and Gennady.</v>

512
00:23:28.311 --> 00:23:29.900
<v Speaker 5>Golovkin is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Floyd Mayweather,</v>

513
00:23:29.901 --> 00:23:31.730
<v Speaker 5>his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Floyd Mayweather,</v>

514
00:23:31.731 --> 00:23:35.060
<v Speaker 5>who in my opinion is the best boxer the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world has ever seen.</v>

515
00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:40.420
<v Speaker 5>I think he's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you might not like him as a </v>

516
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:40.420
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might think his style is boring,</v>

517
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:42.890
<v Speaker 5>but when it comes to hitting people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>not getting hit,</v>

518
00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.950
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck is better ever?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

519
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 5>Better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

520
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.820
<v Speaker 3>people could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

521
00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't fought anybody know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so good.</v>

522
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.550
<v Speaker 3>He makes people that are great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look not that good.</v>

523
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.480
<v Speaker 3>What would he do to Canelo and Canelo is</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroying everybody.</v>

524
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.220
<v Speaker 3>He Shut Canelo down and look what he did</v>
<v Speaker 3>to PAC man.</v>

525
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Shut them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just shuts you down.</v>

526
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

527
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:06.071
<v Speaker 3>pack out a fucked up shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was throwing it mean he's </v>

528
00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:06.071
<v Speaker 3>throwing punches in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

529
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Now he's a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the.</v>

530
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.470
<v Speaker 3>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the best boxer.</v>

531
00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:12.200
<v Speaker 3>He's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart because he does ask to watch.</v>

532
00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:13.730
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not showtime.</v>

533
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 3>Where if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go.</v>

534

<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a slip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing better.</v>

539
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 3>He's wearing a lab coat every time he </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.710
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

541
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.890
<v Speaker 3>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His Dad.</v>

542
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was with HBO.</v>

543
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>24 slash seven is so much better than </v>

544
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:45.120
<v Speaker 3>times behind the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like 24 slash seven is a masterpiece at </v>

545
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.791
<v Speaker 3>the time and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they when him and his dad were arguing </v>

546
00:24:48.791 --> 00:24:49.370
<v Speaker 3>with each other and ms that and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>when Roger,</v>

547
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:50.750
<v Speaker 3>his uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's his.</v>

548
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.700
<v Speaker 3>His trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

549
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:54.770
<v Speaker 3>His uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his uncle who just got teeth.</v>

550
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.900
<v Speaker 3>It was much better than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he got teeth.</v>

551
00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:57.750
<v Speaker 3>He got teeth now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

552
00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.620
<v Speaker 3>He used to have like three teeth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would be the best team.</v>

553
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 3>The best was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think floyd fought Kodo,</v>

554
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:08.771
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fought cotto awhile back and they </v>

555
00:25:08.771 --> 00:25:10.230
<v Speaker 3>were doing the 24 slash seven and Koto </v>
<v Speaker 3>the they cut from Kodo.</v>

556
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

557
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I've been studying all his fights and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized he's going to bring his best </v>

558
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.680
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to bring my best and you </v>

<v Speaker 3>Roger Mayweather Mayweather and he's </v>

560
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:23.770
<v Speaker 3>like kowtowing shit.</v>

561
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.820

<v Speaker 3>Like he likes to watch any of his film.</v>

562
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:33.821
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His whole thing was that like we don't </v>

563
00:25:33.821 --> 00:25:34.580
<v Speaker 3>prepare for other people.</v>

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.630
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

579
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at it,</v>

580
00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:19.790
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

581
00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:22.190
<v Speaker 3>this guy is trying to punch that guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is trying to move his head.</v>

582
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 3>He sees things in melt multiple layers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

583
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.900
<v Speaker 3>He's seeing traps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seen setups.</v>

584
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.760
<v Speaker 3>He's saying all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements that you don't perceive.</v>

585
00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:36.761
<v Speaker 3>It's like us watching standup tricks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

586
00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:42.401
<v Speaker 3>like somebody killing with a bullshit is</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit where the other people in that </v>

587
00:26:42.681 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 3>room are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's great.</v>

588
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.640
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there was a guy that when I </v>

589
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.371
<v Speaker 1>first started out I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good when I was an open mic or I </v>

590
00:26:52.371 --> 00:26:54.110
<v Speaker 1>saw him live before I ever actually got </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage.</v>

591
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I paid to see a show and he was on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had like the whole look.</v>

592
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 1>He had the converse all stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the gas station attendant jacket,</v>

593
00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:08.610
<v Speaker 1>kind of wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had the whole thing going on and this </v>

594
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.890
<v Speaker 1>just contrived nonsense act that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially pieced piece together with </v>

595
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:15.420
<v Speaker 1>every premise that you've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>from every comedian ever,</v>

596
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.470
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

597
00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:18.460
<v Speaker 1>He's a pro pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

598
00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comedy tee shirt.</v>

599
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:22.820
<v Speaker 1>That's always the giveaway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flames on it.</v>

600
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.500
<v Speaker 1>The flames are good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I saw that guy today,</v>

601
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I would watch them for 30 seconds ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wednesday night.</v>

607
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.010

608
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.740

<v Speaker 1>and Tony Tony Hinchcliffe.</v>

609
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a good line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That line and enjoy it.</v>

610
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.210

<v Speaker 1>Hang over.</v>

611
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hang over to also push positive energy.</v>

612
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.240
<v Speaker 1>If you've never seen bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's going to be great at the Ice</v>

613
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 1>House on Wednesday night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you really want to see brody,</v>

614
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.640
<v Speaker 1>you got to see his late night set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a comedy store when he closes the </v>

615
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.391
<v Speaker 1>room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have all these videos up on my </v>

616
00:28:14.391 --> 00:28:14.391
<v Speaker 1>instagram of him playing the drums on </v>
<v Speaker 1>chairs.</v>

617
00:28:14.391 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 1>He gives tambourines to people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and they play along,</v>

618
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.110
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basic.</v>

619
00:28:19.111 --> 00:28:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

620
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I barely knew him when Christina was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and writing for Chelsea on the show was </v>

621
00:28:25.801 --> 00:28:30.801
<v Speaker 1>on the highlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would laugh at her stories about he </v>

622
00:28:30.801 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 1>was audience warmup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how he would wrangle these,</v>

623
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these 22 year old girls who were there,</v>

624
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.640
<v Speaker 4>there like about like energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>energy go,</v>

625
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.150
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when Chelsea comes out,</v>

626
00:28:44.151 --> 00:28:49.151
<v Speaker 4>she's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need you to be real to laugh.</v>

627
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.460
<v Speaker 4>And he would hear the audience laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would go.</v>

628
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:57.320
<v Speaker 4>He would go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

629
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.340
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>

630
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.380
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can say this now because it's shown is</v>

631
00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:05.381
<v Speaker 4>no longer with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the funniest part or Chelsea </v>

632
00:29:05.381 --> 00:29:05.381
<v Speaker 4>lately in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have while you were on it.</v>

633
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.040
<v Speaker 4>Now when you're writing fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucked up.</v>

634
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.790
<v Speaker 4>He's a special man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dude is so funny.</v>

635
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:18.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing that they didn't have him </v>

636
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:18.850
<v Speaker 4>on the shell like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

637
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.920
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't used correctly and I would </v>

638
00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.200
<v Speaker 4>always advocate for that because I would</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the writers and I go,</v>

639
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:29.260
<v Speaker 4>we got to put him in sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we do a thing where maybe we </v>

640
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.520
<v Speaker 4>take brody on blind dates or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

641
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.520
<v Speaker 4>let's end.</v>

642
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.990
<v Speaker 4>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't very popular.</v>

643
00:29:32.991 --> 00:29:35.650
<v Speaker 4>It was shot down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't know if he's an.</v>

644
00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.500
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he wasn't a fit for the television</v>
<v Speaker 4>audience at home,</v>

645
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sensibility thing.</v>

646
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:45.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's so funny and so talented.</v>

647
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:51.030
<v Speaker 4>I think whenever you start wondering </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not the audience will like </v>

648
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:51.030
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>

649
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:51.880
<v Speaker 4>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucked.</v>

650
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 4>You like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's funny?</v>

651
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.040
<v Speaker 4>Then go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at Tim and Eric.</v>

652
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:02.250
<v Speaker 4>You ever watched him and Eric?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys thought for a fucking second.</v>

653
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Do you think the audience will like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>

654
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.810
<v Speaker 4>Do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get it.</v>

655
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.050
<v Speaker 4>The show would die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be.</v>

656
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.070
<v Speaker 4>It would never work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would never work.</v>

657
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.670
<v Speaker 4>That show is so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one with the hillbillies.</v>

<v Speaker 4>pregnant and I didn't see it.</v>

<v Speaker 6>literally that gang territory.</v>

728
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.960
<v Speaker 6>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely,</v>

729
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:46.961
<v Speaker 6>I'd love to write for the show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we had won the lottery and we kind </v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

731
00:33:46.961 --> 00:33:47.720
<v Speaker 6>that was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it was,</v>

732
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:48.500
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

733
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.180
<v Speaker 6>it was one of those jobs for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was huge.</v>

734
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 6>It was one of those Hollywood jobs where</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was supposed to,</v>

735
00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.440
<v Speaker 6>this is supposed to be the best thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>

736
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:02.330
<v Speaker 6>And then I would get my car and just cry</v>
<v Speaker 6>and after where it was just not for me,</v>

737
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the environment was not for me.</v>

738
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 6>It just wasn't my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't my jam.</v>

739
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.790
<v Speaker 6>I didn't jibe with the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just like what was off about it?</v>

740
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 6>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a little bit of a,</v>

741
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:20.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how in writer's rooms there's like a </v>

742
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:20.380
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you feel like,</v>

743
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:20.380
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

744
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.650
<v Speaker 6>let's do that and we'll top that with </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

745
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:25.790
<v Speaker 6>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't sense that energy.</v>

746
00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:29.090
<v Speaker 6>It was more mean girl energy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Know what I'm saying.</v>

747
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:33.080
<v Speaker 6>Like I think you put a bunch of chicks </v>
<v Speaker 6>together and that might just happen.</v>

748
00:34:33.081 --> 00:34:35.410
<v Speaker 6>Not all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but mean girl.</v>

749
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.640
<v Speaker 6>A little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just,</v>

750
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:39.290
<v Speaker 6>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't jive.</v>

751
00:34:39.291 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 6>It's like in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

752
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 6>hung out with the goths,</v>
<v Speaker 6>put it this way.</v>

753
00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:47.570
<v Speaker 6>If I go to a restaurant when I worked </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually when I worked in restaurants,</v>

754
00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.510
<v Speaker 6>I'm more likely to hang out with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>busboys than with the managers,</v>

755
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.660
<v Speaker 6>but just that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's my energy.</v>

756
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:58.810
<v Speaker 6>And they were managers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess I'm trying to decipher this well</v>

757
00:34:59.961 --> 00:35:04.961
<v Speaker 6>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be under the bus </v>

758
00:35:04.961 --> 00:35:06.890
<v Speaker 6>shithead about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they were more into being mean.</v>

759
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.260
<v Speaker 6>The culture wasn't for me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't for me.</v>

760
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:12.140
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't a good match dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just wasn't my energy.</v>

761
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.310
<v Speaker 6>I understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

762
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:14.780
<v Speaker 6>so anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

763
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:17.780
<v Speaker 6>So I got fired pretty quick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think like a month and a half,</v>

764
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:23.710
<v Speaker 6>month and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the best part is they call me into </v>

765
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.310
<v Speaker 6>the [inaudible] office and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to have to let you go.</v>

766
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.590
<v Speaker 6>And I started laughing because I thought</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was joking.</v>

767
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.060
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was a break.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't a wow.</v>

768
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 6>What did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

769
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.260
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the usual Hollywood bullshit.</v>

770
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we already have your</v>

771
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.300
<v Speaker 1>voice on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's a producer guy,</v>

785
00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:19.200
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those guys,</v>

00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 1>they adopt that lingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They adopt that way of talking.</v>

787
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.040
<v Speaker 1>The grossest part about that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always attached to an idea of I </v>

788
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.080
<v Speaker 1>would like a part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's always like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how can I kind of weasel into sucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of what you have achieved for me </v>

790
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:39.390
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a little of that talk,</v>

791
00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:41.940
<v Speaker 1>but I was so unresponsive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it died off,</v>

792
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's.</v>

793
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things they'll say is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's money left on the table.</v>

794
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some money still left on the table and </v>

<v Speaker 1>and figure out how to optimize that.</v>

796
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some ways we can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

809
00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.630
<v Speaker 1>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any talent.</v>

810
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.700
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they have to do is just like,</v>

811
00:37:38.701 --> 00:37:39.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Part of the lights on to.</v>

816
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>So this helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're always trying to figure out </v>

817
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.401
<v Speaker 1>how to say the right words to Kinda like</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingratiate themselves and have it be </v>

822
00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:13.950
<v Speaker 1>manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a manager that talked and</v>

823
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:18.300
<v Speaker 1>manager speak where they never really </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you a decisive answer like,</v>

824
00:38:18.301 --> 00:38:19.920
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I take this thing or not?</v>

825
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a bird in the hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand if you're not </v>

<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

829
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Remember when your first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you don't have a manager and </v>

830
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you think that getting a manager would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be everything.</v>

831
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Everything that I remember a guy came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a show at the Hollywood improv and he </v>

832
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.100
<v Speaker 1>like just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

833
00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 1>this is incredible what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to he.</v>

834
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 1>And he told me that and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shit on another client of his.</v>

835
00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:54.210
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so much better than this other </v>

836
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:54.210
<v Speaker 1>guy that I managed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

837
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:54.210
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

838
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:54.930
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>

839
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I need to bring other guys from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>company to watch you.</v>

840
00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I need to show them.</v>

842
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.300
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

843
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.360
<v Speaker 1>So then we'd set up another show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brought like four guys from this big </v>

844
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.510
<v Speaker 1>company and then after that show they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

845
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

846
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:16.580

847
00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:16.580
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't think it's going to work out.</v>

848
00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>

849
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 1>it's just not a fit.</v>

850
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Speaker 1>What's the fit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got lucky.</v>

851
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:28.400

852
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:28.400
<v Speaker 1>ran into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should immediately.</v>

<v Speaker 1>manager early on.</v>

855
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Then they sue you when you leave or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lawsuit.</v>

856
00:39:35.221 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 1>If.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if anything happens,</v>

857
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.420
<v Speaker 1>if you have a television show or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something takes off and it becomes </v>

<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I never have to worry about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

882
00:40:40.661 --> 00:40:45.661
<v Speaker 1>I could pass it off to jeff and I trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>him the way I would like more than I </v>

<v Speaker 1>always been great from the very </v>

887
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:53.940
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

888
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 1>But you could get a bad one man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then off to the.</v>

889
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

890
00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I've been with the same guy eight years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have a good relationship and I'm,</v>

891
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's cool,</v>

892
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:07.230
<v Speaker 1>but I have friends that have been with </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that eight year span had been with </v>

893
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.471
<v Speaker 1>like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six managers like friends of ours that </v>

894
00:41:10.471 --> 00:41:12.070
<v Speaker 1>you're fired this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fired somebody else.</v>

895
00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 1>I find a good fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times they're both fucked.</v>

896
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.170
<v Speaker 1>The manager's fucked and the comic is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck to fuck there.</v>

897
00:41:20.171 --> 00:41:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's fucked up trying to figure it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

898
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:24.940
<v Speaker 1>No one could figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is true or not,</v>

899
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:30.300
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to say the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently mark Merrin's podcast </v>

900
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.620
<v Speaker 1>before he started his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his manager was telling why you fucking </v>

901
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:34.620
<v Speaker 1>waste your time doing this.</v>

902
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sure it is true.</v>

903
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he just interviewed the president,</v>

904
00:41:41.021 --> 00:41:46.021
<v Speaker 1>so how fucking stupid as fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This his ex manager field now.</v>

905
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

906
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Oops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you missed it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

908
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Nobody saw the podcast thing coming in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his defense,</v>

909
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 1>but what a terrible way to address </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that saying,</v>

910
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 1>oh well why are you doing this on the </v>

923
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Mustache high boots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so he pulled me aside.</v>

924
00:42:41.511 --> 00:42:43.500
<v Speaker 1>This is year four and stand up and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

925
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:46.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a good looking girl.</v>

926
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should do smart though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you write your own material?</v>

927
00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

928
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't that smart at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

929
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

930
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.860
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be like a naive,</v>

931
00:42:56.861 --> 00:42:59.190
<v Speaker 1>like a stupid blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an ingenue.</v>

932
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go bro.</v>

933
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't know.</v>

934
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.290
<v Speaker 1>You're still vulnerable in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

935
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Someone tells you something and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

936
00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:08.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should.</v>

937
00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy knows what he's talking about.</v>

938
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.860
<v Speaker 1>The sad part is that some people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point go,</v>

939
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

940
00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stick to what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to listen to this fucking </v>

941
00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:19.220
<v Speaker 1>idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so new to it,</v>

942
00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:24.070
<v Speaker 1>of course are so green and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is a person write books,</v>

943
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:28.290
<v Speaker 1>the biggest talent in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then boy,</v>

944
00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:30.530
<v Speaker 1>oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you glad I didn't listen to the</v>

945
00:43:30.531 --> 00:43:31.580
<v Speaker 1>advice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

946
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.860
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in Boston they were all </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me to be clean.</v>

947
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to be cleaned from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

948
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Got To be clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

949
00:43:37.341 --> 00:43:38.750
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking shortcuts.</v>

950
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.740
<v Speaker 1>That was the big thing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking shortcuts,</v>

951
00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you,</v>

952
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:46.540
<v Speaker 1>because you talk like a normal person </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe back in the day when the only </v>

953
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:51.161
<v Speaker 1>outlets for standup where you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight show star search and that was </v>

954
00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:51.170
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

955
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And now with the Internet and cable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean kids definitely.</v>

956
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:59.230
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely more outlets but </v>

957
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.230
<v Speaker 1>there was always nightclubs back then </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

958
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:00.500
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what they would call dirty material,</v>

959
00:44:00.501 --> 00:44:01.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swearing,</v>

960
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:04.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in fact funny.</v>

961
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:07.100
<v Speaker 1>So like this idea that it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>clean to be,</v>

962
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.900
<v Speaker 1>to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

963
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:13.901
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying to me is that if I </v>

964
00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:15.260
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't censor myself,</v>

965
00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.990
<v Speaker 1>because that's the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you're seeing on television is</v>

966
00:44:17.991 --> 00:44:20.120
<v Speaker 1>censored so that they can sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials.</v>

967
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:21.550
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.350
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't make a commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>product like that,</v>

969
00:44:24.351 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 1>then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're taking a shortcut,</v>

970
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.980
<v Speaker 1>but what about all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in your brain?</v>

971
00:44:27.981 --> 00:44:29.570
<v Speaker 1>You do think about sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

972
00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 1>You do think about these so those things</v>

973
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.780
<v Speaker 3>aren't valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are not valid,</v>

974
00:44:33.781 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

975
00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:40.611
<v Speaker 3>it always kills me when you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to discuss adult topics among </v>

976
00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:45.381
<v Speaker 3>adults or speak the way adults do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys are so offended by jerk off or </v>

977
00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.870
<v Speaker 3>this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like give me a fucking break.</v>

978
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.970
<v Speaker 3>It's so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me crazy.</v>

979
00:44:50.971 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people are dumb.</v>

980
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 3>They're dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are smart.</v>

981
00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 3>They're the problem and they think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with you.</v>

982
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I just prefer more highbrow type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>comment for you.</v>

983
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

984
00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:08.931
<v Speaker 3>I always wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the shit holes that I did as a </v>

985
00:45:08.931 --> 00:45:08.931
<v Speaker 3>feature act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

986
00:45:08.931 --> 00:45:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I've been down in Florida doing seafood </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants and buy ge grills.</v>

987
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Like how did a guy like Seinfeld come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with an act?</v>

988
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

989
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:22.131
<v Speaker 3>those hard knocks first days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you crush it at the late </v>

990

<v Speaker 3>So the paper towels are crinkly and do </v>

991
00:45:25.351 --> 00:45:27.150
<v Speaker 3>that because I have reverted </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

992
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:32.610
<v Speaker 3>I took a shit today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's check off into the just because I </v>

993
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:33.790
<v Speaker 3>wanted to survive under the jail.</v>

994
00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.720
<v Speaker 3>I just want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

995
00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 3>it's survival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I did a show recently,</v>

996
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:45.840
<v Speaker 3>I was watching this all this shit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead of me and I was like,</v>

997
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:49.470
<v Speaker 3>this is a dog shit show and it's getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>later and later and you know,</v>

998

<v Speaker 3>there's some heckling going on and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>put on like you're like,</v>

1000
00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:57.560

<v Speaker 3>And a weird show.</v>

1001
00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.231
<v Speaker 3>It happened to not go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was able to just do regular </v>

1002
00:46:02.231 --> 00:46:02.610
<v Speaker 3>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the show that we were talking about</v>

1003
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:04.200
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this weekend.</v>

1004
00:46:04.201 --> 00:46:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.800
<v Speaker 3>But what ended up happening was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually ended up being great </v>

1006
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.091
<v Speaker 3>audience and I could just do standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm talking about is that in </v>

1007
00:46:14.091 --> 00:46:15.390
<v Speaker 3>those times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that late show,</v>

1008
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I would always have the hardest hitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff ready to go because for like a </v>

1009
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:21.820
<v Speaker 3>fear thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1010
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 3>they're going to eat me alive.</v>

1011
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:26.580
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno how early on the fear,</v>

1012
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:31.830
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how a clean super clean act would get </v>

1013
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:31.830
<v Speaker 3>through those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those little,</v>

1014
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 3>the balls at such a young stage in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>development to be like,</v>

1015
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:38.410
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stick to my,</v>

1016
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.740
<v Speaker 3>my hand washing jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

1017
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:45.780
<v Speaker 3>Because Gaffigan had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was told had like dirty stuff billing </v>

1018
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:46.950
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1019
00:46:46.951 --> 00:46:49.680
<v Speaker 3>for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he only went clean,</v>

1020
00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:51.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many years ago now.</v>

1021
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.950
<v Speaker 3>And he does fucking huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1022
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 3>theaters and arenas now he's clean act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think when he was doing the clubs,</v>

1023
00:46:58.171 --> 00:46:59.650
<v Speaker 3>he had dirty stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1024
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 years ago.</v>

1025
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:01.840
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how,</v>

1026
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what flips the switch with guys with,</v>

1027
00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.340
<v Speaker 3>with women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>

1028
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy too.</v>

1029
00:47:09.451 --> 00:47:10.680
<v Speaker 3>He's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the podcast,</v>

1030
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 3>but it's like that thing where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide like I am not going to do this is</v>

1031
00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:16.770
<v Speaker 3>my niche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1032
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Like Brian Regan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

1033
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's his.</v>

1034
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.420
<v Speaker 3>He's locked into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that niche.</v>

1035
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.340
<v Speaker 3>There's some guys too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot.</v>

1036
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Some of them look at those things</v>

1037
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.860
<v Speaker 1>like a challenge in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1038

00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:49.810
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1045
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I've heard and I've seen like on </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview stuff like Seinfeld for </v>

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:55.930
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He curses in interviews.</v>

1049
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.730
<v Speaker 1>So does Jay Leno Leno's curses a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.760
<v Speaker 1>when you're hanging out with Jay Leno </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking high.</v>

1051
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always swearing but onstage whereas</v>

1052
00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.530
<v Speaker 1>the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1053
00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because I was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about this like in my day</v>

1054
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:18.340
<v Speaker 4>because Hailey curses when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious curses,</v>

1055
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:27.210
<v Speaker 4>when he's on Viagra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on whatever the fuck your </v>

1056
00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:30.160
<v Speaker 4>expertise and your rudy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he's going to talk about a double </v>

1057
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 4>identity on the stage of identity being </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely different.</v>

1058
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.850
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

1059
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.120
<v Speaker 4>That guy who saw that coming?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

1060
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:42.330
<v Speaker 4>Did you just get like a serial rapist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had that one page knew it,</v>

1061
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:45.190
<v Speaker 4>knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He called it,</v>

1062
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 4>but I do have a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that I always find it weird when</v>

1063
00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:52.450
<v Speaker 4>male comics don't talk about their dicks</v>
<v Speaker 4>on stage.</v>

1064
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:54.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do because I don't trust the.</v>

1065
00:48:54.981 --> 00:48:59.981
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust the dudes that don't </v>

1066
00:48:59.981 --> 00:48:59.981
<v Speaker 4>because I think there's some dishonesty </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1067
00:48:59.981 --> 00:48:59.981
<v Speaker 4>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell you,</v>

1068
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:02.770
<v Speaker 4>a guy that doesn't talk about his Dick </v>
<v Speaker 4>and jerking and all that stuff.</v>

1069
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.420
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I personally,</v>

1070
00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I go sell something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not on the level.</v>

1071
00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:10.150
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something being hidden.</v>

1072
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people have have</v>

1074
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.660
<v Speaker 1>different styles of comedy that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to,</v>

1075
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.900
<v Speaker 1>like maybe they grew up watching like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld or watching that kind of like </v>

1076
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.960
<v Speaker 1>real clean tonight show style comedy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they enjoy.</v>

1077
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 1>They enjoy being buttoned down and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>being tied up and literally weird shit.</v>

1078
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.810
<v Speaker 1>But I was thinking about music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1079
00:49:34.811 --> 00:49:37.060
<v Speaker 1>like my favorite songs don't have swears</v>
<v Speaker 1>in them.</v>

1080
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1081
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean start by thinking about it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stones or Hendrix or something like </v>

1082
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.710
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's my favorite kind of music.</v>

1083
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:48.661
<v Speaker 1>I love classic sixties music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no swears at very few in any of </v>

1084
00:49:49.121 --> 00:49:54.121
<v Speaker 1>those songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that because of the radio and they </v>

1085
00:49:54.121 --> 00:49:54.121
<v Speaker 1>have to play it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1086
00:49:54.121 --> 00:49:54.121

<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1089
00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:00.750

<v Speaker 1>though and onstage or you know,</v>

1090
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:05.820
<v Speaker 1>in rap music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's flooded with swears </v>

1091
00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.480
<v Speaker 1>like in some of my favorite rap songs </v>
<v Speaker 1>just littered with swears.</v>

1092

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:30.760
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody pays attention to him.</v>

1268
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:34.870
<v Speaker 3>He then gets transferred to a jail in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the valley,</v>

1269
00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:38.190
<v Speaker 3>all drunk driving drunk driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the,</v>

1270
00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>in the jail that's out in the valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call it the Hyatt within the,</v>

1271
00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:46.000
<v Speaker 3>the La because it's so much better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the towers downtown.</v>

1272
00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:51.840
<v Speaker 3>And he goes out there and he stays there</v>
<v Speaker 3>two days and then they release them and </v>

1273
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:53.500
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1274
00:58:53.501 --> 00:58:54.880
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened when you said like,</v>

1275
00:58:54.881 --> 00:58:57.970
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to be released 14 days </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1276
00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.380
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1277
00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.930
<v Speaker 3>we got it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got lost in the system.</v>

1278
00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:05.840
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he told me he didn't shit the entire</v>

1279
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.380
<v Speaker 3>time for 14 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1280
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.580
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's told me this before because if</v>

1281
00:59:12.581 --> 00:59:15.220
<v Speaker 3>you're in a cell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a holding cell and there are more people</v>

1282
00:59:15.221 --> 00:59:18.190
<v Speaker 3>in there and oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toilet in the center of the room.</v>

1283
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:23.191
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked him how it was possible and he </v>

1284
00:59:23.191 --> 00:59:23.780
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know he barely ate.</v>

1285
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.680
<v Speaker 3>But he said that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1286
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:28.880
<v Speaker 3>day three and day four he would go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1287
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:33.881
<v Speaker 3>can drop his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then because there's ways you're </v>

1288
00:59:33.881 --> 00:59:37.871
<v Speaker 3>supposed to walk and places that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>two black eyes or two white guys would </v>

1289
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:40.880
<v Speaker 3>walk to the sink that you can see from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shitter.</v>

1290
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:46.360
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as he saw them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would just pull up his pants because </v>

1291
00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.511
<v Speaker 3>he thought he would get attacked and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said he didn't even have a desire to go </v>

1292
00:59:49.511 --> 00:59:49.511
<v Speaker 3>like days.</v>

1293
00:59:49.511 --> 00:59:52.370
<v Speaker 3>So they would look at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was taking his pants off,</v>

1294
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:53.960
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't even look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>

1295
00:59:53.961 --> 00:59:57.470
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that he would see them just walk</v>

1296
00:59:57.471 --> 01:00:01.370
<v Speaker 3>into the area that he was going to shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and all his,</v>

1297
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:03.590
<v Speaker 3>his uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1300
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:10.670
<v Speaker 3>So he just pulled his pants up and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't even shed.</v>

1301
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.040
<v Speaker 3>So no one called him on his fake gang </v>
<v Speaker 3>tattoos.</v>

1443
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:32.351
<v Speaker 1>ago about a porn party that we went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had a friend that we were doing </v>

1444
01:07:32.351 --> 01:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu with.</v>

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:37.630
<v Speaker 1>It was directing porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went to this porn party and we </v>

1446

<v Speaker 1>figured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this part is going to be crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be wild.</v>

1448
01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:43.100

<v Speaker 1>what it was was a screening.</v>

1449
01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>It was so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they were in a parking lot and</v>

1450
01:07:47.151 --> 01:07:51.910
<v Speaker 1>they had a projection screen up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall with strangers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so excited about this.</v>

1452

1454
01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.520
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who directed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's still a friend of mine,</v>

1455
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had decided that he was going to do </v>

1456
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>something that had never been done </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>

1660
01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:50.490
<v Speaker 4>it's just not apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it gets flagged a lot on a lively,</v>

1661
01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.240
<v Speaker 4>lively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like bring it on dude.</v>

1662
01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.380
<v Speaker 4>Someone's mom sees it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is you,</v>

1664
01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:02.370
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

1665
01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.210
<v Speaker 4>mothering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mothering.</v>

1666
01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:09.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were talking a lot about crazy </v>

1667
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:10.350
<v Speaker 4>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slightly over parenting.</v>

1668
01:19:10.351 --> 01:19:14.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he wasn't parents and this guy,</v>

1669
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.640
<v Speaker 4>this guy is getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was too much.</v>

1670
01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:20.150
<v Speaker 4>Maybe like rebellion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1671
01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.950
<v Speaker 4>Hates Mommy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if his mom finds out about this.</v>

1672
01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:28.650
<v Speaker 4>I think he lives at home still because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've studied the videos and it seems as</v>

1673
01:19:28.651 --> 01:19:33.651
<v Speaker 4>though these are like prior to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>location there was one that was just a </v>

1674
01:19:33.651 --> 01:19:38.001
<v Speaker 4>bedroom in a basement and I think he </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually did live with his folks and </v>

1675
01:19:38.001 --> 01:19:41.840
<v Speaker 4>we've deduced that this might be like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fetish thing because it's gluttony.</v>

1676
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:47.030
<v Speaker 4>And then farts and he won't answer any </v>
<v Speaker 4>other tweets that people just bombard </v>

1677
01:19:48.421 --> 01:19:53.421
<v Speaker 4>him with him because he put an email in </v>
<v Speaker 4>one and we will on our show where like </v>

1678
01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:53.670
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even unlike no response.</v>

1679
01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:55.290
<v Speaker 4>So if you could get to the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1680
01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.230
<v Speaker 4>we'd really appreciate it.</v>

1681
01:19:56.270 --> 01:20:01.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to because I'm terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One day he'll be in here in the morning </v>

1682
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:02.940
<v Speaker 4>and my fucking Ergonomic chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the family,</v>

1683
01:20:02.941 --> 01:20:07.050
<v Speaker 4>the family thing also is because on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christmas one you can tell it's a family</v>

1684
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:10.890
<v Speaker 4>and there's stockings up and he farts </v>
<v Speaker 4>and every stocking.</v>

1685
01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:17.380
<v Speaker 4>Then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you get from king as rip a </v>

1686
01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.690
<v Speaker 4>merry Christmas represents coast is </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably going to die.</v>

1687
01:20:20.701 --> 01:20:22.260
<v Speaker 4>Probably there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 4>his colon.</v>

1688
01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:27.420
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting theory too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people have also brought about the </v>

1689
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:31.050
<v Speaker 4>theory that he is doing that pushing air</v>
<v Speaker 4>in there,</v>

1690
01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:32.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>using.</v>

1691
01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.300
<v Speaker 4>It's cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's cheating.</v>

1692
01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:38.460
<v Speaker 4>Believe like filling himself with air </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then forgetting it because there's </v>

1693
01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:41.250
<v Speaker 4>no edits between each fart assumed that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he can't fart.</v>

1694
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:43.410
<v Speaker 4>Rapid fire that loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you'd.</v>

1695
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:46.230
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to be some sort of a bag of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wind,</v>

1696
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:51.290
<v Speaker 4>like a bad because sometimes I mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular fresh,</v>

1697
01:20:51.341 --> 01:20:54.010
<v Speaker 4>like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little farts.</v>

1698
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 4>Smell like sounded like last night I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought yesterday.</v>

1699
01:20:56.761 --> 01:20:57.720

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1700
01:20:57.721 --> 01:21:01.440
<v Speaker 4>when you stay away from seafood for </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile and then you reintroduce it,</v>

1701
01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.390
<v Speaker 4>there's bacteria in like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1702
01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:08.200
<v Speaker 4>it's different in shellfish and Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought when I,</v>

1703
01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:13.230
<v Speaker 4>yesterday when I farted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounded like somebody was throwing </v>

1704
01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:13.230
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sounded like a guy going,</v>

1733

<v Speaker 4>next level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1734
01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.740
<v Speaker 4>what is it about farts?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're so hilarious.</v>

1735
01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:53.740
<v Speaker 4>They're never not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're never not entertaining because </v>

1736
01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.631
<v Speaker 4>there are so taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to do them in front of </v>

1737
01:22:56.631 --> 01:22:56.631
<v Speaker 4>strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The smell,</v>

1738
01:22:56.631 --> 01:23:00.350
<v Speaker 4>the sound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything about it and the pain.</v>

1739
01:23:00.970 --> 01:23:03.210
<v Speaker 4>The people that love them versus don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>like it.</v>

1740
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I think those are all rooted in if your </v>
<v Speaker 4>house</v>

1741
01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 1>was okay with or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had none growing up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So we loved farts and poopies parts.</v>

1743
01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Was it talked about in your house,</v>

1745
01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:21.460
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My house was lacking in any sense of </v>

1746
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:21.460
<v Speaker 1>humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1747
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one was funny.</v>

1748
01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:25.210
<v Speaker 1>No one knows funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one had any.</v>

1749
01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was like,</v>

1750
01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.070
<v Speaker 1>don't be a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop being a loser,</v>

1751
01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.390
<v Speaker 1>a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always,</v>

1752
01:23:31.391 --> 01:23:33.660
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your grades suck.</v>

1753
01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:38.670
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be skewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still coughing from the sublime </v>

1754
01:23:38.670 --> 01:23:39.080
<v Speaker 1>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1755
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I literally almost threw up when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>

1756
01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:44.440
<v Speaker 1>when he was eating the hotdogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs and sausage and the gravy,</v>

1757
01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:47.350
<v Speaker 1>like saliva was coming to the surface in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my throat.</v>

1758
01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm dealing with sometimes he farts </v>
<v Speaker 1>on what he's going to.</v>

1759
01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.600
<v Speaker 4>He's like five little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Debbie's 12 of them and then you're </v>

1760
01:24:05.511 --> 01:24:05.970
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright.</v>

1761
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:09.810
<v Speaker 4>And he turns around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like mo foreign on him and he hates</v>

1762
01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:14.880
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got to be eating some of his own </v>

1763
01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:15.540
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1764
01:24:15.710 --> 01:24:18.740
<v Speaker 4>The first video where he gets up bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>IFC and dips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every fried piece in Mayo.</v>

1766
01:24:22.670 --> 01:24:27.670
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's that guy that's so crazy is</v>

1767
01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:44.310
<v Speaker 1>all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All wrong in every way.</v>

1768
01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I do kind of look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a time where our listeners </v>

1769
01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:50.010
<v Speaker 1>thought that I might get this away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him James.</v>

1770
01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I was literally almost threw up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a,</v>

1771
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:57.100
<v Speaker 1>there is one we want to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1772
01:24:57.101 --> 01:24:58.630
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing gross about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>description,</v>

1773
01:24:58.631 --> 01:25:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but one time because he's a good eater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1774
01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I got eight sausage and egg mcmuffin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's.</v>

1775
01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.090
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's tallying it.</v>

1776
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:15.260
<v Speaker 1>He's like diesel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>250 calories and then I got a egg and </v>

1777
01:25:16.271 --> 01:25:18.670
<v Speaker 1>cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred calories.</v>

1778
01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Nine of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do the math because he wants you to </v>

1779
01:25:25.481 --> 01:25:28.650
<v Speaker 1>know how many calories he's eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not that fat.</v>

1780
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:30.700
<v Speaker 1>It just know God is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God on him.</v>

1781
01:25:30.701 --> 01:25:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he's.</v>

1782
01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.880
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ralphie may thing going on remarkably </v>

1783
01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:36.880
<v Speaker 1>obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That guy lives his life like absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit every day and I'm fatter than him,</v>

1785
01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:45.970
<v Speaker 1>but he definitely does not give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

1786
01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:48.910
<v Speaker 1>He's not that attache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you think that's an act?</v>

<v Speaker 4>going over the data?</v>

1791
01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 4>The footage for about a year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably a long</v>

1792
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.370
<v Speaker 1>time with King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He claims to be in Michigan by the way,</v>

1793
01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.420
<v Speaker 1>a to be a Michigan guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have you been doing this?</v>

1794
01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:13.890
<v Speaker 1>A few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think he tentatively dipping </v>

1795
01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:17.920

<v Speaker 1>or did he just fucking decide he's the </v>

1796
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.490
<v Speaker 1>king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls himself.</v>

1797
01:26:19.491 --> 01:26:21.680
<v Speaker 1>He's the king from the jump though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1798
01:26:21.681 --> 01:26:25.310
<v Speaker 1>did you go back to the library earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos where he's like,</v>

01:26:32.671 --> 01:26:34.870
<v Speaker 1>He shows his face too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't.</v>

1803
01:26:35.410 --> 01:26:38.100
<v Speaker 1>He gets recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1804
01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.240

<v Speaker 1>like one day he's at golden corral and </v>

<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black community did not abandoned </v>

1886
01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.880

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Who likes to be shit on specifically was</v>
<v Speaker 1>always a talk about Sylvester stallone.</v>

1908
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:34.350
<v Speaker 1>You still like to climb under tables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear glass tables and watch girls shit.</v>

1909
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:36.750

<v Speaker 1>That could be just someone makes it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1911

<v Speaker 1>It's like the Richard Gere durable </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1912
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I would not be surprised if Richard Gere</v>
<v Speaker 1>has never had a dribble up his ass.</v>

1913
01:31:45.170 --> 01:31:47.430

<v Speaker 1>I definitely heard that story before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet two,</v>

1915
01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:56.370
<v Speaker 1>which is the crazy thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it took off without somebody sending</v>

1916
01:31:56.371 --> 01:31:58.800
<v Speaker 1>an email or allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>

1917
01:31:58.830 --> 01:32:00.940

<v Speaker 1>scientology thing.</v>

1918
01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:03.730

1921
01:32:06.641 --> 01:32:11.641
<v Speaker 1>left the organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he left and then they spread that </v>

1922
01:32:11.641 --> 01:32:11.641
<v Speaker 1>rumor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>at least I noticed when it was first </v>
<v Speaker 1>going up the cosby scandal.</v>

1929
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:30.260

1930
01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:32.800
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their defense,</v>

1931
01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:37.920
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at it from the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of someone who looks towards black </v>

1932
01:32:38.081 --> 01:32:43.081
<v Speaker 1>heroes and icons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a few hundred percent get a </v>

<v Speaker 1>these white bitches trying to take down </v>
<v Speaker 1>our man.</v>

1936
01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.750
<v Speaker 1>That's how they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it was perceived.</v>

1937
01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.320
<v Speaker 1>That totally got that integrity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>few heroes you have.</v>

1938
01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:58.380
<v Speaker 1>But he was the most celebrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cross over just a revered older </v>

1939
01:32:59.171 --> 01:33:01.540
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lovable father figure.</v>

1940
01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:04.000
<v Speaker 1>So it was like you're talking shit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1941
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:06.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like you were talking shit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's grandfather,</v>

1942
01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.630
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1943
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1944
01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:12.970
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird to think that all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1945
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.750
<v Speaker 1>like some people knew and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1946
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.190
<v Speaker 1>shh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shh.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1948
01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:20.800

01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we know what the numbers are?</v>

1950
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.270

1951
01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Is it more than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ?</v>

1952
01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the alleged the alleged </v>

1953
01:33:32.970 --> 01:33:33.970
<v Speaker 1>incidents or are up in the high forties </v>

<v Speaker 1>about their dicks.</v>

1990
01:35:24.111 --> 01:35:29.111
<v Speaker 1>You don't trust people that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you the truth about how they feel </v>

1991

1995
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:42.560
<v Speaker 1>eastern blocking and that's how we </v>

2032
01:37:12.881 --> 01:37:15.320
<v Speaker 1>same thing with Dave Grohl.</v>

<v Speaker 1>at coming up.</v>

2038
01:37:34.690 --> 01:37:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really great.</v>

2039
01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.470
<v Speaker 1>He went to all these different cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:43.330
<v Speaker 1>DC and Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York and all these cities along the </v>

2041
01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:44.270
<v Speaker 1>way at every episode was focused on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday and then people were like,</v>

2042
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:47.200
<v Speaker 1>how come you didn't have more women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2043
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.980
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2044
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:50.050
<v Speaker 1>more diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

2045
01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a show about what influenced me </v>

2046
01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:55.410
<v Speaker 1>where you grew up around white male </v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians.</v>

2047
01:37:55.411 --> 01:37:56.340
<v Speaker 1>That was his era.</v>

2048
01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.230
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>

2049
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:59.580
<v Speaker 6>And he did have women on there.</v>

2050
01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:02.200
<v Speaker 5>Not Enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2051
01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.220
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told you I've been getting a hard time</v>

2052
01:38:04.221 --> 01:38:09.221
<v Speaker 5>about not having enough black friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have a boards next week </v>

2053
01:38:09.221 --> 01:38:13.540
<v Speaker 5>show everybody about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're not on the show on the </v>

2054
01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:13.540
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>

2055
01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I find,</v>

2056
01:38:14.481 --> 01:38:19.481
<v Speaker 6>and I think it's upsetting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you see that thing and Rola heat by </v>

2057
01:38:19.481 --> 01:38:22.050
<v Speaker 6>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>take one email.</v>

2058
01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:28.170
<v Speaker 6>There was some interview I read online </v>
<v Speaker 6>where he said that there's so much </v>

2059
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:28.810
<v Speaker 6>censorship now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

2060
01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:31.580
<v Speaker 6>the Huffington post has succeeded in </v>
<v Speaker 6>silencing.</v>

2061
01:38:31.581 --> 01:38:36.581
<v Speaker 6>The comedians were also afraid of saying</v>
<v Speaker 6>anything because we're afraid of being </v>

2062
01:38:36.581 --> 01:38:38.270
<v Speaker 6>called a homophobe or a racist or this </v>
<v Speaker 6>or that.</v>

2063
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:41.150
<v Speaker 6>And I think there's some validity to </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2064
01:38:41.151 --> 01:38:44.090
<v Speaker 6>Especially with like Caitlyn Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like on our show,</v>

2065
01:38:44.091 --> 01:38:44.830

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2066
01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.520
<v Speaker 6>we're just talking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2067
01:38:46.521 --> 01:38:49.510
<v Speaker 6>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're not a pc show and the,</v>

2068
01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.370
<v Speaker 6>the emails,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh don't you dare and Blah Blah Blah.</v>

2069
01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:54.470
<v Speaker 6>How can you be so insensitive?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's like,</v>

2070
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:59.590
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Something can happen in the world and </v>

2071
01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:00.520
<v Speaker 6>why can't I have fucked up feelings?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I want?</v>

2072
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:04.180
<v Speaker 6>Why do I have to be on board with the PC</v>
<v Speaker 6>agenda straightaway?</v>

2073
01:39:04.210 --> 01:39:05.510
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm all for her.</v>

2074
01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:07.910
<v Speaker 6>Please don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mazal Tov.</v>

2075
01:39:07.911 --> 01:39:10.970
<v Speaker 6>Do what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but how come you know what I mean?</v>

2076
01:39:10.971 --> 01:39:12.470
<v Speaker 6>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we should also have somebody for</v>

2077
01:39:12.471 --> 01:39:17.471
<v Speaker 6>people maybe of a different generation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think my dad gives a fuck about </v>

2078
01:39:17.471 --> 01:39:18.530
<v Speaker 6>Caitlyn Jenner and is going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sympathetic.</v>

2079
01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.530
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a theory about all this.</v>

2080
01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:25.800
<v Speaker 5>I have a theory about all this like </v>
<v Speaker 5>ultra sensitivity and ultra progressive </v>

2081
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.930
<v Speaker 5>thinking and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2082
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:32.090
<v Speaker 5>I feel like all of this stuff is very </v>
<v Speaker 5>good and it's even though it kind of is </v>

2083
01:39:32.501 --> 01:39:37.501
<v Speaker 5>against what I do for living as someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>who talks a lot of shit about </v>

2084
01:39:37.501 --> 01:39:41.190
<v Speaker 5>controversial issues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that what it is is blowback </v>

2085
01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:46.080
<v Speaker 5>against racism or sexism or homophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just gone so far the other way that</v>

2086
01:39:48.461 --> 01:39:52.000
<v Speaker 5>it's become preposterous and then it'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>bounce out somewhere in the middle.</v>

2087
01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.800
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been making fun of this whole </v>

2088
01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:59.800
<v Speaker 5>Caitlin Jenner thing onstage and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to reveal how I do it,</v>

2089
01:39:59.801 --> 01:40:03.070
<v Speaker 5>but in the way that I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I get people cheering.</v>

2090
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:07.240
<v Speaker 5>People have been cheering what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying and it's not negative.</v>

2091
01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.280
<v Speaker 5>It's not anti transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like.</v>

2092
01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:14.570
<v Speaker 5>But I think we have to remember who the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck this guy was and who he was living </v>

2093
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:16.750
<v Speaker 5>with and what he was doing for the last </v>
<v Speaker 5>20 fucking years.</v>

2094
01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:17.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2095
01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:18.700
<v Speaker 5>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop with a.</v>

2096
01:40:18.850 --> 01:40:21.220
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter if you are secretly a </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman.</v>

2097
01:40:21.250 --> 01:40:25.660
<v Speaker 5>What kind of a woman were you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A dumb cunt I secretly had dumped.</v>

2098
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:28.270
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because that's what I'm hearing.</v>

2099
01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.940
<v Speaker 5>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what you're doing.</v>

2100
01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:34.240
<v Speaker 5>You're still the same nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Talking materialistic.</v>

2101
01:40:35.410 --> 01:40:37.780
<v Speaker 5>Now you're changing your gender maniacs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2102
01:40:37.930 --> 01:40:40.900
<v Speaker 5>because just simply by changing your </v>
<v Speaker 5>gender,</v>

2103
01:40:41.290 --> 01:40:45.100
<v Speaker 5>I want it so that it's irrelevant so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you change your gender.</v>

2104
01:40:45.101 --> 01:40:47.720
<v Speaker 5>Have left or right back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go Mail,</v>

2105
01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:49.030
<v Speaker 5>go female,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go back and forth.</v>

2106
01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:52.930
<v Speaker 5>What is the quality of what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are your thoughts?</v>

2107
01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:58.020
<v Speaker 5>Who are you when you express yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because what I get out of you is </v>

2108
01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:01.510
<v Speaker 5>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not a single interesting thing all about</v>

2109
01:41:01.511 --> 01:41:02.020
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

2112
01:41:03.761 --> 01:41:04.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm in this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a dad,</v>

<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

2116
01:41:06.611 --> 01:41:06.910

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2118
01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:11.620
<v Speaker 5>and this is one of the best ways to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention.</v>

2119
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:14.170
<v Speaker 5>How about the fact that he goes from </v>
<v Speaker 5>being on that show?</v>

2120
01:41:14.171 --> 01:41:16.960
<v Speaker 5>I want to be him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to be referred to as a he.</v>

2121
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:22.140
<v Speaker 5>I want people still call me bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the the 17 million people watching </v>

2122
01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:26.731
<v Speaker 5>that show then immediately afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets massive facial reconstructive </v>

2123
01:41:26.731 --> 01:41:28.270
<v Speaker 5>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes a woman,</v>

2124
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:30.610
<v Speaker 5>does this vanity fair thing and what is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

2125
01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:35.640
<v Speaker 5>What is the number one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the number one thing that's </v>

2126
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:35.640
<v Speaker 5>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Attention,</v>

2127
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:40.380
<v Speaker 5>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the factor in all of this is a </v>

2128
01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:43.220
<v Speaker 5>tension completely ignoring everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Completely ignoring the fact this </v>

2129
01:41:43.391 --> 01:41:47.230
<v Speaker 5>fucking dummy killed somebody by not </v>
<v Speaker 5>paying attention in his car,</v>

2130
01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:51.490
<v Speaker 5>slammed into a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a real woman pushed her into traffic.</v>

2131
01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.760
<v Speaker 5>She got head on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>collided with a fucking Hummer of all </v>

2132
01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:00.001
<v Speaker 5>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get a hit with a God damn fake </v>

2133
01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:00.001
<v Speaker 5>military vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2134
01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:01.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everyone is just sort of pushed that</v>

2135
01:42:01.421 --> 01:42:06.421
<v Speaker 5>aside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's important is we recognize gender </v>

2136
01:42:06.421 --> 01:42:07.750
<v Speaker 5>and gender is a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a dummy.</v>

2137
01:42:07.770 --> 01:42:09.790
<v Speaker 5>It's a dummy dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dummy.</v>

2138
01:42:09.791 --> 01:42:12.010
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's a male dummy or a female </v>
<v Speaker 5>dummy.</v>

2139
01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:17.060
<v Speaker 5>It's a dummy that doesn't pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 5>and slams into your car from behind and </v>

2140
01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:18.420
<v Speaker 5>pushes you into fucking traffic that no </v>
<v Speaker 5>one's talking about.</v>

2141
01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:21.400
<v Speaker 5>No one's talking about that and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened like a month before.</v>

2142
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:26.430
<v Speaker 5>There's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All we're hearing is the woes of being </v>

2143
01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:29.320
<v Speaker 5>transgender and absolutely I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>God damn it mean if you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe.</v>

2148
01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:40.870
<v Speaker 5>If you look at someone like her and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't say,</v>

2149
01:42:40.871 --> 01:42:43.090

<v Speaker 5>that probably is someone who was born in</v>

2150
01:42:43.091 --> 01:42:43.990
<v Speaker 5>the wrong sex.</v>

2156
01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:55.160

<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But she's interesting.</v>

2162
01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.960
<v Speaker 5>She was on Opie and Anthony and she was </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about,</v>

2163
01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:07.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being born transgender and all the </v>

2164
01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:08.851
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with like a different </v>

2165
01:43:08.851 --> 01:43:10.441
<v Speaker 5>quality of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a different quality of human beings who </v>

2166
01:43:10.441 --> 01:43:13.010
<v Speaker 5>just also happens to be transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I had a um,</v>

2167

2168
01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.040
<v Speaker 5>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

2169
01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:23.100
<v Speaker 5>a guy who was born,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a woman who really didn't feel like </v>

2170
01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:27.480
<v Speaker 5>taking risks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that guy does pornography and is </v>

2171
01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:30.841
<v Speaker 5>really out there talking about heroic </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of glass without having balls.</v>

2172
01:43:33.370 --> 01:43:34.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean for real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2173
01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:37.090
<v Speaker 5>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the quality of the human being.</v>

2174
01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:38.790
<v Speaker 5>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you do?</v>

2175
01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:44.040
<v Speaker 5>What's going on inside your head as </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposed to this nonsense existence that </v>

2176
01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.040
<v Speaker 5>you've carved out for yourself?</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't have to make a joke about that.</v>

2190

<v Speaker 3>Like people jokes may want to be pc.</v>

2193
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:36.740
<v Speaker 3>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fake opinion.</v>

2194
01:44:37.050 --> 01:44:42.050
<v Speaker 3>You don't think it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think it's weird that it's 65 </v>

2195
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.050
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

2196
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:43.740
<v Speaker 3>You started to get a boob job and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing looked.</v>

2197
01:44:43.741 --> 01:44:48.741
<v Speaker 3>This weird thing of substance has come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of that stupid clan and the other </v>

2198
01:44:49.311 --> 01:44:54.311
<v Speaker 3>thing is I feel like now the blowback is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people will criticize you and be </v>

2199
01:44:55.701 --> 01:45:00.701
<v Speaker 3>really mean about it if you don't react </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they want you to react to any </v>

2200
01:45:02.690 --> 01:45:04.430
<v Speaker 3>news that comes forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

2201
01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:09.460
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now the lynching has done to the </v>

2202
01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:10.450
<v Speaker 3>person who goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit or,</v>

2203
01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 3>or that's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

2204
01:45:12.850 --> 01:45:14.870
<v Speaker 3>So now you're not allowed to react to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2205
01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:22.040
<v Speaker 3>You can't be confused about it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>curious or maybe I'm scared.</v>

2207
01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:27.041
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this is a new thing about the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's terrifying to see a </v>

2208
01:45:27.041 --> 01:45:30.761
<v Speaker 3>transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to live on Man's field </v>

<v Speaker 3>Jenner.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of memories because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't care if you're a man or a woman.</v>

2231
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:33.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't really care if you didn't do I </v>
<v Speaker 3>judge you based on who you are as a </v>

2232
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:34.610
<v Speaker 3>human being and this bouncing back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're the greatest athlete</v>

2241
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At one point in time.</v>

2242
01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:57.340
<v Speaker 5>It was one of the baddest motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever to do some shit that nobody does </v>

2243
01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:01.700
<v Speaker 5>really gets me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets my asshole twisted is when they do </v>

2244
01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:03.640
<v Speaker 5>come back to the Canadians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2245
01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.970
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

2246
01:47:05.971 --> 01:47:10.971
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when in the history of ever has a comic </v>

2247
01:47:10.971 --> 01:47:12.540
<v Speaker 5>advocated hate speech or violence </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards.</v>

2248
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:14.830
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that they fake that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2249
01:47:14.831 --> 01:47:19.831
<v Speaker 5>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a debate that Jim Norton got </v>

2250
01:47:19.831 --> 01:47:22.581
<v Speaker 5>in with this woman was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>rape jokes and comics qb on stage </v>

2251
01:47:22.581 --> 01:47:23.160
<v Speaker 5>talking about rape and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheering.</v>

2252
01:47:23.161 --> 01:47:23.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2253
01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:25.290
<v Speaker 5>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one is.</v>

2254
01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:27.120
<v Speaker 5>No one does that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not true.</v>

2255
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:30.240
<v Speaker 5>The only time a joke like you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about like bad comedy,</v>

2256
01:47:30.241 --> 01:47:35.241
<v Speaker 5>maybe some would say a bad rape joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only time someone tells a joke and </v>

2257
01:47:35.241 --> 01:47:37.560
<v Speaker 5>the word rape is involved as if it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>

2258
01:47:37.561 --> 01:47:42.561
<v Speaker 5>If rape is involved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the idea that rape could never be </v>

2259
01:47:42.561 --> 01:47:42.561
<v Speaker 5>funny.</v>

2260
01:47:42.561 --> 01:47:43.460
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not true.</v>

2261
01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.160
<v Speaker 5>Things that unfortunately are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This conversation we'll definitely get </v>

2262
01:47:49.201 --> 01:47:54.201
<v Speaker 5>misinterpreted because good he perfect </v>
<v Speaker 5>people because people don't listen like </v>

2263
01:47:54.871 --> 01:47:55.530
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

2264
01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:57.630
<v Speaker 5>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll hear what they want to hear.</v>

2265
01:47:57.810 --> 01:48:02.810
<v Speaker 5>They won't hear the fact that like </v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody here is unaccepting or uncaring </v>

2266
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:06.600
<v Speaker 5>or advocating that somebody doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 5>a right to anything or hatred.</v>

2267
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:11.870
<v Speaker 5>They're just gonna hear what they want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to hear in that and not allow you to </v>

2268
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880
<v Speaker 5>have a different opinion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2269
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:13.680
<v Speaker 5>And I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like I said,</v>

2270
01:48:13.681 --> 01:48:17.340
<v Speaker 5>I think that all of this is good and </v>
<v Speaker 5>even this extreme pc,</v>

2271
01:48:17.370 --> 01:48:22.370
<v Speaker 5>because it's better than the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the opposite is like being a fucking </v>

2272
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:25.461
<v Speaker 5>Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The opposite is like killing people </v>

2273
01:48:25.461 --> 01:48:25.461
<v Speaker 5>because they're Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The opposite is,</v>

2274
01:48:25.461 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is instead of being super sensitive is </v>

2275
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:32.961
<v Speaker 5>being completely insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think ultimately like it's just </v>

2276
01:48:32.961 --> 01:48:34.440
<v Speaker 5>swinging one way and I think what we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>dealing with also,</v>

2277
01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:36.290
<v Speaker 5>and this is the weird aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all,</v>

2278
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:37.080
<v Speaker 5>we all agree on this.</v>

2279
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:42.470
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of people that if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't think the way they think they're </v>

2280
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:43.700
<v Speaker 5>fucking super mean to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that yeah.</v>

2281
01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:48.740
<v Speaker 5>So those are like people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be progressive and kind and </v>

2282
01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:49.530
<v Speaker 5>sensitive and less that you disagree </v>
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>

2283
01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:54.540
<v Speaker 5>Then they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they're nasty and you see it in </v>

2284
01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:54.540
<v Speaker 5>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times among comedians were like</v>

2285
01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:58.750
<v Speaker 5>the most progressive thinkers and ended </v>
<v Speaker 5>up being like super bowl sometimes.</v>

2286
01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.630
<v Speaker 5>There's not really progressive thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were.</v>

2287
01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:04.190
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to do as they're mining </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world,</v>

2288
01:49:04.230 --> 01:49:09.230
<v Speaker 5>the world of ideas for love and </v>
<v Speaker 5>acceptance and the moral high ground </v>

2289
01:49:09.230 --> 01:49:13.800
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to find instead of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>having this like nuanced objective point</v>

2290
01:49:13.801 --> 01:49:14.940
<v Speaker 5>of view where they look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2291
01:49:14.941 --> 01:49:19.941
<v Speaker 5>let's imagine what it would be like to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be someone who wishes you were a woman.</v>

2292
01:49:20.101 --> 01:49:21.300
<v Speaker 5>When you're a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2293
01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.980
<v Speaker 5>I can totally see that conversation </v>
<v Speaker 5>being a fascinating conversation,</v>

2294
01:49:26.190 --> 01:49:29.760
<v Speaker 5>but if you immediately say to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2295
01:49:29.761 --> 01:49:33.060
<v Speaker 5>you have to call him a her now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2296
01:49:33.090 --> 01:49:35.310
<v Speaker 5>you have to refer to him as his new </v>
<v Speaker 5>name.</v>

2297
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to do this.</v>

2298
01:49:36.841 --> 01:49:37.440
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have the.</v>

2299
01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:40.230
<v Speaker 5>What about debate?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about discussion?</v>

2300
01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:42.450
<v Speaker 5>This is off discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is off the table.</v>

2301
01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:44.550
<v Speaker 5>Anything that's off the table is </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

2302
01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:46.720
<v Speaker 5>You can't make fun of his bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2303
01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would argue</v>

2304
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.980
<v Speaker 6>even it's more dehumanizing to not tell </v>
<v Speaker 6>jokes about Caitlyn Jenner because you </v>

2305
01:49:53.031 --> 01:49:54.600
<v Speaker 6>are in effect saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2306
01:49:54.601 --> 01:49:58.300
<v Speaker 6>I pity this creature so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't make fun of her.</v>

2307
01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 6>She can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're actually dehumanizing.</v>

2308
01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:06.560
<v Speaker 5>Seeing somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's starting to be super sensitive </v>

2309
01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.440
<v Speaker 5>customer visits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's time to embrace the new norm.</v>

2310
01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:11.070
<v Speaker 5>The new norm is we're not going to eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat and we're not going to lift weights</v>

2311
01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:14.040
<v Speaker 5>and we're not going to be aggressive and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kumbaya</v>

2312
01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.390
<v Speaker 6>bullying too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've solved that problem.</v>

2313
01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:18.790
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we just keep talking about it because</v>

2314
01:50:18.791 --> 01:50:23.791
<v Speaker 6>my friend teaches in New York and she </v>
<v Speaker 6>said they give the kids the riot act on </v>

2315
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:27.080
<v Speaker 6>bullying and school and then micro </v>
<v Speaker 6>aggressions.</v>

2316
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.640
<v Speaker 6>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2317
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:33.900
<v Speaker 6>But then they get online,</v>
<v Speaker 6>passive aggressive and then they go </v>

2318
01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:34.370
<v Speaker 6>online and they cyberbully this shit out</v>
<v Speaker 6>of each.</v>

2319
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.020
<v Speaker 6>It has to come out somewhere.</v>

2320
01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:38.230
<v Speaker 5>Come out somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2321
01:50:38.231 --> 01:50:43.231
<v Speaker 5>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bullying is negative and horrible as it </v>

2322
01:50:43.231 --> 01:50:46.261
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as caused a lot of people to develop an </v>

2323
01:50:46.261 --> 01:50:48.940
<v Speaker 5>idea of themselves that's rock solid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2324
01:50:48.941 --> 01:50:49.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

2325
01:50:49.901 --> 01:50:51.640
<v Speaker 5>I know what I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

2326
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:56.790
<v Speaker 5>And then they go on and they do their </v>
<v Speaker 5>own thing and then they become </v>

2327
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.790
<v Speaker 5>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2328
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:57.800
<v Speaker 5>By doing that it becomes motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2329
01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:02.960
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Chris Rock has a bit about Bill </v>

2330
01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:02.960
<v Speaker 5>Gates and that if you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullies,</v>

2331
01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:04.170
<v Speaker 5>you don't get guys like Bill Gates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2332
01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.420
<v Speaker 5>because those guys get bullied and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>run off and start giant businesses.</v>

2333
01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:12.340
<v Speaker 5>There's some validity to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was bullied when I was young.</v>

2334
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:17.880
<v Speaker 5>It made me do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It made me fucking learn how to kick </v>

2335
01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:17.880
<v Speaker 5>people's asses like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2336
01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 5>Both things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2337
01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:23.700
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it made me go into martial arts is </v>

2338
01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:23.700
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want anybody to beat me up.</v>

2339
01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:24.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm scared all the time,</v>

2340
01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:25.720
<v Speaker 5>so what do I need to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2341
01:51:25.721 --> 01:51:27.160
<v Speaker 5>if I didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have never went.</v>

2342
01:51:27.161 --> 01:51:32.161
<v Speaker 5>If someone didn't fuck with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would've never went into my bullying </v>

2343
01:51:32.161 --> 01:51:35.431
<v Speaker 5>was very mild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was mostly like fear and </v>

2344
01:51:35.431 --> 01:51:37.321
<v Speaker 5>intimidation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was anybody actually physically </v>

2345
01:51:37.321 --> 01:51:39.721
<v Speaker 5>hurting me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it made me go into martial arts and </v>

2346
01:51:39.721 --> 01:51:40.860
<v Speaker 5>if I didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck knows what kind of a person</v>

2347
01:51:40.861 --> 01:51:43.870
<v Speaker 5>I would have been if I didn't go through</v>
<v Speaker 5>those challenges and the all the,</v>

2348
01:51:43.871 --> 01:51:45.880
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the difficulties of martial arts.</v>

2349
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:47.920
<v Speaker 5>I would never be the same person I am </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

2350
01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:49.450
<v Speaker 5>Fear is a great motivator,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2351
01:51:49.451 --> 01:51:51.910
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember anxiety of the best.</v>

2352
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:57.270
<v Speaker 5>They bused in a bunch of kids in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>school from bad neighborhoods and I'm </v>

2353
01:51:57.330 --> 01:52:02.330
<v Speaker 5>fucking scared of all of them and people</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting beat up and fucking terrified </v>

2354
01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:07.201
<v Speaker 5>and this one kid got me a headlock and </v>
<v Speaker 5>threw me on the ground and the locker </v>

2355
01:52:07.201 --> 01:52:07.201
<v Speaker 5>room and I was like 14.</v>

2356
01:52:07.201 --> 01:52:08.050
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't do anything to them.</v>

2357
01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.150
<v Speaker 5>It was just so much stronger than me and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2358
01:52:10.151 --> 01:52:12.040
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to learn how to fight,</v>

2359
01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:14.950
<v Speaker 5>and I remember thinking that like God </v>
<v Speaker 5>damn it,</v>

2360
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:17.050
<v Speaker 5>like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm terrified all the time.</v>

2361
01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:18.710
<v Speaker 5>Like where is that guy over there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2362
01:52:18.711 --> 01:52:20.740
<v Speaker 5>I've got to go around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that feeling,</v>

2363
01:52:21.550 --> 01:52:26.550
<v Speaker 5>but that's doesn't new schools all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time and that fear was really prevalent </v>

2364
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:29.620
<v Speaker 5>for a lot of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go back now and look at those.</v>

2365
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:32.470
<v Speaker 5>Those are like formative moments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hundred percent.</v>

2366
01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:37.500
<v Speaker 5>You understand human interaction and </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology and a very deep way because </v>

2367
01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:41.650
<v Speaker 5>you understand the worst aspects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not good that those aspects exists,</v>

2368
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:44.740
<v Speaker 5>but those aspects exists in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They exist in.</v>

2369
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:48.260
<v Speaker 5>I have chickens and the the term pecking</v>
<v Speaker 5>order.</v>

2370
01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:53.440
<v Speaker 5>The reason why that that term exists </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they fucking pack out each </v>

2371
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:53.440
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

2372
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:57.080
<v Speaker 5>They find out who's the baddest chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They and by the way it goes,</v>

2373
01:52:57.140 --> 01:53:01.820
<v Speaker 5>it changes like the pecking order </v>
<v Speaker 5>changes like chickens become brooders,</v>

2374
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:03.770
<v Speaker 5>which means like when they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2375
01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.080
<v Speaker 5>for some reason they decide that this </v>
<v Speaker 5>egg,</v>

2376
01:53:06.081 --> 01:53:08.480
<v Speaker 5>even though there's no rooster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a bunch of lesbians,</v>

2377
01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:12.410
<v Speaker 5>they decided that this egg is going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>become a bird,</v>

2378
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:17.620
<v Speaker 5>so they sit on the egg and then they get</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy and they pull their feathers off </v>

2379
01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:21.191
<v Speaker 5>and it's like a long cycle for them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out this egg is never going to </v>

2380
01:53:21.191 --> 01:53:25.211
<v Speaker 5>become.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of sad that this egg is never </v>

2381
01:53:25.211 --> 01:53:27.341
<v Speaker 5>actually going to become a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're little tiny reptile brains just </v>

2382
01:53:27.341 --> 01:53:30.761
<v Speaker 5>don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have to take them out of there </v>

2383
01:53:30.761 --> 01:53:30.761
<v Speaker 5>brooding stage and what you do is you </v>
<v Speaker 5>put them,</v>

2384
01:53:30.761 --> 01:53:35.591
<v Speaker 5>you isolate them in a small cage for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of days and you put them where </v>

2385
01:53:35.591 --> 01:53:37.520
<v Speaker 5>they have to rest on the pole.</v>

2386
01:53:37.670 --> 01:53:39.500
<v Speaker 5>They have to stand on the pole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is how they sleep anyway.</v>

2387
01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:42.440
<v Speaker 5>The rest on like a little bar or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

2388
01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:44.700
<v Speaker 5>That's just their words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2389
01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:49.720
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you take them out and you </v>

2390
01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:52.361
<v Speaker 5>reintroduce them to the population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the other chickens stopped fucking </v>

2391
01:53:52.361 --> 01:53:55.001
<v Speaker 5>with them and just what animals do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how they motivate animals to not </v>

2392
01:53:55.881 --> 01:53:59.000
<v Speaker 5>just be lazy fucks and sit around doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>

2393
01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:00.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's unfortunate.</v>

2394
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:02.330
<v Speaker 5>It feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sad,</v>

2395
01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:07.600
<v Speaker 5>but it's because why is it because </v>
<v Speaker 5>because chickens have and become </v>

2396
01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:07.850
<v Speaker 5>dolphins yet it's because chickens </v>
<v Speaker 5>haven't become aliens.</v>

2397
01:54:07.851 --> 01:54:12.851
<v Speaker 5>They haven't evolved to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can read minds and fly through </v>

2398
01:54:12.851 --> 01:54:12.851
<v Speaker 5>space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just chicken,</v>

2399
01:54:12.851 --> 01:54:14.900
<v Speaker 5>this chicken fucking chickens and when </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other chicken gets out of the box,</v>

2400
01:54:14.901 --> 01:54:18.500
<v Speaker 5>you pick that fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just that's what happens.</v>

2401
01:54:18.570 --> 01:54:23.570
<v Speaker 5>We were watching the thing on gorillas </v>
<v Speaker 5>and how that order so sophisticated.</v>

2402
01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:29.100
<v Speaker 5>It's so sophisticated and different from</v>
<v Speaker 5>our society and there's a definite like </v>

2403
01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:33.521
<v Speaker 5>there's a top dog and there's major like</v>
<v Speaker 5>stepping up and finding out that you're </v>

2404
01:54:33.521 --> 01:54:36.670
<v Speaker 5>not and then those guys do not fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy for awhile.</v>

2405
01:54:37.150 --> 01:54:39.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Primate psychology.</v>

2406
01:54:39.681 --> 01:54:44.681
<v Speaker 5>It's very applicable to human beings and</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of ways obviously we'd like to </v>

2407
01:54:44.681 --> 01:54:48.731
<v Speaker 5>transcend that and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 5>motivation and transcend that is the </v>

2408
01:54:48.731 --> 01:54:50.240
<v Speaker 5>same motivation that leads people to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2409
01:54:50.241 --> 01:54:55.241
<v Speaker 5>to be more accepting and to be more open</v>
<v Speaker 5>minded when it comes to things like </v>

2410
01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:59.750
<v Speaker 5>racism or things like transgender rights</v>
<v Speaker 5>or gay rights or any of those things.</v>

2411
01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:01.850
<v Speaker 5>So ultimately I think these were all </v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

2412
01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:05.570
<v Speaker 5>It's all good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of fakers out there.</v>

2413
01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:10.720
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of like fake progressive </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinkers and fake sweet people that </v>

2414
01:55:11.061 --> 01:55:16.061
<v Speaker 5>really what they're doing is just </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking for an opportunity to be a cunt </v>

2415
01:55:16.061 --> 01:55:17.930
<v Speaker 5>and when they see that you're not going </v>
<v Speaker 5>along with the PC mindset,</v>

2416
01:55:18.110 --> 01:55:21.140
<v Speaker 5>there are super aggressive towards you </v>
<v Speaker 5>and when you see them,</v>

2417
01:55:21.141 --> 01:55:26.141
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times they have fucking dyed </v>
<v Speaker 5>blue hair and they're old morbidly obese</v>

2418
01:55:26.301 --> 01:55:27.560
<v Speaker 5>and they're all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2419
01:55:27.561 --> 01:55:28.640
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're.</v>

2420
01:55:28.641 --> 01:55:33.641
<v Speaker 5>You're getting angry about something to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take away from the fact that you're </v>

2421
01:55:33.641 --> 01:55:37.400
<v Speaker 5>neglecting your very physical body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're neglecting your life.</v>

2422
01:55:37.401 --> 01:55:42.401
<v Speaker 5>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're wallowing in some sort of </v>

2423
01:55:42.401 --> 01:55:42.780
<v Speaker 5>depression and all of your success.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

2424
01:55:42.781 --> 01:55:44.120

<v Speaker 1>not progressive thinking.</v>

<v Speaker 1>super alt rooms and then they actually </v>

<v Speaker 1>DV.</v>

2459
01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:32.060
<v Speaker 1>He wd v I think is what it is and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina and I.</v>

2460
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Michael Che,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Crawford,</v>

2461
01:57:33.751 --> 01:57:35.850
<v Speaker 1>and Jimmy Norton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

2462
01:57:36.450 --> 01:57:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds good.</v>

2463
01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Shawn just fly in early or do radio with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that morning.</v>

2464
01:57:41.101 --> 01:57:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Then we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2465
01:57:41.551 --> 01:57:45.000
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking warrior battling against </v>
<v Speaker 1>this pc mentality,</v>

2466
01:57:45.001 --> 01:57:48.180
<v Speaker 1>but he's also very open minded and super</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro tranny.</v>

2467
01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I got in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he loves them,</v>

2468
01:57:51.710 --> 01:57:56.490
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's worth noting in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion is that really I think all of</v>

2469
01:57:56.491 --> 01:57:59.130
<v Speaker 1>us are pro all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent still be pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These society evolving and have </v>

2471
01:58:04.690 --> 01:58:08.130
<v Speaker 1>contradictory or whatever conflicting </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings are on it.</v>

2472
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also like,</v>

2473
01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:14.660
<v Speaker 1>just because you don't like one man </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you hate all the men were </v>

2474
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:19.950
<v Speaker 1>just because you think one transgender </v>
<v Speaker 1>person is a fucking dumb ass doesn't </v>

2475
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:22.740
<v Speaker 1>mean you hate all of them or your trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>phobic.</v>

2479
01:58:30.751 --> 01:58:32.850
<v Speaker 1>became a woman for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't disclose it,</v>

2480
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:38.030
<v Speaker 1>was beating the shit out of these women </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the conversations that I had </v>

2481
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:38.030
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was hilarious,</v>

2482
01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the conversations was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious and this woman's</v>

2483
01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:43.300

<v Speaker 5>this super progressive woman with </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking pink hair and a big fat face.</v>

2486
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:53.910
<v Speaker 5>she was always a man and I said even </v>
<v Speaker 5>when she was always a woman rather,</v>

2487
01:58:54.370 --> 01:58:59.370
<v Speaker 5>and I said even when she was having sex </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a woman and got her pregnant and </v>

2488
01:58:59.370 --> 01:59:02.320
<v Speaker 5>had a kid and her response was even then</v>

01:59:04.241 --> 01:59:09.241
<v Speaker 5>We can't do this is your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking nonsense because you're </v>

2493
01:59:09.241 --> 01:59:12.211
<v Speaker 5>focused on sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not what this is about and not </v>

2494
01:59:12.211 --> 01:59:14.851
<v Speaker 5>only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about something in a way </v>

2495
01:59:14.851 --> 01:59:19.590
<v Speaker 5>where you completely eliminate the </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility that you might be dealing </v>

2496
01:59:19.590 --> 01:59:20.940
<v Speaker 5>with a crazy person like because because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's dealing,</v>

2497
01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:25.960
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 5>accepted thing where you have to put it </v>

2498
01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:29.731
<v Speaker 5>in a box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can never even consider the very </v>

2499
01:59:29.731 --> 01:59:32.320
<v Speaker 5>realistic possibility that you might be </v>
<v Speaker 5>dealing with someone who is not mentally</v>

2500
01:59:32.321 --> 01:59:32.710
<v Speaker 5>sane.</v>

2501
01:59:32.710 --> 01:59:33.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2502
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:38.430
<v Speaker 5>Not Healthy and it whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're transgender might be beside the </v>

2503
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.910
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2504
01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:42.730
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about someone who </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretended to be a natural born woman and</v>

2505
01:59:42.731 --> 01:59:47.731
<v Speaker 5>didn't disclose it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't disclose something that might be </v>

2506
01:59:47.731 --> 01:59:47.731
<v Speaker 5>pretty significant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talked about it,</v>

2507
01:59:47.731 --> 01:59:50.890
<v Speaker 5>that it was a medical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a medical issue,</v>

2508
01:59:50.891 --> 01:59:53.320
<v Speaker 5>medical issue that you have herpes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a medical issue.</v>

2509
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:59.020
<v Speaker 5>A gender issue is you have a man's bone </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure and you want to fight women.</v>

2510
01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:04.160
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's such a specific and unique case in </v>

2511
02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:07.240
<v Speaker 5>this specific case where a man was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

2512
02:00:07.290 --> 02:00:08.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a man.</v>

2513
02:00:08.351 --> 02:00:09.820
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was born in the wrong body.</v>

2514
02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:11.980
<v Speaker 5>Comes a woman which has every right to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

2515
02:00:12.190 --> 02:00:15.370
<v Speaker 5>but then with that man's frame in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands and stuff,</v>

2516
02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:17.470
<v Speaker 5>the fuck out of girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2517
02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:20.180
<v Speaker 5>and brags about it and gloats and mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

2518
02:00:20.410 --> 02:00:25.410
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of dark shit that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>attached to that that people were </v>

2519
02:00:25.410 --> 02:00:28.600
<v Speaker 5>conveniently ignoring because it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>fit their pc agenda.</v>

2520
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:30.250
<v Speaker 5>It didn't fit there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

2521
02:00:30.251 --> 02:00:35.251
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this weird fucking like angle that they </v>

2522
02:00:35.251 --> 02:00:36.790
<v Speaker 5>wanted to take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very specific angle.</v>

2523
02:00:36.850 --> 02:00:38.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2524
02:00:38.530 --> 02:00:39.880
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a bit.</v>

2525
02:00:39.881 --> 02:00:42.730
<v Speaker 5>It becomes one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 5>ultimately I think it's good.</v>

2526
02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:47.880
<v Speaker 5>I think that this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the push towards pc is move towards pc.</v>

2527
02:00:47.951 --> 02:00:48.900
<v Speaker 5>To me it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2528
02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:53.940
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it signifies that people are becoming </v>

2529
02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:53.940
<v Speaker 5>more sensitive</v>

2530
02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:55.140
<v Speaker 6>and I was thinking about this actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>last week.</v>

2531
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:59.730
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about the PC movement of the</v>

2532
02:00:59.731 --> 02:01:02.160
<v Speaker 6>nineties where we renamed everything and</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody.</v>

2533
02:01:02.161 --> 02:01:07.161
<v Speaker 6>Carlin had a great bit about this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not cripples their handicapable </v>

2534
02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:10.350
<v Speaker 6>people aren't shell shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have.</v>

2535
02:01:10.410 --> 02:01:14.250
<v Speaker 6>Ptsd is a syndrome where we soften the </v>
<v Speaker 6>language.</v>

2536
02:01:14.251 --> 02:01:19.251
<v Speaker 6>We changed the way we use language.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it really changed people's </v>

2537
02:01:19.251 --> 02:01:24.141
<v Speaker 6>minds?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Meaning do you think guys like our dads </v>

2538
02:01:24.141 --> 02:01:25.170
<v Speaker 6>age really changed the way they thought </v>
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

2539
02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:27.060
<v Speaker 6>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>women,</v>

2540
02:01:27.061 --> 02:01:32.061
<v Speaker 6>if they can't call them bitches or </v>
<v Speaker 6>broads or did it really changed how </v>

2541
02:01:32.061 --> 02:01:35.430
<v Speaker 6>people thought that changed?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably the people that were coming up.</v>

2542
02:01:35.431 --> 02:01:36.390
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but not the guy.</v>

2543
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:37.950
<v Speaker 6>Young people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean,</v>

2544
02:01:37.951 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 6>does it change the already</v>

2545
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>who grew up a certain way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

2546
02:01:42.591 --> 02:01:47.591
<v Speaker 1>I think they look at it like the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you talking about with that soft </v>

2547
02:01:47.591 --> 02:01:47.591
<v Speaker 1>language shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2548
02:01:47.591 --> 02:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I know that like my dad's generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2549
02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Your Dad's generation to people in power</v>
<v Speaker 1>still right there.</v>

2550
02:01:53.661 --> 02:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>They look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ptsd is like,</v>

2551
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2552
02:01:57.640 --> 02:01:58.990
<v Speaker 1>it's shell shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2553
02:01:59.050 --> 02:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2554
02:02:00.501 --> 02:02:05.501
<v Speaker 1>like PTSD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably no different between that and </v>

2555
02:02:05.501 --> 02:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>shell shocked in a lot of people's minds</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not,</v>

2556
02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily defining it in any </v>

2557
02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>different way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the word cripple a hard to hear if </v>

2558
02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>your kid has an issue right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your kid's handicap.</v>

2559
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't always that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just what we call them.</v>

2560
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt was doctors used to say cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>called people morons.</v>

2561
02:02:25.740 --> 02:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mongoloid idiots was what they would </v>

2562
02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>call people that were born with down </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndrome.</v>

2563
02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>They called the Mongoloid idiots when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would write that on the birth </v>

2564
02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2565
02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:36.560
<v Speaker 1>But that's what you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you knew.</v>

2566
02:02:36.561 --> 02:02:39.050
<v Speaker 1>It was just a word for something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant the same.</v>

2567
02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:41.390
<v Speaker 1>But do you think they reacted the same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you think they were like,</v>

2568
02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:46.720
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like didn't know what we know now and </v>

2569
02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.191
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the idea about this move </v>

2570
02:02:51.191 --> 02:02:53.771
<v Speaker 1>towards people being more sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like about the move </v>

2571
02:02:53.771 --> 02:02:57.161
<v Speaker 1>towards people will be more sensitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's forcing people to </v>

2572
02:02:57.161 --> 02:02:58.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe reconsider the way they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about things.</v>

2573
02:02:58.950 --> 02:03:00.740
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad thing.</v>

2574
02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I think too soft and the language also </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes the harshness of the thing like </v>

2575
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:10.661
<v Speaker 1>Carlin's point was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not shell shock is what it </v>

2576
02:03:10.661 --> 02:03:10.661
<v Speaker 1>sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shell shock,</v>

2577
02:03:10.661 --> 02:03:11.720
<v Speaker 1>the guy has been back from war.</v>

2578
02:03:11.970 --> 02:03:16.700
<v Speaker 1>The posttraumatic stress disorder takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Zang,</v>

2579
02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>the actual gravity and maybe if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>called it something more aggressive </v>

2580
02:03:21.850 --> 02:03:23.810
<v Speaker 1>because it is horrible to have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2581
02:03:24.170 --> 02:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>but we soften the labels of things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for soften the meaning of things </v>

2582
02:03:29.170 --> 02:03:31.520
<v Speaker 1>and take away like the gravity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder is a weird</v>

2583
02:03:31.521 --> 02:03:33.140
<v Speaker 1>one because that can apply to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2584
02:03:33.141 --> 02:03:37.370
<v Speaker 1>People that are involved in murders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone who was involved in violent</v>

2585
02:03:37.371 --> 02:03:40.760
<v Speaker 1>crimes when they were young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's stress cops.</v>

2586
02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I think cops are the forgotten victims </v>
<v Speaker 1>of posttraumatic stress disorder and </v>

2587
02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:47.520
<v Speaker 1>people talk about why all these cops </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting people.</v>

2588
02:03:47.530 --> 02:03:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try being a fucking cop.</v>

2589
02:03:49.610 --> 02:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Try being a cop for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every day you're showing up five days a </v>

2590
02:03:54.610 --> 02:03:57.971
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's lying to you and people </v>

2591
02:03:57.971 --> 02:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>shooting at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with the most horrific </v>

2592
02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:01.691
<v Speaker 1>violence and let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely you got the job because you </v>

2593
02:04:01.691 --> 02:04:03.200
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a whole lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

2594
02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:04.400
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>

2595
02:04:04.401 --> 02:04:07.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are cops that are cops because they want</v>

2596
02:04:07.611 --> 02:04:12.611
<v Speaker 1>to help because it seemed like a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do because it's something they </v>

2597
02:04:12.611 --> 02:04:13.220
<v Speaker 1>always wanted to be a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always love law enforcement.</v>

2598
02:04:13.221 --> 02:04:18.221
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they came from the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they had a martial arts </v>

2599
02:04:18.221 --> 02:04:20.681
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They felt like it was a good fit for </v>

2600
02:04:20.681 --> 02:04:22.721
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a lot of people that </v>

2601
02:04:22.721 --> 02:04:24.251
<v Speaker 1>are cops that are fucking morons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just like every other walk of </v>

2602
02:04:24.251 --> 02:04:26.981
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people that are ice cream </v>

2603
02:04:26.981 --> 02:04:26.981
<v Speaker 1>man are fucking idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2604
02:04:26.981 --> 02:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people with ice cream and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have great jokes and the kids loved</v>

2605
02:04:27.810 --> 02:04:28.770
<v Speaker 1>when they show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2606
02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:31.040
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't just.</v>

2607
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gets a blanket pass through </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a transgender,</v>

2608
02:04:34.431 --> 02:04:35.840
<v Speaker 1>whether you're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're straight,</v>

2609
02:04:35.841 --> 02:04:37.100
<v Speaker 1>whether you're white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're black,</v>

2610
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:38.430
<v Speaker 1>nobody gets a free ride.</v>

2611
02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:41.000
<v Speaker 1>You're you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really are not racist,</v>

2612
02:04:41.001 --> 02:04:42.750
<v Speaker 1>who you really are not prejudiced in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2613
02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:48.020
<v Speaker 1>judge people based on their individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>merits and not just put them in a </v>

2614
02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:51.801
<v Speaker 1>category and give them a fucking free </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass because there is some form of </v>

2615
02:04:51.801 --> 02:04:56.130
<v Speaker 1>minority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a minority because they're </v>

2616
02:04:56.130 --> 02:04:57.600
<v Speaker 1>transgender or minority because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay or minority because they're whatever</v>

2617
02:04:57.601 --> 02:04:58.580
<v Speaker 1>the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2618
02:04:59.070 --> 02:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2619
02:04:59.431 --> 02:05:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2620
02:05:00.001 --> 02:05:05.001
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably you don't know what </v>

2621
02:05:05.001 --> 02:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>you're getting into when you become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cop.</v>

2622
02:05:07.150 --> 02:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a couple friends and one of the </v>

2623
02:05:12.150 --> 02:05:15.920
<v Speaker 1>that are cops and one of them was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about working the graveyard </v>

2624
02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:19.581
<v Speaker 1>shift and Vegas and just go into like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst fucking and just,</v>

2625
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:24.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing people on foot while while </v>

2626
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you're being shot at and just and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dealing with the worst,</v>

2627
02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:30.630
<v Speaker 1>the worst of the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've heard from multiple cops that</v>

2628
02:05:30.810 --> 02:05:34.410
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing worse than a human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>than pimps.</v>

2629
02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:38.190
<v Speaker 1>That they're just the most skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that they're like,</v>

2630
02:05:38.191 --> 02:05:39.350
<v Speaker 1>they're worse than murderers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2631
02:05:39.351 --> 02:05:41.390

<v Speaker 1>too short record.</v>

2632
02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:43.380
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mack Daddy?</v>

2633
02:05:43.890 --> 02:05:44.790

<v Speaker 1>hoes down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You deal,</v>

2636
02:05:48.661 --> 02:05:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you do deal with pieces of shit all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>very vulnerable people to stealing their</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exploding the fuck out of them.</v>

2641
02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:01.860
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why prostitution</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be legal.</v>

2642
02:06:01.861 --> 02:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Prostitution was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of.</v>

2643
02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:06.600
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have more hose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2644
02:06:06.601 --> 02:06:08.790
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to be going about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a more legal way.</v>

2645
02:06:08.850 --> 02:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>More upfront way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you see there's girls that are </v>

2646
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just.</v>

2647
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:14.400
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>

2648
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>if it's okay to give people massages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come it's not okay to joke someone </v>

2649
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>off?</v>

2650
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Tom Can make money off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2651
02:06:24.430 --> 02:06:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Get those nuts out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got another.</v>

2654
02:06:31.330 --> 02:06:34.080
<v Speaker 1>They got to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've been saying for fucking</v>

2655
02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:35.370
<v Speaker 1>years and no one wants to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2656
02:06:35.610 --> 02:06:37.770
<v Speaker 1>it dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only wants to listen.</v>

2657
02:06:38.010 --> 02:06:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the way to fix everything.</v>

2658
02:06:40.890 --> 02:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Take that load pent up English except to</v>
<v Speaker 1>short kills chicks with his nuts.</v>

2659
02:06:46.231 --> 02:06:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly it,</v>

2660
02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:50.490
<v Speaker 1>you realize how much he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about nutting,</v>

2661
02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:53.910
<v Speaker 1>like he doesn't get into the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantity,</v>

2662
02:06:53.911 --> 02:06:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but if it killed her and might be just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>

2663
02:06:57.690 --> 02:07:01.590
<v Speaker 1>like if it's from the moon under your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and kill you.</v>

2664
02:07:01.650 --> 02:07:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting theory.</v>

2665
02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I think he blew her back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2666
02:07:06.090 --> 02:07:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like a fucking firehose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could've been just a few cells are </v>

2667
02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:14.790
<v Speaker 1>segways on this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty serious moments ago.</v>

2668
02:07:15.090 --> 02:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Well we got a little upset about the PC </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking but yeah,</v>

2669
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.440
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rational.</v>

2670
02:07:19.530 --> 02:07:23.820
<v Speaker 1>But I think our point of view is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty broad.</v>

2671
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at it like no one here is </v>

2672
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.700
<v Speaker 1>anti gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one here is racist.</v>

2673
02:07:29.701 --> 02:07:32.790
<v Speaker 1>No new at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we also recognize that there's a lot</v>

2674
02:07:32.791 --> 02:07:37.390
<v Speaker 1>of like some Lou really shitty clunky </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that's a part of this,</v>

2675
02:07:37.650 --> 02:07:39.940
<v Speaker 1>this sort of progressive thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

2676
02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of like really mean shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings that are getting away with </v>

2677
02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:49.561
<v Speaker 1>it because they've adopted this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular type of thinking that is </v>

2678
02:07:49.561 --> 02:07:53.800
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bandwagoning that without thinking.</v>

2679
02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just and,</v>

<v Speaker 5>pioneer of civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he in,</v>

2746
02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:33.820
<v Speaker 5>he was like very clear in one of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>debates that he never felt like black </v>

2747
02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:33.950
<v Speaker 5>people should be able to vote.</v>

2748
02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:37.610
<v Speaker 5>He never felt like they should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>totally equal to white people.</v>

2749
02:11:37.670 --> 02:11:40.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like a lot of people,</v>

2750
02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:44.390
<v Speaker 5>if you listened to way the way people </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought of black people back then,</v>

2751
02:11:44.391 --> 02:11:49.391
<v Speaker 5>a lot of white people that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>automatically think of a civil rights </v>

2752
02:11:49.391 --> 02:11:52.190
<v Speaker 5>pioneers or progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the way people thought back then,</v>

2753
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:57.370
<v Speaker 5>it was very difficult to get away with </v>
<v Speaker 5>any sort of equality talk then whether </v>

2754
02:11:58.671 --> 02:12:00.530
<v Speaker 5>or not they did it because they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 5>to win debates.</v>

2755
02:12:00.531 --> 02:12:01.640
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me find it because it's.</v>

2756
02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:06.020
<v Speaker 5>The Nixon quote is pretty fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you say the n word?</v>

2757
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:07.850
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

2758
02:12:07.851 --> 02:12:10.640
<v Speaker 5>I was quoting one of our presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2759
02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:15.200
<v Speaker 5>a few of our presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's been a bunch of them.</v>

2760
02:12:15.201 --> 02:12:16.880
<v Speaker 5>Let me read this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2761
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:21.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this Lincoln thing is fucking crazy </v>

2762
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.910
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2763
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.660
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2764
02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:28.780
<v Speaker 5>it's a very weird quote because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize like the time people were around</v>

2765
02:12:29.361 --> 02:12:29.960
<v Speaker 5>back then.</v>

2766
02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:32.240
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here I'm 18,</v>

2767
02:12:32.250 --> 02:12:37.250
<v Speaker 5>58.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a series of debates with his </v>

2768
02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:37.370
<v Speaker 5>opponents in the Illinois race for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>US Senate,</v>

2769
02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:42.670
<v Speaker 5>Stephen Douglas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who had accused him of supporting Negro </v>

2770
02:12:42.670 --> 02:12:43.250
<v Speaker 5>equality in there for fourth debate at </v>
<v Speaker 5>Charleston,</v>

2771
02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:45.170
<v Speaker 5>Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On September 18th,</v>

2772
02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:46.010
<v Speaker 5>18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>58.</v>

2773
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:48.830
<v Speaker 5>Nick Lincoln made his position clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

2774
02:12:48.831 --> 02:12:52.670
<v Speaker 5>I will say then that I am not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nor have I ever been,</v>

2775
02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:57.700
<v Speaker 5>nor have been in favor of bringing about</v>
<v Speaker 5>in any way the social and political </v>

2776
02:12:58.610 --> 02:13:03.610
<v Speaker 5>equality of the white and black racists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He began going on to say that he opposed</v>

2777
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:08.300
<v Speaker 5>blacks having the right to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to serve on juries,</v>

2778
02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:12.260
<v Speaker 5>to hold office and to intermarry with </v>
<v Speaker 5>whites.</v>

2779
02:13:12.710 --> 02:13:17.710
<v Speaker 5>What he did believe that like all men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blacks had the right to improve their </v>

2780
02:13:17.710 --> 02:13:21.080
<v Speaker 5>condition in society and to enjoy the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fruits of their labor.</v>

2781
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:26.260
<v Speaker 5>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were equal to white men and for </v>

2782
02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:27.320
<v Speaker 5>this reason slavery was inherently </v>
<v Speaker 5>unjust,</v>

2783
02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 5>but thinking about fucking dark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how a progressive is even that</v>

2784
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:35.250
<v Speaker 3>in 1850,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that he's like,</v>

2785
02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:39.010
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make some form of you're.</v>

2786
02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:40.410
<v Speaker 3>You're really right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2787
02:13:40.411 --> 02:13:44.520
<v Speaker 3>That's why you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't even frame our minds in a place</v>

2788
02:13:44.521 --> 02:13:47.580
<v Speaker 3>where we really understand what it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to be in 18,</v>

2789
02:13:47.581 --> 02:13:48.640
<v Speaker 3>58,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2790
02:13:48.810 --> 02:13:50.900
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even that.</v>

2791
02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:55.960
<v Speaker 3>That has got to be crazy to more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>half the population to hear at that </v>

2792
02:13:56.311 --> 02:13:56.930
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2793
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the population of the south.</v>

2794
02:13:59.130 --> 02:14:00.940
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you on?</v>

2795
02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:06.220
<v Speaker 3>How about South Carolina?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still fucking flying the </v>

2796
02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:08.541
<v Speaker 3>confederate flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to figure out whether </v>

2797
02:14:08.541 --> 02:14:10.311
<v Speaker 3>they should tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure it out when there's biology.</v>

2798
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:13.410
<v Speaker 3>There's bureaucratic bullshit in the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>of something like that.</v>

2799
02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of world is it where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be like,</v>

2800
02:14:16.290 --> 02:14:17.570
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just take that shit down.</v>

2801
02:14:17.590 --> 02:14:19.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like we've got to get the assembly </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2802
02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Vote on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2803
02:14:20.821 --> 02:14:24.900
<v Speaker 3>and it's like the hanks on vacation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carol's not back either.</v>

2804
02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:27.300
<v Speaker 3>Like we got to get everybody organized </v>
<v Speaker 3>before we can.</v>

2805
02:14:27.630 --> 02:14:31.700
<v Speaker 3>Somebody can go up there and taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Allowed and it's more like.</v>

2806
02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:34.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like having the Nazi flag flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw.</v>

2807
02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Was it Andy Richter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about history.</v>

2808
02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:40.700
<v Speaker 3>He tweeted and keep it in the museum </v>
<v Speaker 3>about prices.</v>

2809
02:14:40.710 --> 02:14:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I learned learning stuff about a twitter</v>
<v Speaker 3>from twitter,</v>

2810
02:14:43.531 --> 02:14:48.531
<v Speaker 3>but he tweeted that he didn't know and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know either that that flag went </v>

2811
02:14:48.531 --> 02:14:52.341
<v Speaker 3>up in Charleston in South Carolina in </v>
<v Speaker 3>1962 as a fuck you to the civil rights </v>

2812
02:14:53.671 --> 02:14:55.470
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you're saying like,</v>

2813
02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:56.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's southern pride,</v>

2814
02:14:56.371 --> 02:14:56.850
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2815
02:14:56.851 --> 02:15:00.880
<v Speaker 3>that went up on that building to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked civil rights.</v>

2816
02:15:02.010 --> 02:15:05.610
<v Speaker 3>That kind of changes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Years after slavery was abolished.</v>

2817
02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're totally convinced that's an extra </v>

2818
02:15:11.731 --> 02:15:14.070
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge extra fuck you.</v>

2819
02:15:14.490 --> 02:15:19.490
<v Speaker 3>But then people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all the stuff we were talking </v>

2820
02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:19.490
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people,</v>

2821
02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:22.920
<v Speaker 3>the reactions to Obama's use of it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not hearing what he's saying.</v>

2822
02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:25.530
<v Speaker 3>Of course they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're acting like he's just,</v>

2823
02:15:25.531 --> 02:15:28.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing it around casually.</v>

2824
02:15:28.801 --> 02:15:33.801
<v Speaker 3>Like who's the least happy Mark Marin's </v>
<v Speaker 3>old manager told him he never worked </v>

2825
02:15:33.801 --> 02:15:38.451
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got fucking president to say and I </v>

2826
02:15:39.330 --> 02:15:44.330
<v Speaker 3>double g.dot</v>
<v Speaker 3>g e r what kind of damage?</v>

2827
02:15:44.410 --> 02:15:46.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that episode will get fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>trillion.</v>

2828
02:15:46.621 --> 02:15:51.621
<v Speaker 3>It's probably going to break the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet thinks more than Kim </v>

2829
02:15:51.621 --> 02:15:51.621
<v Speaker 3>Kardashian's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be crazy.</v>

2830
02:15:51.621 --> 02:15:52.740
<v Speaker 3>That's breaking the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2831
02:15:52.741 --> 02:15:57.741
<v Speaker 3>it's probably going to get my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be number one across the country </v>

2832
02:15:57.741 --> 02:16:01.341
<v Speaker 3>for sure for a while and it I'd probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>get millions and millions and millions </v>

2833
02:16:01.341 --> 02:16:02.250
<v Speaker 3>of downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He set up another website for it.</v>

2834
02:16:02.370 --> 02:16:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Did he really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2835
02:16:04.021 --> 02:16:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I saw that tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2836
02:16:04.921 --> 02:16:05.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2837
02:16:05.821 --> 02:16:07.950
<v Speaker 3>if you're having trouble getting it </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2838
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:12.240
<v Speaker 3>I set up like mark meets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama is a whole other side,</v>

2839
02:16:13.230 --> 02:16:15.260
<v Speaker 3>like photos czar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2840
02:16:15.570 --> 02:16:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Weird world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating though.</v>

2841
02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:23.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean on a much smaller scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously the success that you and I </v>

2842
02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:24.660
<v Speaker 3>have had all of us have had with </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasting is pretty.</v>

2843
02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:26.850
<v Speaker 3>It's been very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2844
02:16:26.851 --> 02:16:29.880
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just shot a pilot because apoe test.</v>

2845
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy.</v>

2846
02:16:31.931 --> 02:16:36.931
<v Speaker 1>But your show really should be some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a show and that's the best way to do </v>

2847
02:16:36.931 --> 02:16:40.831
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if someone was smart and they </v>

2848
02:16:40.831 --> 02:16:42.691
<v Speaker 1>wanted to have a TV show based on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and the interactions that you guys </v>

2849
02:16:42.691 --> 02:16:45.160
<v Speaker 1>have with your fans and then going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows it means it's a no brainer.</v>

2850
02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's guaranteed.</v>

2851
02:16:46.710 --> 02:16:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get the Duggar's 19 fuck,</v>

2852
02:16:49.890 --> 02:16:51.420
<v Speaker 1>they just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>weight active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like to fuck.</v>

2855
02:16:56.580 --> 02:16:59.530
<v Speaker 1>And we teach our kids nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of my kids,</v>

2856
02:16:59.531 --> 02:17:04.531
<v Speaker 1>fuck one of my other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I ain't paying attention is too </v>

02:17:04.531 --> 02:17:04.531
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I say I say the,</v>

2858
02:17:04.531 --> 02:17:09.511
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pilot thing that we shot in that </v>

2859
02:17:09.511 --> 02:17:12.421
<v Speaker 1>like we never anticipated going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording a show that like a production </v>

2860
02:17:12.671 --> 02:17:14.720
<v Speaker 1>company in a network will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's make a tea.</v>

2861
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:15.470
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>

2862
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:19.000
<v Speaker 1>we sit in our house and we just record </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show and then,</v>

2863
02:17:19.590 --> 02:17:24.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road has been so much better to us </v>

2864
02:17:24.590 --> 02:17:24.590
<v Speaker 1>and it will evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking podcast man.</v>

2865
02:17:24.590 --> 02:17:26.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're selling all these crazy places,</v>

2866
02:17:26.410 --> 02:17:29.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know what ultimately is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious is the TV show is not going to</v>

2867
02:17:29.351 --> 02:17:32.830
<v Speaker 1>mean shit that the Internet is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be.</v>

2868
02:17:32.930 --> 02:17:35.440
<v Speaker 1>The podcast is the best part to what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

2869
02:17:35.441 --> 02:17:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Your podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast is fucking fun.</v>

2870
02:17:38.050 --> 02:17:39.550
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fun.</v>

2871
02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fun.</v>

2872
02:17:41.561 --> 02:17:43.990
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you guys have a down,</v>

2873
02:17:43.991 --> 02:17:48.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have a groove and it's </v>

2874
02:17:48.991 --> 02:17:48.991
<v Speaker 1>hilarious to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

2875
02:17:48.991 --> 02:17:49.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really entertaining thing.</v>

2876
02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Way more entertaining than any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms way more entertaining than any </v>

2877
02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.591
<v Speaker 1>talk show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a Goddamn talk show on </v>

2878
02:17:58.591 --> 02:17:58.850
<v Speaker 1>television that is entertaining as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

2879
02:17:59.930 --> 02:18:00.300
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>

2880
02:18:00.550 --> 02:18:05.550
<v Speaker 1>But that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even if they take your show and </v>

2881
02:18:05.550 --> 02:18:05.550
<v Speaker 1>put it on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be as good.</v>

2882
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:10.830
<v Speaker 1>It'll get more people to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll get more people to listen to the </v>

2883
02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:13.741
<v Speaker 1>real thing and that's ultimately good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is your show is growing </v>

2884
02:18:13.741 --> 02:18:16.990
<v Speaker 1>exponentially just by word of mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were hearing about it.</v>

2885
02:18:16.991 --> 02:18:18.850
<v Speaker 1>They spray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can come on other people's podcasts,</v>

2886
02:18:18.851 --> 02:18:22.810
<v Speaker 1>they talk about it and that's what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to all of us.</v>

2887
02:18:22.811 --> 02:18:27.811
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this exponential thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on when we do each other </v>

2888
02:18:27.811 --> 02:18:28.440
<v Speaker 1>shows and then it builds up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it,</v>

2889
02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:33.510
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it juices us all up in some sort of a </v>

2890
02:18:33.510 --> 02:18:33.910
<v Speaker 1>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's how is this going to change</v>

2891
02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:39.110
<v Speaker 1>and eventually has to change television </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you get the real deal when </v>

2892
02:18:40.481 --> 02:18:45.481
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you go and watch a TV show if </v>

2893
02:18:45.481 --> 02:18:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a Netflix show hbo show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of them,</v>

2894
02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:51.880
<v Speaker 1>this is what television is good for.</v>

2895
02:18:51.970 --> 02:18:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>house of cards,</v>

2896
02:18:54.370 --> 02:18:57.600
<v Speaker 1>shows that are like productions madman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You produce,</v>

2897
02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:02.760
<v Speaker 1>you're producing some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have fucking cameras and </v>

2898
02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:05.341
<v Speaker 1>writers and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is still and that's actually a lot </v>

2899
02:19:05.341 --> 02:19:09.691
<v Speaker 1>of ways better than films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of films that can fulfill </v>

2900
02:19:09.691 --> 02:19:10.500
<v Speaker 1>them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV for the last five,</v>

2901
02:19:10.530 --> 02:19:15.530
<v Speaker 1>seven years has taken a colossal dump on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of film is a lot of film is really</v>

2902
02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:19.760
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially blockbusters.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but that's rare.</v>

2905
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It's rare to come to come up with a film</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets produced and distributed out </v>

2906
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.110

<v Speaker 1>I'll be like a,</v>

2934
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:42.830
<v Speaker 1>like a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2935
02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:48.340
<v Speaker 1>This thing on Netflix and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are not in our kind of like,</v>

2936

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2937
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:55.040
<v Speaker 1>but then everybody who was kind of young</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids young into it,</v>

2938
02:20:55.041 --> 02:20:55.790
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2939
02:20:55.791 --> 02:20:57.320
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The all young kids,</v>

2940
02:20:57.350 --> 02:20:59.810
<v Speaker 1>your parents say you can't watch any TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have a laptop.</v>

2941
02:20:59.810 --> 02:21:01.370
<v Speaker 1>You sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit in your room,</v>

2942
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:03.260
<v Speaker 1>your whole house houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all Wifi.</v>

2943
02:21:03.470 --> 02:21:05.150
<v Speaker 1>When you're online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching movies.</v>

2944
02:21:05.151 --> 02:21:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Parents don't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know shit.</v>

2945
02:21:07.431 --> 02:21:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future is Netflix and the future is.</v>

2946
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:15.670
<v Speaker 1>The only problem that I have with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things is that you can't download them </v>

2947
02:21:15.670 --> 02:21:18.671
<v Speaker 1>onto your computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go on a plane flying over </v>

2948
02:21:18.671 --> 02:21:18.970
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bummer.</v>

2949
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2950
02:21:20.661 --> 02:21:21.430
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2951
02:21:21.650 --> 02:21:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean they said that like the speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can get on a plane just won't </v>

2952
02:21:26.650 --> 02:21:28.730
<v Speaker 1>support streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You download it.</v>

2953
02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.920
<v Speaker 1>They want you to have to go there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

2954
02:21:31.130 --> 02:21:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but they should also have an option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a download option just for the media,</v>

2955
02:21:35.421 --> 02:21:37.400
<v Speaker 1>like on camping trips or some shit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

02:28:41.570 --> 02:28:43.490
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be 700,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven horsepower.</v>

3142
02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven hundred and 70 horsepower from a </v>

3143
02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:48.680
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They challenger charger too though.</v>

3144
02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:51.980
<v Speaker 1>The four door charger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a fucking sacrilege.</v>

3145
02:28:51.981 --> 02:28:53.930
<v Speaker 1>They turned a charger into a formula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3146
02:28:53.931 --> 02:28:57.200
<v Speaker 1>It used to be the dukes of hazzard car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that challenger.</v>

3147
02:28:57.780 --> 02:29:00.740
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgot about that challenger could never</v>

3148
02:29:00.741 --> 02:29:03.230
<v Speaker 1>have that today and that love that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you.</v>

3149
02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:06.680
<v Speaker 1>There's two separate keys and the red </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3150
02:29:06.681 --> 02:29:09.890
<v Speaker 1>That means 700 horsepower and then if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to dial it back,</v>

3151
02:29:09.891 --> 02:29:12.820
<v Speaker 1>like if a friend or the valet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give them the black and that.</v>

3152
02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>That brings it down to like 500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3153
02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:17.620
<v Speaker 1>so it's not all the way opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3154
02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:21.000
<v Speaker 1>control how fast somebody can go based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the key,</v>

3155
02:29:21.410 --> 02:29:22.850
<v Speaker 1>the amount of horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horsepower.</v>

3156
02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:27.670
<v Speaker 1>But it's so ridiculous because 505 </v>
<v Speaker 1>horsepower is so fucking stupid fast.</v>

3157
02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 700 horsepower is almost </v>

3158
02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:32.680
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

3159
02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:32.930
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have that.</v>

3160
02:29:32.931 --> 02:29:37.931
<v Speaker 1>It's the two keys and on top of that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can put valet with a code into the </v>

3161
02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:42.490
<v Speaker 1>computer and your screen and that'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop it down to like 2:30</v>

3162
02:29:42.491 --> 02:29:43.330
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3234
02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:43.540

<v Speaker 1>when you watch him hit the way he hit </v>

3235
02:32:43.540 --> 02:32:47.260
<v Speaker 1>and slammed on the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tried to kind of just fucked up the </v>

3236
02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:47.260
<v Speaker 1>suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3237

3239
02:32:49.010 --> 02:32:50.360
<v Speaker 1>breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3240
02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:55.480

<v Speaker 1>frame seems okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it's just.</v>

3245
02:33:01.610 --> 02:33:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think a guy in a fucking race </v>

3246
02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:06.610
<v Speaker 1>would probably know how to drive a </v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3295
02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:55.260
<v Speaker 1>a cream that instead of like laser takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tattoo ink completely off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know very little about this.</v>

3302

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just talking.</v>

3303
02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I researched it before I brought it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

3304
02:35:10.350 --> 02:35:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I heard some people talking about </v>

3307
02:35:16.861 --> 02:35:16.861
<v Speaker 1>and they were super excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shark tank,</v>

3308
02:35:16.861 --> 02:35:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't like when they over rehearse </v>
<v Speaker 1>their pitches though,</v>

3309
02:35:18.911 --> 02:35:20.690
<v Speaker 1>like I know they're nervous because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on now,</v>

3310
02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:25.650

<v Speaker 1>performer.</v>

3312
02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Empathy for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of them are amazing at their </v>

3313
02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:38.380
<v Speaker 1>level of bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their,</v>

3314
02:35:38.381 --> 02:35:39.370
<v Speaker 1>their pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3315
02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:41.380
<v Speaker 1>they'll come on and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3316
02:35:41.381 --> 02:35:45.160
<v Speaker 1>so what are your sales like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real strong really good numbers.</v>

3317

<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3330
02:36:12.250 --> 02:36:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I read an interview with Matt Lauer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the beginning,</v>

3331
02:36:15.671 --> 02:36:17.790
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about that lay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white lady that.</v>

3332
02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was so disappointed that she didn't</v>

3333
02:36:20.921 --> 02:36:22.900
<v Speaker 1>talk blacker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't talk black at all.</v>

3334
02:36:23.350 --> 02:36:26.110
<v Speaker 1>When she did get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have been really funny.</v>

3335
02:36:26.820 --> 02:36:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying like that would</v>

3336
02:36:28.471 --> 02:36:33.471
<v Speaker 1>have been great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This going to be some video of her </v>

3337
02:36:33.471 --> 02:36:33.820
<v Speaker 1>talking like that especially went back </v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was saying that she was black.</v>

3338
02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:39.750
<v Speaker 1>She got busted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I don't know if that post is even </v>

3339
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.750
<v Speaker 1>real of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a facebook and she could go in with</v>

3340
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:41.200
<v Speaker 1>the all natural look and it was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>curled,</v>

3341
02:36:41.530 --> 02:36:44.470
<v Speaker 1>which means that she just got a perm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was really shit straight.</v>

3342
02:36:44.530 --> 02:36:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She posted like going with the all </v>

3343
02:36:49.530 --> 02:36:50.470
<v Speaker 1>natural look like I think it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said it was a real facebook.</v>

3344
02:36:50.471 --> 02:36:53.500
<v Speaker 1>They all natural for other people or </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

3345
02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people.</v>

3346
02:36:57.610 --> 02:37:02.610
<v Speaker 1>It shows you how we did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole progressive movement is that </v>

3347
02:37:02.610 --> 02:37:05.480
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have adopted this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>trans racial identity thing that you.</v>

3348
02:37:05.481 --> 02:37:10.481
<v Speaker 1>You should be allowed to be trans racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people were saying that racism or </v>

3349
02:37:10.481 --> 02:37:11.890
<v Speaker 1>that race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that race is just a social construct,</v>

3350
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:16.420
<v Speaker 1>so you should be able to be translated </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there out of fucking horrible.</v>

3351
02:37:18.290 --> 02:37:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

3352
02:37:22.610 --> 02:37:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I never saw this coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because what we called </v>

3353
02:37:27.610 --> 02:37:27.610
<v Speaker 1>politically correct we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in the nineties,</v>

3354
02:37:27.610 --> 02:37:32.590
<v Speaker 1>that ain't shit compared to this because</v>
<v Speaker 1>now people have formed their entire </v>

3355
02:37:32.590 --> 02:37:34.580
<v Speaker 1>identities based on this type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

3356
02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:37.640
<v Speaker 1>You know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this agenda,</v>

3357
02:37:37.641 --> 02:37:42.641
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the word would be that you </v>

3358
02:37:42.641 --> 02:37:43.970
<v Speaker 1>would fit into the whole narrative that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've adopted.</v>

3359
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3360
02:37:44.470 --> 02:37:49.400
<v Speaker 1>it's adorable because it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's simple minds,</v>

3361
02:37:49.570 --> 02:37:50.940
<v Speaker 1>trans racial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not onboard.</v>

3362
02:37:51.010 --> 02:37:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I am on board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>

3363
02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to be Japanese either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing is that you are,</v>

3364
02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:00.650
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is say you are in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are there.</v>

3365
02:38:00.651 --> 02:38:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It is all natural because I started my </v>
<v Speaker 1>36 years.</v>

3366
02:38:03.980 --> 02:38:07.360
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to her credit she looks good.</v>

3367
02:38:07.370 --> 02:38:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean she does pass good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's pretty in that picture,</v>

3368
02:38:12.021 --> 02:38:15.410
<v Speaker 1>but the picture is not so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her 36 year.</v>

3369
02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:18.020
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3370
02:38:18.021 --> 02:38:18.900
<v Speaker 1>That one on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pretty.</v>

3371
02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:22.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a weave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is she say it's a we've.</v>

3372
02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does.</v>

3373
02:38:23.930 --> 02:38:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Does she say it to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've.</v>

3374
02:38:24.981 --> 02:38:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a we've.</v>

3375
02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are.</v>

3376
02:38:28.671 --> 02:38:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing Tanya a grocery store or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else I would be like,</v>

3377
02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:34.400
<v Speaker 1>it's none of your business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

3378
02:38:34.401 --> 02:38:36.260
<v Speaker 1>after brief pause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she says it's a we've.</v>

3379
02:38:36.470 --> 02:38:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinky curls and dreadlocks come from.</v>

3380
02:38:39.890 --> 02:38:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was a different look.</v>

3381
02:38:41.750 --> 02:38:46.750
<v Speaker 1>That's not that look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was when she had the crazy </v>

3382
02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:49.001
<v Speaker 1>dreadlocks that a lot of skin tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's orange is the new black.</v>

3383
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Did you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3384
02:38:49.791 --> 02:38:54.791
<v Speaker 1>did he got arrested?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got arrested for swinging a </v>

3385
02:38:54.791 --> 02:38:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Kettlebell strength and conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>coach at Ucla when I heard this.</v>

3386
02:38:57.180 --> 02:38:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Don't Miss Pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a mace.</v>

3387
02:38:59.330 --> 02:39:01.010
<v Speaker 1>You can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to assault someone,</v>

3388
02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:06.040
<v Speaker 1>steal clubs or macy's or the way to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells and awkward thing swinging </v>

3389
02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:09.401
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have connected with that </v>

3390
02:39:09.401 --> 02:39:09.401
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

3391
02:39:09.401 --> 02:39:11.530
<v Speaker 1>he'd be up on murder charges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially hit the guy in the head like </v>

3392
02:39:11.570 --> 02:39:16.570
<v Speaker 1>a watermelon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's attempted assault with a deadly </v>

3393
02:39:16.570 --> 02:39:16.850
<v Speaker 1>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charge them all terrorism.</v>

3394
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

3395
02:39:18.740 --> 02:39:19.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in,</v>

3396
02:39:19.430 --> 02:39:21.170
<v Speaker 1>he's probably fucked right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3397
02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's out on like $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>bail.</v>

3398
02:39:23.361 --> 02:39:24.680
<v Speaker 1>But like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3399
02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:27.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those charges could easily.</v>

3400
02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I've read an article so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I was there,</v>

3401
02:39:31.011 --> 02:39:36.011
<v Speaker 1>I don't know firsthand account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like a pretty serious </v>

3402
02:39:36.011 --> 02:39:38.981
<v Speaker 1>assault charge man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it was it the guy was yelling </v>

3403
02:39:38.981 --> 02:39:39.450
<v Speaker 1>at his son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son apparently.</v>

3404
02:39:40.010 --> 02:39:45.010
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually chicklet the Kiddos in </v>

3405
02:39:45.010 --> 02:39:45.010
<v Speaker 1>the first star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got arrested.</v>

3406
02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:47.240
<v Speaker 1>What is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just on this page.</v>

3407
02:39:47.241 --> 02:39:47.950
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3408
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:50.630
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said that,</v>

3409
02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:54.320
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he son hasn't been there for all the</v>

3410
02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:58.610
<v Speaker 1>workouts and was like giving minimal </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort at this strength condition.</v>

3411
02:39:58.611 --> 02:40:01.250
<v Speaker 1>How weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sound seems strange.</v>

3412
02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:06.520
<v Speaker 1>So spoiled kids try harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard very motivated coach lit him up </v>

3413
02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:11.020
<v Speaker 1>and then they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the coach was on the phone and he </v>

3414
02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:15.010
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went into his office and the coach </v>

3415
02:40:15.010 --> 02:40:15.010
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be with you like in a second.</v>

3416
02:40:15.010 --> 02:40:18.450
<v Speaker 3>And he came in and apparently it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it escalated there.</v>

3417
02:40:18.451 --> 02:40:23.451
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hit him is what the article I read </v>

3418
02:40:23.451 --> 02:40:23.520
<v Speaker 3>said that he punched the strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioning coach.</v>

3419
02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:28.760
<v Speaker 3>They finally got him out of that office </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I guess they were next to the </v>

3420
02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:32.240
<v Speaker 3>weight room or something and an intern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the people restraining them got a</v>

3421
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:37.550
<v Speaker 3>few people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got them in there and he grabbed the </v>

3422
02:40:37.550 --> 02:40:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Kettlebell and swung it at an intern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3423
02:40:37.550 --> 02:40:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't even that cold.</v>

3424
02:40:37.951 --> 02:40:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Who knows if that's really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows if we're just talking shit.</v>

3425
02:40:40.141 --> 02:40:45.141
<v Speaker 3>I heard John Jules came down and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>guided his hand and they brought it to </v>

3426
02:40:45.141 --> 02:40:46.950
<v Speaker 3>the Kettlebell and he swung for Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you realize what angel did it?</v>

3427
02:40:47.430 --> 02:40:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's right there.</v>

3428
02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Biggie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3429
02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:50.850
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3430
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Biggie was on the shoulder,</v>

3518
02:44:35.361 --> 02:44:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It could be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3519
02:44:36.221 --> 02:44:37.180
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3522
02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Just be suppressed someone and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>explode when they get away from you,</v>

3523
02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:45.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the opposite.</v>

3524
02:44:45.971 --> 02:44:48.570
<v Speaker 1>You encourage it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just constantly laughs.</v>

3525
02:44:48.610 --> 02:44:51.040
<v Speaker 1>It's an environment of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know how to.</v>

3526
02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:54.310
<v Speaker 1>They know how to make and they repeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff when it's funny to try it again.</v>

3527
02:44:54.390 --> 02:44:55.600
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>

<v Speaker 1>be so many far.</v>

3547
02:45:45.171 --> 02:45:49.610
<v Speaker 1>It's in our house and so much brown </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown.</v>

3548
02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you like by the time your kid becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 17,</v>

3549
02:45:54.191 --> 02:45:57.700
<v Speaker 1>18 years old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how fucking strange the world is</v>

3550
02:45:57.701 --> 02:45:58.890
<v Speaker 1>going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't.</v>

3551
02:45:58.891 --> 02:46:00.940
<v Speaker 1>We can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't imagine it though.</v>

3552
02:46:01.050 --> 02:46:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean how different the world is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 39 and I look at like millennials in</v>

3553
02:46:05.711 --> 02:46:08.980
<v Speaker 1>the audience and I look at them and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just go like the world I grew up in,</v>

3554
02:46:08.990 --> 02:46:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I was born in 76</v>

3555
02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:15.080
<v Speaker 4>is radically different than the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Millennials grew up in cell phone.</v>

3556
02:46:15.081 --> 02:46:17.870
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have that until I graduated </v>
<v Speaker 4>from college.</v>

3557
02:46:18.290 --> 02:46:21.290
<v Speaker 4>I didn't send an email until I was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the work force.</v>

3558
02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:23.990
<v Speaker 4>That's why your friend had a makeup </v>
<v Speaker 4>pitstop every hour.</v>

3559
02:46:24.290 --> 02:46:26.150
<v Speaker 4>Talked to her dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3560
02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:29.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one has been.</v>

3561
02:46:29.250 --> 02:46:32.540
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to wipe again.</v>

3562
02:46:32.810 --> 02:46:34.210
<v Speaker 4>This very leaky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today.</v>

3563
02:46:34.211 --> 02:46:36.650
<v Speaker 4>That girl talked about taking the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to describe it,</v>

3564
02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:41.120
<v Speaker 4>how did she describe it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That she'd like rationalize it.</v>

3565
02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:46.420
<v Speaker 4>She knows completely rational to her the</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument because it's such a cultural </v>

3566
02:46:46.420 --> 02:46:47.540
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least amongst her friends.</v>

3567
02:46:47.541 --> 02:46:52.130
<v Speaker 4>That is what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But from what I understand,</v>

3568
02:46:53.810 --> 02:46:58.810
<v Speaker 4>that's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I wish I would have asked that at </v>

3569
02:46:58.810 --> 02:46:58.810
<v Speaker 4>13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have the wherewithal.</v>

3570
02:46:59.260 --> 02:47:00.180
<v Speaker 4>Do they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3571
02:47:00.230 --> 02:47:01.220
<v Speaker 4>did she talk about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3572
02:47:01.221 --> 02:47:02.860
<v Speaker 4>Christina feels so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should do.</v>

3573
02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:04.600
<v Speaker 4>She didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3574
02:47:04.630 --> 02:47:07.280
<v Speaker 4>She personally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a necessity.</v>

3575
02:47:08.130 --> 02:47:10.790
<v Speaker 4>It was basically like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you gotta do?</v>

3576
02:47:11.610 --> 02:47:12.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3577
02:47:12.530 --> 02:47:14.240
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That it doesn't feel good.</v>

3578
02:47:14.270 --> 02:47:19.270
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you have to do it because you like </v>

3579
02:47:19.270 --> 02:47:19.270
<v Speaker 4>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what do you like about boys?</v>

3580
02:47:19.270 --> 02:47:19.650
<v Speaker 4>Fuck y'all.</v>

3581
02:47:21.940 --> 02:47:24.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean at least if the boys are putting </v>
<v Speaker 4>it in your vagina and you,</v>

3582
02:47:25.010 --> 02:47:27.530
<v Speaker 4>it feels good in your vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you like sex,</v>

3583
02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:31.070
<v Speaker 4>but you don't even like the sec.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you have to do it because what?</v>

3584
02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:35.240
<v Speaker 4>She liked the boys that were the </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>

3585
02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:37.190
<v Speaker 4>But sexing her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she didn't.</v>

3586
02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:42.640
<v Speaker 4>She could only but sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was the one outlet and that's </v>

3587
02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:44.540
<v Speaker 4>the compromise of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess to get to hang out with a boy.</v>

3588
02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:47.750
<v Speaker 4>But the first time she ever got one in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual cooter she's probably like.</v>

3589
02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:52.040
<v Speaker 4>And then that guy was easier than what?</v>

3590
02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:59.700
<v Speaker 4>For a while I am pure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about it.</v>

3591
02:48:00.530 --> 02:48:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a weird thing.</v>

3592
02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:06.810
<v Speaker 4>The religious principles when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>to bug fucking,</v>

3593
02:48:06.940 --> 02:48:11.000
<v Speaker 4>it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes me sad that she had to,</v>

3594
02:48:11.001 --> 02:48:16.001
<v Speaker 4>but sex instead of just having the sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>she wanted was getting fucked in </v>

3595
02:48:16.001 --> 02:48:19.901
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get buffed really sad,</v>

3596
02:48:24.570 --> 02:48:26.450
<v Speaker 4>but fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While the Talibans were watching,</v>

3597
02:48:27.210 --> 02:48:28.350

3601
02:48:35.130 --> 02:48:37.730

<v Speaker 4>and you can do whatever you want,</v>

3606
02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:50.940
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

3609
02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:01.070
<v Speaker 4>the Iranian hostage crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Jimmy Carter thing is that when they</v>

3610
02:49:01.071 --> 02:49:02.870
<v Speaker 4>went back to when they started doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>Persian,</v>

3611
02:49:03.230 --> 02:49:05.450
<v Speaker 4>because I had an Iranian girlfriend when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like seven,</v>

3614
02:49:11.801 --> 02:49:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and she was my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her mother tried to stab her father.</v>

3615
02:49:15.150 --> 02:49:18.990
<v Speaker 1>She was half Iranian and half white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her Dad was white.</v>

3616
02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3617
02:49:20.191 --> 02:49:22.830

<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3618
02:49:22.831 --> 02:49:27.831
<v Speaker 1>He was an eastern Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck he was United States </v>

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3621
02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:32.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wife tried to stab the,</v>

3622
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:35.010
<v Speaker 1>the father while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3623
02:49:35.100 --> 02:49:37.860
<v Speaker 1>while I was friends with her and he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really weird,</v>

3624
02:49:37.861 --> 02:49:42.861
<v Speaker 1>crazy situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I really wish I remembered more of </v>

3625
02:49:42.861 --> 02:49:42.861
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really liked her.</v>

3626
02:49:42.861 --> 02:49:43.560
<v Speaker 1>She was sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was very pretty too.</v>

3627
02:49:44.130 --> 02:49:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was really nice little girl.</v>

3628
02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:51.260
<v Speaker 1>We're both the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we went to school together hard </v>

3629
02:49:51.260 --> 02:49:54.141
<v Speaker 1>for me to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living in San Francisco at the </v>

3630
02:49:54.141 --> 02:49:54.141
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably like eight and uh,</v>

3631
02:49:54.141 --> 02:49:56.730
<v Speaker 1>there was like this big issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was like my mother,</v>

3632
02:49:57.540 --> 02:50:01.110
<v Speaker 1>my father and the police came and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that,</v>

3633
02:50:01.230 --> 02:50:04.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother was old school from Iran.</v>

3634
02:50:04.410 --> 02:50:08.100
<v Speaker 1>She just was ready to kill a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could understand that.</v>

3635
02:50:08.190 --> 02:50:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Ready to kill a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you'd like,</v>

3636
02:50:11.010 --> 02:50:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll make you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just spread your ass hole up.</v>

3637
02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:15.020
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough with that.</v>

3638
02:50:15.021 --> 02:50:15.660
<v Speaker 1>But sex.</v>

3639
02:50:17.850 --> 02:50:20.250
<v Speaker 1>But she had like gone after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she,</v>

3640
02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if she cut him or God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what happened,</v>

3641
02:50:23.641 --> 02:50:26.970
<v Speaker 1>but it was cops were involved and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty significant.</v>

3642
02:50:26.971 --> 02:50:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that the little girl might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to stay over my house for awhile.</v>

3643
02:50:30.990 --> 02:50:32.360
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to remember.</v>

3644
02:50:32.390 --> 02:50:37.390
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent the night over my house were </v>

3645
02:50:37.390 --> 02:50:39.230
<v Speaker 1>cops were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big deal though because I </v>

3646
02:50:39.230 --> 02:50:39.930
<v Speaker 1>remember my parents being freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were freaked out,</v>

3647
02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:41.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>as someone who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3649
02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:48.630

<v Speaker 1>I've experienced the actual act getting </v>

3650
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:48.630
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3651
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:51.450

<v Speaker 1>When you know somebody like that is when</v>

3652
02:50:51.451 --> 02:50:54.690
<v Speaker 1>you see shit like that about people </v>

<v Speaker 1>It went so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far gone.</v>

3655
02:51:02.130 --> 02:51:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Someone pulled out a metal blade and </v>
<v Speaker 1>went after somebody.</v>

3682
02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:19.200

3686
02:52:26.700 --> 02:52:30.661
<v Speaker 3>one to 22 that ranks how evil a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>is based on their acts.</v>

3687
02:52:31.210 --> 02:52:36.210
<v Speaker 3>And so what's 22?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty two is a torture murderer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>on the episode.</v>

3695
02:52:51.810 --> 02:52:52.060
