1
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.650
We,
and we're back ladies,
gentlemen,
two in a day.

2
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:09.720
That's how we roll.
Um,

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.970
and this episode is brought to you by legal zoom.
If you go to legal zoom,

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.980
you my friend,

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.010
you fellow Americans just got done celebrating independence day,

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.870
feeling all star Stripey bantery and

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.780
what does America about folks,

8
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:34.260
it's about fucking innovation and shit coming up with your own thing,

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.670
getting your freak on,
getting it together,
planning for the future.

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.090
I don't know if it's about that.
It's kind of just about living in America,
right?

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.290
Although other stuff sounds good though.
It's motivational speaking.

12
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.120
It's like you're a fucking titan and if you're going to the school and you were

13
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.450
tight and you'll be like a titan,
um,
anyway,

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.560
uh,

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.560
one of the best things that you could do that for your own personal sense of

16
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:06.501
satisfaction or growth or just independence is to be a person has their own

17
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:10.590
business.
Um,
if you've ever thought about doing that,
you can do that.

18
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.090
You can start a corporation.

19
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:17.091
You do do all the necessary legal steps online using legal zoom quite easily.

20
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
If you have some sort of an invention that you want to patent that you want to

21
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:23.304
lock down.

22
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.050
If you have some sort of a thing that you want to have become your business,

23
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:29.310
legal zoom can help you with that.

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.050
They can set it all up and they can do it for less than,
well,

25
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.940
I think the the lowest for the,

26
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.250
for setting an LLC is as little as 99 bucks.
You can get a a will,

27
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.830
he could set up,
you can even get divorced if you're,

28
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.420
if you're married to someone.
Cool.
Look at that 99 bucks to form an LLC.

29
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.250
It starts at nine,
nine bucks.
No waiting in line.
Everything done naked,

30
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.640
everything done drunk as fuck.
He looks happy with it and the guy,

31
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.850
that guy's happy as fuck with everything,
but his haircut,
his hair,

32
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.880
his hair is strange.
It's a strange guy.
But Hey,
I don't have any hair,

33
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:07.650
so who am I talking?
Shit.
Anyway,
um,
for over,
you know,

34
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.800
for a long time legal zoom has been doing,

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.970
helping America's get personalized wills,
powers of attorney,

36
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.660
a living trusts,
and they helped protect your assets.

37
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.070
S corporations,
LLCs,
trademarks,
real estate documents and more.

38
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:27.900
And all of it can be done online.
I love doing things online.

39
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:29.760
I do almost all my shopping online.

40
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
It's so much easier than having to go somewhere,

41
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.440
especially when you're dealing with legal stuff.
Because in any normal situation,

42
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:39.390
you would have to set an appointment.

43
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.410
It would have to be from nine to five every day he'd have to take off work or do

44
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:46.740
something.
We have to figure out how to get to that office on your lunch break.

45
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.430
It's gotta be a way you can figure out how to do all this online.
Well now,

46
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.730
finally there is,
you don't have to be there physically in person.

47
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.270
Most of this stuff that people,
uh,
you know,

48
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.640
most of the legal shit that you have to deal with can all be taken care of like

49
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:05.500
this.
This is a,
the future.
This is where our world is coming to.
Um,

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.190
and so you can go to legal zoom and they can take care of you from start to

51
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.490
finish is the modern way to get legal help.

60
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:50.461
which we can't even keep in here because of you hungry savages people.

61
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.110
People in this room are hungry.

62
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.740
Little savages trying to steal my [inaudible] cashews.

63
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.390
I'm not happy with that man.

64
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.940
I'm not happy with you guys always getting the good shit.

65
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.510
<v 1>I get my own box now.
I added three more items,</v>

66
00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:09.530
which is like eight items or so and I still with one other person went through

67
00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:13.370
it like in four days.
Yeah Dude,
you can eat,
you put in some food.

68
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.980
Well those packages,
like if you're sitting there watching a movie,

69
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.410
you're just snacking,
you're grazing and

70
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.760
<v 0>they're good.
And as far as like normal snack food,</v>

71
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:28.410
it's going to be very hard to find things that are as nutritious and delicious

72
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.490
like legitimately healthy for you.
Like those serratia cashews.
Those are,

73
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.910
those are delicious and you don't have to feel bad about eating them.
I mean,

74
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:39.270
yeah,
they have calories but you know,
cashews are pretty fucking good for you.

75
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.580
It's cashews with spices on it.
That's it.
And uh,
nature has all sorts.

76
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.990
Naturebox rather has all sorts of options that you can choose from.

77
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.010
Um,
all the different snacks that they have are delicious.

78
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:56.910
I've had a bunch of different ones and they very nutritionally from like really

79
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:59.670
healthy,
low sugar,
gluten free.

80
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.420
They have a lot of options and if you're into like Paleo and things along those

81
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:06.360
lines,
they have a lot of options that fit into those diets.

82
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.360
Especially like gluten free,
low sugar,
um,
or they have things,

83
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.700
even things that have things like,

84
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.630
there's certain stuff like pretzels and things along those lines that no matter

85
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:17.240
what,
they're not really that health thing,

86
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.740
but there are a lot better than the shit that you'd normally would get in your

87
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:21.840
vending machine.
And they're delicious.

88
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.200
Some of the stuff I'm so addicted to these big apple pineapples,

89
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:26.034
I don't know how they make it.

90
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.860
<v 1>So those are yummy.</v>

91
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.370
I think they have smaller because if you look at the how they're cut,

92
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.030
it's not a huge pineapple.
Maybe it's,
it's sweeter because it's,

93
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.740
<v 0>I dunno,
maybe it's good,</v>

94
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.700
but I think the smaller is because it shrinks through the dehydration process.

95
00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:44.710
But I don't want him making shit up.
Um,

96
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.250
dark cocoa almonds are also the bomb.

97
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:50.580
Diggity they have a lot of great stuff there at naturebox.
Very,

98
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:54.150
very happy with them.
And uh,
everybody is here too.
They,
like I said,

99
00:05:54.151 --> 00:05:58.100
we devour the shit quick.
I'm going to have to start ordering two boxes a week.

100
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.850
Yeah,
we leave them around here.
They're gone.
Um,

101
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.470
but what I like about it,
zero trans fats,
zero high fructose corn syrup,

102
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:10.010
which are two things that are really troublesome and most American diets,

103
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.570
these are all natural.
You're going to find no artificial sweeteners,

104
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:18.350
no bullshit,
no GMO.
Um,
they'll,

105
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:23.351
they'll have plenty of them that are low on sugar or non GMO there with or

106
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:27.710
without gluten and they shipped for free.
That's what the beautiful thing is.

107
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.560
Peanut butter,

uh,

145
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:45.560
with good form.
And that is a key part is doing done with good form.

146
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.490
We're will noticeably increase your functional strength.

147
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.310
It's your ability to do shit like pick up a chair and move it around your

148
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:55.950
apartment.
Like you can do that better if you're stronger.
It's like,
it's,

149
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.320
<v 2>it's better to have a body that works well.
And the,
uh,</v>

150
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.770
Kettlebell packages that we provide,
there are numerous,

151
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.180
all sorts of different sizes.

152
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:06.060
We'll sell you two and three different sizes and weights.

153
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.290
And we also have great EQ shall exercise videos.
These,
um,

154
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.380
the fitness DVDs,
especially my favorites,

155
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.110
the Keith Weber Cardio Kettlebell workout.

156
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.900
I was talking about this long before we were ever selling this,

157
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.690
the extreme kettlebell cardio workout we have.
I think we,

158
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.820
the first one's sold out.
They sell like crazy.
This dude's a bad mother fucker.

159
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:27.660
That's Keith Weber Guy.

160
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:31.440
He goes on a beach and he starts swinging kettlebells and you just try to keep

161
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:34.440
up with him.
He counts every down,
shows you the exercise counts you down.

162
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.900
And he tried to keep up.
And this dude is an animal.

163
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:41.400
It's a fucking fantastic workout is my all time favorite.
It says,

164
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:46.050
if you go there,
it says powerful.
Like it says with my name.
That's my quote.

165
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.770
It is powerful.
That fucking thing is spectacular.

166
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.320
He's a bad motherfucker that Keith Webber and I,

167
00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:56.460
that's how long does it take to look like him?
Years,
years,
steroids,

168
00:09:56.461 --> 00:10:00.130
growth hormone,
green juice.
I can just buy the DVD and pop again.

169
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.910
You're going to have to starve yourself.
Dehydrate.

170
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.610
That guy's probably got great genetic.

171
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.860
All in all seriousness and you've probably as great genetics on top of it,

172
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:08.850
but he's obviously shredded.

173
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.920
<v 3>I think I work out big videos all have different backgrounds cause I've been</v>

174
00:10:11.921 --> 00:10:15.340
watching a girlfriend do a lot of them lately and like,
you know,

175
00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:19.270
do you have the abandoned Jim?
You'll have the outdoor ones on the beach.

176
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.780
They should just have one like in the middle of a Mcdonald's.
That would be good.

177
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.430
That's a good move dude.
Like a food,
like a food court,

178
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:32.130
food color all around.
Ziller with old people everywhere.
Just watching Walmart,

179
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.300
Walmart.
I like the idea of like you could never get it in a,

180
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.210
in a Mcdonald's.
They would never allow you to write about a food court.

181
00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:41.620
You might be able to actually pull off.

182
00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:45.430
If you blurt out all the different labels,
you might be able to do that.

183
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:50.400
Just make it like,
you know,
Texas or something like,
yeah,
Arizona.

184
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.300
Tucson are so hot as fuck.
Everybody's angry.
What the fuck he doing?

185
00:10:55.301 --> 00:10:59.170
Man jumping rope on stage in front of my cheeseburger.
You fuck,

186
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.020
that's rude.
That's shrunk.
Stop.
Would be kids,

187
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.080
especially as the guys in really good shape.
That's fucking rude.

188
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:08.950
I'm trying to enjoy,
this is Chinese chicken salad,
you know,

189
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.620
and you're jumping around in front of me like an asshole

190
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.390
<v 2>six Paki and shit.
Yeah,
sure.
Right.
You couldn't do that.
He didn't,</v>

191
00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:20.020
they would have to be paid actors,
otherwise you'd be an asshole.
Otherwise.
Well,

192
00:11:20.021 --> 00:11:22.270
I'm going to watch a video of how an asshole works out.

193
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.590
<v 3>Look at me was June.
I could see enjoy your pizza.</v>

194
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.200
I can see it taking off.
It's like that guy in Miami,
uh,
the Russian guy,

195
00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:35.810
he gets to people's faces,
you know,
like,
do you even lift bro?
That guy?
No,

196
00:11:35.811 --> 00:11:36.910
I don't know.
That is,
you don't really like,

197
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.050
he does this thing where he goes up to guys who are just obviously very jacked

198
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.340
and he's like,
Bro,
do you even lift?
And just like,
does that to like 20 of them?

199
00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:50.170
And do you know what the name of a more,
uh,
somebody,
I guarantee you,

200
00:11:50.171 --> 00:11:51.600
somebody will know who the fuck I'm talking about.

201
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.920
He's like Vitale or something that,
but he's this

202
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.730
<v 4>big personality Brian Tube.
And we'll start off.
Yeah,</v>

203
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.740
<v 0>podcasts with that car.
He's great.</v>

204
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.780
We'll start off the podcast as one of his cause.
That sounds awesome.
Uh,
anyway,

205
00:12:03.781 --> 00:12:05.340
go to [inaudible] dot com that is o,

206
00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:09.540
n n I t used the Codeword Rogan and you just save 10% off any and all

207
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:10.111
supplements.

208
00:12:10.111 --> 00:12:13.560
If you're thinking about trying kettlebells are any exercise routine,

209
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.910
and this is not a legal disclaimer,
this is just me as a friend to you.
Say,

210
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:21.030
please don't be a meathead police.
Start slow.

211
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.990
Please learn the proper form if you can.
If you can afford it,

212
00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:29.970
please hire a personal trainer and see if he'll let you videotape you doing it

213
00:12:29.971 --> 00:12:32.880
to make sure you get the idea that you're doing right.

214
00:12:32.881 --> 00:12:35.730
You can do certain exercises by herself in front of a mirror as long as you have

215
00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:39.780
proper form.
But proper form is critical to avoid injuries,

216
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.780
back injuries especially,
you could tweak yourself,

217
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:47.520
so please build your body up first,
like slowly.
Do it.
Do it the smart.

218
00:12:47.521 --> 00:12:51.510
If you're not a person that works out on a regular basis,
don't go crazy.

219
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.690
You want a slow build.
You don't want to break everything down.

220
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.390
Don't feel like you're being a pussy.
Like I only worked out 20 minutes today.

221
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.160
I bet 20 minutes is okay.

222
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.310
If you're not in good shape and you want to throw some kettle bells around for

223
00:13:02.311 --> 00:13:05.490
20 minutes,
that is,
I'll do a 20 minute workout all day.

224
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:08.460
I love 20 minute workouts.
People don't think that's enough.

225
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.340
You can get a good workout in 20 minutes.
My point being,

226
00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:14.220
if you're a person who doesn't exercise on a regular basis,

227
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.030
just slowly get into it.
Don't kill yourself because that's what people do.
They,

228
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.630
they get nutty and they say,
no,
I'm going to only drink water.
No more soda.

229
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.900
I'm going to fucking ruin seven miles every morning and in two weeks you're

230
00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:28.680
exhausted.
You've lost all your momentum,
you've tried too hard,
you went crazy.

231
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.180
<v 4>Not only that,
but you over compensate.
I'm kind of going through this right now,</v>

232
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.810
uh,
where I've been getting back into yoga now that I have a little bit more

233
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.000
stability and uh,

234
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.060
it's weird because after a really intense yoga class,

235
00:13:41.061 --> 00:13:44.270
I want to go out and drink or like do something unhealthy cause I feel like I've

236
00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:47.230
done something that was a sacrifice.
You know,
you're like,
all right,

237
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.450
now I can get back to my life.
But if you feel the sacrifice,
then you're,

238
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:50.781
you know,

239
00:13:50.781 --> 00:13:54.020
you're going to fuck yourself over later on by not going for the next three

240
00:13:54.021 --> 00:13:55.670
months or stopping whatever you're doing.

241
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.160
<v 0>Hmm.
Yeah.
It's,
it's also one of those things too that like you,</v>

242
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:04.030
I felt great satisfaction when I'm on a run of like working out where I don't

243
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:06.880
have any breaks,
but terrible satisfaction.

244
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.990
If I've slacked off for like two weeks,
if I go like two weeks ago a exercise,

245
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:14.380
I'm like,
oh my God,
what am I dealing?
Like I'm too busy.
This is crazy.

246
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:16.660
I got to work out.
I'm going to go fucking bananas here.

247
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.980
There's a big difference between how I,
like I feel like very satisfied.
Like,

248
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:25.390
I feel like I'm on a good path when I get a run in of like six weeks,

249
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.710
six days a week,
I'm working out fucking feel great.
Feel like getting shit done.

250
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:34.240
And when I don't feel like a dummy point being,
ladies and gentlemen,

251
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.840
please do this smart please.
If you can,
um,

252
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.510
take it slow and uh,
make sure you watch your diet too.

253
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.280
If you're looking for all these fat loss pills,

254
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:48.610
like that asshole doctor Oz just got popped in front of Congress for,

255
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.810
listen folks,

256
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.140
there's nothing out that's gonna make you burn fat is getting some shit that's

257
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:58.080
getting make you a stimulate.
You know,
it's going to stimulate your heart rate.

258
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.240
[inaudible] Jack you up.

259
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:04.241
But there's really nothing that's been proven that can take a fat person and

260
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:08.390
make them skinny.
There's some things that can help you burn fat.

261
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.570
There's things that can help your body metabolize calories more efficiently.

262
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.990
Enzymes are a big one.
Probe having,
uh,
the right,
uh,

263
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:23.030
stomach bacteria is big too.
Taking probiotics when at all possible.

264
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.050
You can do that.
Even like Vegan probiotics are actually really good.
Like,
um,

265
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.500
Kraut,
like raw Kraut,
really good for your stomach.

266
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.510
All that stuff's so important.

267
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.430
It's so important to just do start doing some research on what you put into your

268
00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:41.000
body.
Lots of green leafy vegetables.
Goddamn,
that's important.

269
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.080
I eat a lot of Kale and celery and like,

270
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:50.030
I like Green Spinach and cook it sometimes and I eat it raw sometimes.

271
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.320
That shit so important.
Um,

272
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:57.050
all these different things are important for optimization of your body.

273
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.801
Okay.
Shit.

274
00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:02.270
Together you fucks and go to onnit.com it's Oh and it uses the codeword Rogan

286
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.543
<v 0>Oh</v>

Uh,
but you can get them all at shops squad.</v>

288
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.710
Just hit collect lie.

289
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:48.070
<v 0>Yeah.
And um,
for Brian's desk squad podcast network,</v>

290
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.190
that's all available on Itunes,
you can subscribe to it.
And he's,

291
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.270
of course he has killed Tony,
which is hilarious.
Great show.

292
00:16:55.271 --> 00:16:58.620
I finally got to do that.
And the new kill Tony is not right now.
Right now.

293
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.740
Me and dom,
I rare and holy shit was dumb.
I rarer funny.
Oh my God,

294
00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:06.280
it was like dom over at its best.
It's like,
well you get to see dom Irrera.

295
00:17:06.281 --> 00:17:10.660
It is snarky,
snarky,
hilarious passed.
He's fucking awesome.
It was really,

296
00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:14.840
really fun.
And some funny comics too and some ones that were terrible,
right?

297
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.980
Perfect.
There's a perfect evening for field training.
She'll tell him he's a,
um,

298
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.110
uh,
podcast bar pal,
Tony Hinchcliffe and the podcast is all,
um,

299
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.380
Tony and the red band.
And a couple of other comics,

300
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.780
we'll sit down and then open minors.

301
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.060
Maybe some of them that have never done comedy ever.

302
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.600
They'll go up and they'll do like a minute and a,
it's really fun.

303
00:17:34.601 --> 00:17:35.321
It's really cool.

304
00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:38.920
And I think it's the closest thing that Brian does right now that I could see

305
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:41.050
being like a television show.
In fact,

306
00:17:41.051 --> 00:17:44.080
I think you probably better off because it's so good.

307
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.020
I think you'd probably better off not doing it as a television show,

308
00:17:47.021 --> 00:17:50.010
just producing for an online series sort of thing.
Like

309
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.570
<v 2>and like slowly but surely putting some money into it because I think it's like</v>

310
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:58.260
a show dude.
Like when I sat down in it,
you know what it felt like.
I was like,

311
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:01.260
this could easily be a comedy central show easily.

312
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.920
It's an easy premise to understand.
It's great fun.

313
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.280
You have comics giving advice to some comics and other ones that are just

314
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.320
insufferable that you just,
you have,

315
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.260
<v 1>don't just say you want to stay by me out to one.
It was really good with,
yeah.</v>

316
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:19.610
So fun.
I think Tony Hinchcliffe was there and also,
um,
princess chank,

317
00:18:19.611 --> 00:18:24.440
she was there that week.
Tony Design this idea.
Yeah,
we both came up with it.

318
00:18:24.441 --> 00:18:24.951
We started,

319
00:18:24.951 --> 00:18:28.040
he had an idea of that at the beginning and then we just kind of made it more of

320
00:18:28.041 --> 00:18:30.980
a show.
We added things like the bear,
the West Hollywood bear,

321
00:18:30.981 --> 00:18:35.981
and like the time limits we had the reoccurring females that come every show.

322
00:18:37.161 --> 00:18:39.410
So yeah,
it started out who are the two girls again?

323
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.510
Sarah wine shank and Kimberly Condon.

324
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:46.360
<v 2>These checks do a new,
a new minute every week,</v>

325
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.220
one new minute every week.

326
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.480
If you only knew how hard that is for someone who's just started talking to do

327
00:18:52.481 --> 00:18:57.460
comedy and his only been doing comedy.
Why while they've been on this show.

328
00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.890
So they've only been doing it for like a year,
right?
Yeah.

329
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.430
<v 1>Uh,
yeah,
just that we just had our one year anniversary.</v>

330
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.781
<v 2>Okay.</v>

331
00:19:02.781 --> 00:19:06.320
So they've only been doing it for that long and every week they do a new minute

332
00:19:06.321 --> 00:19:10.940
that the internet gets to listen to fucking incredibly courageous.

333
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.560
Like as far as comedians go,

334
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.300
that's incredibly courageous for a pro of a,

335
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:20.510
like a longterm pro to commit to a minute every week.
That will be hard.

336
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.540
Like if someone said,
hey,
you want to do a new minute every week,
I'd be like,
Ooh,

337
00:19:23.541 --> 00:19:28.130
that I put online.
Like sometimes a minute it's not ready.
Like I'll try it.

338
00:19:28.131 --> 00:19:31.490
I'm like this fucking jokes not ready.
Well guess what?
I'm sorry.

339
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.040
It's very unfortunate,
but the only way for it to get ready,

340
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.560
cause I have to tell it a bunch of times and it's gotta Eat Dick.

341
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:37.730
It's just got to,

342
00:19:37.731 --> 00:19:40.250
sorry if you were there when an eight deck one day it'll be awesome,

343
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.170
but they don't start out awesome.

344
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.310
They start out in this weird way and they sort of morph and grow well to be able

345
00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:47.144
to do that,

346
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.180
live on the Internet in front of a live audience and do a new minute every week.

347
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.850
Those chicks have fucking some serious chutzpah.

348
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.200
<v 1>Yeah,
it's great.
And it,
what's,</v>

349
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.700
what's really interesting is that the one girl who also is a usually on

350
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:07.140
dysentery with me,
Sarah,
Sarah wine shank.
And then Kimberly quick,

351
00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:08.500
quick college,
uh,

352
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.330
and she was about to graduate and quit college and started comedy on the show.

353
00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:16.960
So you saw the first set she did all the way up to a year later.
So awesome.

354
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.920
Yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's any,
we've had so much weird drama too.

355
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:23.160
We had this guy that dressed up as like an iron man,
you know,
and,
and,

356
00:20:23.161 --> 00:20:26.010
and you know,
he had drama and now we have like a weekly guest.

357
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:30.120
I couldn't imagine he would have drama that we have a weekly guy that dresses up

358
00:20:30.121 --> 00:20:34.560
as this guy called the iron patriot and a,
we have,
we had Jesus on your episode.

359
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.873
Jesus.

360
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.570
<v 2>You've had an interesting Jesus like quality to them.
Yeah,
I really did.
Anyway,</v>

361
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.990

Yep.

365

Schelok lock,

David Seaman team.

366
00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.930
And he knows things that she does

367
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.730
and he'll tell you them.

368
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.610
<v 4>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

<v 5>Try Rocky podcast all day.</v>

370
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.430
<v 0>Would you consider this?
Would you consider this?
That being your opening song,</v>

371
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.080
David Seaman knows about is just thinking that she knew a,

372
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.710
it's got to be my new voicemail message.

373
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.320
I'm feeling like you could do something with this.

374
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.380
I feel it's got a good melody to it.
Yeah,
it's catchy.
It's very catchy.

375
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.280
Devens even knows what you don't know.

376
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.380
Maybe a chorus or pizza at a couple of times.
Hmm.
Yeah.

377
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.760
Doug San hub is a great joke.

378
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.670
Ever seen that joke that he doesn't know about how lazy songwriting is.

379
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.630
He tells the same punchline over and over and over again and it keeps doing it

380
00:21:45.631 --> 00:21:48.360
and everyone gets uncomfortable and he goes,
dad say,

381
00:21:48.361 --> 00:21:50.950
see how fucking easy it is to write a song.

382
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.540
How do you see how lazy songwriters are?
It's really funny too,

383
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:57.880
because you don't know what he's doing until he's doing it.
Yeah.

384
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.090
He's fucking awesome.
That was off his last special.

385
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:06.180
<v 4>Yeah.
Dogs.
Hilarious.
He's being fair.
We see somebody like Adam Levine or a,</v>

386
00:22:06.181 --> 00:22:08.820
I'm only thinking of that because he's in a movie recently thinking about that

387
00:22:08.821 --> 00:22:11.880
cause it's beautiful.
Beautiful.
He just,

388
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.060
he locked down the voice and now he could say anything and people would be like,

389
00:22:15.061 --> 00:22:17.700
yeah,
you know,
like I'll buy that for 99 cents.

390
00:22:17.701 --> 00:22:19.680
Somebody out there would not necessarily me.

391
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.740
<v 0>Isn't it interesting that he sells acne stuff even though he's on the voice?</v>

392
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.380
Like he's on this big show,
but he's doing an infomercial.
Like he's like,

393
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.700
it's a contrast because usually like someone has to be like sort of sliding till

394
00:22:30.701 --> 00:22:34.330
when they pick up like a proactive or something type of commercial.
Right.

395
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.980
Isn't it a,
are usually like someone was,

396
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.570
<v 4>oh,
I see what you're saying.
Got Five people are no longer in the prime.
Yeah.</v>

397
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:42.640
And there's like,
there's a Shannen Doherty

398
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.190
<v 0>commercial for like,
uh,
some online course or something like that.</v>

399
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.740
Online university courses.
I forgot what it is,

400
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.610
but it's her wearing a bunch of different outfits and it's like,
you know,

401
00:22:52.611 --> 00:22:55.310
that she probably needed money and this is something that came along.

402
00:22:55.311 --> 00:22:57.320
But he's got guys like hugely famous.

403
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.190
<v 4>They probably gave him so much money that he's like,
fuck,
I don't,
you know,</v>

404
00:23:00.191 --> 00:23:04.000
an afternoon,
$3 million,
whatever.
Like,
if you look at Alec Baldwin,

405
00:23:04.001 --> 00:23:07.840
he has enough money,
right?
And he does the capital one shit constantly.
Yeah,

406
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.140
that's pretty Cheley that,

407
00:23:09.141 --> 00:23:12.010
that seems like kind of embarrassing for somebody that famous to do,

408
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:15.040
but they must have just given him a shit load of money and it's a good card and

409
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:16.000
he's like,
well I'll do it.

410
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.500
<v 0>I wonder if that's worth it.</v>

411
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.500
How many people do you think saw Alec Baldwin and go,
you know what,

412
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:24.840
that motherfuckers,
my banker,
I got to go to his bank.
How many people did that?

413
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.780
<v 4>I Dunno.
I just talked about it though.
So I mean it gets it.
He gets you do head,</v>

414
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.960
you wouldn't do it.
Right.
What I do,
what would I sign up because of that?

415
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.240
If you had no bank and you said I've got to get a bank,

416
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.020
I wouldn't choose it because of that.
No,
of course not.
Right.
Who would,

417
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.300
but it might,
it might like slide the balance.
If it was,

418
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.930
if I was already thinking like should I go with capital one or somebody else,

419
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.100
I might go,
well I liked Alec Baldwin

420
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.410
<v 2>20 years ago and red Octobers.
He's been good.</v>

421
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.060
A bunch of movies,
right?
Fucking Glengarry Glen Ross,

422
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:58.160
the park I hate when anybody tells me that was over the top.
Oh so over the top.

423
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.820
What that Shane with the watch and the whole piece for closers.
Yeah,

424
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:06.890
that was a fucking great scene.
Yeah,
he was a dick.
He was,
that was his character.

425
00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:10.940
He fuck people get weird with him cause he's so goofy in real life.
You know,

426
00:24:10.941 --> 00:24:14.120
he does so much goofy shit in real life that people don't respect his acting.

427
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.280
That dude can act as dick off.
You really can.
Fuck yeah,
he can that Glen Gary,

428
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:23.540
Glen Ross scene is fucking fantastic.
He's vicious.

429
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.470
Fucking cold,
hard capitalist.
And he's like,
this is the army.

430
00:24:28.471 --> 00:24:32.600
You pussies.
You don't get the Glengarry Glen Ross leads.
What did it say?

431
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:36.110
Only close to get those leads.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a great fucking scene.

432
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.500
That poor guy's always duking it out though with somebody.

433
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.160
It's like a flight attendant or recently as the cops arrested him for riding his

434
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:46.200
bike the wrong way,
he's going to like the wrong way on a street.
You know,

435
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:50.400
you can't run your bike there.
It would
shut up.
They cuff him.

436
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.690
New York cops so happier to cuff you.
If you're a fucking actor,

437
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:57.380
they're happy to cough you.
Oh,
we coughed Alec Baldwin today was awesome.

438
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:02.210
He smelled like liquor riding his bike drunk going down the wrong way

439
00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.440
that that guys always in some sort of a dispute with someone.

440
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:10.940
But the fun interesting people are,
you know,
I mean Mel Gibson,

441
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.930
you tell me Mel gives,

442
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:15.200
it did become more interesting to you after you heard him scream at his

443
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.810
girlfriend.
You should shut up and blow me.

444
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.580
His last name is actually pretty good.
The one about him escaping from Mexico.

445
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.270
I saw that.
Yeah,
I was a con.
This is actually like,
it's completely psychotic,

446
00:25:26.271 --> 00:25:29.540
but it was really entertaining.
You know,
he's kind of embracing it,
right?

447
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.290
It's embracing that he's crazy.
Like he's in the expendables movie,
you know,

448
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:36.380
he's embracing the,
the crazy aspects of all those recordings.

449
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.710
He's like the first casualty to that kind of shit.

450
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.770
Like the first real casualty to a big time movie star being sort of exposed like

451
00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:49.880
as a buy a,
I mean,
whatever you want to call or what would you call it,
Brian?

452
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.910
I don't want the temperatures.
Yeah,
something along those.
I don't know how to be,

453
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.790
I don't want to be sued to,
no,
I mean,

454
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.470
I'm like a,
that's an old term for catch wrestling.
Yeah.
A lot of those rushes,

455
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.250
they knew a lot of samba very similar to catch wrestling.

456
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.090
This is your call and asked for an escort dude.
You said that's a hooker.

457
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.930
How dare you?
I don't think she was that.
I think she was a mercenary though.

458
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.490
And uh,
her,
uh,
approach recording this crazy man.
It's Creamy,

459
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.320
but maybe,
you know what?
If you're that chick,

460
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:20.810
how else do you share that motherfucker doesn't kill you?

461
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.470
How do you know he's not going to Oju and all defense?
I mean,
in her defense,

462
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.740
everyone looked at it like that.
That woman was even what she did was evil.

463
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.920
It was that the whole thing's a disaster.
Okay,

464
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.240
let's stop thinking there's a black and white on this motherfucker.
That whole,

465
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.280
the whole situation was a total disaster.

466
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.660
You had a guy screaming you fucking cunt.
He's screaming,

467
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:45.060
I hope you get raped by a pack of niggers.
That's when he screamed.

468
00:26:45.061 --> 00:26:49.470
He screamed that on a recording.
Okay,
so he's clearly out of his fucking mind.

469
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.110
Isn't that amazing how many chances we give?
People are like,
yeah,

470
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:55.410
I'll go see his movie after that.
Yeah.
But my point being like,

471
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:58.210
she's probably out of her mind too.
Yeah.
You know,

472
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:02.580
she recorded him doing all this shit.
Like she put it out and she sold it.

473
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:06.320
I don't know how it got loose.
Got Her 15 grand from TMZ or something,

474
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.490
whatever it was.
But what's,
what's fascinating on,

475
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.130
on both accounts is that like they're together.
They mean what,
what,

476
00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.550
what caused her to be what they mean.

477
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:19.380
But both of them are making terrible choices.
You know,
she's recording him.

478
00:27:19.381 --> 00:27:21.180
He's completely insane.

479
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:24.360
It's like you're getting caught up in this whirlwind of Kookiness.

480
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.710
But in her defense,

481
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.360
how else would she react if she had a child with this guy?

482
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:34.380
And he's screaming and yelling crazy shit like that.
Like you don't,
you know,

483
00:27:34.381 --> 00:27:37.080
everybody looks at in terms of like she was mercenary and I agree.

484
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.010
She probably was definitely mercenary,
but a guy like that,
that's how it works.

485
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.360
If you're fucking 60 years old and you're starting to get old looking and you

486
00:27:45.361 --> 00:27:48.180
have this unbelievably hot young Russian check was really into,

487
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.800
you should probably suspect something.

488
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.280
You should probably suspect that she's not in love with the way you look.

489
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.350
She's not as attracted to you as you are to her.

490
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.530
You should probably suspect that she knows that you are an incredibly rich guy

491
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.070
who made like $300 million or something on the passion of the Christ.
Right.

492
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.250
What was,
how much money do you make?
Something insane,
right?

493
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.230
Funder it all himself lethal weapon at least.
Yeah.

494
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.180
I mean I don't think he made that model that he owned that one,

495
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:14.070
but he owned the thing about the passion of the Christ,

496
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:18.690
that he funded it himself and it was a huge international Fox News obsessed over

497
00:28:18.691 --> 00:28:21.240
that for like a month.
A lot of people went out to see it,

498
00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:25.050
I'm sure too at that movie,
was he huge?
The Passion of the Christ?

499
00:28:25.051 --> 00:28:27.600
Let's find out how much money that made.
Let's guess before we look.

500
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.570
I said it's dead now though.
Have you ever heard anyone saying they saw it on TV?

501
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.920
Like they don't play that at all.
You can't even buy that anymore probably.
Oh,

502
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:38.030
I'm sure you can.
But I think what happened?
What do you that Jim Caviezel guy.

503
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.880
It didn't work again for a long time.
And you got to play Jesus.
Yeah,

504
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.440
he didn't work again for a long time.
He's doing something now.

505
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.320
Is he in the desert now?
Like wandering around about 20 years,
man,

506
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.830
I think he's on a show now or maybe a new movie now.
I don't know.

507
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:52.020
But he's doing some stuff now.
He's a very good actor.

508
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:57.180
So it's kind of unfortunate.
But I heard they didn't want a little cries.
Um,

509
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.890
let's guess,
um,
what do you guests before we look at how much money it made?

510
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.160
I don't know,
but I bet Daniel Day Lewis would have been a way better Jesus,

511
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.520
because he would have really gotten into it.
Yeah.

512
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.780
I'm going to go up 150 million.
That's my number.
Brian,
don't cheat.
Don't cheat.

513
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.360
You can't be cheating.
We're having a competition yet,
bro.
Hey,
hey.
Hey.

514
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.800
Don't let that fucking bitch.
Okay.
Oh my God is bigger than I thought.

515
00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:27.000
Really bigger than you think.
I would say.
Wow.
Holy Shit.

516
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.210
$215 million.
Keep going,
bitch.
Wow.

517
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.860
That's just domestic son.

518
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.520
Ready for this domestic 370,274,604

519
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:47.010
<v 0>foreign,
another 241,116,490</v>

520
00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.150
<v 1>holy shit.
You guys are going to see Jesus coin in the next few weeks,</v>

521
00:29:50.151 --> 00:29:55.151
so more than half a billion dollar just driven by people supporting him because

522
00:29:55.611 --> 00:29:55.790
he's

523
00:29:55.790 --> 00:30:00.260
<v 0>pursuing a religious topic and most of the time how I would ignore is that dude,</v>

524
00:30:00.261 --> 00:30:03.710
it's opening weekend was $83 million.

525
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.620
How much did it cost to make though?
I don't know,
man.
Oh my God.
Wow.

526
00:30:09.621 --> 00:30:12.680
Three look at this shit.
3000 theaters.

527
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.270
Wow.
$27,000 a show average.
Ain't never think about it that way.

528
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.411
You don't.

529
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:23.380
You ever think about it when you're looking at like what the actual numbers are

530
00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:28.210
for a movie like that,
$83 million a made in the first week out.
Suck it.

531
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:33.030
I'm Mel Gibson Karate.
That was a crazy movie too,

532
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.060
if you,
if you've watched it,

533
00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:37.720
it was just the entire movie was like this sadist dream.

534
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.470
I just guy just getting the fuck beat out of them and it's so hard to discern a

535
00:30:41.471 --> 00:30:43.480
plot and it's all implied.

536
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.900
Like you have to know that the guys already Jesus for the movie to have any sort

537
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:50.290
of an impact.
So it was essentially a movie that he made for the insiders.

538
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.170
Like you made it for the people that already knew that Jesus story.

539
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.890
Because if you didn't know who Jesus was and you saw that movie wasn't very

540
00:30:56.891 --> 00:31:00.610
informative on who Jesus's,
it was kind of weird.
It was like,

541
00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:02.740
why are they beating the fuck out of his colleague?
What's going on?

542
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.680
How come he's not worried?
He's not even freaking out.
He's got magic.

543
00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:06.514
He doesn't use it.

544
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.370
How can we start using the magic while you're letting those guys beat the fuck

545
00:31:09.371 --> 00:31:10.840
out of you?
Software,
religious people.

546
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.290
<v 1>It hadn't had $30 million budget.
Awesome.</v>

547
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.290
<v 0>Kapow so $53 million.
The first look at this fucking look at these numbers.</v>

548
00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.290
370 million,

549
00:31:21.291 --> 00:31:26.291
782,930 domestic sock.

550
00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.990
So Mel Gibson was just
to scream at this Russian chick,

551
00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.470
you know,
I mean that was probably what was going on.

552
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:39.850
His head shot up and blow man.
Hey he didn't,

553
00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:43.820
he like fun to her like recording sessions and stuff.
Like it was trying to like,

554
00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.980
she was trying to be a singer.
That's right.
So sorted,
sorted,

555
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.190
sad.

556
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:54.740
<v 1>You see the,
the,
the video that I posted of the two women stealing,
uh,</v>

557
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.870
some guys,
uh,
like furniture or whatever,

558
00:31:57.871 --> 00:32:01.650
those things are on the beach when you have like a big tent and he,
you know,

559
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.650
he caught Anna.
Yeah,
Cabana.
He walked,
checks are stealing it.

560
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.220
He walked up on him going,
excuse me.
Hey,
how are you guys doing today?

561
00:32:08.221 --> 00:32:10.320
And it's older women in Florida.

562
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.860
We're just took all his bags and stuff and they had them all in the middle and

563
00:32:13.861 --> 00:32:17.320
then they were taking down his thing and acting like it was theirs and condoms,

564
00:32:17.321 --> 00:32:21.150
stealing it.
The second he's,
he's like,
get the fuck away from it.
You know,

565
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.290
they start coming at him like and attacking them.
It is one of,

566
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.250
it's one of those videos like that,
that draw play the drone video times.

567
00:32:28.251 --> 00:32:29.084
And here's another one,

568
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.490
<v 0>dude,
I got to see this.
It's got a backlog of awesome videos.</v>

569
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.943
<v 6>Okay.</v>

570
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:44.060
<v 7>Any Shit?
Oh,
you need some help?</v>

571
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.880
Yeah.
This is our stuff.
Yes.

572
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.810
No,
it is.
This is all ours.
All of it.

573
00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:01.370
The chairs,
the bag.
This is all our stuff.
My kids.
Yeah,

574
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.810
that's my kids.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
It's what these olds do.

575
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:06.770
They steal from the young.

576
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:14.600
I want to see.
It's okay.
I'll let it slide,
but I'm glad I made it in time.

577
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.860
No,
no,
no.
Step away from my shit.
How about that?

578
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.750
And then I'm going to take a camera and putting in the grass that you would like

579
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.593
that

580
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.430
<v 3>whoa.
Was that real?
Yeah,
it seems to be real.
I mean,</v>

581
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.840
it's being reported on use and stuff like that.

582
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.030
He's got over 1.6 million hits and it cost nothing to make.

583
00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:50.690
I wonder if you shut the phone off and whipped her ass.
Yeah,
right.

584
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.270
I've been trying to search it,
uh,
you know,

585
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.390
news reports for it and see like an official,
you know,

586
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:59.540
like a police report or anything.
I just don't think he filed the police.

587
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:02.540
But I looked at it as older videos and it was just him and his kids,
you know,

588
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:04.760
singing cars and stuff,
you know,
so it,

589
00:34:04.761 --> 00:34:07.670
it doesn't seem like he added no extra that praying group,

590
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:12.200
but he actually did catch it.
Well.
Well look man,
young criminals become older.

591
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:14.390
Criminals know,
you see some 60 year old ladies.

592
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.810
Don't just assume that they're sweet and kind because they look like your mom.

593
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:18.770
Right.
You know,
there's,

594
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:22.490
I have some friends that have moms that are criminals to stray criminals.

595
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.250
You know,
I'm,
I'm my friend,
his mom and his dad,

596
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.870
both of them scamming credit card scams,
all kinds of crazy shit.
Like,
you can't,

597
00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:32.330
if they're following you,
you gotta go a circuitous route.

598
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:33.860
The fuck away from them.
They want,

599
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.470
you don't want them knowing where you live there.
They're criminals and they,

600
00:34:36.471 --> 00:34:39.590
but they look like grandpa's.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean that's,
that happens.

601
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.170
You can get those.
Does that boil your blood at all?

602
00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:44.330
Cause that gets my heart racing.
It does get your heart rate.

603
00:34:44.331 --> 00:34:47.210
You always get your heart rate to be being attacked while you're holding a

604
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:51.270
camera.
I know.
Remember the,
yeah,
do remember it.
Yeah.

605
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.700
You should really talk about that.

606
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:57.740
Well we almost had an incident with young Brian,
but yeah,

607
00:34:57.741 --> 00:35:01.250
I mean hitting people,
people hitting people like that,
like went,

608
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.010
then obviously they're stealing this guy stuff.
All right.

609
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.370
And they're hitting him and I wonder how long coming out on was it therefore

610
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.970
like was it left there for hours?
Good question.
Five minutes.
Was it a setup?

611
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.350
Who knows?
Moon fucking know.
That would be a crazy thing to do.

612
00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:18.980
Set some shit out and then set a camera up from distance and then when it starts

613
00:35:18.981 --> 00:35:21.340
stealing it,
come down and go,
hey,
fuck,
I understand that my style,

614
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.200
if you were saying that the rest of his social media stuff,
family,

615
00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.770
they know like singing in the car.
I hope he's right.

616
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.080
What if he was on Ambien and shit?
It wasn't really his stuff.

617
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:33.740
And they break the fuck out of a,
we're taking his side.
You know,
Jamie,

618
00:35:33.741 --> 00:35:38.070
you got to find out if it's real.
I don't know if it's

619
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.740
<v 0>real.
So,
um,
I can't really comment,</v>

620
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:43.590
but if it is real and they were stealing stuff and then they were beating him up

621
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.890
at what point in time,
like if you know,
those women are criminals,
like Brian,

622
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:50.460
let me ask you this.
You're not a violent guy at all.
You're a very friendly guy.

623
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.470
And if you were in a situation like that,
we were,

624
00:35:52.471 --> 00:35:55.380
stuff was left out and you came up to it and these old ladies were,

625
00:35:55.381 --> 00:35:58.580
we're stealing your stuff.
And then when you start talking about it,
they,
uh,

626
00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.230
put the camera down and they started hitting on you.
Would you fight back?

627
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.251
<v 1>Uh,</v>

628
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:06.750
I would keep the video on as much as possible and then kick away and I kind of,

629
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.730
did you go to your back and do like a guard?
No,
I would do strong arm.

630
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.460
Uh,
I would do,
you know,
like just the Heisman.
Yeah.

631
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.280
Just like get the fuck away from me while recording.
You know,

632
00:36:17.281 --> 00:36:18.900
I've been in situations like this before.

633
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:22.050
I mean I always pull out my camera immediately and hit record.

634
00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:26.400
I had a weird police incident that happened recently that I pulled out my camera

635
00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:28.950
to start recording him while he was talking to me.
You know,

636
00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:31.650
it's just like I am now to the point where accorded a cop.

637
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.570
I'm not showing it.
No,
I have to.
Yeah.
You want to court?
No,
no,
no,

638
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:42.390
no.
It happened.
No,
I just don't.
Um,
uh,

639
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.590
I'll say that a house,
not in Burbank.

640
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.600
<v 0>Was There underage drinking involved?
No,</v>

641
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:53.780
<v 1>but we are at or at this person's house and uh,</v>

642
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:58.810
we were just talking by my car and the cop pulls up and just comes out and goes,

643
00:36:58.971 --> 00:37:02.900
Sirk Sirk I need to see your Id.
And,
and I'm just like,
Eh,
this is my house.

644
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:06.820
And Goes,
oh right,
I don't care.
What are you doing here?
And he just started like,

645
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.400
like yelling at you and all of a sudden,
and it's just like,
come on,
what's up?

646
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.550
All right,
hold on.
I pull out my recorder and I'm going,
well,

647
00:37:12.551 --> 00:37:15.830
what's the problem officer?
This is my house.
You're on my property.

648
00:37:15.831 --> 00:37:18.140
What is going on?
He goes,
I need to see your Id.
And you know,

649
00:37:18.141 --> 00:37:22.070
it was just like this whole thing.
It's like finally we just being like,
like,

650
00:37:22.071 --> 00:37:25.390
why the fuck are you,
I mean,
bothering me was impossible

651
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.970
<v 0>that they were looking for someone who looks like you who had done something</v>

652
00:37:28.971 --> 00:37:30.380
fucked up.
Now they were on foot.

653
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.280
<v 1>What he says is,
he's like,</v>

654
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.880
I just find it peculiar that you're sitting outside this house at two o'clock

655
00:37:35.881 --> 00:37:40.080
with that book bag.
And I'm like,
yeah,
it's just got off work.
I this,

656
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:42.870
this camera gear,
it was from kill Tony.
And I was like,

657
00:37:42.871 --> 00:37:45.570
this is all my camera gear.
And he goes,
yeah,
but you and I'm like,

658
00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:49.530
so I'm not allowed to be at my house on my property with a book bag without

659
00:37:49.531 --> 00:37:54.040
getting yelled at at what it's like to be black.
They're allowed to say no.

660
00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:57.930
It's like to be black.
Yeah.
You had a taste of it.
Yeah.
I,
it's,
it's,
you know,

661
00:37:57.931 --> 00:38:00.260
I understand what he was doing,
but I also understand work.

662
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.700
Like what do you mean in this girl we're having a serious conversation.

663
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:06.300
He just cock blocked and ruined everything that I've ever,
right.

664
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:10.650
Yeah.
I've built up to like,
there was like a magic part that was coming on,

665
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.010
you know,
she's about to go,
okay,
I'll come in and fuck you.
You know,

666
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.680
and now it's ruined because now it's just like,
what the fuck happened?

667
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:20.620
I need to go home.
It's late.
You know,
indeed that's interfering.
It's mine.

668
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:22.010
He caught fucking rights.

669
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.640
<v 0>Definitely fine.
If he asks you questions,</v>

670
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.110
I mean it's definitely fine if he sees you standing on the lawn of this house

671
00:38:30.111 --> 00:38:32.930
and he wonders whether or not you're going in,
but then he's got to let it go.

672
00:38:32.931 --> 00:38:34.280
He doesn't have any rights beyond that.

673
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.970
The problem is once someone starts to think that you're guilty of something,

674
00:38:36.971 --> 00:38:39.790
they want to,
they want to believe that they were right.
You know,
they want,

675
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.460
especially if there's any sort of a hostility between you and them.

676
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.210
Sometimes people perceive that cops perceive that,

677
00:38:45.211 --> 00:38:49.060
like any disrespect between them as like some resistance of what they do or

678
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:49.894
their authority.

679
00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:53.320
So they want to impose it on you now and get you to do something and you're
like,

680
00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:54.280
I'm not fucking doing that.

681
00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:57.280
And then all of a sudden you were involved in this altercation over nothing.

682
00:38:57.281 --> 00:39:00.790
You know,
and you were innocent.
You're an innocent person.
But the,
the ego,

683
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.600
the cop gets in the way.
That definitely can happen with the wrong personalities.

684
00:39:04.601 --> 00:39:05.650
Even with good cops.

685
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.940
<v 1>There's also been a lot of incidences lately where I feel like,</v>

686
00:39:08.941 --> 00:39:10.890
especially when I'm in my car,
I'm like,
man,

687
00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:14.580
I need to remember to just put my Gopro on in my car and just record everything.

688
00:39:14.581 --> 00:39:18.390
I'm doing it while I'm driving because I mean there's been so much crazy shit

689
00:39:18.391 --> 00:39:19.230
that that's been like,

690
00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:22.170
I saw a guy jumped into traffic the other day and get hit and I'm like,

691
00:39:22.171 --> 00:39:26.130
why didn't you do that?
Like I watched him jump into it like,

692
00:39:26.131 --> 00:39:28.410
and he was just like a drug addict and he,
you know,

693
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:31.590
I don't know what he was doing.
I think it was alive and everything.

694
00:39:31.591 --> 00:39:33.870
I just kept on driving.
Like I saw a woman shitting.

695
00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:36.720
Like I think I said I shitting in the middle of the street.
Like I'm like,
what?

696
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:39.840
But I also think like,
especially with these videos that have been coming up,

697
00:39:39.841 --> 00:39:42.720
just women attacking and like Anthony gets saying,

698
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.010
that woman said that he was going to,

699
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.860
that woman has got like if he called the police was going to say that he was

700
00:39:46.861 --> 00:39:48.860
raped,
she was raped or you know,
attacking her

701
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:51.870
<v 0>or whatever.
That's what he said,
that she said that,
um,
when she was hitting him,</v>

702
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.480
she was saying that she was going to say that he sexually assaulted her.
Right,

703
00:39:55.481 --> 00:39:56.100
right.

704
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.550
<v 1>And by the way,
it's the and Anthony thing.</v>

705
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.410
<v 0>Yeah.
The opie and Anthony thing,
if you don't know,
um,</v>

706
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.560
our friends open Anthony Anthony.
Cool.

707
00:40:02.561 --> 00:40:07.561
Mia was in New York City and he was taking photographs and they got a photograph

708
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:12.610
of a woman and this woman got very upset that he took a photograph of her.

709
00:40:12.611 --> 00:40:15.850
So some sort of an altercation took place.
Um,

710
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:19.570
some words were exchanged and she started hitting him.
So she was hitting him.

711
00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.190
And if you don't know Anthony,

712
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:24.100
you don't know that he's a gun nut and like a legit gun,

713
00:40:24.101 --> 00:40:27.730
not who actually has a license to conceal carry in New York City,

714
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.400
which is incredibly difficult to obtain.

715
00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.320
But here's one strike for,
uh,

716
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.370
people who want people to have guns.
Anthony never pulled out that gun,

717
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.880
never even seen it.
He obviously felt threatened.

718
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.840
He was getting hit by this one woman who,
Anthony is a nice guy,

719
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.560
but he is,
you know,
51 years old,

720
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:54.460
loves his drinking and I don't think he lifts weights that much.

721
00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.350
It's not like he's just like big scary,
you know Quentin Jackson,

722
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.280
rampage Jackson looking dude,
you know he's a,
he's a thin guy.
He's not a,

723
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:08.550
not a physically imposing guy and this chick is beaten on him and he's got a gun

724
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:11.170
on them.
I don't,
I wasn't there.

725
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:14.560
So obviously I don't know what the tone the situation was.

726
00:41:14.561 --> 00:41:16.270
I don't know how it got started.
I don't know.

727
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.540
I've read very little about it other than he went on this rampage calling her an

728
00:41:22.211 --> 00:41:25.600
animal and a cunt and all this,
all these different,
but what's,

729
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:30.580
what's hilarious is everything that he said and his Twitter rampage that they're

730
00:41:30.581 --> 00:41:35.581
firing him before he said on the radio show and they hired him for

731
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:38.990
the radio show.

732
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:43.991
If you paid attention to what he said over the years and why he's entertaining

733
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:49.040
in how he says it,
he gets crazy about racial situations.

734
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.060
He gets crazy about certain aspects of the African American community and he's

735
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:54.230
done it for ever.

736
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:59.710
And so these things that he said after getting punched that they were surprising

737
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:04.490
to serious who had heard him say these things and they gave him checks.

738
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.170
It's kind of hilarious.

739
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:10.550
And also like one of the things that people are pointing out all over la all

740
00:42:10.551 --> 00:42:11.384
over.
Um,

741
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.600
the twittersphere is they're showing all these lyrics to rap songs that Sirius

742
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:20.000
has aired since Anthony got fired for tweeting.

743
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:25.310
And the lyrics are ridiculous.
I mean,
oh yeah,
dude,
it's hardcore rap.
They,

744
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.180
they air hardcore rap lyrics.
So they've got,
you know,

745
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:33.590
Nigga this and shoot,
suck my dick and this bitch isn't that pitches.

746
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:37.910
And you know,
the craziest,
most a radical,
you know,

747
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:38.744
hip hop shit.

748
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.910
And yet Anthony gets in trouble for this thing that he did where he went on this

749
00:42:43.911 --> 00:42:48.470
Twitter rampage and said a bunch of shit that he's,
I bet you could.

750
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:50.870
I bet if someone was a real opiate Anthony Fan,

751
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.080
you could probably go back through all the opiate Anthony shows and piece

752
00:42:55.081 --> 00:43:00.081
together him actually saying those words that are in those tweaks

753
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.680
<v 4>that's serious makes money off of racist.
That's serious.
Makes money off of,
well,</v>

754
00:43:04.681 --> 00:43:06.700
you know what man,
here's the thing.
Um,

755
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.320
I think what happens is that these companies get really terrified of the Twitter

756
00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:13.380
storm.
Yeah.
They get like,
you saw that with a,

757
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.520
well you see it all the time with the sponsors for rush Limbaugh,

758
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:20.670
but you see it with or I believe conservative radio in general.
You see it with,

759
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.550
uh,
like Donald Trump had a,
I forget what it was,

760
00:43:23.551 --> 00:43:25.530
a tie collection or some shit at Macy's.

761
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.560
Then there are all these people on Twitter like tweeting the Macy's account.

762
00:43:28.561 --> 00:43:31.800
Like don't support him because I don't remember what the issue was,
but they,

763
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:35.010
once it gets going,
the company feels overwhelmed and they're like,

764
00:43:35.011 --> 00:43:39.510
we have to respond because a thousand people just retweeted this thing and they,

765
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.450
I think they just feel like the best route is the 48 laws of power thing where

766
00:43:43.451 --> 00:43:46.650
you just put a head on the chopping block and,
and think later.

767
00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.540
<v 0>Oh,
I see their point of view.
I do if you,</v>

768
00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:52.060
but I don't think they were fans of the opiate Anthony show.

769
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.150
That's what I think is part of what's going on.
I don't think they listened.

770
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:57.160
I think there weren't a lot of people could play anything.

771
00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.430
They just like the money coming in.
So it's a great show.

772
00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.170
It's the reason why we're doing this show.

773
00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:05.260
The reason why we're doing this shows because of opie and Anthony.
Oh,

774
00:44:05.261 --> 00:44:08.740
a lot of ways.
There's a direct chain of influences.
Um,

775
00:44:08.741 --> 00:44:10.300
one of them being Tom Green,

776
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.510
Tom Green had his own show in his house way back in the day.

777
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.990
And I remember going over there and be like,
this is the craziest shit ever.

778
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:18.520
He's got server room,

779
00:44:18.521 --> 00:44:21.670
he's got a Goddamn server room with cables all through his living room and he

780
00:44:21.671 --> 00:44:25.690
turned his living room into a television show.
He just did a little too early.

781
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.800
He had a great innovative idea.
He did it a little too early.
That influence us.

782
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:34.590
Anthony Kumina me greatly.
When he did live at the compound,
he did,

783
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:38.700
he does this thing live at the compound where he set up a studio in his house in

784
00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:40.650
Long Island and in his,

785
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.310
in his basement he has a green screen and he'll fucking sing while he's holding

786
00:44:44.311 --> 00:44:46.200
guns.
Dude,
he's singing songs.

787
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:51.030
He's singing karaoke while he's holding assault rifles.
All right.
And that,

788
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.520
I don't know if they have a page,

789
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:57.600
but that shit is hilarious and I saw him doing that while he was still on opie

790
00:44:57.601 --> 00:45:00.660
and Anthony who was doing it just for fun and I was like,
oh my God,

791
00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:02.670
this is genius.
He set up a green screen.

792
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.290
He set up in a a real like professional stage with a green screen and behind the

793
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:10.560
green screen and you would have like video of Manhattan or he would have like,

794
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.240
like I was going to totally steal that idea.

795
00:45:12.241 --> 00:45:14.310
I might still put a green screen behind me.

796
00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:19.420
It for a w if we do get that track quarter cried tri caster thing that we'll do

797
00:45:19.531 --> 00:45:22.020
it.
Uh,
in respect to Anthony,

798
00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.690
<v 4>I have a,
I have a green screen in my apartment.
Kind of weird shit.
Are you up to,</v>

799
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.280
it's kind of a kind of low end cause it's just the green cloth that's the right

800
00:45:31.281 --> 00:45:33.260
color.
Right.
But then you use I movie,

801
00:45:33.261 --> 00:45:36.590
you switch out the background and suddenly instead of being in your apartment,

802
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:40.130
you have this subtle background or maybe it's the city or wherever the fuck it

803
00:45:40.131 --> 00:45:42.950
is.
You find something on flicker and then people take it a little bit more

804
00:45:42.951 --> 00:45:45.980
seriously because you're not just some crazy rambling in your kitchen.

805
00:45:45.981 --> 00:45:46.310
You're like,

806
00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:50.210
oh I see somebody spent a little bit of time on this and people will watch.

807
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:52.910
I like that.
Yeah.
It's pretty cool.
Everybody out there should do it.

808
00:45:52.911 --> 00:45:55.970
Go on Amazon and get like a green screen kit.
They're not expensive.

809
00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.300
That's not everybody.
If you're like just the fucking idiot,
I'll do it.

810
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.500
But if you have something to say,

811
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.650
this is the way to not seem like a crazy person on youtube.

812
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:09.190
A crazy person on youtube just told you how to not say things and do things to

813
00:46:09.531 --> 00:46:11.750
make you know completely everybody on Youtube.

814
00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.010
That's like one of the easiest ways to dismiss people.

815
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.870
Always just kind of a youtube show fucking guy on youtube saying which crazy

816
00:46:17.871 --> 00:46:21.800
show on youtube.
Right?
Isn't that like,
it's sort of a,
a term of dismissal,

817
00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:26.210
isn't it?
Yeah.
I think it's all changing.
I think now people are kind of,
uh,

818
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:28.730
I'm not even a big Youtuber,
I just do it from time to time.

819
00:46:28.731 --> 00:46:32.450
But I think people are definitely intimidated by things like the young Turks

820
00:46:32.451 --> 00:46:36.680
where it is clear that it's more powerful than half the cable shows out there.

821
00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.350
And so the only thing they can do,
and this is something that he's talked about,

822
00:46:39.351 --> 00:46:41.920
his dismiss it and be like,
oh,
it's not the real thing.
But yeah,

823
00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:46.330
this is realer than probably anything on the radio right now.
So we're,
uh,

824
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.430
so what he's doing is realer than,
I mean his numbers,

825
00:46:49.431 --> 00:46:53.890
he can verify the numbers that they're using.
Like Nielsen's,
yeah,

826
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:57.170
come on you two dozen.
Youtube does not fuck around with their numbers.

827
00:46:57.171 --> 00:46:58.310
They're very serious about it.

828
00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.000
<v 0>Well,
they absolutely,
that's absolutely true.</v>

829
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:02.940
But it's also that it's a number that you could watch and see.
I mean,

830
00:47:02.941 --> 00:47:05.880
like you can't,
you can tell me whatever you want about the Nielsens,

831
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:09.390
but the reality is you only have a certain amount of households.

832
00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.270
Like I don't know how many,
it's,
there's some fuckery in there.

833
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.930
There's some number of differences and they,
they can tell you all,
all day long.

834
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.760
Well,
we've just statistically analyzed how well it works.
I don't believe you.

835
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.460
You know why I don't believe you?
Because the Internet says so.

836
00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:26.230
<v 4>Well,
it's in their best interest to inflate their numbers.</v>

837
00:47:26.231 --> 00:47:29.170
They get more advertising dollars.
That's probably what's happening,

838
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.070
but I don't need think

839
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.860
<v 0>of would think it's inflating.
I think by their algorithm,</v>

840
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:35.950
this is what the numbers that they've calculated,
it's probably pretty close.

841
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.860
They're probably pretty close.
But why would you want pretty close?
When do,

842
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:41.460
you can get absolutely exact and that's what the Internet offers.

843
00:47:41.461 --> 00:47:44.500
So when they talk shit on like chank and like the young Turks,

844
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.620
which just look at the numbers,
look at how many downloads.
You know what that is?

845
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.270
That's real.
It's a real number.

846
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:54.340
It's not like 15,000 households all across the Midwest,

847
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.850
you know?
I mean,
I don't understand the Nielsens at all.
I never understood it.

848
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:01.330
It's,
it's Voodoo and unless they can accurately,

849
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.810
every time you wash something,
a little counter should go over.

850
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.030
Every time you watch it at home where you watch it.

851
00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:10.750
Maybe it's a an app that we all were on their fucking Google glasses or

852
00:48:10.751 --> 00:48:11.584
something like that,

853
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:15.010
that measures what you're watching so we can all figure it out.

854
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.590
But until they do that,
you don't really know.

855
00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.480
<v 3>It should already have that though.
Based on what cable companies know,</v>

856
00:48:20.481 --> 00:48:21.740
what channel you're watching,

857
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.060
<v 0>do what?
They don't share that information.</v>

858
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.000
They say they know how many people are watching what on satellite,

859
00:48:27.001 --> 00:48:30.480
but they can't use it as a ratings thing because it's probably like some NSA

860
00:48:30.481 --> 00:48:32.760
type shit.
You're not even supposed to be doing that.

861
00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:36.150
And that's supposed to be monitoring people's viewing habits and find out that

862
00:48:36.151 --> 00:48:38.610
they've been ordering Debbie,
Debbie dirty debutantes

863
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:43.460
<v 3>over and over again and clearing their history.
You know,
I do.</v>

864
00:48:43.461 --> 00:48:46.160
I don't think that does shit.
I think there's probably a second copy somewhere.

865
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.810
It goes off into the cloud and you're,

866
00:48:47.811 --> 00:48:49.640
especially if you're ordering some freak shit,

867
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.280
if you're ordering some freak shit to hear about the,
uh,

868
00:48:52.281 --> 00:48:57.281
there was a thing about tour where apparently one of the NSA programs actually

869
00:48:57.411 --> 00:49:01.250
flags you for further review.
If you're using tour tour,
what's tour?

870
00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:06.290
That's the anonymous anonymized web browser that people use to surf without

871
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:11.480
giving away their identity.
Really?
Yeah.
So if you use it,
you get flagged.
Exactly.

872
00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:12.320
Just for using it.

873
00:49:12.321 --> 00:49:15.320
They consider you to be like some kind of elevated or know the word they used as

874
00:49:15.321 --> 00:49:18.200
extremists,
which I think is so ridiculous because the people use tour,

875
00:49:18.201 --> 00:49:19.830
our journalists,
uh,

876
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.400
activists and probably like bored kids in college who were like,

877
00:49:22.401 --> 00:49:26.320
I'm going to try tour.
Um,
like they said,
extremists,
extremists,

878
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:29.330
the fuck are you talking about dude,
who are the biggest freaks in the world?

879
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:34.130
Journalists and college kids.
Every one of them rolls on an Internet course.

880
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.800
That would be like the number one way to,
I've only used it once.

881
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:44.120
The problem is it's way slow.
It needs to really,
it's frustrating to use.

882
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:47.330
You didn't worry when you signed up to use it that you would be flagged.

883
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.300
I assume I'm already on there.
I think.
I think I'm on a good one.

884
00:49:50.301 --> 00:49:52.900
I think I talked to the other day about,
you know,

885
00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.570
you imagine though for a second there you started to sweat it.
No,
I was excited.

886
00:49:56.571 --> 00:50:01.310
I was like,
Ooh,
let's hear about this.
But uh,
no.
Um,
the tour issue,

887
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:04.610
it just goes to show you how fucked up things are that they considered that

888
00:50:04.611 --> 00:50:05.570
extreme.
Yeah.

889
00:50:05.571 --> 00:50:09.410
It's kind of weird that you're preserving your anonymity would automatically put

890
00:50:09.411 --> 00:50:10.490
you in this weird bracket.

891
00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:14.690
But I guess like if you thought about like who are the extreme people that would

892
00:50:14.691 --> 00:50:17.760
use this,
that would be dangerous and how many of the people,

893
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.810
I guess their definition of dangerous in our definition is different.
Like,

894
00:50:20.811 --> 00:50:23.840
I would like to see activists,
right.
Network and out,

895
00:50:23.841 --> 00:50:27.020
like companies dumping pollution.
I don't really give a shit about that,

896
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.070
want to see that happen,

897
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.840
<v 4>but they consider that to be,
you know,</v>

898
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:33.680
a threat to national security because it threatens the balance of power.

899
00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:38.510
<v 0>But yeah,
no,
you're totally right.
It's,
uh,
it's,
it's easy to make both arguments.</v>

900
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.540
That's the problem.
It's an,
it's one of those situations where,
yeah,

901
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:45.080
if you did that and you looked at everybody's background when you found them

902
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:48.890
using this and analyzing,
analyzing it,
anonymous,

903
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:53.240
anonymizing and optimizing and optimizing web browser,
you'd go,
well,
you know,

904
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:55.310
it's probably a good pool to look through.

905
00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:00.780
The thing is like could I accurately rely on them to look at a guy like David

906
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.421
Seaman and go,
oh no,

907
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:06.110
this is actually just a smart young guy who's looking at the world and doesn't

908
00:51:06.111 --> 00:51:08.960
like all the bullshit he sees and he thinks that we can do better.

909
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:11.480
It really that simple.
That's your agenda.
That's how I'd take you.

910
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:13.450
Am I accurate in my assessment of view or are you

911
00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:16.260
<v 4>pretty accurate?
I get frustrated by person.</v>

912
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:21.570
I get frustrated by seeing stupidity and callousness and I think we're seeing

913
00:51:21.571 --> 00:51:25.260
like a nice combination of that and we're also on the other side seeing progress

914
00:51:25.261 --> 00:51:29.490
and I'm attracted to progress so I'm just trying to like push the ball and you

915
00:51:29.491 --> 00:51:29.581
know,

916
00:51:29.581 --> 00:51:33.150
talk about things that I think are actually helping while also reminding people

917
00:51:33.151 --> 00:51:34.770
that a lot of this stuff has not been fixed.

918
00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.860
<v 0>I think you were also doing a great service in that you are doing it in this</v>

919
00:51:38.861 --> 00:51:43.861
uncensored form through the Internet very courageously and you're a part of

920
00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.840
what's now like this whole,
there's a,

921
00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:51.250
and it's all connected in a lot of ways to the the new corporations to like

922
00:51:51.251 --> 00:51:53.830
Google and these new technological corporations.

923
00:51:53.831 --> 00:51:57.370
They all seem to have an ethic about them that didn't exist and some of the

924
00:51:57.371 --> 00:51:58.780
other corporations that we think of,

925
00:51:58.781 --> 00:52:03.310
whether it's fossil fuel corporations or carb manufacturers or anything along

926
00:52:03.311 --> 00:52:06.640
those lines,
we don't think of them as being like particularly ethical,

927
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.650
particularly tolerant.

928
00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:12.190
But you think about that when it comes to like tech companies like Google is

929
00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:15.970
trying and Vr,
there's companies like Google especially it was a,

930
00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.730
they're very upset about all this net neutrality shit.

931
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.830
They're very upset about all this.
This,

932
00:52:20.831 --> 00:52:23.560
this the possibility that the Internet is going to be regulated by the

933
00:52:23.561 --> 00:52:24.350
government.
Like the,

934
00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:29.170
they're going to be able to monitor and track like streams and how fast.

935
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:29.690
Yeah,

936
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:30.580
<v 4>I was just,
you get,</v>

937
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:32.750
I was just thinking about this earlier today cause I was trying to figure out

938
00:52:32.751 --> 00:52:37.160
what is the problem.
Like how do we get to a place where a company can be,

939
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.361
I was thinking of Twitter,

940
00:52:38.361 --> 00:52:42.620
like a company can take advantage of that capitalistic impulse towards,
you know,

941
00:52:42.621 --> 00:52:47.060
constant progress,
constant new products.
We're finding more,

942
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.550
make it more addictive,
make it easier to use.

943
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.790
So Twitter because they're profit focus,
that's what they're doing.

944
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:56.120
And because they're in the right kind of business where there they make their

945
00:52:56.121 --> 00:52:58.040
money from giving small people a voice.

946
00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.700
Like that's obviously an oversimplification,
but that's what Twitter does.

947
00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:03.860
And so that capitalistic thing,

948
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.610
that machine works really well and making Twitter better and better at least in

949
00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:10.760
the next couple of years until something better comes along and replaces it.

950
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.090
But then you get companies like,
um,
you know,

951
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:18.950
the big ISP is the big cable companies were them getting more and more.

952
00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:24.470
I'm like capitalistic efficient and more ruthless isn't actually helping the

953
00:53:24.471 --> 00:53:26.280
rest of us.
It's dragging us down

954
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.870
<v 3>because they're in charge of this thing.</v>

955
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:31.230
We all need the internet and if they're only thinking about,
oh,

956
00:53:31.231 --> 00:53:34.480
we can fuck them over a little bit right here and then we can implement this so

957
00:53:34.481 --> 00:53:38.320
when we can have the fast lane for our preferred partners,
they're applying that,

958
00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.390
that profit motive to something that is completely against the public interest

959
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.900
and doing it in a very efficient,
uh,
influential way.

960
00:53:45.901 --> 00:53:47.430
Like they have lobbyists working on this shit,

961
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:51.930
but it's against the public interest to be like lobbying for polluted water and

962
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:55.440
being like,
well,
we make more selling polluted water.
Too bad you can't do that.

963
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:59.880
You can't sell people Internet access and pick and choose which sites people are

964
00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:01.500
going to be able to get the fastest.

965
00:54:01.501 --> 00:54:03.780
That'd be like selling me a newspaper and it's like,
oh,

966
00:54:03.781 --> 00:54:06.930
half the photos haven't been printed.
If you want those photos to be printed,

967
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.150
go to our office and we'll print them out for you.

968
00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.760
You would not pay for the newspaper.
You'd be like,
fuck this.

969
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:13.650
I'm never buying your newspaper again.

970
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:17.370
It's also one of those things where when you're looking at it,
you go,
why?

971
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:22.270
Why should this be legal?
Why should this be okay?
Well,
it's censorship of,

972
00:54:22.271 --> 00:54:25.380
of,
of what people are putting out there into the world.

973
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:29.040
Like the whole point of the Internet is that it's not preferential.
Right?

974
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:30.690
It's control.
Yeah.
There's,
it's,

975
00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.990
it's an added element of control and the added element going to large

976
00:54:33.991 --> 00:54:36.480
corporations and not to individuals.
It's going the wrong way.

977
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.840
It's going the opposite way that the internet goes.
Yeah.

978
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:42.450
The Internet goes to the individual having more ability to communicate the

979
00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:45.870
individual having more resources and what you said about Google seeming to be

980
00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:47.280
more ethical in some ways,

981
00:54:47.281 --> 00:54:50.460
and a lot of these tech companies have the same kind of ethos.
I think.

982
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:52.830
It's not because they're necessarily better people.

983
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.400
It's because what they're doing,
their industry is non parasitic,

984
00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:58.290
so whereas the cable company,

985
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.950
the only way they can increase their profits is we got this pipeline into your

986
00:55:01.951 --> 00:55:06.820
house.
Let's make more money off of what we own.
Over time,
that becomes parasitic.

987
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:11.840
Whereas Google essentially built a whole empire off of user generated content.

988
00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:15.240
Anybody who built a website improves Google search.

989
00:55:15.241 --> 00:55:18.510
Anybody who puts shit on Youtube improves the,
you know,

990
00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:20.640
content offering of youtube.

991
00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:24.510
So they make money off of everybody having a voice and they want to protect that

992
00:55:24.511 --> 00:55:26.280
voice.
Cable companies don't give a shit.

993
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:30.180
They make money off of pumping their networks into your home and they want to

994
00:55:30.181 --> 00:55:31.320
maximize their profit.

995
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:34.320
And unfortunately they're really powerful and they have a bigger voice than

996
00:55:34.321 --> 00:55:38.250
almost anybody else.
Yeah,
I think that's an interesting way of looking at it.

997
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:42.720
I think there's probably some of that in there too.
Uh,
but I think that also,

998
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.490
I like to look on the bright side of things.

999
00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:48.270
So I think that what I'm seeing from these new tech companies is just more

1000
00:55:48.271 --> 00:55:49.104
tolerance.

1001
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:52.620
And I think that that tolerance is probably due to the influence of the
Internet.

1002
00:55:52.621 --> 00:55:55.980
And that's probably how they look.
Google is the Internet.
I mean,

1003
00:55:55.981 --> 00:55:56.850
that's what it's about.

1004
00:55:56.890 --> 00:56:00.600
So their whole company is essentially about the internet and now phones,

1005
00:56:00.601 --> 00:56:03.000
but the phones are also connected to the Internet.

1006
00:56:03.001 --> 00:56:05.940
I mean it's a big part of what they do and the ethic of the Internet,

1007
00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:10.941
it seems to be like the social ethic seems to be evolving way quicker and way

1008
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:14.940
stronger than at anytime that I can never remember.

1009
00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.160
And cultural history,

1010
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:21.570
I never remember these like big movements shifts in how people talked and

1011
00:56:21.571 --> 00:56:25.330
behaved in the words that were in the words that weren't accepted and you know,

1012
00:56:25.331 --> 00:56:30.331
and just w w just these giant trends that take place in just wash through

1013
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.810
culture.
They didn't,
they didn't move this quick before.

1014
00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.720
It's because we practice like a thought mass correction,

1015
00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:40.180
which I'm not entirely convinced is a good thing yet.

1016
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.830
I still haven't really decided if it's good or bad,

1017
00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:45.820
but if you look at that woman who took the flight from London to South Africa

1018
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.880
and tweeted out that insensitive shit about like,
you know,

1019
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:52.100
like I hope I don't get aids when I land in Africa or something.
Uh,

1020
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:55.790
she finished it though.
She said,
just kidding.
I'm white.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1021
00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:59.830
So even even worse.
So by better you mean?
Yeah,

1022
00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.920
that's what made it funny.
Before her flight landed in South Africa.

1023
00:57:02.921 --> 00:57:06.010
I think she's already lost her job and the global uproar.

1024
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.220
So that person learned that this is not socially acceptable.

1025
00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:12.400
And why did they learn that?
Because the Internet gave them that lesson.
Well,

1026
00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:15.100
she should have been a comedian because that would have been fucking hilarious.

1027
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:19.300
You know if a really funny comedian said that like a licensed last year said

1028
00:57:19.301 --> 00:57:21.610
that when she went to Africa Hall,
Shit,
that would be funny.

1029
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.880
Is it the wrong thing to say?
Yes,
it most certainly is.
Yeah.

1030
00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.000
But if you work in PR for some,
I think it was a,

1031
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.100
I don't even want to say the company,
but just a big media company.

1032
00:57:30.101 --> 00:57:34.750
So you think she was on pills or something?
Like why was she fucking say,
I mean,

1033
00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:38.750
what did what,
how could a person in corporate America thing,

1034
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:42.760
it's okay to put some on your Twitter.
I have no idea.
Kidding.
I'm not,
I'm white.

1035
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:48.010
Lol.
We don't get aids.
Just kidding.
I'm white.

1036
00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:53.050
Wow.
Yeah.
That's crazy person.
It's funny though.

1037
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:55.210
It's still funny.
It's a horrible thing to say,

1038
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:58.300
but the point is like crazy people are being called out.
There's still crazy,

1039
00:57:58.301 --> 00:58:01.750
but now we can call them out.
So you're going to ruin a lot.
Good jokes.
You are.

1040
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.090
And a lot of jobs,
people are losing their jobs.

1041
00:58:04.091 --> 00:58:07.150
Like Anthony was just for going off Twitter.
Well,
you know,
the,

1042
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:12.010
the Anthony thing is,
um,
it's particularly weird because that's sort of like,

1043
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:15.940
he had been known for that.
Like you guys had a show where it was like,

1044
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.090
there were openly joking about racism all the time.

1045
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:22.060
Like the other day he had Amy Schumer on one of the best of shows.

1046
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:26.230
It was from years ago and they were talking about interracial porn and Amy

1047
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:31.110
Schumer was fucking hilarious.
But she was saying that she,
she was so funny,
man.

1048
00:58:31.111 --> 00:58:33.980
It was really fun.
And she's so sharp.
Um,

1049
00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:37.030
she was saying that she's never fucked a black guy,

1050
00:58:37.031 --> 00:58:41.090
but she likes watching black on white porn.
And uh,

1051
00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:46.270
Anthony was talking about how sad it was and that,
uh,
his,
uh,

1052
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:49.240
his racism won't let him watch it.

1053
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:53.680
Like his racism won't let him watch a black guy fucking a white girl.

1054
00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:56.920
<v 1>There is a certain that is pretty racist if you,</v>

1055
00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.770
if you can't handle a black man fucking a white person that's praying,

1056
00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.670
he's joking.
He is a comedian.
I think a lot of people forget it.

1057
00:59:05.671 --> 00:59:09.210
It's a comedy show that he's one of the funniest people I know that just doesn't

1058
00:59:09.211 --> 00:59:11.370
go on stage and it's a comic.
Yeah,

1059
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:12.650
<v 3>certainly a comedian.
Yeah.</v>

1060
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.940
Whether he goes on stage in front of a live audience or whether he goes,

1061
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:19.630
do you think his rampage was meant to be funny though?
No.
That's the problem.

1062
00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:22.130
That's part of the problem.
That's not,
that's not done

1063
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.510
<v 0>for entertainment or for then you're not,</v>

1064
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.390
then your profession doesn't really matter.
You see,

1065
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:28.550
I'm up my issue with all these things,
um,

1066
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.660
is that like many things in life.
They're not black and white.
You know,

1067
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:35.510
this is not black and white.
I think Anthony is awesome.
I love that dude.

1068
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.440
He's one of my favorite people on radio ever.
He's great.

1069
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.380
He's just funny as shit.
He's smart as fuck.

1070
00:59:42.381 --> 00:59:45.230
He knows a lot of things about different things.
He's very,

1071
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:47.420
he's very interesting the way he looks at the world.

1072
00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:51.560
He says a lot of crazy shit about black people.
He does,
he has for a long time.

1073
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:55.790
I don't know his personal experiences.
I don't know what he's around,

1074
00:59:55.791 --> 01:00:00.080
where he's formulated these ideas about certain black people.

1075
01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:03.320
But I also know that there's a lot of black friends,
Patrice and him were close.

1076
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:06.500
You know,
he's uh,
you know,
black comics that come on the show all the time.

1077
01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:09.530
That a friendly with him.
He's not a mean person.
He's not a bad guy.

1078
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.010
If you're a nice person,
he'll be nice to you too.
That said,

1079
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.800
I don't know what the fuck went down that night.
Who knows?

1080
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:20.750
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
he did get attacked,
which is crazy,
but he's leading up to it.</v>

1081
01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:24.650
He also used to always talk about statistics about his city in New York and

1082
01:00:24.651 --> 01:00:29.420
stuff like that,
about how,
you know,
the,
the,
the race issues with that.

1083
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:33.290
And so I think that what he,
because he didn't,
when he went off,

1084
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:37.340
he didn't really say all blacks are this,
you know,

1085
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:42.341
he was kind of just talking about the person that attacked and was a savage,

1086
01:00:43.191 --> 01:00:44.024
you know,
it was what he said.

1087
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.950
<v 0>Yeah.
He called her a continent animal and all this different shit.</v>

1088
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.770
If it was a white chick and he called her an animal,
he would have been fun.

1089
01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.980
<v 1>Yeah.
And we would have called her the same exact word.</v>

1090
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.210
<v 0>It's,
look,
it's all very tricky.
You know when I always say about when,</v>

1091
01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.900
whenever you see a situation where two people get into a fight,

1092
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.880
it's not always just one guy's fault.
Sometimes it's both guys fault.

1093
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:08.390
Sometimes one a different person.
Like if you talk to this guy,

1094
01:01:08.391 --> 01:01:12.490
it would have never turned into a violent altercation and maybe you would walk

1095
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.810
away shaking hands.
Sorry man.
Ah,
no worries dude.

1096
01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.030
And another guy talking to the same guy.

1097
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:21.350
It might lead to a bloody fist fight and it's just a matter of how do you

1098
01:01:21.351 --> 01:01:23.870
communicate with people?
Who was this woman?
I've been,

1099
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.390
I was in New York City with this chick that I was dating.

1100
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:31.070
We were walking down the street and this girl was so nice.
She was so nice.

1101
01:01:31.071 --> 01:01:35.660
I mean she was,
no,
she wasn't,
she wouldn't be mean to anyone ever.
No mean faces.

1102
01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:38.780
She didn't have anything like that in her.
So um,
we're walking in,

1103
01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:43.781
this black couple is walking in the same direction and the girl steps in between

1104
01:01:44.211 --> 01:01:49.211
her and I and pushes this girl that I was with just push their move bitch,

1105
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.890
just move bitch.
Cause you know,

1106
01:01:51.891 --> 01:01:55.490
we were walking this way and they were walking towards us and she's decided that

1107
01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:59.660
that was her spot.
So Jesus,
she has elbow.
This girl said move bitch.
Wow.

1108
01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:04.370
She pushed it aside and I am thinking we're about to go to war.
I'm like,

1109
01:02:04.371 --> 01:02:07.190
we're going to about to go to war and I'm the knock out the girl first because I

1110
01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:09.800
don't want to have to deal with her while I'm hitting out of the guy.
I'm like,

1111
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:10.700
this is about to be a fight.

1112
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.860
And then th that chick just turned white bitches or something along the lines

1113
01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:18.320
like that,
some white and walked away and kept going.

1114
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.160
Fortunately because it was like,

1115
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:22.660
<v 2>like an all of a sudden the car.
But I was like,
Dad,</v>

1116
01:02:22.661 --> 01:02:25.530
I was like close to a fist fight for no reason,
you know?

1117
01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:28.560
And it just happened to be that that chick was black and it just happened to be

1118
01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:31.500
the girl that I was with was white and blonde.
But that happens.

1119
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:35.010
There's black assholes out there just like there's white hassles out there.

1120
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:38.850
There's Chinese assholes out there,
you know,
that doesn't make me racist.

1121
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:43.830
That makes me scared of people that are assholes and they come in all forms,

1122
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:48.490
Bro.
I,
I grew up in a Boston neighborhood,
Jamaica.
There was Jamaica plain,

1123
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:50.280
the place where I lived at before I moved to Newton,

1124
01:02:50.281 --> 01:02:54.840
which was our cushy and Nice Jamaica plain was Phil with his Irish savages.

1125
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.410
They were dangerous fucking kids.
These dangers,
Irish kids.

1126
01:02:58.411 --> 01:03:02.250
And if you ran into him,
it didn't matter what race they were.
It's like,

1127
01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:05.250
who's that?
Who's a savage?
These guilds kids were savages.

1128
01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.990
Didn't matter if they were white or Chinese.

1129
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:10.620
You walked down the wrong street in Chinatown and you run into some crazy

1130
01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:13.910
Chinese gang that wants to fuck you up.
You're not happy.
I mean,
it's not,

1131
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.950
it's not,
it's not better that way.
There's all sorts of races.

1132
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:21.390
Every race contains savages.
Every race contains assholes,
you know,

1133
01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:25.770
and the problem is when it's a black person,
it's getting attacked by white guy.

1134
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:26.491
You know,

1135
01:03:26.491 --> 01:03:30.330
you gotta be real specific that it's that person that's a piece of shit.

1136
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.900
And if some other people jumped in,
it's them that are pieces of shit.

1137
01:03:33.901 --> 01:03:37.620
It's not the whole town.
It's not all black people.
It's not,
you know,
it's just,

1138
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:41.370
there's a certain type of person,
whether it's white or black or whatever.

1139
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:45.840
That's a piece of Shit,
you know?
And I don't know if it's this lady,

1140
01:03:45.841 --> 01:03:49.740
I don't know why.
Who knows what happened to her that that day,
you know,

1141
01:03:49.741 --> 01:03:52.290
who knows what happened to her,
who knows what's going on in her life,

1142
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.120
and all of a sudden this guy's taking pictures at her.

1143
01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:55.200
She wants to punch him in the face.

1144
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.120
<v 1>Do you remember what time it was?
I,
it was,</v>

1145
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:59.640
I forgot to look to see actually what time it occurred,

1146
01:03:59.641 --> 01:04:04.200
but I think it was around two to 3:00 AM wearing the Twitter happens.
Uh,

1147
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:09.150
but uh,
you know,
I understand he's,
if you looked at his photos on Instagram,

1148
01:04:09.151 --> 01:04:10.920
he was taking a lot of photos of the city,

1149
01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:14.370
a lot of photos of cops and construction workers and [inaudible] and stuff like

1150
01:04:14.371 --> 01:04:18.390
that.
I get having a great camera,
uh,
that,
that you're playing,

1151
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.260
like New York's empty and you're downtown and you're taking photo and though a

1152
01:04:22.261 --> 01:04:25.640
woman's walking in the distance.
Yeah,
you're taking her,
cause it's a photo.
It's,

1153
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:29.190
it's cool.
But,
but,
but you know,
I don't know what happened here,

1154
01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:31.560
but what does seem to happen that,
that,

1155
01:04:31.561 --> 01:04:36.561
that he did attack him and he didn't have a police or a deal with the police?

1156
01:04:37.201 --> 01:04:37.390
No,
no,

1157
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:40.150
<v 2>he doesn't call nine one one because you figure like they wouldn't do anything.</v>

1158
01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.250
Right.
You know,
maybe he's right,

1159
01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.520
but I don't think the right way to handle it is going on Twitter and going

1160
01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:46.450
fucking crazy.

1161
01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:51.250
And I think that that's something that someone does when you just want to lash

1162
01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:55.150
out.
And for him,
he likes to,
uh,
use social media to,
you know,

1163
01:04:55.151 --> 01:04:56.770
to get points across.
And that's a point though.

1164
01:04:56.771 --> 01:05:01.060
The black on white violence has been a point of interest of his for a long time,

1165
01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:01.811
you know,

1166
01:05:01.811 --> 01:05:05.860
and there's a reality that exists just like white on black violence exists,

1167
01:05:05.861 --> 01:05:07.930
just like all kinds of violence exists.

1168
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.810
And Anthony is a guy who was particularly concerned with that.

1169
01:05:10.811 --> 01:05:13.120
It's one of the reasons why carries a gun,
right?
I mean,

1170
01:05:13.121 --> 01:05:16.450
he's a rare person that has a concealed carry permit in New York City.

1171
01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:20.190
He's one of,
it's pretty hard.
It's got a big ass fucking 99.
It was published.

1172
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.860
So that's chicken hitting him while he's armed with a deadly weapon.

1173
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:28.180
And then five other people jump in apparently.
And the whole thing is chaos.

1174
01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:30.760
And I would have loved to for it to be avoided,

1175
01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:35.761
but I think serious lost the potential opportunity to engage in a discussion

1176
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.890
about this,
about violence in New York City,
about violence in general,

1177
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:45.670
the people interacting with each other about interacting on social media,

1178
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:50.080
interacting when you're hot with fucking rage and you're just venting and

1179
01:05:50.081 --> 01:05:52.030
ranting and consummate a continental.

1180
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.240
And what is your actual intent and and what is my job as a representative of

1181
01:05:57.251 --> 01:05:58.390
your Sirius Xm?

1182
01:05:58.391 --> 01:06:02.230
Am I am allowed to be Anthony or do I have to be Anthony that only thinks like

1183
01:06:02.231 --> 01:06:06.430
Sirius XM wants me to think and only tweets like Sirius XM wants me to tweet.

1184
01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:09.670
When are you clocked off work?
Exactly.
Now when?
When are you not,

1185
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:13.840
I'm not supporting him right in this,
I'm saying this is,

1186
01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:19.200
this is a very tricky situation where the company has to be real careful because

1187
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:23.840
part of what you do is you promote free speech and you,

1188
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:28.390
you have a radio show and you have this network that's uncensored.

1189
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.321
There's net was,

1190
01:06:29.321 --> 01:06:32.800
it was the coolest thing about Sirius was you could get Howard stern on it and

1191
01:06:32.801 --> 01:06:37.200
he could swear it was the greatest thing of all time.
Like from now on,

1192
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:42.040
he's unchained and Opie and Anthony are unchained and comedy is unchained.

1193
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.030
You can watch,
you can hear all my bits.
It's totally uncensored.

1194
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:48.040
They have them on Sirius.
It's beautiful.

1195
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:52.810
So if all of a sudden you decide that you don't like what a guy says on Twitter,

1196
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.940
so his opinions,
which are very similar that he's voiced on the radio,

1197
01:06:58.270 --> 01:07:02.440
very similar,
if not identical,
will now be silenced.
It gets a little squirrely.

1198
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.710
The whole thing is a backlash.
It's a backlash to the,

1199
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:09.970
the racism and or implied racism of his tweets.
You know,

1200
01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:12.250
look dude,
I do.

1201
01:07:12.251 --> 01:07:16.390
I wish that he just went on the radio and explained himself and more than 140

1202
01:07:16.391 --> 01:07:17.650
characters.
Yes.
Cause,

1203
01:07:17.651 --> 01:07:21.760
I bet he could evented the exact same rage the next day with no Twitter thing

1204
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:25.930
and people would not have had a problem with it if he said it with his words,

1205
01:07:25.931 --> 01:07:27.280
if he explained what happened,

1206
01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:31.480
there's a real problem with fucking getting out anything super important where

1207
01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:36.040
you don't want to have any mistakes and how you're being perceived with 140

1208
01:07:36.041 --> 01:07:40.780
characters.
You know,
you're saying cut animal savage,
you don't,
you know,

1209
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:43.720
he's not talking,
he's writing a bunch of shit down.

1210
01:07:43.721 --> 01:07:46.630
So you mad that he's conveying those thoughts.

1211
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:49.360
Do you not think that he would have those thoughts up,
this chick hit him?

1212
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.040
Do you expect them to be,
you know,
Eh,

1213
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.970
angelic and his approach to violence?
Like,

1214
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:58.360
I don't know what you're looking for here because if it's just that you think

1215
01:07:58.361 --> 01:07:59.590
that what he said is racist,

1216
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:03.310
have you ever listened to that show because they listened to that show?

1217
01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:04.960
He says shit like that all the time.

1218
01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.210
I'll say if you have a job as a show host or a pundit,

1219
01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.480
you really need to be allowed to say what you want on your social media,

1220
01:08:10.481 --> 01:08:15.160
even if it kind of,
you know,
damages may be Asian,
but no,
but,
but no,

1221
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.100
because look,
if

1222
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.220
<v 0>he said all Jews need to be thrown into an oven and pissed on while they're on</v>

1223
01:08:19.221 --> 01:08:22.610
fire.
No,
no,
that's right.
That's a little bit different.
So,
but,

1224
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:25.790
but is it different because where does,
where does one draw the line?

1225
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.760
What if he said that and he's only joking?
It turns out he's actually Jewish.

1226
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.890
Is that okay?

1227
01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:32.800
<v 3>I don't know nearly enough about him or the show,
so I really don't know.</v>

1228
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.560
<v 0>I think it's the same thing.
I think when,
when you say something absolutely,</v>

1229
01:08:37.561 --> 01:08:40.770
totally awful like that,
like all Jews should be like,

1230
01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:43.550
you can't be associated with my company.
Right?
Like you can't,

1231
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.500
it's not a serious person at that point.
It's a crazy person.

1232
01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:50.040
And it's a dangerous person too because who knows what percentage of the

1233
01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:51.870
population's listing that's unhinged.

1234
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:56.250
It's been waiting for a guy like you to come along.
But he didn't do that,

1235
01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.120
you know?

1236
01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.120
Well he did his respond to a person who attacked him and then talk in very a

1237
01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:06.360
racial terms about the scenario.

1238
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:11.390
And he has in the past on the radio show about what it's like to worry about

1239
01:09:11.491 --> 01:09:13.830
black violence on white people.
Yeah.

1240
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:17.810
<v 3>And,
and that's,
what is that like the young Turks,
uh,
thing you saw,</v>

1241
01:09:17.811 --> 01:09:20.330
I don't know if you saw that or not,
but that was,
they called them a racist.

1242
01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:24.800
That was one of the worst things I've ever seen.
I lost,
I'm sorry.

1243
01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:28.220
All respect for them just based off of that one interview,

1244
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:32.640
because it was completely,
you can know that they don't know the backstory.
They,

1245
01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.820
they don't know.
They don't listen to the show.

1246
01:09:34.821 --> 01:09:36.780
But it's an interesting thing though,
isn't it?
When you're,

1247
01:09:36.781 --> 01:09:39.590
you're looking at someone who doesn't know,
Anthony,
doesn't know the show,

1248
01:09:39.610 --> 01:09:44.060
doesn't know the backstory and is responding to just deciding everything right

1249
01:09:44.061 --> 01:09:44.510
there.

1250
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:47.730
You know that he was perving and he's taking a picture of this woman coming in

1251
01:09:47.731 --> 01:09:50.900
off the street and not knowing about all those other pictures that he had taken

1252
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.490
and that he is an amateur photographer.

1253
01:09:52.491 --> 01:09:55.400
He loves taking pictures in a candid photo of a woman walking down the street.

1254
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:59.300
She was pretty and she had long legs and just said,
nice body look good.
You know,

1255
01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:02.910
I've heard three in the morning dressed up like street,
absolutely street meat,

1256
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:08.090
but,
but they jumped on him unfairly and that's like,
that was like Fox News.

1257
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:10.730
It was like,
wait,
aren't you supposed to be the opposite of this?

1258
01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.590
<v 0>No,
I don't think it was like Fox News.</v>

1259
01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:15.870
I think it was like they perceived what his word.

1260
01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:19.880
I'm telling you there's a fucking real problem with saying something like that

1261
01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:22.070
at 140 characters.
It's stupid.

1262
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.160
Like I've said some dumb shit on Twitter before.

1263
01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:29.870
I've had people write full blogs on like one tweet that I had there was like a

1264
01:10:29.871 --> 01:10:34.460
joke.
It's just a joke tweet.
I get that.
I get that.

1265
01:10:34.461 --> 01:10:37.640
You could decide that you know you have a green light to write something.

1266
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.590
140 characters doesn't work.
It doesn't work for anything important.

1267
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.450
If you really had a situation where you thought your life was in danger or you

1268
01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:49.250
thought you were,

1269
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.580
you know you're going to go unconscious or you're gonna lose your eyesight,

1270
01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:56.240
like apparently had like spots on his eyes,
wouldn't you want to hear that?

1271
01:10:56.241 --> 01:10:57.740
Like the full version of it?

1272
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.800
I think if Anthony just would tell the full version of it on the air and avoid

1273
01:11:03.831 --> 01:11:05.570
the tweets,
none of this would've happened.

1274
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:08.300
He would've been able to express himself the exact same way.

1275
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.780
That fucking cunt animal,
he would have been able to say whatever he wanted.

1276
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.140
He would have been able to talk in depth about black on white violence,

1277
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:18.570
which I'm not saying that's all that exists.

1278
01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:20.970
There's plenty of white on black violence.
There's plenty.

1279
01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:25.110
I'm saying that it exists.
I mean to pretend it doesn't exist,

1280
01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:29.340
it's pretty silly to me to pretend there's not black people that will hit white

1281
01:11:29.341 --> 01:11:30.330
people and robbed them.

1282
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.860
Just like to pretend is not white people who will hit black people and robbed

1283
01:11:33.861 --> 01:11:36.870
them.
Of course it exists.
Yeah.
Racism exists.

1284
01:11:36.871 --> 01:11:41.100
Violent racism from random people on both sides can end,

1285
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:42.000
does exist.

1286
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.600
So is he right in saying that it exists from them or what do you have to qualify

1287
01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:50.700
it first by saying that there's a lot of piece of shit white people out there as

1288
01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:53.070
well.
I don't know.
You know,
I don't know,

1289
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:55.710
but in my opinion with what they're doing is silly.

1290
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.370
This is a quote from Penn Jillette today.
Penn says this.

1291
01:11:59.371 --> 01:12:03.800
If I'm in a position where I cross somebody who was carrying a gun and can,

1292
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:05.700
can defend themselves and hurt me,

1293
01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:09.480
and their choice is to write angry stuff on Twitter instead of fighting me back.

1294
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:13.530
Wonderful.
Gandhi.
That's Gandy.
Yeah.
I don't agree with that.

1295
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.590
I think just cause you have a gun that doesn't make you any more special and

1296
01:12:17.591 --> 01:12:19.140
they're like,
well I didn't use my gun.

1297
01:12:19.141 --> 01:12:21.060
It's like that shouldn't even be on the table in the first place.

1298
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:23.760
It certainly should be on the table.
If someone's trying to take your life,

1299
01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.640
what's the difference between someone punishing you with her knuckles and

1300
01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:28.830
someone beating you to death?
How much,

1301
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.780
however much of a background do you have in violence?

1302
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:34.350
Have you ever seen someone get knocked unconscious in a street fight?
Uh,

1303
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.251
actually yeah,

1304
01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:40.251
but on Youtube I've seen in real life I've seen in real life a few times and

1305
01:12:40.261 --> 01:12:43.020
it's terrifying.
I saw in real life once in Hollywood,

1306
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.680
there was a a moment in front of the comedy store,
we're all hanging out.

1307
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:51.710
It was after a show and this guy and this other guy got in this argument and

1308
01:12:51.871 --> 01:12:54.480
there was traffic going by and they're right in front of the House of Blues,

1309
01:12:54.481 --> 01:12:58.110
which is directly across the street from the comedy store.

1310
01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:02.130
And in the middle of this argument there's back and forth and it's a white guy

1311
01:13:02.131 --> 01:13:07.050
and a black guy and you see them start to like swing at each other and the white

1312
01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:12.030
guy goes into a full panic.
All I remember is this guy like standing,

1313
01:13:12.031 --> 01:13:16.830
like wincing his eyes and flailing with his hands,
like literally had,

1314
01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:19.710
it was just in full panic and this black eyes.

1315
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.040
I see him hit him and I see cars go in front of it and I don't know what

1316
01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:26.190
happened.
I just,

1317
01:13:26.191 --> 01:13:29.550
I know that they're hitting each other because the white guy was flailing,

1318
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.840
but I don't see the connection.
And then the car goes back,
you know,

1319
01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:38.370
the car passes and the guys flat out cold on the concrete just in serious

1320
01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:40.980
trouble.
He's in the street,
there's cars going by,

1321
01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:44.130
he's in a fight with a guy and he's completely unconscious and everybody's

1322
01:13:44.131 --> 01:13:48.090
screaming,
there's cars honking and this guy's out cold on the street.

1323
01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:52.610
That guy could die easy.
And again,
we tell you something.
A woman can do that too.

1324
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:55.440
Just like a man can do that to you if you don't think that there's women out

1325
01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:58.740
there that can punch you in the face and knock you unconscious cause you've

1326
01:13:58.741 --> 01:14:00.000
never been punched by a woman.

1327
01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.640
There's a lot of women that can punch really fucking hard.
I,

1328
01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.480
you know this,
see these snacks.

1329
01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:11.530
That's my friend Miriam,
Miriam Nakamoto.
She's eight time world Moitai champion.

1330
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:15.250
She beat a man and a kickboxing bout.
She's beautiful.
She's a nice person.

1331
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:18.370
She makes snacks now,
but live.
That chick punches you in the face.

1332
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:20.920
You're fuck Ceville you know,
like for real,

1333
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.230
like a regular guy who doesn't know how to fight.

1334
01:14:23.231 --> 01:14:26.260
She'll beat the fucking breaks off you.
It's not,
not good.

1335
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:28.030
So he doesn't know anything about this girl.

1336
01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.750
If the girl starts teeing off on him with left and rights and she's got like

1337
01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:35.680
precision punching,
guess what?
You're going to go unconscious.
Yeah.

1338
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:39.700
So should you applaud him for night pulling out his gun?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1339
01:14:39.701 --> 01:14:41.590
You shouldn't pull out a gun in that situation.

1340
01:14:41.591 --> 01:14:44.280
And he did the right thing so that I agree with them.

1341
01:14:45.090 --> 01:14:49.470
<v 1>Yeah.
I just wouldn't go as far as saying that he is a Gandhi.
Like that's I,</v>

1342
01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:53.250
he's choking.
Yeah,
I know.
It's written.
See when it's written,

1343
01:14:53.251 --> 01:14:57.100
you get all fucked up.
You get all fucked up.
Even you the regular person.
Yeah,

1344
01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:00.960
of course.
It's going to get close.
It's impossible to tell sarcasm.
Like I,

1345
01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.480
I've thought that he was serious because he's a pretty serious guy.

1346
01:15:04.481 --> 01:15:05.130
Like I realize,

1347
01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:07.950
I realize he doesn't show in Vegas and ship and he's very serious.

1348
01:15:07.951 --> 01:15:10.110
Like he has a lot of serious ideas.
He is serious.

1349
01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.790
I mean he's joking about that by saying he's gone,
but he's premise,
this series,

1350
01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:16.770
the premise is absolutely serious.
It's true.

1351
01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.490
Is there any way to see a security video of how this went down?
Good question.

1352
01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.080
Good question.
Given how,

1353
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:25.470
I mean series is a big company and it's kind of big implications to drop one of

1354
01:15:25.471 --> 01:15:29.160
your biggest hosts so well their outrage was all over online.

1355
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.800
You know what I mean?
People went crazy about it.
Here's the one crazy.

1356
01:15:31.801 --> 01:15:33.660
There's petitions right now they're up to like,

1357
01:15:33.661 --> 01:15:38.040
I think last I saw it was 15,000 you know there's a cancer Wentz canceling it.

1358
01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:42.150
They have to be getting hurt by this because honestly Howard stern and opie and

1359
01:15:42.151 --> 01:15:44.310
Anthony,
that's pretty much,
you know,

1360
01:15:44.311 --> 01:15:47.850
fueling that channel I would imagine.
Do you know that?

1361
01:15:47.851 --> 01:15:50.610
For sure cause I don't know what they make their money off.
I have no idea.

1362
01:15:50.611 --> 01:15:51.730
I would just be guessing.
Well,

1363
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:55.230
I would imagine that opie and Anthony has definitely a huge pie.

1364
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.370
What's a great Chai?

1365
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:59.420
<v 0>Yeah,
it's a great show,
and by the way,
if it was on the Internet,</v>

1366
01:15:59.450 --> 01:16:03.290
it would still be awesome if they just switched to the Internet.
It'd be huge.

1367
01:16:03.291 --> 01:16:03.471
I mean,

1368
01:16:03.471 --> 01:16:07.100
it might be a great opportunity for them if they mean they cancel Anthony if

1369
01:16:07.101 --> 01:16:10.100
they fire Anthony.
Just hope he's still under contract.
I mean,
how's that work?

1370
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:15.590
<v 1>What Ob said today is that him and Jim will be back Monday next Monday.
Well,</v>

1371
01:16:15.591 --> 01:16:16.640
I said they might have,

1372
01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:20.570
they might be making it the opn gem show just based on contracts,

1373
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:22.270
but what's interesting is,

1374
01:16:22.271 --> 01:16:26.360
is leading up to this is how much Opi has been talking about that he's done.

1375
01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.330
He's not going to sign a contract.
He does.
He wants to do a podcast.

1376
01:16:29.331 --> 01:16:31.120
He's done and it,

1377
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:35.660
this whole timing of this is very interesting because sometimes that's how the

1378
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:39.890
universe,
it's very interesting.
Very,
very interesting.

1379
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:44.030
<v 0>Yeah.
Wonder Man,
I hope they do a podcast.
Look,
the show's awesome.
It's funny.</v>

1380
01:16:44.031 --> 01:16:46.850
Show to watch little Jimmy.
He's the funniest guy ever on radio.

1381
01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:50.960
Jim Norton is my favorite guy ever of all time on radio.
No question about it.

1382
01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:54.830
Consistently comes with the funny,
he's hilarious and he's smart.

1383
01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.880
He's well thought out.
He's a,
he's an interesting dude.
He's honest.

1384
01:16:58.881 --> 01:17:02.660
I really love Joey.
I think he's a hilarious comedian too.
He's so fun.

1385
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.220
Plus he makes me feel,

1386
01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.320
I don't feel like so much of a per after hanging out with him,

1387
01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:10.050
like I thought my act at too many Dick Jokes.
Then went to see him and I

1388
01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:11.090
<v 2>even told them that I go do it.</v>

1389
01:17:11.091 --> 01:17:14.420
I had the best time that you freed me in a lot of ways because sometimes I go,

1390
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.670
man,
I got so many Dick Jokes.
Why keep writing Dick Jokes?

1391
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:20.630
His whole act was dick jokes from beginning to end and I loved it.

1392
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:25.100
It was awesome.
I saw him at a cobb's Cobb's comedy club and the Austin,

1393
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:30.880
not cubs
cap city Cap City Comedy Club in Austin.
Right.

1394
01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.470
<v 1>Anthony is starting is a compound show this week though,</v>

1395
01:17:33.471 --> 01:17:34.920
so that's going to be interesting.
Just to add to it.

1396
01:17:34.921 --> 01:17:37.080
I don't know how if he has a lawyer,
if he said he,

1397
01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.170
you know he was going to lawyer up if,

1398
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.410
but what if he can talk about and what he can't talk about.

1399
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.610
You know it's going to be interesting.

1400
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:48.110
<v 2>Well I'm pretty sure he could probably talk about the incident that he could</v>

1401
01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:51.380
talk about.
No one can keep you from talking about a person attacking you.

1402
01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.540
How could they keep you from doing that?

1403
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:56.720
Any person that could keep you from doing that is not a person want to be

1404
01:17:56.721 --> 01:17:58.730
associated with it.
They fire you for that.
Good.

1405
01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:02.540
Imagine someone keeping you from talking about you being attacked,

1406
01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:04.400
like your own personal experience.

1407
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:07.430
How he expresses himself is entirely up to him.

1408
01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:12.880
I think we'll probably get a more balanced view of it now than when it happened.

1409
01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.570
You know?
I think he's probably going to take into consideration all the,

1410
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:21.230
the heat and the bullshit and the time that's elapsed and the motions that have

1411
01:18:21.231 --> 01:18:24.830
relaxed and the tension that's relaxed,
the sting of the punches,

1412
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:29.030
and he'll be able to look at it and give you a funny assessment of it,

1413
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:33.860
but the,
the show just be better if they go on the Internet,

1414
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:37.850
they can do whatever they want on your times.
You don't need anybody anymore.

1415
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:41.570
You just don't it.
Yeah.
They can move anywhere they want.

1416
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:44.150
You don't need anybody anymore.
It's,
it's silly.

1417
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:49.480
It's like the amount of people that don't have iPods or iPhones or can't get

1418
01:18:49.701 --> 01:18:51.950
their phone to stream through their radio.

1419
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:55.910
It's common almost everybody now it's really close,
you know?
I mean,

1420
01:18:55.911 --> 01:18:58.910
especially if you're commuting,
if you're getting on subways and shit like that,

1421
01:18:58.911 --> 01:19:03.650
and it's actually better than having some sort of a satellite that sends it to,

1422
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:06.350
and you can get it whenever you want.
You can pause it.

1423
01:19:06.351 --> 01:19:10.430
You can listen whenever you want.
It's just a better medium,
you know?
And that,

1424
01:19:10.431 --> 01:19:14.270
don't get me wrong,
I have three cars that have a Sirius satellite radio.

1425
01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:15.770
I love it.
It's great.

1426
01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:19.550
I love the fact that I could flip through the shit and listen to new music.

1427
01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:20.900
I love that I can,
uh,

1428
01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.890
get on the classic Vinyl Station and listened to all classic rock cause I'm old

1429
01:19:24.891 --> 01:19:29.120
as fuck.
I'm old as fuck and I reminisce and listen to some Bob Seger.

1430
01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:34.070
I like it.
I like serious.
I'll keep it as a product,
but man,

1431
01:19:34.071 --> 01:19:35.270
you've got to realize what you're selling

1432
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.450
<v 1>it.
Music channels are definitely great.
Um,
for sure.</v>

1433
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.580
I haven't been to my cars also.
I just,

1434
01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.150
I know that the majority of what I listened to that was opie and Anthony and it

1435
01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:46.370
used to be Howard Stern,
but again,
you know,

1436
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:50.150
<v 2>mm.
It's just kind of not the same.
I think that,
um,</v>

1437
01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:55.250
I think that they would be just as happy if not happier on the Internet.

1438
01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.520
I think they would do just as well,
if not better on the Internet.

1439
01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:02.060
I don't think there's any downside to this.
No one can stop you anymore.

1440
01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:04.250
They used to just be able to fire you and that was it.

1441
01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:07.920
They can't do that anymore because anybody could just go on with their cell

1442
01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:08.730
phone.

1443
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:12.510
He could just start the other David Seaman show sitting here at chipotle lay

1444
01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.010
like this fucking government builds going on right now is basically bullshit.

1445
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.420
That's basically what I do.
Yeah.

1446
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:21.400
With a green screen using a cell phone in a green screen.

1447
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:25.370
<v 4>What if this would have happened if that series just instead took a different</v>

1448
01:20:25.371 --> 01:20:28.370
route because you know they bitch about their studio and how horrible it is and

1449
01:20:28.371 --> 01:20:30.810
stuff like that.
What if they could just send it in like,

1450
01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:35.340
like kind of what Joe Rogan experience does do them.
We sit,
right,
right.

1451
01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.110
But what if,

1452
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:41.110
would they still be as upset if he did all this Twitter rampage if he just had

1453
01:20:41.691 --> 01:20:45.710
to send in show where they had their own staff,
they own employees,

1454
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:47.540
their own sponsors,
and they just send it in.

1455
01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:50.830
<v 2>Well,
we're getting into a lot of what ifs now that we're not business people</v>

1456
01:20:50.831 --> 01:20:54.400
obviously.
Right.
That's why we work together.
This,
you know,
we're,

1457
01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:58.510
I don't know what it would be like to be a part of a shareholder corporation

1458
01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:01.420
because they have shares.
They're responsible for a lot of shit.

1459
01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:03.190
Like they have to listen to a lot of people.
Man,

1460
01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.430
there's a lot of people involved.
When you have companies,
man,

1461
01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:10.450
anytime anything gets crazy and people start protesting and you got to act,

1462
01:21:10.451 --> 01:21:14.800
you've got to get out there and you've got to save this company as a
shareholder.

1463
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:17.230
You know,
as the CEO,
uh,

1464
01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.410
like the guy that fucked the fucking Nba guy when they,
uh,

1465
01:21:20.650 --> 01:21:23.560
when they got rid of Donald Sterling and he's,
what's his name?

1466
01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:27.730
That fucking Ball Dracula looking dude,
that was so ridiculous on that podium.

1467
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:31.270
I don't know.
Oh,
that was so ridiculous.
That goofy fuck.

1468
01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:36.420
That shit was so ridiculous.
We find him the maximum amount,
you know,
there,

1469
01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:39.040
that drives me crazy.
That whole story.

1470
01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.950
Like you got an old guy who's known for saying racial shit.

1471
01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:44.260
He tells his girlfriend she can fuck black guys.

1472
01:21:44.261 --> 01:21:47.890
Just don't take pictures with them and all you can focus on is the picture part.

1473
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:51.880
She's,
he's letting her fuck black guys and you guys are going to find them.

1474
01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:57.460
Right?
2.5 million.
That's ridiculous.
The highest amount.
Oh it seems reasonable.

1475
01:21:57.850 --> 01:22:00.670
Yeah.
He told her don't take pictures of black guys.
What an asshole.

1476
01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:05.440
You can fuck them though.
If they leave that out,
the totally leave that out.

1477
01:22:05.441 --> 01:22:08.830
Why would he leave that out?
Because you can't,
you can't bring it up.

1478
01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:12.070
If that was [inaudible] that was you and you were the commissioner of the NBA

1479
01:22:12.071 --> 01:22:15.220
and you had to explain to people and you were like looking on the bright side.

1480
01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:18.280
He's allowing her to fuck black guys.
Right?

1481
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:20.900
<v 4>It's a,
yeah.
I,
I don't,
uh,</v>

1482
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:24.380
I don't know what to make of that one either.

1483
01:22:24.381 --> 01:22:28.760
Cause it seems like it goes back to what you were saying about how,
you know,

1484
01:22:28.761 --> 01:22:30.170
to get into an altercation or something.

1485
01:22:30.171 --> 01:22:34.940
Both people kind of need to be involved and you don't have to be an asshole and

1486
01:22:34.941 --> 01:22:38.060
say those things.
And if you're going to be an asshole and say those things,

1487
01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:41.480
you have to be aware that if you're also prominent and you own a fucking sports

1488
01:22:41.481 --> 01:22:44.420
team,
people are gonna listen to what you say more,

1489
01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:47.810
more so than somebody in a trailer saying the same thing on youtube.
Right?

1490
01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.850
Like if you post that in the youtube comment section,

1491
01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:53.720
you're not going to see a national uproar.
Especially if you're not that dude.

1492
01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:56.480
But if you're a billionaire and you own a sports team and you're always in the

1493
01:22:56.481 --> 01:23:00.620
public eye,
even if you're old,
that's not an excuse for saying racist shit.

1494
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:05.560
<v 2>You're absolutely right.
And I agree with you 100% but here's the,</v>

1495
01:23:05.561 --> 01:23:10.561
but you're looking at this guy and this guy is being recorded against his will.

1496
01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:13.660
He has no idea is being recorded.
That's what he says.

1497
01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:15.540
So you're in a Mel Gibson possible scenario.

1498
01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:19.360
You're in a scenario where you're dating this girl and she,
I don't know,

1499
01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:22.270
she blackmail you.
I don't know what's going on.
I have no idea what the story is.

1500
01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:25.690
But I know that he did say he should have paid her off.
That is what he said.

1501
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.350
That was one of his quotes that he should have paid her off and all this stuff

1502
01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:33.640
comes out and he,
he got he,
no one is saying that what she did is illegal.

1503
01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:34.660
No one's freaking out.

1504
01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:37.600
Everyone's paying attention to the fact that I think people are freaking out

1505
01:23:37.601 --> 01:23:41.290
that he comes across as an asshole to,
exactly.
I should not paid her off.

1506
01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:45.940
You should have said sorry like that to everybody is the kind of the character

1507
01:23:45.941 --> 01:23:50.110
of the old billionaire who represents everything that the average working person

1508
01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:51.310
kind of despises.
Right.

1509
01:23:51.311 --> 01:23:56.230
This old white guy is saying the shit that really is insensitive at best and I

1510
01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:59.980
can,
that's one of the situations where I can see that the media has just

1511
01:23:59.981 --> 01:24:03.370
manipulating people and it's just like bullshit anger that we're being

1512
01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:06.220
collectively drawn into,
but at the same time like,

1513
01:24:06.221 --> 01:24:07.930
well and the guy is kind of an asshole.

1514
01:24:07.931 --> 01:24:11.800
Like there's not 100% culpability in either direction.
Exactly.

1515
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:14.770
It's just like what we've been talking about all day.
It's the same thing.

1516
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:17.470
It's like there's not black and whites and everything's a lot.

1517
01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:20.470
Somebody like that.
I give less leeway for sure.
Like somebody like that.

1518
01:24:20.471 --> 01:24:23.950
Less leeway than a private citizen.
Wait a minute and he's a private citizen.

1519
01:24:24.010 --> 01:24:26.350
What do you mean billionaire?
And you own a sports team.

1520
01:24:26.351 --> 01:24:28.720
You have to be aware that you have an influence when you say things.

1521
01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:32.920
Whereas just some person on the sidewalk who says that most people are going to

1522
01:24:32.921 --> 01:24:36.120
be like,
well it's not my job cause you can't there.
See,

1523
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:40.750
I can't see a way to justify recording someone and playing what they said,

1524
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.930
no matter what it is.
If it's not a crime,
you know,

1525
01:24:43.931 --> 01:24:46.630
if it's as mildly offensive as that and it is offensive.

1526
01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:51.220
But he's an old guy and he's got this young girlfriend he's trying to fuck and

1527
01:24:51.221 --> 01:24:54.570
we're supposed to,
it's not a statement.
He's not making an affidavit.
He's,

1528
01:24:54.571 --> 01:24:58.090
he's trying to bang some chick and he's telling her to please you.

1529
01:24:58.091 --> 01:25:00.640
I don't care if you fuck it,
I'm just don't take pictures with them.
Okay.

1530
01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.980
And he's trying to get his freak on.
She records that.

1531
01:25:02.981 --> 01:25:05.830
I mean that's exactly what happened and that is exactly what he said happened.

1532
01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:08.230
He thought it was a private conversation between the two of them.

1533
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:11.100
Is it despicable that he doesn't want her to take pictures of with black guys?

1534
01:25:11.101 --> 01:25:15.730
Cause he,
it makes him look bad.
Yeah.
It's not cool.
But he talks a her fuck them.

1535
01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:18.700
I mean that is,
that is a part of what he said.
Right.

1536
01:25:18.701 --> 01:25:23.140
And this isn't as simple as racism.
He said it's,
I don't care if you fuck them.

1537
01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.410
Like how racist is he?
He's letting her fuck black guys.

1538
01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:29.620
Well that's a low level racist for sure.
And the dizzy,

1539
01:25:29.621 --> 01:25:32.830
dizzy saying this in public because it's a big bold statement on Twitter.

1540
01:25:32.831 --> 01:25:34.510
Like Anthony.
No,
no.

1541
01:25:34.511 --> 01:25:38.080
He's in the confines of his own home and he's trying to get laid.

1542
01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.890
You're going to try and he was probably had a couple of drinks in him too.

1543
01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:45.760
You're going to hold the guy to that publicly.
Yeah.
Is he an asshole?
Yes.

1544
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:48.160
But he's not trying to hurt feelings.
He's not trying to spread hate.

1545
01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.900
I mean he just trying to get laid.
Yeah.

1546
01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:52.570
It seems to me that the intent of what you're saying,

1547
01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:55.840
like the context and the intent are pretty critical when you're released

1548
01:25:55.841 --> 01:26:00.400
something like that and you get angry and find someone for something like that.

1549
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:04.220
That was a knee jerk reaction or response that they took regardless of whether

1550
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:08.480
<v 0>the guy is an asshole.
I,
I,
I've heard both ways of her more than he is.</v>

1551
01:26:08.481 --> 01:26:11.330
Then he isn't,
who knows?
I don't know,
but I don't like it.

1552
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:12.650
I don't think it's cool.

1553
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.320
I don't think it's cool that you take this all the asshole and do that to him

1554
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.720
and I think it's going to wind up selling the clippers for like a fucking

1555
01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.240
trillion dollars and he's going to profit off of it anyway.
Yeah.

1556
01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:28.590
<v 1>And there's reports that he's just going crazy and that's also as taking</v>

1557
01:26:28.591 --> 01:26:32.340
something that you,
like you said,
private,
you know in that in your own house,

1558
01:26:32.341 --> 01:26:35.520
like it that's complete.
It should be a hunt.
It is 100% illegal.

1559
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:38.970
Like I shouldn't have to worry about you taking all my texts and all my stuff

1560
01:26:38.971 --> 01:26:40.740
out of my phone and then putting it online.

1561
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:44.160
Why are you being fine tuned a half million dollars if a crime wasn't committed.

1562
01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.320
Right,
exactly.
You're not the government.

1563
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:48.060
Why are you finding somebody that much money?

1564
01:26:48.061 --> 01:26:50.820
It's one thing if it's like we're in a dock,
your pay for a week,

1565
01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.400
that's not chump change.
I don't understand he's a billionaire,

1566
01:26:53.401 --> 01:26:56.880
but you're enforcing something with a lot of weight there.

1567
01:26:56.950 --> 01:27:01.180
<v 0>I couldn't agree more and I also think that it's a situation that merits a</v>

1568
01:27:01.181 --> 01:27:05.740
serious conversation.
May merits serious conversation about race,
about context,

1569
01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:08.050
about privacy.
It merits that would,

1570
01:27:08.051 --> 01:27:12.370
it doesn't matter if some guy giving some canned speech where he's got this

1571
01:27:12.371 --> 01:27:15.010
righteous indignation in his voice,

1572
01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:18.730
we are going to find him the maximum amount and he's basically running for

1573
01:27:18.731 --> 01:27:19.690
president or something.

1574
01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:23.500
He's got that fake politician thing going on was giving this speech totally

1575
01:27:23.501 --> 01:27:25.300
disingenuous.
The whole thing is goofy.

1576
01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.780
Like you get a flat or you're not paying attention to the whole recording while

1577
01:27:28.781 --> 01:27:31.000
you focus on the one part.
Don't take pictures of black guys.

1578
01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.350
They have their freaks.

1579
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:37.150
He's letting her fuck guys like this is not a normal dude and he's at home in

1580
01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:39.880
his bedroom.
What is this real am I,

1581
01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:43.330
is this a real world where you just find him two and a half million dollars from

1582
01:27:43.331 --> 01:27:46.860
that?
You guys are assholes.
The whole thing is an asshole organization will,

1583
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:49.960
you should all do is sit down and have a conversation.

1584
01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:54.700
Everybody sit down and you go,
what happened here?
And he gets a chance to say,

1585
01:27:54.701 --> 01:27:58.090
well,
I was hanging out with this chick and she,

1586
01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:02.440
I buy Ferrari's and shit.
I got a fat pen house for her.
She's my Goomada.

1587
01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.570
I got her on the side.
But uh,
every,
you know,

1588
01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:07.260
she fucks it all the black guys but just takes pictures and my friends sticking

1589
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:10.960
with my face mocking me.
So I told her,
don't take pictures of black guys.
Please.

1590
01:28:11.410 --> 01:28:14.170
What would you really freak out if someone said that?
He'd be like,

1591
01:28:14.171 --> 01:28:17.650
well that's an unfortunate relationship for that poor old billionaire and sort

1592
01:28:17.651 --> 01:28:18.430
of an unfortunate,

1593
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:22.750
even more unfortunate relationship for that lovely young lady who has such low

1594
01:28:22.751 --> 01:28:27.640
self esteem that she needs this old man.
To pay for her sex and buy her things.

1595
01:28:27.641 --> 01:28:29.680
And that's how she gets by,
by hustling.

1596
01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.700
And in the meantime she hangs out with all these black guys,
whatever,
man,

1597
01:28:33.701 --> 01:28:34.720
what do you give a fuck?

1598
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:39.340
This is goofy is a goofy thing for you to be taken up my CNN with over and over

1599
01:28:39.341 --> 01:28:39.970
and over again,

1600
01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:43.480
playing it back and forth and those sorts of details of the Donald Sterling

1601
01:28:43.481 --> 01:28:47.140
tapes emerge.
He didn't want him.
Come on,

1602
01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:52.630
come on.
Silly.
It's fucking,
it's,
it's a nonissue.
He's not an evil person.

1603
01:28:52.631 --> 01:28:56.080
He's not Hitler.
He didn't even say a racial slur.

1604
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.890
North Korea

1605
01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:02.040
<v 1>people are being sent to concentration camps.
CNN has zero interest in</v>

1606
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.020
<v 4>a really covering that.</v>

1607
01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:08.000
<v 2>You know that the depictions,
the illustrated depictions that,</v>

1608
01:29:08.001 --> 01:29:11.570
that one guy who escaped from the camp,
you've ever seen?
That one.

1609
01:29:11.571 --> 01:29:15.290
The guy was Kate from the prison camp was showing the various stages.
Brian,

1610
01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.710
he pulled out.
Pull that up cause you could see it.
You could walk,

1611
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:20.120
you could look at the actual images.
Yeah.
I don't think I've seen it,

1612
01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:22.730
but sounds pretty gross.
It's going to freak you the fuck out.

1613
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.510
It's a guy who escaped from this,
you know,
essentially slave camp.

1614
01:29:26.511 --> 01:29:27.640
The slave prison.
Yeah.

1615
01:29:27.650 --> 01:29:30.140
They had like hundreds of thousands of people there who are in straight up

1616
01:29:30.141 --> 01:29:32.120
concentration camp.
People are born there man.

1617
01:29:32.290 --> 01:29:35.020
Cause people are born in these camps.
I mean it's,
it's an,

1618
01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:38.180
it's unbelievably heartbreaking when you hear these stories.

1619
01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.720
And one guy escaped and he had been,
I think it's the same guy.

1620
01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.700
He had been born there.
He grew up there.

1621
01:29:43.701 --> 01:29:46.130
He had no idea what life outside the camps was.

1622
01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:50.260
And he started explaining all the various aspects of torture.
Um,

1623
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:54.470
w what level of deterioration they would judge prisoners out and it's complete

1624
01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:59.660
Nazi Germany type shit.
And it's going on in 2014.
Right now.

1625
01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:03.050
It's just like Nazi Germany stuff.
I mean it's,

1626
01:30:03.051 --> 01:30:05.480
I don't know how they single out the prisoners,

1627
01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:09.970
what they're in there for or why that is political dissent.
Is it crime?
Well,

1628
01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:13.670
I don't know what it is,
but they've,
what if,
when they,

1629
01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:15.860
once I've decided this is the enemy,
this is us,

1630
01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.570
<v 4>right,
is the good,
they don't have to do anything over there.
He,
uh,</v>

1631
01:30:18.571 --> 01:30:21.780
I think sent like all of his girlfriend's family or his ex girlfriend's family

1632
01:30:21.781 --> 01:30:24.750
to one of the camps or some shit.
Like,
it's crazy he did.

1633
01:30:24.930 --> 01:30:29.160
He's like Kim Jong,
whatever.
I forget the guy's name.

1634
01:30:29.161 --> 01:30:32.330
Kim Jong Gun.
Just Google that and like ex girlfriend.

1635
01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:36.430
<v 2>Oh God.
Well,
I know he did that one girlfriend,
he killed his uncle.
Right?</v>

1636
01:30:36.670 --> 01:30:38.860
He executed his uncle.
He's a crazy dude.

1637
01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.581
<v 4>So anyway,</v>

1638
01:30:41.581 --> 01:30:44.280
my point with that is that shows you that the whole media moral equivalency

1639
01:30:44.281 --> 01:30:47.790
thing is bullshit.
They focus on things as if it's a more outrage.
And I'm like,

1640
01:30:47.791 --> 01:30:50.580
yeah,
I could see how this is offensive,

1641
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:55.020
but what about that?
What about everything else happening in the world?

1642
01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:56.220
Yeah.

1643
01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:57.600
<v 2>I don't know,
man.
It's just,</v>

1644
01:30:58.350 --> 01:31:02.370
I couldn't even imagine living in a place like North Korea.
I mean,

1645
01:31:02.730 --> 01:31:03.690
it's not even,

1646
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.530
will you put your head in that place where you get to bring up whatever the

1647
01:31:07.531 --> 01:31:09.660
thing is?
Yeah.
Brian's is trying to find it.

1648
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:13.110
Soon as you find is the search terms that I'm not finding it.

1649
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:16.290
Did you write North Korea escape pictures?

1650
01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:22.260
North Korea escape pictures?
He,
um,
he drew them all.

1651
01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:27.000
Um,
it's,
it's really dark shit,
man.

1652
01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:30.930
He drew all these images of,
do you know what it is?

1653
01:31:30.931 --> 01:31:32.430
You know what I'm talking about?
I didn't find it.

1654
01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:41.730
Um,
prisoner.
Yeah,
that's it.
Yeah.

1655
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:45.690
Man.
Or escaped in North Korea prison.
This is it.
So this guy,
he,

1656
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:50.470
he drew these depictions of like how malnourished people would be.
Well,

1657
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:53.330
how they would treat them.
Um,

1658
01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:55.620
how they would treat them based on what they weighed,

1659
01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:59.500
what jobs he would give them up until the moment when they died.
You know,

1660
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.780
<v 0>unreal stuff.
Yeah.
It's insane.
Like,
look at this.
This guy's killing babies.</v>

1661
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:10.450
Jesus.
Yeah.
Dude,
this is,
it's dark and it's going on right now.

1662
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.670
I mean,
it's confirmed.
I mean,

1663
01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:17.170
it's a scary place when you know that the guy who's the head of Korea right now,

1664
01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.900
someone was trying to make coup against him.

1665
01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:24.670
He had him assassinated and he had his son's assassinated because he thought his

1666
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:27.610
sons would one day tried to seek revenge.
He has sons killed.

1667
01:32:27.611 --> 01:32:31.990
And then he had his wife and he gave his wife a res.
Hmm.
Yeah.

1668
01:32:31.991 --> 01:32:34.300
I gave her like a better position in a race,

1669
01:32:34.301 --> 01:32:36.940
like the whole situation has completely gangster.

1670
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:41.350
Could you imagine the guy kills your sons and then gives you some sort of a new

1671
01:32:41.351 --> 01:32:45.010
job?
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,
it seems normal.

1672
01:32:45.710 --> 01:32:48.020
<v 4>Well,
did they treat him almost as like a God?
Right.</v>

1673
01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:51.170
So it's a little bit different.
They war ship everything he does.

1674
01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:54.590
<v 0>I think it's just straight fear,
you know?
I don't know.</v>

1675
01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:58.790
That's probably part of it also.
Do you know that when,
when his father died,

1676
01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:03.200
if people didn't cry convincingly enough,
they got like six month terms.
Wow.

1677
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:06.800
2014 it's going on right now.
Happening

1678
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:07.551
<v 4>completely crazy.</v>

1679
01:33:07.551 --> 01:33:10.430
I can't see why the Twitter storm can't focus on that asshole for a little bit.

1680
01:33:10.431 --> 01:33:14.980
Make his life difficult.
What can you do?
What can you do?
Send them pizzas.

1681
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:18.570
Much bankrupt them until the US invades him.

1682
01:33:19.890 --> 01:33:22.350
<v 0>Well,
the problem is they,
they'll take it,
they'll be fine.</v>

1683
01:33:22.351 --> 01:33:25.200
There's enough resources that they'll be fine.
People will starve to death.

1684
01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:27.630
I mean,
look what they're doing to these people in these prisoner camps.

1685
01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.670
Fucking unbelievably terrifying shit,
man.
That can happen,

1686
01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:36.690
that the world can vary so much.
That's what's scary is it?

1687
01:33:36.691 --> 01:33:40.590
Cause it gives us the possibility of that happening here.

1688
01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.500
You start thinking like that.

1689
01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:44.760
<v 4>Well that's why I'm so against government overreach cause it doesn't start all</v>

1690
01:33:44.761 --> 01:33:49.080
at once.
And then at one point that was a new thing for them.
Like,

1691
01:33:49.081 --> 01:33:50.670
Oh I guess we got this now.
Right.

1692
01:33:50.671 --> 01:33:54.630
And then you grow up and that's just normalcy even though it's completely insane

1693
01:33:54.631 --> 01:33:59.280
to everybody else.
That's what this surveillance stuff is,
is complete insanity.

1694
01:33:59.281 --> 01:34:00.930
And everybody in Europe is pissed off about it.

1695
01:34:00.931 --> 01:34:03.510
And here things have been kind of normalized and it's like,

1696
01:34:03.511 --> 01:34:05.040
well it has kept us safe.

1697
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:10.320
And the new thing that came out I think in the Washington Post or the times is

1698
01:34:10.321 --> 01:34:13.710
about how nine out of 10 people that they're grabbing the photos and videos and

1699
01:34:13.711 --> 01:34:15.870
stuff of our,
not even the targets,

1700
01:34:15.871 --> 01:34:19.200
they're just people being incidentally sucked up.
But when they say like,

1701
01:34:19.201 --> 01:34:22.740
we're incidentally grabbing their data,
it means like really intimate stuff,

1702
01:34:22.741 --> 01:34:27.150
like the video conversations that people have had with their partners or just

1703
01:34:27.151 --> 01:34:30.460
being stored in databases.
And,
uh,

1704
01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:32.970
that's the beginning of,

1705
01:34:33.010 --> 01:34:36.540
and there was another report that they might be collecting baby photos.

1706
01:34:36.541 --> 01:34:39.180
The NSA might be archiving people's baby photos.

1707
01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:44.220
That's the beginning of not tomorrow,
but maybe in 50 years for sure.

1708
01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:46.530
Some shit like that because that's how it starts right there.

1709
01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:48.510
It's like you get to stage one,

1710
01:34:48.511 --> 01:34:50.670
maybe we don't even see stage two in our lifetimes.

1711
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.610
But to give people you don't know that kind of power is insane,

1712
01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:56.370
<v 0>right?
And if things go bad,</v>

1713
01:34:56.371 --> 01:35:00.350
that's when you justify stage two things are fine now.

1714
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:03.650
But look what if a Katrina type situation happened?

1715
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:05.810
One of the things that every leader,

1716
01:35:05.811 --> 01:35:10.811
every great military leader knows is that you must capitalize on opportunities.

1717
01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:14.600
And when a tragedy takes place,
it's not just a tragedy,

1718
01:35:14.601 --> 01:35:17.270
but it's also an opportunity for more control.

1719
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.900
And it's one of the things that classically people have done throughout time and

1720
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.870
in us history,
it's very easy to map.

1721
01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:28.370
And it's one of the reasons why conspiracy theories are so rampant when it comes

1722
01:35:28.371 --> 01:35:33.080
to big crimes like Oklahoma City is because you see a ramp up of the laws

1723
01:35:33.081 --> 01:35:36.500
afterwards.
And a lot of people think,
well,
this was a false flag event.

1724
01:35:36.501 --> 01:35:40.580
It was used to justify the ramping off of laws and now they have more control.

1725
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:42.590
Whether or not it was or wasn't.

1726
01:35:42.591 --> 01:35:46.940
The point being every time there is some sort of an incident where things go
bad,

1727
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:52.000
whoever is a power hungry fuckhead tried to take more control as if it would've

1728
01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.640
protected them from that situation.
Whether it's the Oklahoma thing,

1729
01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:59.960
whether it's nine 11 if nine 11 was just an attack and it wasn't just some

1730
01:36:00.170 --> 01:36:01.280
nefarious plot.

1731
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:05.000
I mean it was just some nefarious plot from some overseas people and had nothing

1732
01:36:05.001 --> 01:36:07.580
to do with the United States government.
It doesn't matter.

1733
01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.650
The United States government still capitalizing.

1734
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:11.280
<v 4>I think that's absolutely vin.</v>

1735
01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:15.990
That's absolutely what I believe happened by the way,
is that there was not a,

1736
01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:19.750
it was not an inside job.
It was an opportunity to stick thing afterwards where,

1737
01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.270
Oh,
this fell in our lap.

1738
01:36:21.450 --> 01:36:24.780
We're going to capitalize on it to the maximum amount possible,

1739
01:36:24.781 --> 01:36:25.441
which is what they did.

1740
01:36:25.441 --> 01:36:29.790
The neoconservatives under Bush got us into two wars that arguably we didn't

1741
01:36:29.791 --> 01:36:32.880
need to be in it at all.
What's a classic military.
Yeah,

1742
01:36:32.881 --> 01:36:36.780
and introduced all these laws that really I think shut down like a lot of the

1743
01:36:36.781 --> 01:36:40.680
innovation we're seeing now is people speaking freely,
podcast,
you know,

1744
01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.750
TV shows where people are really speaking their minds.

1745
01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:45.680
All that Shit Kinda went on ice during the Bush administration.
Like,

1746
01:36:45.690 --> 01:36:47.010
I hate to be like a Bush hater,

1747
01:36:47.011 --> 01:36:50.820
but I noticed because I was in high school at the time during the Bush

1748
01:36:50.821 --> 01:36:51.630
administration,

1749
01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:55.650
I was in high school when nine 11 happened and I noticed that the kind of death

1750
01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:59.280
of vitality and like people were afraid to be,

1751
01:37:00.090 --> 01:37:01.800
you don't want to sound like an asshole,
right?

1752
01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.280
Like everybody was for the Iraq war.
And if you're like,
I don't know,

1753
01:37:05.281 --> 01:37:09.060
like should we go in there?
People just go nine 11 have you forgotten?

1754
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:11.610
And I'm like,
I'm not sure how the two are connected.
Really.

1755
01:37:11.611 --> 01:37:14.880
Like I'm not sure why.
And some people were saying the same thing,

1756
01:37:14.881 --> 01:37:19.650
but the overriding thing was you don't want to be like against the country at

1757
01:37:19.651 --> 01:37:20.820
this important time.

1758
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.940
And that bullshit lasted for a decade where I'm sure a lot of terrible things

1759
01:37:23.941 --> 01:37:28.110
happen that we don't even know about yet and might not know about for awhile.

1760
01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.980
And only now are we starting to see like kind of the flowering of independent

1761
01:37:31.981 --> 01:37:35.340
thought that probably would have happened 10 fucking years ago if it weren't for

1762
01:37:35.341 --> 01:37:38.220
nine 11 and if it weren't for that crackdown cause we have the internet,

1763
01:37:38.221 --> 01:37:41.190
we were on the path and I feel like all this stuff now,

1764
01:37:41.191 --> 01:37:42.870
podcasting could have been in 2004

1765
01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:44.560
<v 0>it might have been,</v>

1766
01:37:44.561 --> 01:37:48.130
but the technology wasn't there yet as far as like the ability to broadcast.

1767
01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:50.300
<v 4>That's true.
The broad broad band wasn't there yet,</v>

1768
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:54.320
but just that movement of people speaking their minds would have started sooner.

1769
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:57.870
And there was fear like a lot of people were afraid and there are no fly list.

1770
01:37:57.871 --> 01:38:00.920
That was a serious thing for awhile.
People would say you,
oh don't fuck around.

1771
01:38:00.921 --> 01:38:01.860
You're gonna have the no fly list

1772
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:03.610
<v 3>now.
It was like,
it was abused.
Yeah.</v>

1773
01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:05.700
I mean it was abused by people that they were,

1774
01:38:05.701 --> 01:38:10.300
they were going after consenting journalism or a dissenting,
a journalist,

1775
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:12.260
Laura podiatrists who,
uh,

1776
01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.470
did that New York Times story about William Binney and she's done some other

1777
01:38:15.471 --> 01:38:18.830
important stuff since then.
She claims that every time she goes to an airport,

1778
01:38:18.831 --> 01:38:22.910
she gets the full thing because they want to show her like,
keep an eye.

1779
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:25.100
We're keeping an eye on you.
So well they just throw,

1780
01:38:25.101 --> 01:38:27.500
all they have to do is throw you on a list.
The people that are working,

1781
01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:31.160
they're giving him the f the frisking.
I mean,
they're not showing her shit.

1782
01:38:31.190 --> 01:38:34.310
They're just working conveyor belt.
Yeah.
They're making x amount per hour.

1783
01:38:34.311 --> 01:38:36.680
They're putting in their time waiting for that Buzzer to rank so they can get

1784
01:38:36.681 --> 01:38:40.160
the fuck out of there.
But someone,
all they had to do is put her on a list.
Yeah.

1785
01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:40.290
Yeah.

1786
01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:45.240
<v 4>That's,
uh,
that conveyor belt idea of like,
once the order has been given,</v>

1787
01:38:45.241 --> 01:38:47.160
then it's somebody just doing their job.
Yeah.

1788
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:50.550
That's why so much bad stuff in the world is happening right now.

1789
01:38:50.551 --> 01:38:54.430
Like this is what I research all day.
I'm kind of a obviously crazy,
but uh,

1790
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:59.580
the military to about that,
the military industrial complex is clearly real.

1791
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:00.630
It's a real thing.

1792
01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:05.280
It's an economic force where people get employed by companies that pay them way

1793
01:39:05.281 --> 01:39:07.860
more than they should be paid for.
What they're doing,
right?

1794
01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:12.750
So you get paid $200,000 to design the next drone.
Any other job at your age,

1795
01:39:12.751 --> 01:39:16.710
you'd be lucky to make $40,000 so you go into this new world where you don't

1796
01:39:16.711 --> 01:39:19.690
really belong and this is what happened is snowed in.
From what you know,

1797
01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:23.400
it seems like this young guy gets into this world where he's making far more

1798
01:39:23.401 --> 01:39:26.580
money than he would otherwise.
All you have to do is buy in.

1799
01:39:26.581 --> 01:39:28.380
All you have to do is I can see this,

1800
01:39:28.381 --> 01:39:31.980
I can see spying on everybody constantly cause it is keeping us safe and I'm

1801
01:39:31.981 --> 01:39:35.280
making a lot of money.
And if you're the drone designer,
drone designer,

1802
01:39:35.281 --> 01:39:37.770
I can see this.
So from your little perspective,

1803
01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:40.470
it's not all that bad and you branch out,

1804
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:44.160
you zoom out far enough and you see that we're a society that is basically run

1805
01:39:44.161 --> 01:39:48.780
by an avatar government that starts or at least provokes wars for its own

1806
01:39:48.781 --> 01:39:52.500
benefit and for very cynical reasons that have nothing to do with what they tell

1807
01:39:52.501 --> 01:39:57.000
us on TV.
And from there you go,
I can't stop the conveyor belt.

1808
01:39:57.150 --> 01:39:58.980
Nobody can,
you know,

1809
01:39:58.981 --> 01:40:03.480
you can send out 10,000 retweets are a million petitions that does not stop the

1810
01:40:03.481 --> 01:40:04.950
conveyor belt because at the end of the day,

1811
01:40:04.951 --> 01:40:09.000
that person who's doing whatever they're doing spying on you or frisking you,

1812
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:13.080
they're like,
well,
I'm not going to be unemployed.

1813
01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:17.010
Like I understand what you're saying,
semen on the podcast and I understand what,

1814
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.420
uh,
you know,
the eff says,
I'm not going to sit at home without a paycheck.

1815
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:23.910
I'd rather just be sifting through people's emails.

1816
01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:27.960
And obviously most people make that choice.
That's a problem with human nature,

1817
01:40:27.961 --> 01:40:31.970
I guess is people need money to pay their rent.
And,
um,

1818
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:35.670
the only solution is to actually change that economic structure.
Like by,

1819
01:40:35.671 --> 01:40:38.580
by military industrial complex.
That's old paradigm shit.

1820
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.800
Country to country warfare is over.

1821
01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.740
It's on its way out cause we're starting to move toward a different kind of

1822
01:40:43.741 --> 01:40:48.480
system and um,
that's,
it's cool for me to watch because it's actually happening.

1823
01:40:48.481 --> 01:40:51.150
Like what I'm talking about is not something out in the clouds.

1824
01:40:51.151 --> 01:40:54.280
It's already well underway.
Yeah.
It's,

1825
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.840
<v 2>it's a strange time in that their ability to do what they're doing,</v>

1826
01:40:58.841 --> 01:41:03.580
their ability to spy on people,
their ability to influence people,

1827
01:41:03.581 --> 01:41:08.500
their ability to have control over the populous with these,
uh,

1828
01:41:08.501 --> 01:41:12.940
these tools of surveillance is coinciding with people's ability to communicate

1829
01:41:12.941 --> 01:41:15.890
their,
their uh,
being upset about it.
This is,

1830
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:19.420
this is a weird time because in the sixties and seventies when all that

1831
01:41:19.421 --> 01:41:23.170
Watergate shit was going down,
what,
what voice did a regular person could have,

1832
01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:23.950
you could hope,

1833
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:26.880
you would just hope that the Washington Post would publish an op Ed.

1834
01:41:26.881 --> 01:41:29.170
Do you agree with,
and that's pretty much the extent of your power.

1835
01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:33.650
When Kennedy was assassinated,
what,
what,
what happened?
Well,
who taught we,

1836
01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.670
how did the people get their thoughts and imagine if there was an Alex Jones

1837
01:41:36.671 --> 01:41:40.060
back there back then when the real platform,
how insane that would have been.

1838
01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:42.340
Oh my God,
they would've killed him quick.

1839
01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:46.240
If Alex Jones lived in 1963 they would have killed the shit out of him.

1840
01:41:46.690 --> 01:41:49.930
Do you imagine?
They were probably was about 20 Alex Jones at the time,

1841
01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.140
but what could they have done though?
That's the point.

1842
01:41:53.141 --> 01:41:56.380
Like Alex Jones has a real radio show that he does on the Internet.

1843
01:41:56.590 --> 01:41:58.990
His youtube videos,
giant youtube channel.

1844
01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:04.140
He has a regular radio show mean what could a god have done in 1963 the answer

1845
01:42:04.841 --> 01:42:09.260
is nothing.
Yeah,
but no,
he's also a couple other assholes can't get laid.

1846
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:11.560
I wonder if they did.
How many people we think

1847
01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:14.120
<v 4>my uncle used to do it all the time and it was so creepy and be like,
Hey,</v>

1848
01:42:14.130 --> 01:42:16.170
want to talk to somebody?
And you'd be like talking like,
oh,

1849
01:42:16.171 --> 01:42:17.250
they're in Russian hours.

1850
01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:20.930
<v 2>Yeah,
I knew one dude who did it,
but that's it.
One.
I mean,
it wasn't like,</v>

1851
01:42:20.931 --> 01:42:24.740
it was like everybody had a radio in their house,
right.
Growing up,
it basically,

1852
01:42:24.741 --> 01:42:27.200
everybody had a TV.
If you didn't have a TV,
you were a Weirdo.

1853
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:29.210
Bobby just family doesn't believe in TV.

1854
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:30.920
That's like people who don't have internet.

1855
01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:32.870
If somebody says they don't have Internet,
I'm like,

1856
01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:36.790
I don't understand that at all.
Why would you do that?
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

1857
01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:40.130
I don't want to get caught up in it.
How about grown some fucking discipline.

1858
01:42:40.131 --> 01:42:42.890
You joining the human race.
Like if you don't have the internet,

1859
01:42:42.891 --> 01:42:45.380
you don't know what's happening.
Oh,
I don't know how to get online.

1860
01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:49.310
You don't win silly.
Fuck it.
This is the,

1861
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:53.240
this is the time to voice your opinions on things.
This is the time to speak up

1862
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:54.211
<v 4>and it's the top.
Well,</v>

1863
01:42:54.211 --> 01:42:57.480
it's the time to see that this old thing is luckily ending.

1864
01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:00.630
Like I think some people are still caught up in the,
um,

1865
01:43:01.530 --> 01:43:05.280
the police brutality outrageous that you see on the homepage of reddit every day

1866
01:43:05.281 --> 01:43:07.470
and that people are always tweeting.
That stuff's real.

1867
01:43:07.471 --> 01:43:09.030
And I understand why people are pissed.

1868
01:43:09.031 --> 01:43:12.570
And I 100% think it's the right move to shame the shit out of those people.

1869
01:43:12.571 --> 01:43:17.100
And always like have that,
that fire going.
But that's not the solution.

1870
01:43:17.101 --> 01:43:21.090
The solution is that economics are gradually shifting away from the military

1871
01:43:21.091 --> 01:43:26.091
industrial thing and we're shifting into a different economic model and that

1872
01:43:26.191 --> 01:43:30.540
will end this stuff like the spying and the drones and the police brutality.

1873
01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.411
That's what ends it.

1874
01:43:31.411 --> 01:43:35.370
Cause you just don't have as many cops and the cops you do have are more locally

1875
01:43:35.371 --> 01:43:36.061
financed.

1876
01:43:36.061 --> 01:43:39.990
And it's kind of the way it was and some kind of mad men utopia that probably

1877
01:43:39.991 --> 01:43:43.500
never existed.
It was a hell of a lot better than what we have right now.

1878
01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:47.640
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
what do you think is going to happen,
do you think,</v>

1879
01:43:47.641 --> 01:43:51.060
is this a war right now where technology and the,

1880
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:56.420
that the average person has to information is at odds with this gigantic

1881
01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:59.010
Neolithic Group of corporations,

1882
01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:03.890
corporations that are sort of combining forces to try to slow down the Internet?

1883
01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.590
Is this a battle of good and evil?

1884
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:11.600
Fucking Internet control net neutrality and regulations?

1885
01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.570
I want your Isp,
you little fuck,
give me your eyes be number,

1886
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:17.820
whether it's just stopping this tide is transcendence

1887
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:23.130
<v 4>good versus evil because then you fall into the US versus the outrage kind of</v>

1888
01:44:23.131 --> 01:44:25.500
thing.
I just look at the data and I,

1889
01:44:25.501 --> 01:44:28.860
that's what I've tried to do with as many aspects of my life as possible is

1890
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:32.160
emotion is fine because after you see the data you get emotional.

1891
01:44:32.161 --> 01:44:36.570
That's 100% fine,
but you shouldn't be deriving your conclusion from the emotion.

1892
01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:41.840
And what I see is that a lot of this stuff is going to end just essentially

1893
01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.813
ByDesign.

1894
01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:46.520
<v 2>So by design meaning that as innovation increases,</v>

1895
01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.670
people are not going to tolerate it anymore.

1896
01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:51.280
<v 4>Better technology or better technologies take off.</v>

1897
01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:56.050
I mean the reason why we're having this conversation is not because some Ben

1898
01:44:56.050 --> 01:44:59.560
Franklin was like within 200 something years we will have podcasts.

1899
01:44:59.561 --> 01:45:03.880
It's because gradual technological innovation comes along and it took probably a

1900
01:45:03.881 --> 01:45:07.480
million things before this to get to this point.
And now that you're here,

1901
01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:11.530
it doesn't take you any more effort to put out a podcast cause it's all built.

1902
01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.160
And it's the same thing with,
if you look at the development of travel,

1903
01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:16.930
people used to get around by foot,

1904
01:45:17.290 --> 01:45:21.610
then it was carriage is like Oregon trail type shit where if you had to go from

1905
01:45:21.611 --> 01:45:26.350
New York to California you might not make it now it's a flight that costs $250

1906
01:45:26.351 --> 01:45:27.640
and it takes like five hours.

1907
01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.960
And the same thing is happening with the economy where we're getting away from

1908
01:45:31.961 --> 01:45:36.961
old kind of superstitious technology and entering the age of science,

1909
01:45:37.541 --> 01:45:41.080
like science is now being applied to economics and to money.

1910
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:44.950
And that's going to change some of the worst aspects of society.

1911
01:45:45.970 --> 01:45:49.180
For sure.
For sure.
Like if anything I've researched,

1912
01:45:49.181 --> 01:45:51.910
this is the one that most convinced will not come true,

1913
01:45:51.911 --> 01:45:53.650
but it's already happening around us.
And what,

1914
01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.950
what makes you so positive that it's going to happen again?

1915
01:45:56.951 --> 01:46:00.050
Because it already is,
it's just in the early phases.
Like,
if you look at,
uh,

1916
01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:04.010
the B word,
you look at Bitcoin as an eight Jews call it the be yeah,

1917
01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:07.570
because I was debating whether to even talk about bitcoin this time because

1918
01:46:07.571 --> 01:46:11.590
people get so into it.
Uh,
it's like an,
it's because it's money.

1919
01:46:11.591 --> 01:46:13.480
People get emotional about money,
you know,
and it's,

1920
01:46:13.481 --> 01:46:15.820
they get into it in a negative way.
You mean?
Um,
no,

1921
01:46:15.821 --> 01:46:20.710
just I don't want to be known as the bitcoin person because that's not the

1922
01:46:20.711 --> 01:46:24.650
totality of me.
Right?
Like I think you should worry about that.
Okay.
Well anyway,

1923
01:46:24.651 --> 01:46:25.930
I'm going to be the bit,
all right,
good.

1924
01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.370
I just don't want it because call people are still like,

1925
01:46:27.371 --> 01:46:29.920
you're a great advocate for bitcoin.
I'm like,
I'm not trying to be like,

1926
01:46:29.921 --> 01:46:33.940
I'm trying to report on an important shift in society,
which,
so anyway,

1927
01:46:33.941 --> 01:46:38.350
bitcoin is worth $8 billion.
Is it really?
Four years?
Yeah.

1928
01:46:38.351 --> 01:46:40.330
Four years ago it was worth like nothing.

1929
01:46:40.331 --> 01:46:44.680
Like one guy traded 10,000 bitcoins on a discussion forum in exchange for

1930
01:46:44.681 --> 01:46:46.660
somebody to order him a pizza and pay for it.

1931
01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.780
And now those 10,000 bitcoins are worth like six point something million.

1932
01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:54.840
So something is happening in society,

1933
01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:58.080
something's happening in society where we're saying like,
oh,

1934
01:46:58.081 --> 01:47:01.020
we can create money without governments doing it for us.

1935
01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:03.390
And that's a very simple shift.
It's not a big deal.

1936
01:47:03.391 --> 01:47:06.510
People have already accepted at Earl's.
Bitcoin wouldn't be around.

1937
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:11.990
And if you take that little choice out to its logical conclusion,

1938
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:16.260
it's going to be a drastically different world in 10 20,
30 years,

1939
01:47:16.290 --> 01:47:19.710
it's going to be a different world and two years,
no doubt about it.
I mean,

1940
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:24.330
I think that we're seeing this now or people are starting to get paid in
Bitcoin,

1941
01:47:24.690 --> 01:47:25.880
like who did who,

1942
01:47:26.010 --> 01:47:29.250
there was a story recently about someone getting paid in Bitcoin.
Well,

1943
01:47:29.251 --> 01:47:33.120
John Fitch got paid and in Nautilus coin,
which is,
uh,

1944
01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:37.260
an alt coin,
so,
and he got paid in that for his last fight,
right?
Yeah.

1945
01:47:37.261 --> 01:47:39.060
Nautilus coin.
He got paid,

1946
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:42.720
I think it was 20,000 Nautilus coin and then some people contributed on top of

1947
01:47:42.721 --> 01:47:46.680
that.
Wow.
And it ended up on NBC.
Like this weekend's fight.

1948
01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:51.030
He was wearing boxers that have their logo all over it and that was done in

1949
01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:52.200
completely over the Internet.

1950
01:47:52.201 --> 01:47:55.890
I watched the deal go down on Twitter because he and Brian Kelly interacted

1951
01:47:55.891 --> 01:48:00.210
publicly and that's pretty cool because if you think about like what,

1952
01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:03.270
what did we use money for?
One of the things is sponsoring events,

1953
01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:05.850
like banks own stadiums.
That's going to change.

1954
01:48:05.851 --> 01:48:10.100
It's going to be bitcoin stadium and you know,
doggy coin,
uh,

1955
01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:13.740
whatever I said,
Doge coin or doggy coin.

1956
01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:17.640
I've tried both and I get,
I get called out either way.

1957
01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:21.150
I prefer to say Doge coin because it sounds a little bit more sophisticated and

1958
01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.710
doggy coin.
Yeah.
What does it stand for?
It's,
it's an Internet meme.

1959
01:48:25.711 --> 01:48:30.390
A that that dog with a stupid face,
a the Sheba,
whatever that breed is.

1960
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:34.370
How famous she would he know.
Yeah.
Is that a she,
she blew it up.

1961
01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:37.650
He's got the main output.
So in front of anything you want to say,

1962
01:48:37.651 --> 01:48:41.190
basically like so rich,
so,
so wow.
You know,
such whoa.

1963
01:48:41.650 --> 01:48:46.650
So that's where Doge coin came and emerged as a novelty coin and then got so

1964
01:48:46.921 --> 01:48:48.930
much transaction volume that people started.

1965
01:48:48.931 --> 01:48:50.730
Some people started to take it seriously.

1966
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:53.010
It's so strange with stuff like that happens,
isn't it?

1967
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:58.140
It's like what makes a bitcoin just take take off other than the great design,

1968
01:48:58.410 --> 01:49:01.810
but what?
What makes it bit coin?
What makes a Doge coin that makes,

1969
01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:05.370
that's what's so exciting about it now point is human psychology,

1970
01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:09.960
like that's the reason why the $50 bill in your pocket is a $50 bill and not the

1971
01:49:09.961 --> 01:49:13.260
sheet of paper,
right?
It's purely psychology.
You see the pyramid on the back,

1972
01:49:13.261 --> 01:49:16.620
you see the dude on the front,
that's money to you.
Totally enough.

1973
01:49:16.621 --> 01:49:19.560
People around the world have said that,
you know,

1974
01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:23.070
bitcoin and even some people have said that Doge coin,
like,
you know what?

1975
01:49:23.071 --> 01:49:23.881
This is money to me,

1976
01:49:23.881 --> 01:49:28.050
I understand that it took somebody time to make and that it can't be
counterfeit.

1977
01:49:28.051 --> 01:49:32.010
Those are really the two biggest properties of any of these coins is they're

1978
01:49:32.011 --> 01:49:35.340
hard to make and you can't counterfeit them,
period.

1979
01:49:35.610 --> 01:49:39.360
So when you get that thing going,
you trade it back and forth over time.

1980
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:42.840
Some people lose their password.
So over time the amount is reducing.

1981
01:49:42.841 --> 01:49:45.540
I'm talking about bit coin,
not Dutch coin because there are too many dose coins,

1982
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:48.070
but bitcoin you're using it constantly.

1983
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.820
So the amount is being reduced over time just through through usage.

1984
01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:55.350
But unlike a government currency where people uh,

1985
01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:58.720
know that more money will be printed,
this is the opposite.
Like we,

1986
01:49:58.721 --> 01:50:02.140
oh we know that only so much is going to be printed over time and then that's it

1987
01:50:02.141 --> 01:50:03.520
ever.
So fascinating.

1988
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:06.700
And so what might happen is some kind of weird feeding frenzy where everybody

1989
01:50:06.701 --> 01:50:11.050
gets into it at once because increasing values create one of the strongest

1990
01:50:11.051 --> 01:50:15.490
network effects that we know of is people like you think about how fast Facebook

1991
01:50:15.491 --> 01:50:17.500
took off.
That was just people like,
oh,

1992
01:50:17.501 --> 01:50:22.270
it's cool that I can casually spy on my friends that I'm in class with.
This is,

1993
01:50:22.330 --> 01:50:26.380
oh,
I now have complete control over my own money.
And it's appreciating,
you know,

1994
01:50:26.381 --> 01:50:30.250
at a certain rate that beats anything that of traditional bank can offer.

1995
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:33.490
The problem is that these things come and go so frequently that people don't

1996
01:50:33.491 --> 01:50:36.970
want to dip their fingers or their feet in the water thinking that it might be

1997
01:50:36.971 --> 01:50:41.320
the next AOL.
Right.
You know,
that might be the first one,
the first one,

1998
01:50:41.321 --> 01:50:44.770
and then they really get it locked down to what we all agree to a,
you know,

1999
01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.930
elder coin or whatever the fuck we're going to call it,
you know,

2000
01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:49.750
five years from now or two years from now.

2001
01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:53.560
I'm going to share my strategy and I absolutely do not want anybody to think

2002
01:50:53.561 --> 01:50:55.390
that this is like what you should do.

2003
01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:58.510
This is just what I've done so people can understand like,
you know,

2004
01:50:58.690 --> 01:51:02.650
this is what I believe is a good thing to do for me,
not for anybody else.
Uh,

2005
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:07.420
I agree with you 100%.
I'm only convinced that this currency thing will take off.

2006
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:11.200
I'm not even 100% convinced that bitcoin will make it because the bitcoin

2007
01:51:11.201 --> 01:51:15.790
foundation has been doing some really stupid fucked up things.
Like what?
Well,

2008
01:51:15.791 --> 01:51:18.970
they appointed a guy who has a really checkered past and I feel like I

2009
01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:25.320
should not have been,
you know,
a part of that organization.
But point is,

2010
01:51:25.530 --> 01:51:28.460
can you,
do you mind saying like,
what is this checkered past?
Like,
wait,

2011
01:51:28.461 --> 01:51:31.510
can you say checkered past?
You can Google it.
It's too serious that,

2012
01:51:31.511 --> 01:51:34.180
I don't even want to say it,
but it's really bad.

2013
01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:38.710
Bad allegation of violence stuff.
Uh,
like,
like molestation type stuff.

2014
01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:44.860
And uh,
this,
I,
I think if you Google this,
it might be public.

2015
01:51:44.861 --> 01:51:47.680
It doesn't really matter.
But uh,
might be now.

2016
01:51:49.250 --> 01:51:53.380
Anyway,
the point is that foundation I feel like has made some bad moves.

2017
01:51:53.730 --> 01:51:57.960
And aside from that,
it's the first one.
So if you look at like compuserve,

2018
01:51:58.540 --> 01:52:00.250
they probably want a lot of battles.

2019
01:52:00.251 --> 01:52:02.760
We're not using fucking compuserve to connect to the Internet,
right?

2020
01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:06.040
So I'm only convinced that the technology will win,
not that bitcoin will win.

2021
01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:09.760
So what I do is I own a little bit of Bitcoin and again,
I'm not rich,

2022
01:52:09.761 --> 01:52:11.320
so this is like a reasonable person money.

2023
01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:15.580
I own a little bit of bitcoin and I also in a little bit of the three or four

2024
01:52:15.581 --> 01:52:19.570
currencies after bitcoin that show the most promise and I own enough of each one

2025
01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:23.290
that should they come in and become the next bitcoin or the next light coin,

2026
01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:26.210
I'll be really satisfied.
But if they don't come in,

2027
01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:27.280
it's not the end of the world.

2028
01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:31.600
And what I'm doing is when one currency doesn't do anything new for two months

2029
01:52:31.601 --> 01:52:36.280
or something better comes out,
I shift the money into that one.
So my,
my ideas,

2030
01:52:36.370 --> 01:52:40.510
however long this process takes of us going digital to new kinds of money,

2031
01:52:40.511 --> 01:52:44.020
which is happening all be in at least one of the ones that does well.

2032
01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:45.830
And we'll just try to keep,

2033
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.890
<v 3>I think at this point they're already mature brands that will take off.</v>

2034
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:50.390
Do you ever see a point where,

2035
01:52:50.391 --> 01:52:53.110
you know how you'd go to the airport and you see the government,
uh,

2036
01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:57.860
currency exchange where it's like Australian dollar is Mexican pesos and it has

2037
01:52:57.861 --> 01:52:59.750
all the things like what the rates are,
you know,

2038
01:52:59.751 --> 01:53:01.970
those things they have at the airport.
We can exchange your money.

2039
01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:05.660
Do you ever think it's going to come a point where there's so many accepted

2040
01:53:05.661 --> 01:53:07.880
currencies that we have that on everything.

2041
01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:10.670
Like this is what every price is like,
it's worth this much of that.

2042
01:53:10.671 --> 01:53:14.420
And it's a fluctuating thing.
It's on a uh,
like a like,
you know,

2043
01:53:14.421 --> 01:53:15.980
some sort of a stock market,

2044
01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:20.150
sort of a ticker tape type of thing where it flux because it does fluctuate on a

2045
01:53:20.151 --> 01:53:23.510
daily basis.
I have some bitcoin.
It's interesting to watch it go up and down.

2046
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:26.690
Sometimes it's,
it's a big jump and sometimes it's a big drop.

2047
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:31.520
What you just mentioned already exists basically like the alt market will blow

2048
01:53:31.521 --> 01:53:35.230
your mind.
If you go on a,
you can bring up,
um,
it'll,

2049
01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:38.690
it'll blow the mind as far as like your ability to purchase things.
No,

2050
01:53:38.691 --> 01:53:40.910
just how many currencies are trading against each other.

2051
01:53:40.911 --> 01:53:44.300
It really is exactly like that foreign exchange board at the airport.

2052
01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:47.270
Except way more complex.
Like if you go on mint pal,

2053
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:51.620
there are a range of currencies that you probably and I have not even heard of

2054
01:53:52.130 --> 01:53:53.840
and they're trading against bitcoin.

2055
01:53:53.841 --> 01:53:56.180
And in some cases trading against other currencies,

2056
01:53:56.181 --> 01:53:59.210
like there are currencies now that don't even really trade against bitcoin

2057
01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:02.240
because they're like two steps removed from that.

2058
01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:06.950
How would it be possible that all these could exist and you could purchase items

2059
01:54:06.951 --> 01:54:08.750
from it from with them?

2060
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:12.110
Rather like say if you want to get a case of this delicious sea two oh coconut

2061
01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:14.570
oil,
this is not a paid sponsor.
This is not a plug.

2062
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:16.910
There's not like an unfair plug that I put in there.

2063
01:54:16.911 --> 01:54:20.270
But if you wanted to buy a case of this and would they have to have like a bunch

2064
01:54:20.271 --> 01:54:23.450
of deer,
like it's worth to doge coins,

2065
01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.500
it's worth 1.9 bit.
You know what I mean?
Could you have,

2066
01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:31.520
you're not,
you might just be a currency exchange programs.

2067
01:54:31.521 --> 01:54:35.090
It probably went program.
They just like an APP.
The math for it,
like an APP.

2068
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:38.420
So you would have to the everybody that works in a store,

2069
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:40.690
like you'd have to run a price.
Well,

2070
01:54:40.691 --> 01:54:44.330
it's what's interesting is since this is software and not government issued

2071
01:54:44.331 --> 01:54:48.290
currencies,
this stuff can happen instantly.
You don't need to be like,
oh,

2072
01:54:48.291 --> 01:54:51.020
we need to check in with the government of Argentina and make sure they're cool

2073
01:54:51.021 --> 01:54:52.580
with this.
It just happens immediately.

2074
01:54:52.610 --> 01:54:56.180
So there are already services being built that are pretty much what you're

2075
01:54:56.181 --> 01:54:56.631
thinking of.

2076
01:54:56.631 --> 01:54:59.780
Like they want to work on universal wallets where you don't have to think about

2077
01:54:59.781 --> 01:55:02.120
what currency you're sending,
you're just sending somebody value.

2078
01:55:02.121 --> 01:55:05.750
So if I want to send you $10 worth of internet value,
I could do it.

2079
01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:10.130
I don't have to even know what currency it is as long as it's a mutually agreed

2080
01:55:10.131 --> 01:55:13.610
amount of money.
Right.
If it could be a mutually agreed upon number,

2081
01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.880
like instead of saying this is a hundred bitcoins,

2082
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:21.070
it could just be this is a hundred well 100 and Bitcoin is 98 a hundred and Doge

2083
01:55:21.411 --> 01:55:24.530
coin is one oh one you know what I mean?
Like whatever the number is,

2084
01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:25.430
the value number,

2085
01:55:25.431 --> 01:55:28.850
you entered into an app and it will read out what it is and whatever currency

2086
01:55:28.851 --> 01:55:29.684
you choose to use.

2087
01:55:30.170 --> 01:55:33.890
And since it's all going to be done online and it's all sort of,
you know,

2088
01:55:33.891 --> 01:55:36.290
in hard drives in the in space,

2089
01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:39.770
you could kind of like have as many of them as you want it.

2090
01:55:39.771 --> 01:55:43.680
It's not like if you had a cash register and you're at a store and some asshole

2091
01:55:43.681 --> 01:55:44.010
comes in

2092
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.620
<v 4>with Canadian money and he wants Australia and change,
like pitch,</v>

2093
01:55:46.621 --> 01:55:49.710
get the fuck out of here.
You're crazy.
I don't have Australian money.

2094
01:55:49.890 --> 01:55:54.890
But if you are digitally connected and you service 20 major coin,

2095
01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:59.960
you know,
whatever you would call them,
programs,
what would you call them?
Uh,

2096
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:03.150
people call him our ses,
I think actually,

2097
01:56:03.151 --> 01:56:07.210
I mean it's more software than currency,
but everybody calls it a currency and a,

2098
01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:09.570
if you look at um,
Hollywood boulevard,

2099
01:56:09.571 --> 01:56:12.180
they have some of those foreign exchange stands also.

2100
01:56:12.190 --> 01:56:14.310
There are a couple of stores you walk in,
you trade your,

2101
01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:18.300
if you're a Chinese tourists,
you trade your won for US dollars.

2102
01:56:18.301 --> 01:56:21.990
Then you can shop at,
you know,
the shops there.
That step is going to go away,

2103
01:56:21.991 --> 01:56:24.150
not just on Hollywood boulevard,
all over the world.

2104
01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:26.910
You think about how cool that is that now you can travel to any country,

2105
01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:31.200
walk into their malls and just pay with a mutually agreed upon currency.

2106
01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:35.180
It seems inevitable doesn't it sort of like we looked at the Internet in 1993 is

2107
01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:37.210
like wow,
this is kind of cool thing that you're,

2108
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:39.480
well it didn't even seem like it was free.

2109
01:56:39.490 --> 01:56:42.420
It was the internet because it was going through the line,
the phone line.

2110
01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:45.750
It was just a shitty version of the TV that couldn't play movies.

2111
01:56:45.810 --> 01:56:48.000
That's what's happening now.
Some of these people are Weirdos,

2112
01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:50.580
some of this stuff and you're like Doge coin,
what the fuck is this?

2113
01:56:50.581 --> 01:56:53.820
But like out of that you're starting to see the very beginnings of a,

2114
01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:58.320
one of the companies I've been covering is a company that does this like

2115
01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.210
legitimately as a product.

2116
01:57:00.211 --> 01:57:04.230
Like they have I think 16 or 17 employees and they build currencies.

2117
01:57:04.231 --> 01:57:06.990
That's what they do.
They build currencies and if they haven't built it,

2118
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:11.880
they find ones that are taking off and support them and mind them and make money

2119
01:57:11.881 --> 01:57:13.290
off of them and see.

2120
01:57:13.290 --> 01:57:16.530
You're starting to see like a more professional kind of environment where

2121
01:57:16.531 --> 01:57:18.300
there's still a lot of experimentation,

2122
01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:22.350
but it's starting to be like this is serious business and I think it was

2123
01:57:22.351 --> 01:57:22.830
Citibank.

2124
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:27.600
So that digital currency by 2020 is going to be like a $10 trillion industry or

2125
01:57:27.601 --> 01:57:29.970
something insane.
And we got to get from there to here,

2126
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.910
from here to there and we're already at the year 2014.

2127
01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:35.910
So a lot of money gets made over the next six years.

2128
01:57:36.150 --> 01:57:39.750
A lot of money gets lost and a lot of new stuff gets created that we can't even

2129
01:57:39.751 --> 01:57:44.070
think of yet.
I totally could see it.
I totally didn't see it.

2130
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:46.820
It seems like the people that are all,
uh,

2131
01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:49.650
hedging their bets now and it's almost like they know something's going to

2132
01:57:49.651 --> 01:57:53.490
happen.
Like they see this bubbling on the surface like a volcano's about to rob,

2133
01:57:53.491 --> 01:57:55.190
but they can't figure out which were,

2134
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:57.810
where's the mainstream going to come out of it?
It's going to be here.

2135
01:57:57.811 --> 01:58:01.320
Is it going to be here?
This is,
this is the next Internet,
this is the next thing.

2136
01:58:01.410 --> 01:58:05.190
It absolutely is.
And it's going to be fucked.
Uh,
people,

2137
01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:08.190
I think by now people listen to your show.
Sort of know my track record.

2138
01:58:08.191 --> 01:58:12.570
I wasn't wrong about drones,
I wasn't wrong about the NSA really.
And this one,

2139
01:58:12.571 --> 01:58:16.270
you're on about a lot of shit.
This is going to be big.
And it's,
uh,

2140
01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:20.160
what's called a black swan event and people aren't familiar with black swan

2141
01:58:20.161 --> 01:58:22.490
event is the thing like the financial crisis in oh eight,

2142
01:58:22.491 --> 01:58:24.930
that takes everybody spice surprise and changes everything.

2143
01:58:25.410 --> 01:58:28.530
And this is the same deal.
It's like now we have an airplane before we did it.

2144
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:32.310
What do we do with this airplane?
Oh,
let's start.
Let's try to fly to London.

2145
01:58:32.311 --> 01:58:34.260
And before you know it,
you have commercial air flight.

2146
01:58:34.590 --> 01:58:36.630
That's what's going to happen here.
As people are experimenting.

2147
01:58:36.631 --> 01:58:38.850
And before you know it,
there's no more euro dollar.

2148
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:43.690
There's just bitcoin and whatever else.
We as a people,
as a species is money.

2149
01:58:43.930 --> 01:58:47.410
And here's where it gets really cool.
And then I'll shut up about this.
But,
uh,

2150
01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:53.770
um,
somebody on the Reddit bitcoin a category,
they're subreddit,

2151
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:57.400
uh,
posted this thing about how if you really think about what's happening,

2152
01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:01.870
people are making money from these coins because they have to mine them,

2153
01:59:01.871 --> 01:59:05.290
which takes energy.
You're getting your utility bill goes up.

2154
01:59:05.291 --> 01:59:08.820
When you're mining these coins,
you notice the difference.
And uh,

2155
01:59:10.150 --> 01:59:12.000
so what people are doing regardless of language,

2156
01:59:12.001 --> 01:59:15.370
is deciding that I can transfer some of my energy for money,

2157
01:59:15.371 --> 01:59:18.310
for actual money that I can use to buy anything else in this physical world.

2158
01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:21.610
So now you have a globally competitive,

2159
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:24.940
a market for energy that will be created as a result.

2160
01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:28.480
You'll have entrepreneurs who aren't interested in creating coins.

2161
01:59:28.481 --> 01:59:31.330
They're interested in how do I get energy as cheaply as possible.

2162
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:34.570
So you'll see solar fields in the deserts in Africa,

2163
01:59:34.571 --> 01:59:38.260
maybe to fuel a mine for a cryptocurrency.

2164
01:59:39.190 --> 01:59:40.170
So it's gonna.

2165
01:59:40.210 --> 01:59:44.410
What it's gonna do is incentivize a lot of us to find cheaper energy no matter

2166
01:59:44.411 --> 01:59:45.040
what.

2167
01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:48.220
So you're going to see all this innovation where the energy industry has to get

2168
01:59:48.221 --> 01:59:51.970
cheaper and cheaper because we have to continue mining these currencies.
Fuck.

2169
01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:53.710
Which is pretty crazy to think about.

2170
01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.130
So it's a technology that by design is going to make us,

2171
01:59:57.670 --> 01:59:59.260
I'm using all these bullshit terms like better,

2172
01:59:59.261 --> 02:00:01.900
but we're going to care more about cheap energy than we do now,

2173
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:04.990
which I see as a good thing and we're going to care more about what does my

2174
02:00:04.991 --> 02:00:08.110
purchasing power mean.
Did I really agree that this has value?

2175
02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:10.930
And that's what's so cool about all this stuff is that nobody's forcing anybody

2176
02:00:10.931 --> 02:00:12.790
to do anything.
It's all voluntary

2177
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:16.640
<v 2>and it's all happening while marijuana is becoming illegal or becoming legal,</v>

2178
02:00:16.641 --> 02:00:19.820
rather,
it's all happening on marijuana is legal in Colorado.
They just,

2179
02:00:19.821 --> 02:00:24.260
I just tweeted something today about the statistics from Colorado that they're

2180
02:00:24.261 --> 02:00:28.970
getting back from as far as crime and revenue,
more revenue than ever before.

2181
02:00:28.971 --> 02:00:32.360
More revenue than even projected and less crime.

2182
02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:32.650
<v 4>Yup.</v>

2183
02:00:32.650 --> 02:00:35.980
Cause you were locking up poor tourists and college kids and now it's no longer

2184
02:00:35.981 --> 02:00:37.570
a crime.
So you're making money off it.

2185
02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:41.460
<v 2>Shit,
loads one and New York legalize it.</v>

2186
02:00:41.461 --> 02:00:42.490
Brian who talk about this because I got it.

2187
02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:46.640
<v 1>Yeah.
New York to today legalized medical marijuana.
Um,</v>

2188
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:51.940
it's becoming the state to permit this use a Monday and said,

2189
02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:52.551
hey,

2190
02:00:52.551 --> 02:00:56.450
I found that video though a that you were talking about earlier about you come

2191
02:00:56.451 --> 02:00:57.280
at me Bro.

2192
02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:01.270
<v 4>Oh,
uh,
yeah.
It's uh,
do you even lift bro?
Is that the one?</v>

2193
02:01:02.250 --> 02:01:06.700
Yeah.
Let's see what this is.

2194
02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:11.850
<v 1>Um,
but I don't know that medical marijuana thing though in New York is a,</v>

2195
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:14.820
I don't think it's,
it's like legit medical marijuana.

2196
02:01:14.821 --> 02:01:16.650
It's probably not going to be like the California.

2197
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:21.960
I just got my license renewed yesterday and it was the first time where it

2198
02:01:21.961 --> 02:01:24.240
actually was a little bit harder than normal.

2199
02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:27.780
And I don't know if it was just the doctor because the doctor was like this old

2200
02:01:27.781 --> 02:01:29.550
doctor and you walk in and you guys,
all right.
What,

2201
02:01:29.551 --> 02:01:31.500
why do you need medical marijuana and use,

2202
02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:35.770
I used to be able to just say it eases me with stress.
I,

2203
02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:39.230
it helps me go to sleep at night.
Uh,
it helps me eat.

2204
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:40.970
And what's funny is those things are true.

2205
02:01:40.971 --> 02:01:45.500
Like you would probably be taking Xanax or a sleeping pill if you weren't using

2206
02:01:45.501 --> 02:01:48.410
weeds.
So when people say like,
Oh,
I'm a medical marijuana patient,

2207
02:01:48.411 --> 02:01:51.320
like it actually is medicine.
Right?
But he came at me like,

2208
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:55.910
that's not a medical medical reason.
And I'm like,
well,
I use it to sleep.

2209
02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:59.180
That's not a medical reason.
Uh,
I get it for stress.
That's not magic.
My inquiry.

2210
02:01:59.390 --> 02:02:02.510
Then I finally said,
headache.
It goes,
all right,
that's a medical reason.

2211
02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:04.390
And then he like signed the paper.
Uh,

2212
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:07.560
but my friend that was with this guy sounds like the grand Terino of like,
yeah.

2213
02:02:08.370 --> 02:02:09.203
Yeah.

2214
02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:11.790
<v 3>Why would you do that?
Why would you go to there?
Go to Idleman.</v>

2215
02:02:11.850 --> 02:02:16.650
What would you go anywhere else?
A lot of money.
He's um,

2216
02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:20.280
you know,
he went to jail though.
He gets my props because he went to jail.

2217
02:02:20.281 --> 02:02:24.720
He was like one of the pioneers,
but 220 versus 200.

2218
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:28.350
It's less than that.
But I know what you're saying.
Yeah.
But that's what you get.

2219
02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:32.970
You get some fucking fuck off script a joint,

2220
02:02:32.971 --> 02:02:36.570
then you're not going to go to jail.
Decriminalized in California a long time.

2221
02:02:36.571 --> 02:02:38.670
I know.
All those sorts of Niagara decriminalized it.

2222
02:02:38.671 --> 02:02:41.280
The worst you can get is like a ticket and get like a ticket.

2223
02:02:41.281 --> 02:02:42.420
If they catch you smoking it and they

2224
02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:48.360
point out the legalization thing cause that's happening simultaneously and is

2225
02:02:48.361 --> 02:02:49.800
every bit is important.
Like yes,

2226
02:02:49.801 --> 02:02:53.310
because it's creating entrepreneurs and creating revenue by people that smoke

2227
02:02:53.311 --> 02:02:57.360
pot.
It's a completely different ethic.
It's going to even amber Lyon,

2228
02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.580
our mutual friend,
uh,
his committed,
you know,

2229
02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:05.600
pretty much her professional time right now to promoting this idea of a medical

2230
02:03:05.851 --> 02:03:09.120
uses for psychedelics,
which is,
it was recently in slate.

2231
02:03:09.121 --> 02:03:12.150
Like it seems like the whole kind of mainstream consciousness is coming around

2232
02:03:12.151 --> 02:03:13.620
to this idea that well shit,

2233
02:03:13.621 --> 02:03:16.380
if it works and we're starting to have that attitude towards everything.

2234
02:03:16.381 --> 02:03:20.910
Like bitcoin sounds crazy,
but if it works and the fees are lower,
why not?

2235
02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.200
And yeah,
it's the same with this.

2236
02:03:22.201 --> 02:03:25.770
Like if people can be more relaxed and maybe have some personal insights,

2237
02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:28.950
why not?
We should give out ambers websites,
reset.me,

2238
02:03:29.010 --> 02:03:32.940
reset dot Emmy and it's a new website that she created entirely based on the

2239
02:03:32.941 --> 02:03:36.060
idea of resetting consciousness through psychedelics.

2240
02:03:36.061 --> 02:03:39.030
And all the latest research and news on psychedelics.

2241
02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:41.850
She wants it to be like the Huffington post for psychedelics.

2242
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:47.730
She went hogwild I found that I just went full on hog.
She went full hog.

2243
02:03:47.731 --> 02:03:52.080
She's awesome video that he was talking about earlier.
That do you even lift bro?

2244
02:03:52.230 --> 02:03:53.580
Okay,
well good.
So hold on a second.

2245
02:03:53.581 --> 02:03:55.380
We just want to talk about amber because she's,
uh,

2246
02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:59.400
she's this new website is very important for her.
She,
um,

2247
02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:02.850
she kind of was really,
she talked about it on the podcast.

2248
02:04:02.851 --> 02:04:06.660
She was really like down in the dumps and very bummed out about her situation.

2249
02:04:06.661 --> 02:04:11.661
The leaving CNN and decided to just take a trip down to the jungle and went to,

2250
02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:13.080
well she was working in the,

2251
02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:16.680
she was working in the factory and finally saw how the sausage is made.
Exactly.

2252
02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:18.360
And for,
I mean I used to,

2253
02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:21.390
I still consider myself a journalist and it is a depressing moment when you

2254
02:04:21.391 --> 02:04:24.040
realize like,
this is fucked.
Yeah.
But you don't work for anybody doing it.

2255
02:04:24.041 --> 02:04:26.700
I don't work for that.
But kind of journalist,
you know,

2256
02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:30.540
and the best kind of journalist is to kind of journalists that she saw that from

2257
02:04:30.541 --> 02:04:33.540
within CNN.
I just see that from outside.
I'm like,
oh,

2258
02:04:33.541 --> 02:04:36.450
these people are all fucked up.
But she got to see that from the inside,

2259
02:04:36.451 --> 02:04:37.740
which has got a fascinating,

2260
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:38.791
<v 2>well,
fascinating,</v>

2261
02:04:38.791 --> 02:04:41.820
but also depressing because how hard do you have to work to get to CNN?
Yeah,

2262
02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:45.610
very hard.
I mean,
look in,
they find out you're not playing ball.
He does.

2263
02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:48.450
A lot of people have these idealized visions of what they're going to be able to

2264
02:04:48.451 --> 02:04:49.800
accomplish as a journalist,
you know,

2265
02:04:49.801 --> 02:04:52.800
I'm going to be the next guy who breaks the big story,

2266
02:04:52.801 --> 02:04:54.960
the next girl who takes down the evil regime.

2267
02:04:54.961 --> 02:04:57.660
And then you get over and you film the evil regime when you have all this

2268
02:04:57.661 --> 02:04:58.950
evidence and your risk your life,

2269
02:04:58.951 --> 02:05:02.070
and it gets really crazy and herring and get back to the states and they put out

2270
02:05:02.071 --> 02:05:03.030
an info piece,

2271
02:05:03.031 --> 02:05:07.380
like an infotainment infomercial piece of the city and you're like,
Whoa,

2272
02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:10.110
how come you didn't have a sniper footage?
Why?
Where's the sniper footage?

2273
02:05:10.111 --> 02:05:13.170
Where's the people dying?
Where's the like what are you guys doing here?

2274
02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:15.630
What's going on here?
You just made up fluff piece.

2275
02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:18.370
We have the best Starbucks if anywhere in the Middle East.
Started

2276
02:05:20.010 --> 02:05:23.220
her new site is great though.
She spent a lot of time on it and a lot of effort.

2277
02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.750
Uh,
so um,

2278
02:05:24.810 --> 02:05:28.110
just just to check it out for something that's interesting to go to reset.me

2279
02:05:28.170 --> 02:05:31.020
lots of cool stuff on there too.
Like I said,

2280
02:05:31.021 --> 02:05:34.230
she wants it to be the Huffington post of psychedelics.

2281
02:05:35.670 --> 02:05:38.100
So what were you saying about um,
the do lift bro?

2282
02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:40.230
I just find that video that we had brought up earlier,

2283
02:05:40.231 --> 02:05:41.610
they were going to talk to the Russian guy.

2284
02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:46.410
He does pranking a big giant.

2285
02:05:46.411 --> 02:05:49.710
People ask them if they lift.
Is this old or new?

2286
02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:52.600
It's like a year or two old surprise.

2287
02:05:52.601 --> 02:05:55.970
You guys haven't seen it but he does new stuff.
He's a,
this is him.
He's going to,

2288
02:05:57.090 --> 02:05:58.180
<v 7>why won't take a picture of my heart?</v>

2289
02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:00.830
Is this the skinniest thing I've ever seen in my life,
Bro?

2290
02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:04.100
You got to start lifting man.
You're getting to self.
Would do it.

2291
02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:07.180
He hurt my friend.
What does that supposed to mean?

2292
02:06:07.181 --> 02:06:10.350
You're about to get yourself into a world of trouble.
My friend gives me a term.

2293
02:06:10.351 --> 02:06:14.990
I'll walk away.
Really lift up your glasses.
Oh yeah.

2294
02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:20.240
Oh,
what do you deal with?

2295
02:06:20.241 --> 02:06:23.600
You call me out and then
you're gonna find me.

2296
02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:34.220
What do you mean?
What am I doing?
Well,

2297
02:06:34.250 --> 02:06:35.083
if you punched me,

2298
02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:41.420
you guys need a number of the gym.

2299
02:06:44.710 --> 02:06:49.460
You guys need to start lifting.
Are you sure about that?

2300
02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:51.870
Let's go.
Let's do it.

2301
02:06:53.590 --> 02:06:58.420
I got to get on the bike to
lift.

2302
02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:02.210
You better.
Put it over your shoulder and walk with it.

2303
02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:05.393
All right,
let's go

2304
02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:10.553
85

2305
02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:17.673
five

2306
02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:22.473
oh shit.

2307
02:07:28.930 --> 02:07:32.980
Awesome,
Bro.
I say,
let's go,

2308
02:07:33.090 --> 02:07:34.490
but you start going

2309
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:42.940
make some money.
What's up,
bro?
Even lift.
Do you even live,
Bro?

2310
02:07:43.690 --> 02:07:46.270
Are you looking at that?
Skinnylicious man,
you know the girl was bigger than you,

2311
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:50.960
but I started lifting because that guy was pretty cool about it.
Yeah.

2312
02:07:51.550 --> 02:07:56.300
Excuse me.
Do you mean lift?
Yeah.

2313
02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:02.470
<v 3>Do you even lift bro?
Meme comes from,
Oh,
okay,
now I get it.</v>

2314
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:05.680
I just thought it was people being silly online.

2315
02:08:05.681 --> 02:08:08.320
I didn't know that there was a video that it originated from.

2316
02:08:09.090 --> 02:08:09.923
<v 7>That makes sense.</v>

2317
02:08:12.210 --> 02:08:16.440
That's French bomb square space.
What do you mean?
What do you say?

2318
02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:18.600
Try to look like a big shot.
So what do you mean?

2319
02:08:18.601 --> 02:08:21.780
I tried to look like a big salary talking about I'm just walking to my car.

2320
02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:26.060
<v 3>Yeah,
that guy's lucky.
You didn't get beat.
I know.</v>

2321
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:29.120
Why do people think that's funny?
It is kind of funny.

2322
02:08:29.121 --> 02:08:31.830
Do you even lift bro is a funny thing to say to people,
but man,

2323
02:08:31.831 --> 02:08:34.250
these guys getting close to getting fucked up on a regular basis.

2324
02:08:34.251 --> 02:08:39.020
That's the people like I think is that I don't get hit.
I think it's real.

2325
02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:43.430
I don't think he stages these beforehand and I just think it's fun to watch

2326
02:08:43.550 --> 02:08:46.580
people do uncomfortable things.
Yeah.

2327
02:08:47.050 --> 02:08:50.450
Oh that guy just rate reached out his hand.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's interesting.

2328
02:08:51.170 --> 02:08:53.840
Well this is one of the things like we're talking about with the and Anthony

2329
02:08:53.841 --> 02:08:57.470
thing,
like how different people handle different situations.

2330
02:08:57.860 --> 02:09:01.400
You know like you call differently.
People handled him.
You know,

2331
02:09:01.460 --> 02:09:03.770
it's kind of the guy you shook his hand that probably me.
If somebody said,

2332
02:09:03.771 --> 02:09:08.530
why don't you lift and be like,
whatever.
That gives a shit man.
But it's,

2333
02:09:08.590 --> 02:09:11.990
isn't it interesting how different people handle different situations in a

2334
02:09:11.991 --> 02:09:16.130
completely different thing?
And you could be different every day like you,

2335
02:09:16.250 --> 02:09:17.960
the way you handle one situation.

2336
02:09:17.961 --> 02:09:21.830
Like if that guy came up to you today or if that guy came up to you immediately

2337
02:09:21.831 --> 02:09:26.240
after the DMV for hours thing,
fucked up.
Anything wrong.

2338
02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:30.290
Fight with a girl.
Fight with a guy,
fight with a mom.
Fight with the dad,

2339
02:09:30.291 --> 02:09:34.370
fight with a boss.
Whatever it is.
Traffic,
bullshit.
Flat tire.

2340
02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:39.320
Someone stole your laptop.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
I don't lift fucking asshole.

2341
02:09:40.130 --> 02:09:42.380
You know it depends entirely on where you're at.

2342
02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:47.330
That is a problem with human beings.
We're not ready.
Somebody beat his ass.

2343
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:48.583
This guy,
this guy.
This,

2344
02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:52.650
<v 7>you're going to hit me if you said it again.
Oh,
whoa.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Really?</v>

2345
02:09:53.190 --> 02:09:57.240
You want to get a battery charge doing a that day you will do what?
Say it again.

2346
02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:00.680
Say what again?
Say it again.
A poop my pants.
I'm sorry.

2347
02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:04.870
I think you guys are going smell chicken legs.
Hands

2348
02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:11.340
call it a chicken leg.
I'm using her reaction.
That was good.

2349
02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:15.870
And it's you being frank.
This is even lists break.
Uh,

2350
02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:20.230
easy reaction.
Your reaction was priceless,
Bro.
That's real awesome.

2351
02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:25.100
<v 3>That's actually kind of fun.
I'm glad he does that.
At least some love.</v>

2352
02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:28.040
How much I love how much shit you can do to somebody as long as afterwards like,

2353
02:10:28.041 --> 02:10:31.980
hey man,
this is going on youtube.
Yeah,
I'm going to be famous.
Fuck,

2354
02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:34.070
I'm telling you I'm gonna kick your ass.

2355
02:10:35.210 --> 02:10:38.870
<v 2>Silly.
But you can get in trouble,
man.
People don't know they're being pranked.</v>

2356
02:10:38.871 --> 02:10:42.860
They might fucking hate you and they might hate you because you seem crazy.

2357
02:10:43.230 --> 02:10:46.430
I'm a crazy person coming up to him starting shit for no reason.

2358
02:10:46.431 --> 02:10:48.290
They don't know you.
You might be nuts,
man.

2359
02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:50.520
<v 1>And it might make it worse that your videotape him.
Look,</v>

2360
02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:52.650
I'd look at all these videos that we've been showing lately.

2361
02:10:52.651 --> 02:10:54.660
People just freak out when they're getting videotaped.

2362
02:10:54.661 --> 02:10:56.100
They don't give a shit if it's a joke or not.

2363
02:10:56.101 --> 02:10:59.790
He gun chick that was hitting that dude.
If he's telling the truth.

2364
02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:04.080
By the way,
uh,
Jamie's just showed me on Gawker right now.

2365
02:11:04.081 --> 02:11:06.830
There's a whole story where they interviewed them,
uh,

2366
02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:10.980
the guy and he's completely wrote it out exactly what happened.

2367
02:11:10.981 --> 02:11:12.960
What happened after he thought he was still recording,

2368
02:11:12.961 --> 02:11:15.450
but when she hit his camera,

2369
02:11:15.451 --> 02:11:18.540
it turned it off and he thought he was still recording and scratched it also.

2370
02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:22.650
And then they said that they were going to go call pat and pat was going to take

2371
02:11:22.651 --> 02:11:25.860
care of all of this.
And so they went to the car and said he was like,

2372
02:11:25.861 --> 02:11:29.580
what the hell?
And so he sent the,
uh,
his girlfriend who was back at the house,

2373
02:11:29.610 --> 02:11:33.510
I guess he was gone for like an hour video and they called the police and

2374
02:11:33.511 --> 02:11:37.340
everything,
but they were gone and,
but uh,
yeah,
it's written all out though.

2375
02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:41.040
And his girlfriend.
The video.
Yeah.
Well,
just in case if they took his phone,

2376
02:11:41.041 --> 02:11:43.770
like that kind of shit,
he just wanted to show like,
look what happened.

2377
02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:47.150
Like look what's going on right now.
Wow.
Yeah.

2378
02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:48.021
<v 2>Well,
strange world.</v>

2379
02:11:48.021 --> 02:11:51.080
We live in when you send a video over their phone through the cellular network.

2380
02:11:51.081 --> 02:11:55.850
Isn't it Shitty and compressed though?
No,
not anymore.
It used to be,
mm.

2381
02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:57.800
I don't know about that.
I just got one the other day.

2382
02:11:57.801 --> 02:12:00.950
That definitely wasn't perfect.
It was an iPhone.
The iPhone.
Yeah.

2383
02:12:01.330 --> 02:12:02.720
<v 1>Um,
yeah,
it should be fine.</v>

2384
02:12:02.721 --> 02:12:05.960
Unless it's over I think two minutes then it might start compressing it,

2385
02:12:05.961 --> 02:12:09.890
but normal videos you like,
you know,
like a minute clip or whatever.

2386
02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:11.173
It's usually fine.

2387
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:15.720
<v 2>Eddie Bravo sent me a video of me getting out of that tank,
that crazy.
Um,
um,</v>

2388
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:20.390
frozen 240 degree below zero tank and it looks like shit.

2389
02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:24.090
<v 1>I didn't know that.
If you cross platform it,
a lot of times it'll be coming.</v>

2390
02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.170
<v 2>Same Platform.
Yeah.
Here's an iPhone.
I have an iPhone and send it to me.</v>

2391
02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:31.430
I saw that on your Twitter,
by the way.
What is that about?
The 240 degree a thing.

2392
02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:36.110
What happens is you go into this thing for two minutes and what happens is your

2393
02:12:36.111 --> 02:12:40.070
body thinks you just got dropped off at the top of the world.

2394
02:12:40.130 --> 02:12:42.080
Like there's 240 degrees below,

2395
02:12:42.081 --> 02:12:46.640
zero is insanely cold and he'd do it for two minutes and your body rushes all

2396
02:12:46.641 --> 02:12:49.670
your blood to the surface of your skin to try to heat it up because it's

2397
02:12:49.671 --> 02:12:51.680
freaking out.
I can't believe how cold it is.

2398
02:12:52.070 --> 02:12:54.920
And then when you get out after two minutes,
it realize like,
oh,

2399
02:12:54.921 --> 02:12:57.800
this is like normal temperature and everything relaxes.

2400
02:12:57.801 --> 02:13:00.150
And the idea that flushes out inflammation,

2401
02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:05.090
it's incredibly efficient at like if you have injuries and inflammation,

2402
02:13:05.091 --> 02:13:08.930
incredibly efficient at reducing it.
Did it help you to fuck?
Yeah.
That's great.

2403
02:13:09.110 --> 02:13:10.880
It makes you feel good too.
It's really crazy.

2404
02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:14.900
Is it painful while you're actually in the negative to 40 no,
no,
no.

2405
02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:18.700
Just weird to colts even care.
It's quick.
You know,
because it's so quick,
Brian,

2406
02:13:18.701 --> 02:13:21.380
I'm a send it to you.
See if you could throw it up or should I send to you Jamie,

2407
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:24.170
which ones on this an expensive thing or is this something that could be in

2408
02:13:24.171 --> 02:13:29.030
malls and a couple of years?
Oh,
it's expensive as fuck.
Um,

2409
02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.020
it's expensive to have one of those.
That's um,
that's what,

2410
02:13:34.210 --> 02:13:37.890
it's expensive.
But to use it,
I'm not sure.
I don't think it's that much.

2411
02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:39.270
I don't remember quite honest with you.

2412
02:13:39.271 --> 02:13:42.780
It sounds like a cool idea and it sounds like it's kind of polar opposite of why

2413
02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:47.730
people go to Saunas,
get all the,
you know,
well,
expand your,
um,

2414
02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:51.330
if scan and whatnot and get toxins out just in some ways.

2415
02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:52.800
In some ways it's kind of the opposite,

2416
02:13:52.801 --> 02:13:57.060
but in other ways it's just another way to get your body to do things that are,

2417
02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:01.680
you know,
better than just resting.
You know,

2418
02:14:01.710 --> 02:14:05.850
the Sonor picks up your growth hormone.
It picks up like,
um,

2419
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:09.810
Doctor Rhonda Patrick wrote a whole piece on the benefits of the sauna.

2420
02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:11.760
Apparently Sauna has like some,

2421
02:14:11.761 --> 02:14:15.900
like that hyper heating environment and like the hot air for short periods of

2422
02:14:15.901 --> 02:14:20.610
time has a pretty significant effects on a recovery in the body.

2423
02:14:20.850 --> 02:14:22.500
So the Russians had it right all along,
man.

2424
02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:26.970
Ever seen that thing they do called the Banya?
Yeah,
they had it right all along.

2425
02:14:27.090 --> 02:14:29.850
They would do a,
these hot cold bass.
It would go back and forth.

2426
02:14:29.851 --> 02:14:32.220
They want to do this Banya thing where they,
uh,

2427
02:14:32.250 --> 02:14:36.680
they go to the sauna and they slap sticks on it.
Oh yeah.
Yeah,
I saw,

2428
02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:40.700
I saw a vice video about that.
It's pretty fucking cool.
Yeah.
Um,

2429
02:14:41.130 --> 02:14:45.570
I'll email to you Brian,
should I email to you Jamie?
Oh,
you meant to Brian.
Brian.

2430
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:50.880
Okay.
Um,
okay.

2431
02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:54.650
What is it Brian?
Hold on.
You know what it is?
Yeah.

2432
02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:58.550
I'm just trying to find in here.
All right,
so on sweaty,
um,

2433
02:14:59.650 --> 02:15:02.780
what were we talking about?
Cool.
Shit.
But who'll shit happening?

2434
02:15:05.170 --> 02:15:07.540
No,
what was,
but what was it,

2435
02:15:07.570 --> 02:15:09.970
what was the subject that we're just talking about before the,
uh,

2436
02:15:10.210 --> 02:15:13.960
before the video?
Yeah,
before this thing.
I'm sending it to him.
Um,

2437
02:15:14.410 --> 02:15:17.500
before that I was just going on my ramble about how bitcoin is going to change

2438
02:15:17.501 --> 02:15:18.580
everything.
No,
I had to,

2439
02:15:18.581 --> 02:15:21.670
I had a point about this fucking tank thing and I forgot it now.
Oh,

2440
02:15:21.671 --> 02:15:24.340
I was asking about the price and you were saying,
Oh,
I'm not sure.

2441
02:15:24.790 --> 02:15:27.070
The place that I went to was in Hollywood,
you know,

2442
02:15:27.071 --> 02:15:28.600
I don't know how much it cost.
I should look it up.

2443
02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:31.870
I should look it up cause it's a good spot.
But athletes are using a Coby Brian.

2444
02:15:31.871 --> 02:15:34.270
I was like one of the first guys to bring it back from Europe.
It's just a,

2445
02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:39.220
in Europe they've figured out a quicker than America and America's onto it.

2446
02:15:39.220 --> 02:15:43.870
Now that inflammation is one of the huge causes of all sorts of ailments in the

2447
02:15:43.871 --> 02:15:48.670
body.
Physical injuries and sicknesses,
inflammation from your diet,

2448
02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:52.540
inflammation from a exercise,
strange stress,

2449
02:15:52.541 --> 02:15:56.140
all sorts of different things that cause your body to have inflammation.

2450
02:15:56.141 --> 02:15:59.470
Then it fucks up a lot of systems of the body and for recovery,

2451
02:15:59.710 --> 02:16:01.690
reducing inflammation,
it's really critical.

2452
02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:06.550
They used to do these ice baths or guys would uh,
go into uh,
like a tub,

2453
02:16:06.551 --> 02:16:11.551
like this big steel tub and they would just pour buckets of ice in there and

2454
02:16:11.951 --> 02:16:16.720
cold water and you would sit submerged inside this thing and it would do the,

2455
02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:21.040
a similar version of it,
but it takes far longer.
It wasn't nearly as effective.

2456
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:23.400
Then they figured out how to do this one,
which is really,
um,

2457
02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:27.830
I mean it's just really not that painful.
It's interesting.
It's weird.
You,
you,

2458
02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:32.440
you,
you do it and you get of there like,
Whoa,
Ooh,
you know,
like your whole body.

2459
02:16:32.441 --> 02:16:33.070
It's like,

2460
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:36.720
it just feels like as soon as you warm up everything just like it's his,

2461
02:16:36.730 --> 02:16:37.690
cause it's only two minutes,

2462
02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:42.130
everything just free flows and it feels like you have like extra blood pumping

2463
02:16:42.131 --> 02:16:45.250
through your body or something.
You feel like you just get this charge of energy.

2464
02:16:45.310 --> 02:16:47.430
That sounds cool.
It's really cool.
I'm gonna,

2465
02:16:47.450 --> 02:16:50.830
I'm going to look into that just out of curiosity because I do infrared Saunas

2466
02:16:50.831 --> 02:16:55.360
and I get,
uh,
you feel good for the rest of that whole day.

2467
02:16:55.390 --> 02:16:57.400
If you do the sauna like three or 4:00 PM,

2468
02:16:57.700 --> 02:16:59.230
the rest of the day you're a little bit lighter,

2469
02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:02.170
a little bit friendlier and like everything is nicer.
Yeah.

2470
02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:06.640
Massage is great for that too.
Yeah.
There's all sort of cryo healthcare.

2471
02:17:06.670 --> 02:17:10.450
That's the name of the place.
Um,
how much does it cost?
Is it,

2472
02:17:10.451 --> 02:17:14.710
say it has a store,
let's find out how much it costs.

2473
02:17:15.670 --> 02:17:17.930
But it's something that,
uh,

2474
02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:21.070
they figured out like a lot of different things they figured out in Europe.

2475
02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:23.200
There it is.
That's me coming out of it.
Right?
Yeah.

2476
02:17:23.210 --> 02:17:24.970
That shouldn't be that compressed.
That's not even a long,
yeah.

2477
02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:25.833
<v 7>Video.</v>

2478
02:17:32.390 --> 02:17:35.850
That would only two minutes to you.
I could have done another minute.

2479
02:17:37.090 --> 02:17:41.210
How did it get on with it?
It's cool.
I liked the breathing.

2480
02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:45.860
Like you breed you like you can do that.
Pulled them out.
I mean,

2481
02:17:46.210 --> 02:17:50.880
the breathing was really weird.
Perfect.
Okay.
Very good.

2482
02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:55.930
It was awesome.
Wow.
That was incredible.

2483
02:17:56.770 --> 02:17:59.530
It's crazy how hard it is to breathe in there.
That's the weird thing.

2484
02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:03.370
When you breathe it up.
Ooh.
It's like a labored breath,
you know?

2485
02:18:05.930 --> 02:18:08.980
<v 2>That's it.
That's the video.
But a,
I'm going to do it all the time now.</v>

2486
02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:12.520
I can't wait to do it again.
Hmm.
They have them all over the place.
Uh,

2487
02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:14.260
Ian Mccall does it every day.
He's the,

2488
02:18:14.261 --> 02:18:17.440
one of the fighters for the UFC flyweight division,
one of the best in the world.

2489
02:18:17.890 --> 02:18:21.640
He does it every day.
He's doing that.
Cryotherapy shit goes in.

2490
02:18:21.670 --> 02:18:25.930
He went up to 263 degrees below zero,
because he's an extremist.

2491
02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:29.380
He does like three minutes and 20 seconds,
something fucking ridiculous.

2492
02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:33.220
Longest anyone's ever done.
The coldest everyone anyone's ever done.

2493
02:18:33.221 --> 02:18:36.490
That's kind of Shitty,
negative,
any negative.
No,
not to me.
You know,

2494
02:18:36.491 --> 02:18:39.370
I don't know what happens with other folks.
You turn it into sub zero,

2495
02:18:39.371 --> 02:18:42.580
you start freezing and other people,
they start you off slow though.
Um,

2496
02:18:42.970 --> 02:18:47.140
there's many,
many articles on cryotherapy though.
Uh,

2497
02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:50.500
both cryotherapy applied to sports and athletic performance.

2498
02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:53.890
Cryotherapy applied to a injury and recovery.

2499
02:18:53.891 --> 02:18:56.440
There's a bunch of different things you could do.
Now.
It's interesting.

2500
02:18:56.441 --> 02:19:00.040
There's a thing called the hyperbaric chamber.
There's that,
that,
uh,

2501
02:19:00.041 --> 02:19:04.210
aids and recovery and uh,
oxygen utilization,

2502
02:19:04.270 --> 02:19:07.510
healing of the body.
Like guys who have injuries like you're right a favor.

2503
02:19:07.810 --> 02:19:11.410
He had,
um,
a bunch of,
uh,
contusions on his leg from his fight.

2504
02:19:11.650 --> 02:19:12.800
He got leg kicked a lot.

2505
02:19:13.170 --> 02:19:16.480
Like it was fucked up and swollen and he went into a hyperbaric chamber.

2506
02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:18.710
That helps.
Yeah,
it helps him with his hands to his guys.

2507
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:21.790
He's getting his hands healed after he broke and we went to the hyperbaric

2508
02:19:21.791 --> 02:19:25.960
chamber.
It's pretty incredible.
Cool.
Yeah,
they have some amazing shit now.

2509
02:19:26.140 --> 02:19:28.460
We're just,
we're just a few years

2510
02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:32.780
<v 3>away from creating like bulletproof,
immortal,
mortal people,
you know?</v>

2511
02:19:32.781 --> 02:19:35.430
I mean we're,
we're maybe like a hundred,
like if,

2512
02:19:35.431 --> 02:19:39.290
if we live to be a hundred years more,
if human beings don't blow each other up,

2513
02:19:39.590 --> 02:19:41.180
they're going to have bulletproof skin.

2514
02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:43.100
They're going to have Oregon's that never tire.

2515
02:19:43.130 --> 02:19:46.010
They're going to have a genetic code that just never drops off.

2516
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:49.400
I think we're less than a hundred years away from the actual FTL drive if it,

2517
02:19:49.401 --> 02:19:53.150
if it can be built,
I think it will be built in the next hundred years.
FTL Yeah,

2518
02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:56.600
faster than light.
Really.
NASA,
NASA came out with that.

2519
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:58.540
It was just a media stunt,
you know,

2520
02:19:58.541 --> 02:20:03.541
it was like a computer generated image of what an FTL star ship might look like.

2521
02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:06.230
I saw that.
Yeah.
The warp drive,
the warp drive thing,

2522
02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:10.040
and I think if it's going to happen again,
like assuming we don't,

2523
02:20:10.041 --> 02:20:10.874
I'll kill each other.

2524
02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:13.940
It'll happen in the next hundred years because the technology is at the point

2525
02:20:13.941 --> 02:20:15.650
where we could get there eventually.

2526
02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:18.710
How would you say that [inaudible] could give you any indication that they will

2527
02:20:18.711 --> 02:20:20.390
be able to surpass the speed of light?

2528
02:20:20.450 --> 02:20:24.170
It seems like an energy problem and I don't even know what kind of advances are

2529
02:20:24.171 --> 02:20:27.470
going to happen in energy just within our lifetime.
So it,
hmm.

2530
02:20:27.890 --> 02:20:30.020
I don't want to pretend them the FTL drive expert,

2531
02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:34.430
but that scientist he's working on it came up with some kind of innovation where

2532
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:39.010
it would require far less energy than they originally thought to do this,
uh,

2533
02:20:39.070 --> 02:20:43.040
you know,
warp of the space,
time fabric or whatever the fuck it does.

2534
02:20:43.430 --> 02:20:47.210
And the fact that he figured that out means that now they can work on a proof of

2535
02:20:47.211 --> 02:20:47.751
concept.

2536
02:20:47.751 --> 02:20:51.770
They can do a very small version and a laboratory one day and once they have

2537
02:20:51.771 --> 02:20:56.030
that,
that's all you need to get industry interested,
you know,
like why,

2538
02:20:56.031 --> 02:20:58.460
why should we build a faster than light spacecraft?

2539
02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:01.430
It's kind of a self explanatory thing.
Like the coolest shit.

2540
02:21:01.431 --> 02:21:03.320
You can get resources anywhere in the galaxy,

2541
02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:06.170
of course people are going to try to build it if it becomes reasonable.

2542
02:21:06.470 --> 02:21:09.920
It's interesting if you look back on 1940 what was it,

2543
02:21:09.921 --> 02:21:14.921
45 when the atomic bomb was first detonated and think about 1945 to today and

2544
02:21:15.451 --> 02:21:19.160
then how,
how long it has a 70 plus years.
Exactly.
Yeah.

2545
02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:21.860
I mean think about how primitive our technology was back then.

2546
02:21:21.861 --> 02:21:23.300
They had the stupid radios,

2547
02:21:23.301 --> 02:21:27.500
the tube radios that would get like two channels and they built a nuclear bomb.

2548
02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:30.770
No kidding.
Right.
And now we have smartphones that are so good.

2549
02:21:30.771 --> 02:21:32.780
I mean I was thinking about how uh,

2550
02:21:32.810 --> 02:21:35.840
the year 2000 I had a palm pilot and it was really like psyched about it cause

2551
02:21:35.841 --> 02:21:38.960
it was the best you could have pop poppop antenna.

2552
02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:41.090
The little I had the heart antenna,
the nub.

2553
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:42.830
I have the one that it would come up like you,

2554
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:45.500
you would pull up and went to school.

2555
02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:49.490
If you are very lucky and all the stars were aligned,
you could send an email,

2556
02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:52.500
the shitty little keyboard.

2557
02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:56.840
Can you pay like $70 a month for the data plan for like 500 kilobytes or

2558
02:21:56.841 --> 02:22:00.290
something?
Yeah.
I enjoyed my palm pilot.
I felt like I had a computer with me.

2559
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:03.740
I was being fucking real.
I was on,
I was on the ball,

2560
02:22:03.741 --> 02:22:07.310
I was on the technology ball.
But compare that to today and that's only 14 years.

2561
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:08.090
Amazing.

2562
02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:12.080
You know what amazes me the most still to this day Shizam that app that you can

2563
02:22:12.081 --> 02:22:14.720
like you hear a song and you just press that and do it.
Dude,

2564
02:22:14.770 --> 02:22:15.531
I did it the other day.

2565
02:22:15.531 --> 02:22:19.160
It was loud as fuck in this restaurant and this song was playing and I was like,

2566
02:22:19.161 --> 02:22:22.040
that song,
it's cool.
What the fuck is that song?
And I was like,

2567
02:22:22.041 --> 02:22:26.010
this isn't gonna work perfect instantly.
I mean the APP gets better

2568
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:29.430
<v 2>all the time too.
Yeah.
That APP.
Like like whatever they've done to it.</v>

2569
02:22:29.610 --> 02:22:31.800
Maybe it's the new processing power of the new phones.

2570
02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:35.550
Cause as a phone's getting more powerful and more resources are available for

2571
02:22:35.551 --> 02:22:38.190
these apps to figure things out like that.
I don't know how it does it.

2572
02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:41.820
I don't understand how it works,
but it's incredible what we can do now.

2573
02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:42.420
Incredible.

2574
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:46.080
The heart rate monitors that work off of the flash on the back of the phone.

2575
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:49.410
Yeah.
That's insane.
It's pretty cool.
Put your finger over the camera.

2576
02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:50.810
<v 4>I even use the,
um,</v>

2577
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:54.500
the 10,000 steps thing that the Samsung has where it tells you when you've hit

2578
02:22:54.501 --> 02:22:58.550
10,000 steps in a day.
Really?
I try to hit that because it's just good.

2579
02:22:58.551 --> 02:23:02.210
Like if I look down and it's 8:00 PM,
and it says only 6,000 steps,
I'm like,
oh,

2580
02:23:02.211 --> 02:23:05.240
I'll just go walk to the,
uh,
the La River is kind of close to where I live.

2581
02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:07.820
It's like I'll just walk down there and back because they know it's about 4,000

2582
02:23:07.821 --> 02:23:11.390
steps.
I do that and then I feel like I've hit my quota for the day.

2583
02:23:11.540 --> 02:23:13.970
So you have a cell phone that's keeping me healthy pretty much.

2584
02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:15.290
That's incredible.
Yeah.

2585
02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:18.720
<v 2>I'm a maniac dog.
Get those 10,000 out before I did anything,</v>

2586
02:23:18.721 --> 02:23:21.330
just so I can be able to do whatever the fuck I want for the rest of the day.

2587
02:23:21.690 --> 02:23:25.560
I would just find a staircase and keep walking up and down and like an idiot.

2588
02:23:26.010 --> 02:23:27.630
I probably would.
I'm not kidding.

2589
02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:30.630
I can't have something like that where there's a number in front of me that I

2590
02:23:30.631 --> 02:23:33.450
have to achieve every day because I'll,
I'll just go nuts.

2591
02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:37.140
I'll just do it right away.
Just hated immediately.
Yeah,
I'll just go.
Okay.

2592
02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:37.980
What time is it?

2593
02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:41.960
It's a nine o'clock by 10 o'clock I'm going to have 10,000 steps ready co by
the,

2594
02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:44.310
how long would it take you to do 10,000 steps?

2595
02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:49.170
<v 4>It's not that long.
It's like a maybe like 20 or 30 minutes of walking.
It's done.</v>

2596
02:23:49.350 --> 02:23:51.960
That's it.
I think so.
That's all you needed to do in a day.

2597
02:23:52.050 --> 02:23:55.830
I mean it's got to be brisk walking,
but he considered brisk,

2598
02:23:56.820 --> 02:23:59.980
like just short of a power walk.
Pretty much like I'm not jogging,
but I'm,

2599
02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:02.220
when I walk it's to get cardio,
so

2600
02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:04.880
<v 2>that's interesting.
Do you ever do that?
Sometimes at the airport,</v>

2601
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.280
sometimes the airport,
when I know I have like a long walk,

2602
02:24:07.281 --> 02:24:11.150
I treat it like a workout and I just say I'm just going to walk 50% faster than

2603
02:24:11.151 --> 02:24:13.970
I would ever walk and just give it that extra like,

2604
02:24:14.010 --> 02:24:18.560
and when I hit the ground like push off that motherfucker push,
push,
push.

2605
02:24:18.810 --> 02:24:22.620
<v 4>I don't do that at airports because I just,
I kinda shut down in airports.</v>

2606
02:24:22.621 --> 02:24:24.420
I feel like you're almost like this,

2607
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:27.780
this freight that just needs to be transported to where you need to go.

2608
02:24:27.781 --> 02:24:30.240
Like I'm normally in my head and before you know it,
you're

2609
02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:32.910
<v 2>there.
I um,
like music,
man,</v>

2610
02:24:32.970 --> 02:24:35.310
I'm very rarely at the airport without music.

2611
02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:40.440
Very rarely makes the whole trip so much more fun when you're sitting down and

2612
02:24:40.441 --> 02:24:41.161
just chilling out,

2613
02:24:41.161 --> 02:24:44.760
waiting for your flight to take off and you have some really good music.

2614
02:24:44.761 --> 02:24:48.090
Like you don't even mind.
You might waiting if you can enjoy the music.

2615
02:24:48.390 --> 02:24:52.650
The problem with a lot of travel is the downtime problem.

2616
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:56.220
That's the problem.
The problem is you're not doing what you want to do,

2617
02:24:56.490 --> 02:25:01.490
but what people don't think of is that you can do what you want to do while

2618
02:25:01.981 --> 02:25:03.330
you're doing what you don't want to do.

2619
02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:06.810
Like if there's a time where you have to do something,
like just sit and wait.

2620
02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:10.230
You can listen to a book on tape,
you can go to audible.com get the book on tape,

2621
02:25:10.231 --> 02:25:11.550
you can listen to this podcast,

2622
02:25:11.790 --> 02:25:16.260
you can listen to some cool music and it makes it better.
It,
it literally makes,

2623
02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:17.910
it's better than just sitting there like a dummy.

2624
02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:22.230
Like when is this thing going to take off?
You just plunk plunk crank.

2625
02:25:22.470 --> 02:25:24.220
I did the this weekend for Vegas.

2626
02:25:24.221 --> 02:25:26.770
I was listening to the shooter Jennings ever everlasting shooter Jennings.

2627
02:25:27.490 --> 02:25:32.260
Holy Shit.
Well,
and Jenny's son as some fucking talent.
He's a good dude.

2628
02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:36.910
He's got some great songs.
It's really good.
Interesting stuff too.

2629
02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:39.520
So that was my,
that was my,
uh,
travel time.

2630
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:42.370
I travel time was listening to some new music.

2631
02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:45.280
It's always good books.

2632
02:25:45.281 --> 02:25:47.350
I like reading on flights because nobody can interrupt you.

2633
02:25:47.351 --> 02:25:51.940
There's no like a phone call or nonsense.
I like riding on flights.
That's my,

2634
02:25:51.941 --> 02:25:55.000
I get some of my best writing done on flights for whatever reason.
Hmm.

2635
02:25:55.900 --> 02:25:57.100
Are you working on a book or something?

2636
02:25:57.101 --> 02:25:59.590
Cause I think you've mentioned before that you've right.
Yeah,

2637
02:25:59.591 --> 02:26:02.920
well I write shit down and I'll eventually probably put together as a book,

2638
02:26:02.921 --> 02:26:04.450
but I'm not giving myself any,
I like,

2639
02:26:04.451 --> 02:26:07.900
especially right now I'm concentrating almost entirely on writing stand up.

2640
02:26:08.350 --> 02:26:11.890
I'm going to do my next special and the tick is actually just went on sale today

2641
02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:16.370
for a Denver.
I'm going to be in Denver on,
um,

2642
02:26:18.250 --> 02:26:22.270
August 22nd and 23rd,
22nd.
It's Friday night.

2643
02:26:22.330 --> 02:26:27.330
It's like the night before the taping just to have fun and do some shows and get

2644
02:26:27.461 --> 02:26:27.940
loose.

2645
02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:32.940
And then on Saturday night I'm recording my comedy show at the comedy works and

2646
02:26:35.441 --> 02:26:39.250
it should be fun.
Denver's a cool city.
I like Colorado in general.

2647
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:43.030
Colorado's the shit and right now it's changing trainging radically.

2648
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:48.310
It's like all this marijuana money is really what it's transferring the

2649
02:26:48.311 --> 02:26:52.840
consciousness of this,
uh,
entire city.
A lot of people concerned about it,

2650
02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:55.360
you know,
they're worried about,
you know,

2651
02:26:55.361 --> 02:26:59.350
nefarious elements getting involved and all sorts of Weirdos and biker gangs and

2652
02:26:59.351 --> 02:27:03.910
who knows who's going to have money now and what the pros to me so severely

2653
02:27:03.911 --> 02:27:05.050
outweigh the cons.

2654
02:27:05.050 --> 02:27:09.310
It's like you're giving adults the ability to choose responsibly.

2655
02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:11.020
Whether they use it or don't use it,
you're,

2656
02:27:11.021 --> 02:27:13.930
what you're doing is you're giving people freedom and freedom always makes

2657
02:27:13.931 --> 02:27:16.840
better.
People just does.
So long as no one's getting hurt,

2658
02:27:16.841 --> 02:27:18.880
you're not going to have freedom to fucking sell poison.

2659
02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:22.150
You're not talking about freedom to shoot darts at fucking babies.

2660
02:27:22.390 --> 02:27:26.140
What you're talking about is freedom to ingest a plant that grows naturally on

2661
02:27:26.141 --> 02:27:28.990
earth.
Yeah.
And the government lets you frack for thousands of miles,

2662
02:27:28.991 --> 02:27:29.824
but you can't,

2663
02:27:29.980 --> 02:27:33.340
you can't blow a puff of smoke in the air that happens to be an herb they don't

2664
02:27:33.341 --> 02:27:33.760
like.

2665
02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:37.570
It's one of those things where it's so intrinsically ridiculous that that's why

2666
02:27:37.571 --> 02:27:41.080
it's changing all at once.
Yeah,
it's interesting.
We have the,

2667
02:27:41.170 --> 02:27:45.100
I think this is one of the coolest times ever to be alive.
I really do.

2668
02:27:45.370 --> 02:27:48.730
And I think that one of the reasons why it's one of the coolest times ever to be

2669
02:27:48.731 --> 02:27:53.731
alive is because it's just so chaotic and it's so strange and no one can do

2670
02:27:53.891 --> 02:27:55.750
anything about it.
No one can stop it.

2671
02:27:56.020 --> 02:27:58.990
Now they're going to try to net neutrality and they're going to try to put the

2672
02:27:58.991 --> 02:28:02.230
brakes here and charge people for that.
And you're going to,

2673
02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:05.050
you're in trouble and you're on a list and I'm going to watch you.

2674
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:08.990
What are you trying to be anonymous?
You've fucker.
I want to know where you were.

2675
02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:12.220
We were,
we were talking about this right before the show.

2676
02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:14.290
Like all that shit that's coming out,

2677
02:28:14.291 --> 02:28:17.410
like all the corruption and anger and government and competence.

2678
02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:22.220
I'm starting to believe that it has to be there because that's wakes us up to,

2679
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:24.410
<v 3>we don't need so many agencies.</v>

2680
02:28:24.411 --> 02:28:27.440
We don't need like so many wars and so much bullshit.

2681
02:28:27.441 --> 02:28:30.680
Let's just decide things for ourselves.
And of course we need some laws.

2682
02:28:30.681 --> 02:28:34.460
We need some police,
we need some roads.
And that's really it.
Thank you very much.

2683
02:28:34.461 --> 02:28:38.390
You know,
like have a nice day.
We don't need you archiving fucking baby photos.

2684
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:39.950
That's what you've gone over the line.

2685
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:43.580
And so you're seeing the people realize that people realize that banks are

2686
02:28:43.581 --> 02:28:44.600
ineffective ingredient.

2687
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:47.780
People realize that the old media is dying out and they don't give a shit about

2688
02:28:47.781 --> 02:28:48.590
their viewers.

2689
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:52.160
So they're just moving over to better stuff and it's happening across the board

2690
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:56.180
and pretty much every industry even.
Um,
I had,
uh,

2691
02:28:56.420 --> 02:28:59.090
this woman Tiffany van [inaudible] on my show recently,

2692
02:28:59.091 --> 02:29:03.470
he was another podcast host and she was talking to me about how all these

2693
02:29:03.471 --> 02:29:06.620
grocery stores now have an organic section and that's taking off.

2694
02:29:06.980 --> 02:29:09.500
And so you're seeing like this,
we have new standards.
Like that's,

2695
02:29:09.530 --> 02:29:12.410
I think what's happening is that we have higher standards than we used to.

2696
02:29:12.770 --> 02:29:16.160
And so across the board is better stuff.
Yeah.

2697
02:29:16.161 --> 02:29:20.120
There's no doubt that things are getting more complex and harder to control.

2698
02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:23.600
There was no doubt.
And there's no doubt that these old systems,

2699
02:29:23.601 --> 02:29:25.760
whether it's like afternoon,

2700
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:29.000
when you watch the news at six or five or whatever the fuck it is,

2701
02:29:29.220 --> 02:29:31.330
it seems like you're watching a parody,
right?

2702
02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:36.020
The anchorman is becoming more and more.
I mean when you watch,

2703
02:29:36.021 --> 02:29:38.690
if you try to watch like the La News,
try to watch any of those channels.

2704
02:29:38.691 --> 02:29:42.260
Local news at five o'clock it's like these people were aliens,
right?

2705
02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:43.820
I need these.
I think these things,

2706
02:29:43.821 --> 02:29:46.880
we're not supposed to exist forever and that's why to us it seems so kind of

2707
02:29:46.881 --> 02:29:49.450
silly.
It's like it's supposed to be dying out.
That's like the,

2708
02:29:49.490 --> 02:29:52.460
it's the new season.
New stuff's going to come out.
It's kind of like fashion,

2709
02:29:52.461 --> 02:29:54.920
right?
Like every year it's going to be something different.

2710
02:29:54.921 --> 02:29:58.250
That's the way it works.
Now it's a corporate media and centralization,

2711
02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:03.230
top down type stuff is dying out and I'm sure it'll continue to exist in a bunch

2712
02:30:03.231 --> 02:30:06.350
of different forms,
but that idea is getting weaker and weaker.

2713
02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:09.620
I think that eventually afternoon news,
Evening News,
whatever it is,

2714
02:30:09.621 --> 02:30:11.270
is going to be like a burlesque show.

2715
02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:14.930
Like people are going to pull it out on stage like she's an astrologer thing

2716
02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:19.400
like riding a unicycle or fucking being in a covered wagon.
Like take my photo,

2717
02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:22.820
I'm in a covered wagon.
We're going to go watch the local news.

2718
02:30:22.821 --> 02:30:24.590
It's a new show where they just,

2719
02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:29.300
they leave out like really important parts of historic events because they don't

2720
02:30:29.301 --> 02:30:33.200
jive with the government plan.
I mean,
that would be really funny.

2721
02:30:33.410 --> 02:30:36.170
Like watching like a news report,

2722
02:30:36.171 --> 02:30:41.171
you could easily do a parody of a news report of the fervor after 2011 or 2001

2723
02:30:41.631 --> 02:30:46.070
rather after September 11th you could easily do some sort of a government

2724
02:30:46.071 --> 02:30:49.130
propaganda.
Fox News at its worst,
but just oh,

2725
02:30:49.131 --> 02:30:52.470
so subtle show and people would,
you know,

2726
02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:56.840
people would eat it up and 10 years from now it probably will be like burlesque.

2727
02:30:58.120 --> 02:31:00.170
It really,
you would watch a burlesque show.

2728
02:31:00.200 --> 02:31:02.960
Isn't that kind of like cold bear does in terms of he takes that model,

2729
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:06.590
makes it a little bit ridiculous.
Yup.
And now he does have millions of viewers,

2730
02:31:06.591 --> 02:31:10.730
so I mean it's going to take over Letterman spot.
Yeah.
Just hilarious.

2731
02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:13.430
When does that start?
Well,
what's weird is what is he going to do?

2732
02:31:13.431 --> 02:31:16.670
Is he going to be cold bear?
Hmm.
No,
I heard he's not.

2733
02:31:17.450 --> 02:31:19.080
That's what it's going to be himself.
Yeah.

2734
02:31:20.540 --> 02:31:24.180
<v 2>You know,
he's like an ardent Catholic.
Is He really?
Yeah.</v>

2735
02:31:24.181 --> 02:31:28.980
He's like the guy is a serious Catholic.
Interesting.
Yeah,
that is interesting.

2736
02:31:28.981 --> 02:31:29.550
I didn't know that.

2737
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:32.370
I maybe would just be a new character unless that's a character too.

2738
02:31:32.850 --> 02:31:35.460
Maybe that's character too.
Maybe the Catholic things bullshit.

2739
02:31:36.940 --> 02:31:39.990
He's just playing that character as well.
Yeah.
Who knows?
What do you think?

2740
02:31:41.580 --> 02:31:41.971
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

2741
02:31:41.971 --> 02:31:46.200
I think he's probably going to play a version of himself mixed with like a late

2742
02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:50.400
night talk show host character.
You know,
it's probably,
you know what I mean?
Like,

2743
02:31:50.401 --> 02:31:52.800
uh,
like hey,
welcome back guys.
You know,

2744
02:31:52.801 --> 02:31:55.440
but he's still going to be himself but not be quick.
Yeah.

2745
02:31:55.740 --> 02:31:58.620
<v 2>It's a very quick guy.
Very,
very,
uh,</v>

2746
02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:02.460
cause Leno was a character that wasn't really,
I know,
you know.
Yeah.

2747
02:32:02.461 --> 02:32:06.600
But he doesn't think that,
I don't know.
He's so much better with just cars.

2748
02:32:06.810 --> 02:32:08.600
I watched Jay Leno's car shows,

2749
02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:12.660
like he's got this Jay Leno's garage with Jay's garage.
It's fucking great.

2750
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:15.420
And I'm watching.
I was like,
this could be a really good show.

2751
02:32:15.421 --> 02:32:17.700
Like why didn't you do this all the whole time?

2752
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:21.900
Because you see him on the tonight show it.
It's just so,
you know it's forced.

2753
02:32:21.901 --> 02:32:22.830
He's talking if I like,

2754
02:32:22.831 --> 02:32:26.340
that's that bit that Bill Hicks she used to do about them talking to Joey

2755
02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:28.580
Lawrence,
pulling out a gun and blowing his brains out and it,

2756
02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:32.880
and it forms an NBC peacock on the wall because he's a company man until the

2757
02:32:32.881 --> 02:32:36.720
bitter end.
It was a great classic bit,
but in a way,

2758
02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:39.720
I mean the reason why the bit was funny it was,
cause it kind of was true.

2759
02:32:39.930 --> 02:32:42.990
Like what was he doing?
He used to be a great comic and now he's a shill.

2760
02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:47.520
This like guy who's just selling people's TV shows he doesn't give a fuck about

2761
02:32:47.521 --> 02:32:50.250
and but you know what?
He gives a fuck about cars.

2762
02:32:50.370 --> 02:32:53.280
I've seen him on I think discovery channel before and he's lit up like a

2763
02:32:53.281 --> 02:32:55.530
Christmas tree.
Just super excited.
He will,

2764
02:32:55.531 --> 02:33:00.531
he knows everything about cars and not just everything about cars of today.

2765
02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:05.340
He knows about steam powered cars and old cars and electric cars.

2766
02:33:05.341 --> 02:33:08.910
I mean he's got like a,
a fleet of automobiles.
He works on them.

2767
02:33:08.911 --> 02:33:13.890
He's got this Jay Leno's,
Jay Jay's garage show,
and he loves them like this.

2768
02:33:13.891 --> 02:33:18.180
He's doing Jay Leno has more money than he will ever know what to do with.

2769
02:33:18.181 --> 02:33:19.770
He's rich as fuck,

2770
02:33:19.980 --> 02:33:24.060
and he had so much money that he made from stand up that he never touched any of

2771
02:33:24.061 --> 02:33:25.710
us tonight.
Show money.
He was like proud of that,

2772
02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:30.060
that you just put it all in the bank.
So all those cars,
whatever's house costs,

2773
02:33:30.061 --> 02:33:34.500
all that shit that's always stand up.
Comedy money.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.

2774
02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:36.300
You guys get a fuck load of money.

2775
02:33:36.430 --> 02:33:40.440
He is not spending the money he makes from the TV show.
Nope.
He doesn't have to.

2776
02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:41.880
It makes a lot of money doing stand up.

2777
02:33:41.881 --> 02:33:44.280
It's got to be an insane amount of money by now.
It must be insane.

2778
02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:47.850
You just put it all in the bank.
But the point being like he doesn't need money,

2779
02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:49.830
but he's doing it because he loves cars.

2780
02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:53.490
That's what everybody should do and that nobody would ever have had these issues

2781
02:33:53.491 --> 02:33:55.380
with Jay Leno if he did that.
You know,

2782
02:33:55.381 --> 02:33:58.170
you remember when Jimmy Kimmel went on a show and mocked him cause he was trying

2783
02:33:58.171 --> 02:34:02.610
to take Conan's job back and no one would have ever done that if it was just his

2784
02:34:02.611 --> 02:34:05.280
car show.
You know,
there's no competition,
there's no,

2785
02:34:05.430 --> 02:34:08.700
he's just having a great time talking about cars.
It's cool to see.

2786
02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:12.930
It's cool to see somebody like kind of get that and it's like the Internet has

2787
02:34:12.931 --> 02:34:16.500
transformed a lot of people's ideas of who Jay Leno is.

2788
02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:18.070
That's really

2789
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.460
<v 4>cool.</v>

2790
02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:21.220
It's cool when you can see the other side of somebody where you only see the

2791
02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:23.890
little public piece that pushed out there.

2792
02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:27.770
<v 2>Well he's,
you know,
that job's weird job man.
Being the host</v>

2793
02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:29.390
<v 4>I chats and other anachronism,</v>

2794
02:34:29.391 --> 02:34:32.030
it's for sure going to fade out is if you look at the demographics,

2795
02:34:32.031 --> 02:34:35.060
that idea of like Letterman and Leno,

2796
02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:38.030
I don't see that existing even 15 years.
Like I would put the,

2797
02:34:38.610 --> 02:34:42.350
the lifespan of that concept it 15 years at the absolute most because of the

2798
02:34:42.351 --> 02:34:43.670
people watching it.
Now,
how old are they?

2799
02:34:43.671 --> 02:34:46.130
50 or 60 how old are they in 10 or 15 years?

2800
02:34:46.660 --> 02:34:49.210
<v 2>Chelsea handler and she's kind of doing that and she's going to do that on</v>

2801
02:34:49.211 --> 02:34:50.050
Netflix now.

2802
02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:52.700
<v 4>Well that seems to me like an Internet show.</v>

2803
02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:56.660
That format seems different where you have not true or it's like a panel like

2804
02:34:56.661 --> 02:34:57.170
panels.

2805
02:34:57.170 --> 02:35:00.410
I don't have as much of an issue with the panel is that seems very like the way

2806
02:35:00.411 --> 02:35:03.800
you should do a show almost that the,
the late night thing,

2807
02:35:03.801 --> 02:35:07.280
I just don't see it existing because not only are people getting older,

2808
02:35:07.490 --> 02:35:09.350
a lot of old people are liking podcasts now.

2809
02:35:09.351 --> 02:35:12.800
Like I've got some older listeners and I'm sure you do because it's not that

2810
02:35:12.801 --> 02:35:15.310
hard.
Like we make it seem like it's this huge Chaz.

2811
02:35:15.410 --> 02:35:18.110
It's really not like you get bored of what's on TV at night.

2812
02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:22.820
You flip around through iTunes on your phone.
Now you're a podcast listener.

2813
02:35:22.821 --> 02:35:24.590
You've just switched demographics,
you know?

2814
02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:26.430
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
I know what you're saying.</v>

2815
02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:30.990
It's the problem with something like podcasting as opposed to these other things

2816
02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:35.640
is that you know,
if you have a show on NBC,

2817
02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.590
you can't not be a shale.
There's no way you're going to be that.

2818
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:41.490
The talk show host for the tonight show,

2819
02:35:41.730 --> 02:35:44.400
you're going to be on CBS are going to be your,
I mean,

2820
02:35:44.401 --> 02:35:47.100
you can have a certain amount of room for creative expression,

2821
02:35:47.101 --> 02:35:50.520
but essentially what you're trying to do is you're trying to be entertaining

2822
02:35:50.521 --> 02:35:54.120
while you're promoting people's projects and that's how you get access to Tom

2823
02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:57.810
Cruise.
It's what it is,
you know?
And if you're,
you're some wild fucker,

2824
02:35:58.050 --> 02:35:59.850
you're not going to get access to Tom Cruise.

2825
02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:02.670
He knows that you kind of have to be Barack Obama.

2826
02:36:02.671 --> 02:36:06.600
How many times does he interviewed Barack Obama's?
Yup.
Yup.
Fuck ain't did,

2827
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:09.420
that's a good point.
Where,
you know,
he's a hundred percent safe.

2828
02:36:09.421 --> 02:36:12.870
I was on with Ron Paul.
Yeah,
last time I did the tonight show.

2829
02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:15.210
Jay's a fucking really nice guy though.

2830
02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:18.840
He's a very nice guy and I really liked him on his car show.

2831
02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:22.680
It's really cool to say,
you know,
I don't know what kind of crazy shit he did.

2832
02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:23.161
You know,

2833
02:36:23.161 --> 02:36:25.830
when he was trying to get that letter when Letterman and him were duking it out

2834
02:36:25.831 --> 02:36:28.560
and they made those,
uh,
those,
that TV show about,

2835
02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:31.440
remember that made for TV movie the late shift.
Yeah.

2836
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:34.410
It was like at Hbo movie that they made on the struggle.

2837
02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:37.500
Who knows how much of that was true and how much of it was and I don't know,

2838
02:36:37.501 --> 02:36:38.291
but apparently Jaylen,

2839
02:36:38.291 --> 02:36:41.330
oh really did hide in the closet while this guy was having conversations about

2840
02:36:41.331 --> 02:36:44.860
him and then use that information against him.
I just kind of funny

2841
02:36:45.730 --> 02:36:47.740
<v 4>like I think Leno has a bit of a spine though.</v>

2842
02:36:47.741 --> 02:36:52.030
Cause I've seen him do some skits on surveillance type stuff and criticized

2843
02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:57.160
various policies.
Like he's not a complete uh,
uh,
like company man.

2844
02:36:57.161 --> 02:37:00.720
Right.
Like he,
he does use that from time to time.
He had you and Ron Paul on.

2845
02:37:01.580 --> 02:37:04.430
<v 2>We didn't talk about,
I mean I especially didn't talk about too much crazy.</v>

2846
02:37:04.431 --> 02:37:05.264
I just said that,

2847
02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:10.010
but just what I'm saying is just by doing that he's being kind of better than he

2848
02:37:10.011 --> 02:37:13.730
could be.
Yeah.
He had me on though because NBC had fear factor on.

2849
02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:16.060
Oh I don't think it was his like,

2850
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:19.280
<v 3>I mean I'm sure he could probably veto me.
He's always been nice to me.</v>

2851
02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:23.090
But I said that wasn't a decision where like,
cause he's a comedian.

2852
02:37:23.091 --> 02:37:25.850
You're a comedian.
I don't think so.
I mean,
I don't know.
I don't know.

2853
02:37:25.851 --> 02:37:29.910
I mean I would assume Jay Leno has a lot of power over who he chooses or knots

2854
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:33.590
chooses to talk to or not talk to on a show.
It's not like they needed me on.

2855
02:37:33.591 --> 02:37:36.020
It could have been the envy if you said like,
no way that guy's a dick.

2856
02:37:36.050 --> 02:37:38.150
But you know,
I'm sure he could get black balled it.

2857
02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:41.570
But at Ron Paul for sure is a controversial character.

2858
02:37:41.571 --> 02:37:43.820
But when I was talking about so much stuff,

2859
02:37:44.330 --> 02:37:47.390
that's what's so funny is a few years ago people like Ron Paul would've fucking

2860
02:37:47.391 --> 02:37:50.600
crazy federal reserve.
And then so much I started looking into it.

2861
02:37:50.601 --> 02:37:53.450
A lot of people did.
It's like,
well the Federal Reserve is actually pretty crazy.

2862
02:37:53.451 --> 02:37:56.270
So he was right about that is right about the whole like,

2863
02:37:56.271 --> 02:37:59.270
we shouldn't be going into all these places.
Cause now you see Iraq,

2864
02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:03.080
like what the fuck did we spend all this time and money over there for if

2865
02:38:03.081 --> 02:38:06.830
they're now falling back into the same chaos.
Yeah.
Do,
what is Isis?

2866
02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:10.400
I have no idea.
I honestly have not heard of them up until about two weeks ago.

2867
02:38:10.430 --> 02:38:12.410
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah,
you're on the ball.
Yeah.

2868
02:38:12.411 --> 02:38:14.750
Like that's the first I'd heard about them.
You're on the ball.

2869
02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:17.720
I mean you're on top of it.
If I,
if there's anything weird shit in the news,
you,

2870
02:38:17.721 --> 02:38:19.850
one of my favorite people to talk to because you usually have,

2871
02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:21.770
if it was anything really significant,

2872
02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:24.530
usually have a pretty detailed idea of what's going on.

2873
02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:26.660
You don't even know what Isis is.
Yeah.

2874
02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:30.230
I talked to some people the other night that gave me a fairly good explanation.

2875
02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:34.790
Brian Cowan is on top of it.
Of course.
Uh,
the Sunni's in the she eyes.

2876
02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:38.000
Apparently it has a lot to do with that,
but it's,
um,

2877
02:38:38.210 --> 02:38:43.130
it's a really bad militant jihadist organization and scaring the fuck out of

2878
02:38:43.131 --> 02:38:44.810
people.
And uh,

2879
02:38:44.811 --> 02:38:48.380
it sounds like like a team of bad guys in the Avengers.

2880
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:53.780
It doesn't,
it,
it does sound a little,
uh,
that totally sounds avenger like isis.

2881
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:58.670
It's that,
it's like,
okay,
this is more evidence that life's not real.

2882
02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:02.180
I'm in a movie.
We're definitely end up bad guys,

2883
02:39:02.181 --> 02:39:05.960
but definitely in a movie or at least the video game or something.
You think so.

2884
02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:10.880
I think life is too weird.
Like for me on a personal level is just too bizarre.

2885
02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:15.140
Too many checks getting some bitches.
Things are just happening so quick.

2886
02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:18.650
I don't mean like my own life and things are happening so quickly in such a cool

2887
02:39:18.651 --> 02:39:21.710
way.
Like the whole currency thing I consider to be psychedelic,

2888
02:39:21.711 --> 02:39:26.510
the whole legalization thing is literally psychedelic and then just this

2889
02:39:26.511 --> 02:39:30.230
internet thing and how people seem to know what's going on in 20 years ago,

2890
02:39:30.231 --> 02:39:31.570
they really didn't like,

2891
02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:34.190
there's something very cool about that and the progress rate,

2892
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:36.110
it almost doesn't feel like reality.

2893
02:39:36.111 --> 02:39:39.080
It feels like it's a simulation we're all in and I'm not saying it actually

2894
02:39:39.081 --> 02:39:42.080
gives because who the fuck knows.
It just seems like a lot of really interesting,

2895
02:39:42.081 --> 02:39:46.400
weird things happen that by pure probability,
why would this even happen?

2896
02:39:46.430 --> 02:39:50.000
It seems like it's kind of an adventure.
I agree that it is an adventure,

2897
02:39:50.001 --> 02:39:53.240
but I think it really is an adventure.
I don't know if there's no plan,

2898
02:39:53.241 --> 02:39:56.720
there's no design and yeah,
I'm not convinced that it's a simulation,

2899
02:39:56.721 --> 02:40:00.140
but I wouldn't be shocked if it was,
I mean,
I probably would be shocked,

2900
02:40:00.141 --> 02:40:03.980
but logically speaking,
if I looked at all the possibles and the variables,

2901
02:40:03.981 --> 02:40:07.460
I would say that it being a simulation,
it's definitely in the mix,

2902
02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:09.020
but even if it's not a simulation,

2903
02:40:09.021 --> 02:40:13.220
it's a simulation because you are born and now you have this localized

2904
02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:13.980
consciousness.
You

2905
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:16.710
<v 4>don't know why.
You don't know what you're supposed to do.
Like crazy.</v>

2906
02:40:16.711 --> 02:40:19.650
People claim that,
you know,
God speaks to them for the rest of us,

2907
02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:23.340
we don't know what the fuck to do.
Right.
We're here for 70 or 80 or 90 years.

2908
02:40:23.550 --> 02:40:27.420
Then that the game ends.
What was the purpose?
What were the rules?

2909
02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:30.900
You don't know,
but it does feel a little bit like a video game.

2910
02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:33.000
There's a certain life cycle to the game.

2911
02:40:33.270 --> 02:40:37.710
Certain little obstacles and people talk about synchronicity,
which is a,

2912
02:40:37.711 --> 02:40:41.520
it borders on being like secret type stuff,
but I think there's something to it.

2913
02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:46.470
I mean the secret like action.
There's a difference between law of attraction,

2914
02:40:46.471 --> 02:40:51.090
like nonsense and synchronicity,
which I believe is a re I don't understand it.

2915
02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:53.720
I just believe it's real.
What do you think it is?
And Carl

2916
02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:57.350
<v 0>synchronicity,
you mean thinking about things and they come true.</v>

2917
02:40:57.380 --> 02:41:01.160
Having friends think about them and they call you coincidental events that take

2918
02:41:01.161 --> 02:41:04.040
place.
Like what specifically do you think of when you think of synchronicity?

2919
02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:04.471
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2920
02:41:04.471 --> 02:41:07.530
it's those moments where like you're on a flight and at the last minute your,

2921
02:41:07.980 --> 02:41:12.300
your seat changes and the person you sit next to is the agent who signs you and

2922
02:41:12.301 --> 02:41:13.920
then your career takes off.

2923
02:41:13.921 --> 02:41:17.580
And I talked to people where that happens all the time and it seems like if life

2924
02:41:17.581 --> 02:41:21.510
were just this mouthy ASEAN fucking thing that we all go,
go,

2925
02:41:21.511 --> 02:41:24.960
go through and grind through and there's no purpose whatsoever and no design at

2926
02:41:24.961 --> 02:41:29.850
all and nothing to it aside from like just maybe reproduce and then die.

2927
02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:33.180
If that were the case,
I don't think all this cool stuff would be happening.

2928
02:41:33.210 --> 02:41:34.440
There's constant synergy.

2929
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:39.450
Things are getting so much better so quickly that it seems almost like this is

2930
02:41:39.451 --> 02:41:42.150
where we're supposed to be and it's leading towards something

2931
02:41:42.970 --> 02:41:47.170
<v 0>that's fascinating.
I wonder,
um,
I look at the whole,</v>

2932
02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:49.870
if you look at the big picture of the whole universe,

2933
02:41:49.871 --> 02:41:54.160
everything starting from the big bang,
spreading out planets,

2934
02:41:54.161 --> 02:41:57.310
forming stars,
giving,
you know,
solar,

2935
02:41:57.630 --> 02:42:02.480
these solar nebulas um,
solar nurseries giving birth to stars and you,

2936
02:42:02.481 --> 02:42:05.290
you think about what does this whole process and what's it trying to do?

2937
02:42:05.530 --> 02:42:08.050
It's constantly trying to make more complex shit.

2938
02:42:08.350 --> 02:42:11.650
Like everything is more complex.
A planet cools off.

2939
02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:15.340
Biological life begins to form.
Life starts shooting rockets out.

2940
02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:19.690
It starts like streaming things down for spinning things in the air above the

2941
02:42:19.691 --> 02:42:23.350
planet in orbit,
you know,
blowing nuclear bombs up in the atmosphere.

2942
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:25.720
And if you look at that and it's trying to get off,

2943
02:42:25.721 --> 02:42:27.820
it's trying to figure out a way to complicate itself.

2944
02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:33.040
Trying to figure out a way to get more biologically,
um,
more,
more,

2945
02:42:33.041 --> 02:42:36.670
more biologically advanced to the point where it's not going to die.

2946
02:42:36.670 --> 02:42:41.670
It's trying to figure out how to kill diseases and spread information fast and

2947
02:42:41.771 --> 02:42:45.730
the speed of light is trying to figure out how to travel in space through warp

2948
02:42:45.731 --> 02:42:48.520
drives.
I mean think about all the things it's trying to do.

2949
02:42:48.521 --> 02:42:50.050
It's trying to populate other planets,

2950
02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:53.980
in which case it'll continue to evolve as technology continue to get smarter,

2951
02:42:53.981 --> 02:42:57.460
continued to change,
its cool its capacity to change the world,

2952
02:42:57.490 --> 02:43:00.970
the environments open up wormholes,
start traveling to other dimensions.

2953
02:43:01.150 --> 02:43:03.820
I mean it's going to populate the whole earth.

2954
02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.770
It's going to populate the whole galaxy.

2955
02:43:05.771 --> 02:43:08.680
It's going to populate the whole universe.
It's going to keep going.

2956
02:43:08.681 --> 02:43:12.070
It's a crazy little weird thing and it's consciousness

2957
02:43:12.370 --> 02:43:17.350
<v 3>and we're bodies that carry consciousness around the same way a jug carries</v>

2958
02:43:17.351 --> 02:43:22.351
water around and we are consciousness figures out a way to evolve the body and

2959
02:43:22.751 --> 02:43:26.500
the environment and changes things and move things around and improves things.

2960
02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:30.640
And right now it's improving.
The very society that we live in,

2961
02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:35.800
the very culture that we operate on is changing radically because of technology,

2962
02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:38.080
technology and human innovation,

2963
02:43:38.081 --> 02:43:42.310
human creativity changing the actual earth itself,

2964
02:43:42.370 --> 02:43:43.203
building,

2965
02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:47.830
we'll just pop up 30 40 stories should build them out of the ground,

2966
02:43:47.831 --> 02:43:51.220
figure out how to engineer and planes and bridges.

2967
02:43:51.221 --> 02:43:56.221
You could drive across passable lakes and all this shit is being done like

2968
02:43:56.321 --> 02:44:00.720
right.
Like that being being bang,
Bang,
Bang.
It's just happening.
It's highly.

2969
02:44:00.810 --> 02:44:02.650
What's cool is we've layered in capitalism,

2970
02:44:02.660 --> 02:44:06.190
so we're doing all these things that are essentially just creative and are not

2971
02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:09.520
at all necessary to get laid or to get food.
You know,

2972
02:44:09.521 --> 02:44:12.850
like that's what it comes down to for most species and instead were talking and

2973
02:44:12.851 --> 02:44:15.700
building stuff and doing all the things that human beings do.

2974
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:20.320
We don't need to be doing any of it.
It's amazing.
It makes you believe,

2975
02:44:20.321 --> 02:44:21.730
almost like we're,

2976
02:44:21.731 --> 02:44:25.510
these creativity engines are kind of chaos engines that are just churning out

2977
02:44:25.511 --> 02:44:29.200
ideas because for sure you don't need to be as smart as we are to survive on

2978
02:44:29.201 --> 02:44:33.100
this planet.
But you do if you want to survive,
you know,

2979
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:37.180
for a long fucking time.
Yeah.
But,
but what I wanted to add that,

2980
02:44:37.181 --> 02:44:40.170
but I kind of forgot to add in there as the capitalism thing.

2981
02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:42.210
What I was saying is that,
uh,

2982
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:46.300
we've transferred it so that all these things that are essentially just art and

2983
02:44:46.301 --> 02:44:49.870
creativity are now survival for us.
Cause we can make money from that.

2984
02:44:50.290 --> 02:44:54.550
So if you're a rocket ship designer 300 years ago,
that doesn't mean anything.

2985
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:57.490
If you're,
if you're a great sculptor,
300 years ago,

2986
02:44:57.491 --> 02:45:00.390
you're still probably in the fields.
Like you got to eat food,
right?

2987
02:45:00.410 --> 02:45:03.220
You gotta do it now.
It takes no time at all for that shit.

2988
02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:05.200
So you can actually be a sculpture.

2989
02:45:05.201 --> 02:45:08.830
You can go to Nyu or Columbia or something and learn how to be a fucking

2990
02:45:08.831 --> 02:45:12.760
sculptor.
And you can become a rocket designer and do that and you'll actually be

2991
02:45:12.761 --> 02:45:13.594
compensated.

2992
02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:16.660
So you're doing these things that are completely not essential to your own

2993
02:45:16.661 --> 02:45:20.860
existence,
but it's been kind of transferred into this thing where you're like,

2994
02:45:20.890 --> 02:45:25.630
I have to do this so I can survive.
So it's very cool if you think about it.
Yeah,

2995
02:45:25.631 --> 02:45:26.470
it's not essential,

2996
02:45:26.471 --> 02:45:30.370
but it's something that's desirable and it's something that helps make our life

2997
02:45:30.371 --> 02:45:33.340
more interesting.
So you're willing to give up some bitcoin for it.

2998
02:45:33.610 --> 02:45:37.570
And next thing I know it's junk,
junk,
junk.
You're off to the races.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2999
02:45:37.571 --> 02:45:41.020
We were,
you know,
I think we live in,
in the most exciting time ever.

3000
02:45:41.170 --> 02:45:43.270
I think this is the best time ever to be alive as a human.

3001
02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:45.280
I think if you look back on all the different,

3002
02:45:45.430 --> 02:45:48.640
I mean everybody wants to cry that the sky is falling and you know,

3003
02:45:48.700 --> 02:45:51.160
pollution and warming has changed.

3004
02:45:51.161 --> 02:45:54.400
Like that's what what people have to be aware of is,
uh,
you know,

3005
02:45:54.910 --> 02:45:58.960
I was saying different things in 2011 because it was a different world in 2011.

3006
02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:02.500
And I'll be saying different things in 2017 cause there'll be a different world.

3007
02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:04.480
And if you're always saying the same thing,

3008
02:46:04.481 --> 02:46:08.020
like there are financial experts who've been saying that the collapse is coming

3009
02:46:08.021 --> 02:46:09.230
for the past 25 years.

3010
02:46:09.231 --> 02:46:12.260
Literally like just put your money into gold now it's coming folks.

3011
02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:16.580
And it never came.
100% never happened.
The recession.
Uh,

3012
02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:19.390
one of the few good things Obama has done seems to have us,

3013
02:46:19.700 --> 02:46:22.970
seems to have gotten us out of the recession through a combination of things.

3014
02:46:23.270 --> 02:46:27.050
And that collapsed that they'd try to sell you on newsletters and stuff is not

3015
02:46:27.051 --> 02:46:29.600
happening.
It's not going to happen in the way that it's described.

3016
02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:31.490
It's not even going to feel like a collapse.

3017
02:46:31.670 --> 02:46:34.910
Like when you consider the Internet to be the collapse of civilization.
No.

3018
02:46:34.911 --> 02:46:38.000
It's just like the growth of civilization.
It's a collapse of Jesus.

3019
02:46:39.710 --> 02:46:41.990
It's the collapse of easy corporate money is what it is.

3020
02:46:41.991 --> 02:46:43.410
The collapse of a lot of things wrong.

3021
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:47.150
A lot of stupid shit is getting flushed out.
Yeah.
It's just,

3022
02:46:47.270 --> 02:46:49.430
it's always going to be that way.
So he's going to be,

3023
02:46:49.431 --> 02:46:52.100
there's going to be an old method and the old method is replaced by a better

3024
02:46:52.101 --> 02:46:52.430
method.

3025
02:46:52.430 --> 02:46:56.450
The old methods trial struggles to try to stay relevant and it never makes it.

3026
02:46:56.770 --> 02:47:00.320
And this is no one's riding wagons around man.
There's no wagon trains.

3027
02:47:00.321 --> 02:47:05.300
There's this great quote that made the rounds a western union and like the 1870s

3028
02:47:05.301 --> 02:47:09.770
or something,
you probably saw this like this telephone has no use whatsoever.

3029
02:47:10.190 --> 02:47:13.130
It was,
it was about the telephone and that was pretty much what it said.

3030
02:47:13.131 --> 02:47:16.130
Like this telephone is too novel to ever gain mainstream acceptance.

3031
02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:19.730
We were talking about the war worlds the other day and the Orson wells thing,

3032
02:47:19.731 --> 02:47:23.630
the radio show and about how they were talking about radio being a new medium

3033
02:47:23.930 --> 02:47:28.370
and that radio is a new thing and then we have to figure out how to control.

3034
02:47:28.371 --> 02:47:32.090
It's the broadcasts and that must've felt like telepathy for them for the first

3035
02:47:32.091 --> 02:47:35.270
five or 10 years because now you have FDR or whoever,

3036
02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:39.620
like in your living room talking to Ya.
It must have been cool as shit.
Yeah.

3037
02:47:39.950 --> 02:47:42.650
You know,
and also they were all probably drunk at the time,
drunk and high.

3038
02:47:42.651 --> 02:47:44.870
So they were like,
Holy Shit.
Fdrs in the other room.

3039
02:47:45.950 --> 02:47:49.700
And plus it's got to really stimulate the imagination.
Just think he's talking,

3040
02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:52.400
he didn't even get to see him except in the movie theaters.

3041
02:47:52.570 --> 02:47:55.940
Did he go to the movie theaters and they'd play them like these clips ever seen

3042
02:47:55.941 --> 02:48:00.170
those clips that I've seen some of the war clips to.
Amazing.
Amazing.

3043
02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:04.100
Like they would play like clips of soldiers over there doing battle.

3044
02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:07.940
But other than that you had to pretend that you could imagine like you got to

3045
02:48:07.941 --> 02:48:11.690
look at the newspaper stories and you'd get like a black and white photo and try

3046
02:48:11.691 --> 02:48:13.640
to piece together what it was like to be there.

3047
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:17.330
I saw this great thing online that uh,
um,

3048
02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:21.140
it was talking about how we assume that we're all rude now cause we're all

3049
02:48:21.141 --> 02:48:22.760
looking down at our phones the whole time.

3050
02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:26.780
Well it showed a photo of a subway in New York like some time in the forties and

3051
02:48:26.781 --> 02:48:30.050
it's all newspapers so people were just as rude back then.

3052
02:48:30.051 --> 02:48:31.760
We're interested in finding information.

3053
02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:35.720
They were just doing a kind of crude way.
Yeah,
they've always done that.

3054
02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:40.880
People have always sat down on like airplanes that had magazines and read

3055
02:48:40.881 --> 02:48:41.870
magazines and books.

3056
02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:46.070
They didn't just have parties and starts saying share their souls while they're

3057
02:48:46.071 --> 02:48:49.130
on the flight.
I was on a flight once where a lady try to proselytize.

3058
02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:53.360
I was on a fright flight once with my friend who's a Jewish guy,
uh,

3059
02:48:53.450 --> 02:48:56.300
and he got really angry.
He got really angry.

3060
02:48:56.301 --> 02:49:01.301
This big black woman came by and she said something to the tone,

3061
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:06.080
something along the lines of,
uh,
Jesus loves you.
Uh,

3062
02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:07.980
I need to get Jesus to you to

3063
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.500
<v 2>put Jesus in your soul.
And she would like sing.</v>

3064
02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:14.160
She was like singing while the plane was going on before she got up to tell him

3065
02:49:14.161 --> 02:49:18.240
about Jesus.
There was like singing by biblical songs and my friend was like,

3066
02:49:18.241 --> 02:49:21.720
I'm not interested.
Thank you,
not interested.
Please stop talking to me.

3067
02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:24.210
Can someone please have her sit down?

3068
02:49:24.211 --> 02:49:27.570
And The lady came over and told us she had to sit down and stop saying it.

3069
02:49:27.571 --> 02:49:30.510
And then,
you know,
a couple people came over and had a conversation with her.

3070
02:49:31.950 --> 02:49:34.830
They told him,
stop thinking about Jesus Shit.

3071
02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:37.820
<v 4>Well,
I mean the people who have a secular upbringing,</v>

3072
02:49:37.850 --> 02:49:40.640
you have a stranger coming up to,
this happens to all of us all the time.

3073
02:49:40.641 --> 02:49:43.490
Like there are a couple of Mormon guys,
they didn't come up to me,

3074
02:49:43.491 --> 02:49:46.670
but they are on their bicycles where I was a few days ago and you could see them

3075
02:49:46.671 --> 02:49:51.410
doing their thing and it's a combination of you feel bad for them because you

3076
02:49:51.411 --> 02:49:54.770
know,
they were just brought up in it.
But also like as a secular person,

3077
02:49:54.771 --> 02:49:58.310
I just go,
you know,
this stuff is not factually accurate.

3078
02:49:58.850 --> 02:50:00.800
Pushing it on people who have not asked for it,

3079
02:50:00.801 --> 02:50:03.050
it's unsolicited and who the fuck are you?

3080
02:50:03.051 --> 02:50:06.740
You're the expert on what God wants your some broke Mormon kid on a bicycle and

3081
02:50:06.741 --> 02:50:09.460
you're supposed to tell me what Jesus wants me to do with my life.

3082
02:50:09.461 --> 02:50:11.060
Like you don't even know what you're doing with your life.

3083
02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:15.620
<v 2>Yes.
Silly,
silly people.
Silly,
silly people.</v>

3084
02:50:15.770 --> 02:50:16.700
You can't do that.

3085
02:50:17.430 --> 02:50:18.540
<v 1>I don't even answer the door.</v>

3086
02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:22.950
Ever since I got one of those big metal doors that you can see through,

3087
02:50:22.951 --> 02:50:25.080
like you have one of those that decided to have that.

3088
02:50:25.380 --> 02:50:29.700
Let's save so much uncomfortable and like you just open up the front first door.

3089
02:50:29.820 --> 02:50:32.910
You could see through what's going on.
Go.
I'm not interested at slam the door.

3090
02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:34.600
I want to make sure you have what I'm thinking of.

3091
02:50:34.630 --> 02:50:36.630
You have like a nightclub slit,
right?
No,
no,
no.

3092
02:50:36.631 --> 02:50:40.620
I have a wooden door that's then on top of it.

3093
02:50:40.621 --> 02:50:43.560
It's just this huge metal door that has like pins,

3094
02:50:44.180 --> 02:50:47.220
holes throughout the whole thing.
She can see through it,
but barely,

3095
02:50:47.550 --> 02:50:50.220
but you can see what's on the other side of that door and you could talk,

3096
02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:51.390
but you don't have to open the door.

3097
02:50:51.510 --> 02:50:54.030
<v 2>Glorious,
glorious times.</v>

3098
02:50:54.031 --> 02:50:57.930
My friends text away,
son.
Yeah.
I,

3099
02:50:57.931 --> 02:51:01.590
I'm just absolutely completely fascinated by all these new things that are

3100
02:51:01.591 --> 02:51:04.920
coming out.
I got a new pen that I need to implement next podcast.

3101
02:51:04.921 --> 02:51:06.420
I'm going to do it.
I haven't set it up yet,

3102
02:51:06.750 --> 02:51:09.720
but you might be interested in this too for notes.
Um,

3103
02:51:09.721 --> 02:51:12.970
this new pen is a digital pen that takes a photograph of any note that

3104
02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:14.450
<v 4>you don't have it and have it here.</v>

3105
02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:17.020
<v 2>No,
I don't have it here.
It's at home.
It's,
it's complicated.</v>

3106
02:51:17.021 --> 02:51:20.240
It's one of those things I have to look at and figuring out how I'm going to,
um,

3107
02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:22.390
and it has the special dope books that go with it.

3108
02:51:22.420 --> 02:51:25.840
You write down on this notebook all your different notes.

3109
02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:29.140
That camera on the pen takes a photograph of the note.

3110
02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:31.660
Then when you go to the note,
you go to the note,

3111
02:51:31.661 --> 02:51:35.500
you put your pen on the note and the audio recorder will play what you were

3112
02:51:35.501 --> 02:51:39.520
talking about when you wrote that note.
Oh Wow.
Oh Wow.

3113
02:51:39.650 --> 02:51:41.350
So you could be in the middle of an interview,

3114
02:51:41.380 --> 02:51:44.860
be in the middle of a conversation when you're on a podcast.
Like if there's,

3115
02:51:44.861 --> 02:51:48.250
a lot of times I have ideas,
like there was a,
I was talking to this guy,

3116
02:51:48.251 --> 02:51:52.750
a Gad Saad,
uh,
the guy you met who's on the first podcast in the middle of that,

3117
02:51:52.751 --> 02:51:55.840
I remembered this bit that I just stopped doing.
I just stopped doing it.

3118
02:51:55.841 --> 02:51:58.810
But it was a great bit like,
Oh my God,
I don't,
I've never put that on anything.

3119
02:51:58.990 --> 02:52:03.990
So I started writing down like to have that ability to go back to that moment

3120
02:52:04.510 --> 02:52:09.340
and know you were thinking about when you wrote that down,
like you can,

3121
02:52:09.341 --> 02:52:09.731
you know,

3122
02:52:09.731 --> 02:52:13.780
you could save a lot of missed ideas that just sort of disappear out into the

3123
02:52:13.781 --> 02:52:16.810
ether when you're having these long three hour conversations.

3124
02:52:17.140 --> 02:52:19.720
I mean that's just another new application of technology.

3125
02:52:19.721 --> 02:52:21.910
That's incredibly fascinating.
That's really cool.

3126
02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:24.010
Think about how many ideas we've all probably had.

3127
02:52:24.011 --> 02:52:26.110
That would be like a life changing,

3128
02:52:26.111 --> 02:52:29.020
but then you forget it because the phone rings or something and never comes
back.

3129
02:52:29.050 --> 02:52:30.750
Yeah.
Let me pull up what,

3130
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:33.580
whatever the fuck that Penn has called and this we're out of time.

3131
02:52:33.581 --> 02:52:37.690
We turned into a pumpkin probably.
We do a lot of,
to a lot of podcasts here.

3132
02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:40.790
Let me see this.
Uh,
I said,
I think I saw him.
They did.

3133
02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:43.510
Do you know where you got it?
Cause I think I saw them at staples the other day.

3134
02:52:43.690 --> 02:52:45.910
No,
I got it.
I definitely got it online.

3135
02:52:45.911 --> 02:52:49.080
I got it on amazon.com I don't fuck around.

3136
02:52:49.090 --> 02:52:53.380
So I do everything online now.
I very rarely go to a store and Bosch Shit,

3137
02:52:53.381 --> 02:52:57.280
I just love the idea.
It's just so weird to me that you can do that.

3138
02:52:57.310 --> 02:53:00.430
You could just fucking click on something and then all of a sudden it arrives at

3139
02:53:00.431 --> 02:53:01.850
your house and it's going to be three,

3140
02:53:01.900 --> 02:53:03.820
three d printers pretty soon from everything.

3141
02:53:04.210 --> 02:53:06.400
Everything people have been saying that's going to be really cool.

3142
02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:10.120
Live scribe is what it's called.
Live scribe,
eight gigabytes.

3143
02:53:10.121 --> 02:53:14.640
Cut Eight gigabytes of storage.
Incredible.
It works with Wifi.

3144
02:53:15.250 --> 02:53:19.650
Syncs up to your computer.
It's too much.
We,

3145
02:53:19.710 --> 02:53:22.780
we live in the strangest times ever.
This is so weird.

3146
02:53:22.781 --> 02:53:24.640
Like every day there's some new thing that comes at,

3147
02:53:24.641 --> 02:53:29.110
this is from an article I got,
but this guy was talking about,
um,
uh,
shorthand.

3148
02:53:29.140 --> 02:53:32.170
You ever see guys writing that Gregg shorthand?
That's what it's called.

3149
02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:35.710
Fascinating.
It's like they have this weird little shorthand language.

3150
02:53:35.711 --> 02:53:38.650
You can write like 290 words a minute.
If you're really good at it,

3151
02:53:38.651 --> 02:53:40.850
you can whip through it.
So when someone's talking to you,

3152
02:53:40.851 --> 02:53:43.930
you could literally get everything they say and then you can go back to it and

3153
02:53:43.931 --> 02:53:47.680
realize by reading your chicken scratch and you ever seen it.
Yeah.

3154
02:53:47.681 --> 02:53:50.500
Reporters do it all the time.
Yeah.
It's weird stuff,
man.

3155
02:53:50.530 --> 02:53:53.890
Not a lot of reporters anymore,
man.
The old school,
the old school,

3156
02:53:54.130 --> 02:53:57.400
most of the people now they record things and then they write them down.

3157
02:53:57.400 --> 02:53:59.980
Then they fuck up everything you said because the Co,
you know,

3158
02:54:00.440 --> 02:54:03.500
conversation wasn't that clear and make sure I go very,

3159
02:54:03.710 --> 02:54:05.530
I don't like written interviews to that reason.

3160
02:54:05.531 --> 02:54:08.140
Like I don't like it an article where it's just quoting that person.

3161
02:54:08.141 --> 02:54:11.620
Like let's see the,
let's see the video,
let's see how they came across.
Exactly.

3162
02:54:11.621 --> 02:54:13.450
My point about Anthony,

3163
02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:18.370
it goes back to my point about opie and Anthony getting across what he said on

3164
02:54:18.371 --> 02:54:23.320
Twitter with no humor without him,
without someone to talk to.
Also.

3165
02:54:23.321 --> 02:54:26.200
That's the other thing about Anthony's and weight plays off of people.

3166
02:54:26.620 --> 02:54:29.890
You know it have been a way better way to handle that.
Putting six,
you know,

3167
02:54:29.891 --> 02:54:34.891
who else got fucked that Adam Richmond man versus food guy show over.

3168
02:54:35.790 --> 02:54:40.270
Boom.
Very Mild,
very mild.
What he did,
very mild.

3169
02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:43.840
He's talking about losing weight and he wrote something about like how much

3170
02:54:43.841 --> 02:54:44.591
weight it needs to lose.

3171
02:54:44.591 --> 02:54:49.060
And he wrote thin Spiration like Hashtag inspiration and he started getting

3172
02:54:49.061 --> 02:54:53.730
attacked by all these people that are apparently it's in the,
that's in the um,

3173
02:54:53.890 --> 02:54:57.700
uh,
Anorexia Movement,
this idea thins operation,
this Hashtag this.

3174
02:54:57.701 --> 02:55:00.790
And he didn't know about this,
so they started attacking him.
So see,

3175
02:55:00.791 --> 02:55:02.950
he starts responding to them,
attacking him.

3176
02:55:02.951 --> 02:55:06.760
He us one guy to fill a draw a bath and open your veins and,

3177
02:55:06.761 --> 02:55:10.610
and do the society.
Like that's it,
dude,
you're done.
And they pulled the show.

3178
02:55:11.270 --> 02:55:12.890
I actually liked that guy show a lot.

3179
02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:16.510
<v 1>NBC.
I just signed him up for a new show.
That starts like next month though.</v>

3180
02:55:16.511 --> 02:55:17.680
So he,

3181
02:55:18.090 --> 02:55:20.130
<v 2>well he was on the travel channel pro.
They're rough.</v>

3182
02:55:20.340 --> 02:55:23.640
They were rough with the Anthony Bordain.
They're rough with Bert Kreischer.

3183
02:55:24.020 --> 02:55:27.810
You know,
Burt [inaudible] allegedly since bird crash.
It doesn't smoke pot.

3184
02:55:27.811 --> 02:55:31.230
This is all fiction.
But if he did smoke pot,
he would have to do it off camera.

3185
02:55:31.231 --> 02:55:34.950
Right.
And hide it.
Right?
Yeah.
And uh,
Anthony Bourdain,

3186
02:55:34.951 --> 02:55:37.510
he had a problem with them too.
It was like,
I dunno,
I think they're,

3187
02:55:37.590 --> 02:55:42.330
they're quite conservative so they weren't happy.
But meanwhile,
homeboy,

3188
02:55:42.331 --> 02:55:44.970
he didn't handle it so well either white telling people to kill themselves

3189
02:55:44.971 --> 02:55:49.960
because they told you that thin inspiration is a,
uh,
an anorexia.
Yeah.

3190
02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:53.280
A hashtag.
By the way,
take it back.
Take,
take.

3191
02:55:53.281 --> 02:55:56.760
Say we're taking back fitspiration fuck the anorexic.

3192
02:55:57.780 --> 02:55:58.710
That's what he should say.

3193
02:55:59.370 --> 02:56:02.070
<v 1>I think a lot of these people just need to have in the contract,
it's like,
look,</v>

3194
02:56:02.071 --> 02:56:05.760
you're going to have a publicist that you have to send your tweets through if

3195
02:56:05.761 --> 02:56:08.040
you were paying you this much money.

3196
02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:11.190
Cause I know I even have almost said a few things and my girlfriend is a

3197
02:56:11.191 --> 02:56:13.410
publicist.
It's like,
don't say that.
What the fuck are you doing?

3198
02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:17.160
<v 2>That's a standard thing.
Now with television shows,
a lot of people,
they uh,</v>

3199
02:56:17.161 --> 02:56:21.240
in contracts,
they're asking for a control.
Your social media,
super,

3200
02:56:21.270 --> 02:56:24.810
super standard.
Like they want access.
They want to be able to tweet for you.

3201
02:56:24.811 --> 02:56:27.910
They want to be able to tweet things.
Right.
You know,
I've had terrible idea.

3202
02:56:27.930 --> 02:56:28.950
I've had that request.

3203
02:56:29.310 --> 02:56:32.560
Well I've had that request giving away your soul to somebody because really

3204
02:56:32.561 --> 02:56:33.680
that's,
that's what you have.

3205
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:38.130
We're only gonna use it for promotional purposes and I'm,
I can't do that.

3206
02:56:38.190 --> 02:56:42.870
You can't say you're me like it tweets when I Youtube things people give me shit

3207
02:56:42.871 --> 02:56:47.010
about that already.
Like when all of our videos go up on youtube,

3208
02:56:47.011 --> 02:56:50.730
that's not me tweeting.
It's an automatic thing when you upload videos useful.

3209
02:56:50.731 --> 02:56:52.140
That's different from them.
It is.

3210
02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:57.810
But my point is even that it doesn't cost anything,
it's just a link to youtube.

3211
02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:00.990
People give me shit because it's not me.
They call it the Rogan Bot.

3212
02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:03.950
<v 1>What would it should it be?
It should always be you,</v>

3213
02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:09.160
but it should have a filter where they approve it and then once they have no

3214
02:57:09.811 --> 02:57:13.610
negative,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I mean it's,
it's almost instant.
Like,
like,
like,

3215
02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:16.130
like every time you tweet it automatically gets sent to somebody.
Got,
yeah,

3216
02:57:16.131 --> 02:57:20.900
that's fine.
But based on,
based on like,
Hey,
you know,

3217
02:57:20.990 --> 02:57:24.110
if this tweet where to go out,
you had been fired from our

3218
02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:26.640
<v 2>this job,
you can't get rid of them kind of power.</v>

3219
02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:29.520
Especially a guy like Anthony especially,

3220
02:57:29.550 --> 02:57:30.240
<v 1>you can't get around.</v>

3221
02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:33.240
You can't get arrested then you can't lose a job from it is what I'm saying.

3222
02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:35.030
That's what that,
I mean if you're

3223
02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:38.130
<v 2>Liz,
the two totally unrelated things,</v>

3224
02:57:38.131 --> 02:57:42.210
what I'm saying is that he can't give them that and because the audience doesn't

3225
02:57:42.211 --> 02:57:42.870
want that.

3226
02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:46.200
One of the things that people love and that I love is that I know that we wrote

3227
02:57:46.201 --> 02:57:51.030
that con animal,
that's him.
It's a d right,
wrong,
bad,

3228
02:57:51.031 --> 02:57:53.040
good.
It's coming directly from him.

3229
02:57:53.340 --> 02:57:57.000
If I really think that somebody had a green light,
red light option,

3230
02:57:57.040 --> 02:58:01.320
whether or not his tweets got through,
that would be disgusting.
You know,
I would,

3231
02:58:01.321 --> 02:58:05.880
I don't want that.
I don't want anyone else involved in someone's tweets.
I just,

3232
02:58:06.090 --> 02:58:09.360
and giving them the,
like when when they asked me to do it,
they were like,

3233
02:58:09.361 --> 02:58:11.970
you know,
we're just going to promote promotional things.
And I was like,

3234
02:58:11.971 --> 02:58:14.670
how do I know what you're going to do?
Right?
And you're going to have access to,

3235
02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:16.260
you can do whatever you want.
You know,

3236
02:58:16.261 --> 02:58:18.450
you can delete my tweets if you don't like them.

3237
02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:21.150
Like what if I said something fucked up and I got on a plane?
They're like,

3238
02:58:21.151 --> 02:58:25.230
well we know you wanted to take that down.
Like what?
I wanted to take that down.

3239
02:58:25.231 --> 02:58:29.070
I didn't want to take that time.
I'm,
I'm meant that you can't have that.
No,
no.

3240
02:58:29.080 --> 02:58:31.930
That really is the only thing you have at the end of the day because uh,

3241
02:58:31.980 --> 02:58:34.740
like shows and networks change a lot,
especially for journalists.

3242
02:58:34.741 --> 02:58:37.740
But definitely for entertainers to all that stuff changes.

3243
02:58:37.741 --> 02:58:40.170
All you have is like your reputation with the public.

3244
02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:42.090
If they trashed that with a bunch of bullshit,

3245
02:58:42.330 --> 02:58:45.090
if these companies are not that smart,
like I see some companies on Twitter,

3246
02:58:45.091 --> 02:58:47.040
you're like,
this is it.
Don't fucking care about you.

3247
02:58:47.041 --> 02:58:51.020
They don't care about your vision.
Yeah,
we're out of time.
David Seaman.

3248
02:58:51.540 --> 02:58:55.760
Thanks again dude.
Fucking anytime,
man.
We've got to do this more often.
We,
uh,

3249
02:58:55.761 --> 02:58:58.300
the last one was only like,
what,
two months ago?
Yeah,

3250
02:58:58.301 --> 02:59:01.730
it was a month and a half or seven.
That's how we'll do it.
There's all this,

3251
02:59:01.740 --> 02:59:06.680
we're,
we're hitting this time.
We're change.
Things change so exponentially fast.

3252
02:59:06.681 --> 02:59:09.650
It seems so frantic and frenzy.
We need to as often as possible.
