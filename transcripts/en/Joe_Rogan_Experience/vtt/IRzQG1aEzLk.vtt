1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>We are trying to give zero for zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rode a</v>

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>fascinating thing to transmit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind once said about a mushroom trip.</v>

3
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>He asked a mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could he possibly,</v>

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>how could anyone possibly save the path</v>
<v Speaker 1>that humans are on?</v>

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>And they said very simply and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Each parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each,</v>

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>each couple should reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you know two people,</v>

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>they have one kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody relaxes the whole the</v>

9
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax everything.</v>

10
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's plenty of fucking</v>

11
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:32.821
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>There is zero worry that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go extinct.</v>

13
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>But then the problem is how do you go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people?</v>

14
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Like those crazy people that were on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that TV show that had 19 children,</v>

15
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>many of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

16
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>what is she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is she in labor for like three</v>

17
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:47.590
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.473
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

19
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Does he actually have sex with her or</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he just jerk off into the abyss?</v>

20
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

21
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>how are those babies actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>fertilized?</v>

22
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

23
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>that woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you tell that woman she can't</v>

24
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

25
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a freak show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

26
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I think resources wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have three kids,</v>

27
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to give them all the time that</v>

28
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>they deserve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>and me and my wife had discussed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the possibility of</v>

30
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>having more children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I think we should really</v>

31
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on raising the ones we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're fun and it's great and I,</v>

32
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>they needed a lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like children need a lot of time and I</v>

33
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>enjoy giving them that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that if you have another kid</v>

34
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets a little bit less time and</v>

35
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I think in that getting less time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some benefits to independence</v>

36
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it as long as there's love and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's comfort.</v>

37
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>But I also think you can teach kids a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of shit,</v>

38
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could teach them a lot,</v>

39
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>especially if you really are into it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you concentrate on it and you read a lot</v>

40
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 1>of books on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm really involved in the idea of</v>

41
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>raising kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm raising little human beings.</v>

42
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>So the conversations that I have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them are all geared towards that.</v>

43
00:01:55.681 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Like it's geared towards enlightening</v>
<v Speaker 1>them is to the world and it sort of</v>

44
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>guiding them is how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to treat people,</v>

45
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>how to be nice to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be nice to your sister or like,</v>

46
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Be Nice to have to pee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

47
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>don't get angry at things for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it this way instead of that way.</v>

48
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>you ain't gonna miss a lot of that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have 15,</v>

50
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>16 kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to like,</v>

51
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>do you guys just shut the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up organized teams.</v>

52
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for your little</v>

53
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:19.681
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

54
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what those people did.</v>

55
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Those people have like every kid has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chore and every kid,</v>

56
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>that's how you're raised zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these kids,</v>

57
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to know what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going on in the world.</v>

58
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Like they're going to need someone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help them every day is spent doing tasks</v>

59
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your life is basically religion,</v>

60
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>homeschooling and these tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's those kids.</v>

61
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the 19 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they?</v>

62
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>The duggins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call a CV.</v>

63
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I find that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

64
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could tell those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people not to do that.</v>

65
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I think this is America and America has</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it's faults,</v>

66
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think about it,</v>

67
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>they only neutralized like eight gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>couples neutralized when you went.</v>

68
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean like those kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you average it out,</v>

69
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>like you got eight gay couples</v>

70
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 2>who don't have any kids or adopt a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>which takes it out of the pool and</v>

71
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>mathematically you can have outliers</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that because there are lots of</v>

73
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:11.070
<v Speaker 2>people like me who don't have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:03:11.071 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

75
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I think the way to do it is to remove</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stigma around not having kids and to</v>

76
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.740
<v Speaker 2>encourage 'em to n w what Helen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah hrdy calls aloe parenting.</v>

77
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>And this gets back to the hunter</v>
<v Speaker 2>gatherer thing.</v>

78
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Like kids are raised by everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

79
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.174
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 2>two parents are better than one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

81
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>

82
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Five parents are better than two takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure off you,</v>

83
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you get frustrated,</v>

84
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 2>you get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 2>their mother gets tired and it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enriching for the adult.</v>

86
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I love being around kids for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

87
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

88
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I know fully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>we had a party at my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the day and there was a gang for</v>

90
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Halloween.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a Halloween party and there</v>

91
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>was a gang of kids over and it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fun talking to other people's</v>

92
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>little kids and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing other different and how they</v>

93
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>behave different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have different ideas about stuff and you</v>

94
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

95
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>This is the family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 folks that live at home together.</v>

96

<v Speaker 1>It's just to keep them all around.</v>

100
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen kids seems a little excessive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

101
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>he's anal not for really religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

102
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>

103
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>That was Sarah Palin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said that Sarah Palin had a</v>

104
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 1>conversation with a librarian and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cilla Alaska,</v>

105
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 1>where she said that on the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a photograph of,</v>

106
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>of human footprint inside of dinosaur</v>
<v Speaker 1>footprint,</v>

107
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>and the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the woman like talked about this</v>

108
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>and Sarah Palin was running for</v>
<v Speaker 1>president or vice president,</v>

109
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was like,</v>

112
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>heartbeat away from being the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she thought she thought that</v>

113
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs and humans walk together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you see people who are intelligent</v>

114
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.190
<v Speaker 1>get that pill that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian claim dinosaurs of people</v>

115
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>coexisted because they say they're about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the librarian.</v>

116
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

117
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>what's the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Sarah Palin.</v>

119
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Michele Bachman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michele Bachmann's worse.</v>

120
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her husband's gay rights is gay,</v>

121
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>is gay as gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as gay as the day is beautiful and long</v>

122
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 1>and flowers smell pretty and butterflies</v>
<v Speaker 1>are beautiful.</v>

123
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>That guy's gay and allegedly he can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck enough dick.</v>

124
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could just give him a free pass,</v>

125
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>if you ever got that guy liquored up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a heart on in front of him,</v>

126
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.260
<v Speaker 1>he would jump on it like Greg Louganis</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the top peer swan dive on that.</v>

127
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 2>His head would be spinning out of a gain</v>
<v Speaker 2>or he'd still get some tongue on the</v>

128
00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 2>chef.</v>

129
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>He would automatically starts salivating</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where it was like a</v>

130
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:07.451
<v Speaker 1>waterfall coming out of his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pouring down shirts just so</v>

131
00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:10.330
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Long Street.</v>

132
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 2>No where the pool started and the saliva</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Dick coming out.</v>

133
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

134
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would literally be like a saliva</v>

135
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 1>waterfall and when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when when people have a backyard and</v>

136
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:26.021
<v Speaker 1>they have those really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fancy little rock formations where</v>

137
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>the water comes down into their pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fancy schmancy.</v>

138
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:29.774
<v Speaker 1>That was his mouth.</v>

139
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he.</v>

140
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 2>He would say to a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to go in the hot tub with</v>

141
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy would go,</v>

142
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd get in the hot tub and the guy</v>

143
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 2>would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no water in here.</v>

144
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 2>And he'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wet</v>

145
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.650
<v Speaker 1>cock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warm and gooey.</v>

146
00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:46.300
<v Speaker 1>It's comes out 96 degrees.</v>

147
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.140
<v Speaker 2>I'd let them blow me if I knew that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could take down Michelle Bachmann</v>

148
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.490
<v Speaker 2>particular down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From what though?</v>

149
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Just because she will be an elected</v>
<v Speaker 2>leader.</v>

150
00:06:56.191 --> 00:06:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really feel that?</v>

151
00:06:57.811 --> 00:06:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

152
00:06:59.101 --> 00:07:03.990
<v Speaker 2>you just have to see who fox news is</v>
<v Speaker 2>trotting out and she is one of the first</v>

153
00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:08.370
<v Speaker 2>pundits they go to for comments on shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is introducing legislation in</v>

154
00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Congress right now that is actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>being enacted.</v>

155
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.010
<v Speaker 2>So what's the stopper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

156
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.860
<v Speaker 2>I will suck her husband's Dick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>release it on the.</v>

157
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.420
<v Speaker 2>On the Internet.</v>
