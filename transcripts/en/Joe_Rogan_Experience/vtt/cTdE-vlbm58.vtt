<v Speaker 2>It's so amazing.</v>

9
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.710
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how much stuff you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have in here.</v>

10
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

11
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 2>we're working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're making it happen.</v>

12
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Before we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to apologize.</v>

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Speaker 2>I have to apologize for something I said</v>
<v Speaker 2>last week,</v>

14
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.703
<v Speaker 2>last Tuesday in passing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were watching a corey feldman clip </v>

15
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corey feldman was doing this crazy dance</v>

16
00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:45.071
<v Speaker 2>and Greg Fitzsimmons was in and Corey </v>
<v Speaker 2>Feldman had some little tight jacket and</v>

17
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:50.531
<v Speaker 2>it's just weird song he was saying and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that jacket was wearing that jacket</v>

18
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.270
<v Speaker 2>when he was young and he got diddled </v>
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>

19
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to make Greg left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

20
00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to say fucked up things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make comedians laugh,</v>

21
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 2>which is what we do and we get together.</v>

22
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.703
<v Speaker 2>We say the most heinous shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I felt terrible after somebody </v>

23
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:10.010
<v Speaker 2>pointed it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't even remember saying it.</v>

24
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.413
<v Speaker 2>Some pointed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Saturday I watched it and I </v>

25
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:18.050
<v Speaker 2>felt so terrible because the especially </v>
<v Speaker 2>like out of context,</v>

26
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.250
<v Speaker 2>like it's just me laughing about him </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting detailed.</v>

27
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>

28
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.060
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's taken out of context,</v>

29
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 2>like that's going to make you feel weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't see that,</v>

30
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 2>but there's no excuse like what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

31
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.783
<v Speaker 2>you swing it a lot of pitches when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do an live podcasts and sometimes you </v>

32
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 2>hit yourself in the Dick with a bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I did.</v>

33
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was totally wrong.</v>

34
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't funny.</v>

35
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I took a swing at it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the wrong thing to do.</v>

36
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 2>It was what the best way to describe it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

37
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 2>It was thoughtless because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really didn't think I was just trying to</v>

38
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:56.390
<v Speaker 2>say something fucked up to make greg </v>
<v Speaker 2>lap.</v>

39
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't thinking like this is a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

40
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 2>And I've watched him the other day in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie man.</v>

41
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:01.994
<v Speaker 2>I saw him in Gremlins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching gremlins with my kids </v>

42
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 2>after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually we did the podcast before.</v>

43
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I watched the clip though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't,</v>

44
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I do it and then I'm done with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't think about it.</v>

46
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

47
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing the Michael Jackson thing,</v>

48
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:20.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wears a Michael Jackson jacket and </v>

49
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.230
<v Speaker 2>dance like Michael Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't.</v>

50
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.130
<v Speaker 2>He said Michael Jackson didn't even do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to them,</v>

51
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 2>so it didn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a stupid line to say,</v>

52
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 2>but I felt terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't sleep Saturday night.</v>

53
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 2>I felt really bad.</v>

54
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I felt really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt bad for a bunch of reasons.</v>

55
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:37.454
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt bad because it's a mean thing to </v>

56
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 2>say and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean it to be.</v>

57
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Even though it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just trying to be funny.</v>

58
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.993
<v Speaker 2>You know patrice o Neal said something </v>
<v Speaker 2>once when he was defending opie and </v>

59
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying,</v>

60
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 2>when someone says something really funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the same person says something really</v>

61
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all comes from the same place.</v>

62
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Like they're trying to do the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

63
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 2>They just miss you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was without a doubt,</v>

64
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400
<v Speaker 2>the worst miss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most embarrassing to me.</v>

65
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm the most depressing the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

66
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.973
<v Speaker 2>what's the best way to describe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so disappointed that I did that </v>

67
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 2>because he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a kid,</v>

68
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think he actually got </v>

69
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 2>molested.</v>

70
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I think he was actually saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Corey Haim got molested and he didn't.</v>

71
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would make sense where I,</v>

72
00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Corey Haim did so much drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 2>if he did get molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

74
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.943
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started looking into this shit more </v>

75
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 2>and more recently like Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>molestation with children.</v>

76
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no joke,</v>

77
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just as.</v>

78
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 2>It's no joke with sexual harassment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>assault with women.</v>

79
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:46.834
<v Speaker 2>When you see me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Harvey Weinstein thing and these </v>

80
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 2>other directors now are getting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble for the same thing.</v>

81
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 2>The same kind of shit happened to a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of kids that were involved in,</v>

82
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.714
<v Speaker 2>in these child movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think about that when you're </v>

83
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 2>just trying to crack a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just want everybody know if,</v>

84
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>if you were disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>

85
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 2>If you were disappointed in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way.</v>

86
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:09.590
<v Speaker 2>You were more disappointed in me than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>am disappointed in me.</v>

87
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I didn't sleep Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a hard time sleeping last night.</v>

88
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.623
<v Speaker 2>I felt bad about it all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt terrible and I went to underwood </v>

89
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 2>farms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what an underwear ad farms is a</v>

90
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 2>great family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time.</v>

91
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Had a good time with the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

92
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 2>we're picking out pumpkin's and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff,</v>

93
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 2>but the entire time I was there there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this blanket of like,</v>

94
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 2>how did I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did I say that?</v>

95
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes you'll say something </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and then after you did it,</v>

96
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.030
<v Speaker 2>like you can't believe you said it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

97
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Especially when we're doing this live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

98
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.513
<v Speaker 2>If you and me were just out at a diner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would probably say that and laugh to </v>

99
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 2>each other because no one's getting hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>by it.</v>

100
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 2>We're just making each other laugh and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do that all the time.</v>

101
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:50.704
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We say started shit to each other all </v>

102
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:52.864
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when other people hear it and then </v>

103
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 2>the guy hears it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like of course you heard it.</v>

104
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Like that's just wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

105
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean to have that impact and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't think about it.</v>

106
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 2>It was very thoughtless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was extremely disappointed myself.</v>

107
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.163
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to look at it from a different </v>

108
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to like examine it,</v>

109
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:17.434
<v Speaker 2>like the feeling of doing something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't have done that might have </v>

110
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 2>hurt someone's feelings because you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>senseless and thoughtless.</v>

111
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 2>That feeling is a terrible feeling and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

112
00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it overcomes your whole day.</v>

113
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:32.464
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

114
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.563
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody knew because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>still having fun with the family and </v>

115
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 2>everybody was laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a lot of kid stuff.</v>

116
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day that was with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me all day.</v>

117
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

118
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 2>it was like a fucking wet blanket that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was carrying with me,</v>

119
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 2>like a depression blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

120
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

121
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 2>there's no other way to put it.</v>

122
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Then you know that I'm sorry and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have done it.</v>

123
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 2>But what I was thinking while it was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

124
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:05.294
<v Speaker 2>I was like this feeling of letting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people down and hurting </v>

125
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 2>someone's feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something in a mass way,</v>

126
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.093
<v Speaker 2>like on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new feeling like before you </v>

127
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people could be upset at you,</v>

128
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 2>maybe someone you know or people you </v>
<v Speaker 2>work with and it's a bad feeling.</v>

129
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 2>But this is a different kind of bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

130
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 2>It's an intensified bad feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially like the way I did it because</v>

131
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.084
<v Speaker 2>it's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would think that at this age I'm </v>

132
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:32.414
<v Speaker 2>50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would see like a don saying stupid </v>

133
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'm not,</v>

134
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

135
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.423
<v Speaker 2>I'm not done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the fucked up thing about </v>

136
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 2>being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It requires constant diligence.</v>

137
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to constantly pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to your thinking.</v>

138
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 2>You have to constantly pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you behave and who you are.</v>

139
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 2>You can't just go off the cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing,</v>

140
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:55.320
<v Speaker 2>it's making me think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 2>doing this sober October thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

142
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.293
<v Speaker 2>obviously I love pot and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always loved pot and I've been a </v>

143
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 2>regular pot smoker for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

144
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 2>there is a difference in my personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm not smoking pot,</v>

145
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.360
<v Speaker 2>grumpy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more tense,</v>

147
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.740
<v Speaker 2>less kind and I have to like catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself before I get upset about things.</v>

148
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when I'm high or if I even then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

149
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not even if I'm high,</v>

150
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:27.050
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm just smoking on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis,</v>

151
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.243
<v Speaker 2>I'm way more mellow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more relaxed about things and way </v>

152
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:32.880
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

153
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 2>I guess the right word is humble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'm cocky when I'm sober,</v>

154
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like really aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more aware of gratitude.</v>

155
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 2>And Fortunately I'm lucky and </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciative of my friends.</v>

156
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I want to hug people more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like pod has a lot of,</v>

157
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:49.874
<v Speaker 2>for me from my fucked up brain has a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of really positive effects as a lot of </v>

158
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:54.914
<v Speaker 2>really positive personality effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think I might be downplaying my </v>

159
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:00.044
<v Speaker 2>dependence on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think that might've been going </v>

160
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 2>like that's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just fucking quit pot.</v>

161
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about all that.</v>

162
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dreams.</v>

163
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Here's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember him,</v>

164
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember them.</v>

165
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.374
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all wolves and bears and </v>

166
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 2>drowning and falling off buildings and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fucking lava coming at you.</v>

167
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 2>It's all primal shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

168
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

169
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm having all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

170
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.670
<v Speaker 2>these Predator dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

171
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.780
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

172
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:31.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had these dreams,</v>

173
00:08:31.171 --> 00:08:32.004
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these cart almost cartoon wolves at </v>

174
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 2>these giant feet and they will like </v>
<v Speaker 2>running through the woods and uh,</v>

175
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another trying to get away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from them.</v>

176
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I had a dream that I was for some reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was crawling through some fucking cave</v>

177
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 2>and there was an enormous bear inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>this cave and it was looking at me and I</v>

178
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get the fuck out of here.</v>

179
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:52.124
<v Speaker 2>And it was like trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not the bear was going to </v>

180
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 2>come after me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean super vivid.</v>

181
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.133
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember my dreams when I was </v>

182
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 2>getting high and last I took the Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain before I went to sleep.</v>

183
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.243
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will fucking spark you up some </v>

184
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 2>crazy lucid dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

185
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 2>I would just sleep good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never had a problem sleeping.</v>

186
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 2>I'd get up in the morning and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

187
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.793
<v Speaker 2>But there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a big difference between me </v>

188
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 2>when I'm using pot and me when I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>using.</v>

189
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm noticing the same thing with Ari and</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are.</v>

190
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 2>He gets a little more intense about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

191
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.553
<v Speaker 2>a little more upset about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking gets really mad at people </v>

192
00:09:31.601 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 2>on comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucking fights with people online.</v>

193
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 2>They call them a Welsh fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a wheelchair.</v>

194
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 2>He's like super intense.</v>

195
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever switched in it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

196
00:09:40.611 --> 00:09:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Have you done anything more since you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>done this?</v>

197
00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Like are you drinking more coffee </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday,</v>

198
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.950
<v Speaker 3>are you?</v>

199
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm doing so much goddamn yoga that</v>

200
00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 2>because we have this hot yoga challenge </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the hot yoga challenges,</v>

201
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:52.723

<v Speaker 2>Well my dumb ass did one the first week </v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

204
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I've done eight straight days of yoga in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a row as of today.</v>

205
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:07.451
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

206
00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:09.800
<v Speaker 2>And I have four more to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

207
00:10:09.801 --> 00:10:12.720

<v Speaker 2>Black Ford to do though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have until next Tuesday so I </v>

210
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:20.780
<v Speaker 2>could kill it on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Thanksgiving.</v>

211
00:10:20.781 --> 00:10:23.090
<v Speaker 2>The 31st could be my last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to do that.</v>

212
00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:23.924
<v Speaker 2>I'm banging them all out this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing it together for the first </v>

213
00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:26.600
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ari?</v>

214
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Tom Burton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do it together.</v>

215
00:10:28.581 --> 00:10:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to say when,</v>

216
00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:31.790
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want you fucking freak </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing up,</v>

217
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.070
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to do it together one </v>
<v Speaker 2>day this week.</v>

218
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.470
<v Speaker 3>You also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what Tom's biggest problem is.</v>

219
00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:38.780
<v Speaker 3>It's just he's so busy trying to fit in </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

220
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.330
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of do a 90 minute hot yoga,</v>

221
00:10:41.331 --> 00:10:43.310
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was insane because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've never done it.</v>

222
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

223
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Every 90 minutes is a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

224
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I do it every week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I usually only do it once or twice a</v>

225
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.114
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I've done eight fucking days in </v>

226
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.590
<v Speaker 2>a row as of today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rough.</v>

227
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm shredded though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Son.</v>

228
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:57.683
<v Speaker 2>Ken Shredded my bobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm burning off so many fucking </v>

229
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.510
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had blood work done today,</v>

230
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.583
<v Speaker 2>so I'm very interested to see what my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mineral levels are live because I'm </v>

231
00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:09.920
<v Speaker 2>sweating out so much and I'm not really </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplementing minerals that much.</v>

232
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I might have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that on a regular basis,</v>

233
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.090
<v Speaker 2>like every three months I get blood work</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

234
00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:16.040
<v Speaker 2>The sealer where my nutrient levels are.</v>

235
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I just found this company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've heard of it.</v>

236
00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:18.764
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called like simply well and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they have all these DNA tests </v>

237
00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:24.260
<v Speaker 3>that you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I ordered the testosterone test,</v>

238
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.303
<v Speaker 3>but they also have our gi tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have all these tests and they send </v>

239
00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:28.700
<v Speaker 3>it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You spit in a vial,</v>

240
00:11:28.701 --> 00:11:29.900
<v Speaker 3>it takes some hair or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

241
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.150
<v Speaker 3>And then it's kind of like 24 and me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What words?</v>

242
00:11:32.151 --> 00:11:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Like the DNA testing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have it for everything.</v>

243
00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:35.174
<v Speaker 3>Vitamin D deficiencies and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could have it like on a </v>

244
00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:39.410
<v Speaker 3>subscription where you get it done </v>
<v Speaker 3>every.</v>

245
00:11:39.411 --> 00:11:42.170
<v Speaker 3>They send you a new kit every three </v>
<v Speaker 3>months to see if it's changed.</v>

246
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A testosterone.</v>

247
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.770
<v Speaker 3>That's what I got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got it yesterday.</v>

248
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

249
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.560
<v Speaker 2>so to get off this corey feldman thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the end of the day,</v>

250
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

251
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 2>that I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if I disappointed anybody,</v>

252
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just when you,</v>

253
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians try to say fucked up things to</v>

254
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 2>each other and I was talking to Colin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Quinn about this the other night.</v>

255
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Collin was at the comedy store and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>told Carl and I were talking.</v>

256
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:05.861
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

257
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I miss tough crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

258
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I miss it so much.</v>

259
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

260
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 2>We could never fucking do it today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

261
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.053
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think of the things that Patrice and </v>

262
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 2>nick depaulo would say to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

263
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 2>if you did that today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would have riots.</v>

264
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 2>They would be protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would,</v>

265
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 2>they would try to have the show shut </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

266
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Comedy central would freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get fired.</v>

267
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably right.</v>

268
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>But that was like the best show ever on </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy set next to the Chappelle show.</v>

269
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next to South Park.</v>

270
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Park number one,</v>

271
00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number two,</v>

272
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.990
<v Speaker 2>tough crowd number three in my opinion.</v>

273
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.170
<v Speaker 3>South Park still go in for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

274
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't give even the video.</v>

275
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this new video game.</v>

276
00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:43.610
<v Speaker 3>It's called butt hole fractured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whole fractured saw that I saw that,</v>

277
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:44.503
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a part where you're like </v>

278
00:12:46.011 --> 00:12:46.844
<v Speaker 3>these little boys and you're dressed up </v>
<v Speaker 3>as strippers and you're in a strip club </v>

279
00:12:48.831 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 3>getting lapped at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing lap dances for guy,</v>

280
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:55.280
<v Speaker 3>so you're on a guy's junk and rude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a good kid.</v>

281
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

282
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.100
<v Speaker 2>these moments where you fuck up these </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible feelings,</v>

283
00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:03.890
<v Speaker 2>like this is how I'm looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could take it back,</v>

284
00:13:03.891 --> 00:13:04.671
<v Speaker 2>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

285
00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:05.504
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if people are mad at me now because </v>

286
00:13:07.401 --> 00:13:08.420
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

287
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.513
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

288
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to make any excuses for </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

289
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you do have these moments where</v>

290
00:13:15.051 --> 00:13:15.884
<v Speaker 2>you fuck up and you feel terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are an amazing opportunity to </v>

291
00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:21.080
<v Speaker 2>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

292
00:13:21.081 --> 00:13:24.530
<v Speaker 2>And I think people need to look at stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that this way,</v>

293
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.453
<v Speaker 2>or at least I've been looking at stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way for the last like 10 years or </v>

294
00:13:28.521 --> 00:13:29.354
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's made a big impact in my life </v>

295
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.693
<v Speaker 2>because I think regular change happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>in like a regular change and growth </v>

296
00:13:35.511 --> 00:13:40.511
<v Speaker 2>happens in like a grinding slow sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress or progression.</v>

297
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.560
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when something fucked up happens,</v>

298
00:13:45.561 --> 00:13:48.020
<v Speaker 2>when you do something fucked up and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get that terrible feeling,</v>

299
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.393
<v Speaker 2>you have this opportunity for these </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaps of understanding and these bad </v>

300
00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.770
<v Speaker 2>feelings that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

301
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.723
<v Speaker 2>it's a big alarm to let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I was </v>

302
00:13:59.181 --> 00:14:03.920
<v Speaker 2>thinking about is that human beings now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we interact with each other,</v>

303
00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:04.754
<v Speaker 2>like there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of pressure now on people </v>

304
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.800
<v Speaker 2>because it's all this call out culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

305
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.350
<v Speaker 2>people are getting mad that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing dumb shit.</v>

306
00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Like white girls wearing braids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

307
00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:16.470
<v Speaker 2>cultural appropriation that going after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

308
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.540
<v Speaker 2>white guys wearing dreadlocks and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are mad that people are dressing up like</v>

309
00:14:20.541 --> 00:14:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Geishas and they're calling them out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

310
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of silliness to all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

311
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:30.550
<v Speaker 2>but what's interesting about it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is expressing their displeasure</v>

312
00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:32.840
<v Speaker 2>and pleasure of things there.</v>

313
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.683
<v Speaker 2>They're expressing their anger with </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and their happiness with things </v>

314
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.760
<v Speaker 2>at a level we've never seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think people that experienced this</v>

315
00:14:43.761 --> 00:14:46.400
<v Speaker 2>like if it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's one thing if somebody gets mad</v>

316
00:14:46.401 --> 00:14:47.380
<v Speaker 2>at you for something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

317
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.520
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be wearing that blue hat </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

318
00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the crips and you know,</v>

319
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:53.564
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we only support red hats or is it the </v>

320
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 2>bloods?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

321
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I think the bloods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crips or blue,</v>

322
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.960
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone gets mad at you for something</v>

323
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:00.794
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense that stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if someone gets mad at you for </v>

324
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:08.590
<v Speaker 2>poking fun at someone being molested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that bad feeling is valid.</v>

325
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think these bad feelings that like</v>

326
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump must feel 24 slash seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there is probably.</v>

327
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:18.164
<v Speaker 2>I mean part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the reason why he so </v>

328
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.720
<v Speaker 2>angry at people and bitter and barking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fake news.</v>

329
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 2>I think he feels like shit all day long </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

330
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:29.450
<v Speaker 2>this guy checks his twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

331
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 2>he does check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he reads his company,</v>

332
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking ego maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

333
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.900
<v Speaker 2>So he's paying attention to new shows to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk shit about him.</v>

334
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.140
<v Speaker 2>He's paying attention to late night </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians that make jokes about him.</v>

335
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:41.930
<v Speaker 2>He's paying attention to center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't help himself.</v>

336
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:42.973
<v Speaker 2>He's constantly commenting on it and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>hears all these people laughing at him </v>

337
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:46.544
<v Speaker 2>and mocking him and he uses all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that think he's a terrible </v>

338
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:49.424
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read his twitter when he'll put up a </v>

339
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:51.944
<v Speaker 2>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll put up something on twitter and </v>

340
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 2>then I'll read the comments under it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

341
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just go hard at him.</v>

342
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 2>You know that motherfucker reads that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

343
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:01.963
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does and he's also involved in a </v>

344
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:04.274
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>several lawsuits now where he's blocked </v>

345
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:07.604
<v Speaker 2>people on twitter and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>questioning the constitutionality of </v>

346
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:12.854
<v Speaker 2>someone being able to block someone from</v>
<v Speaker 2>commenting whether the president of the </v>

347
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:16.280
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

348
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.113
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a new way to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to hear what people have </v>

349
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 2>to say because it's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

350
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

351
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.900
<v Speaker 2>we're so people are questioning this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>court,</v>

352
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 2>but I think that that feeling that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting this guy,</v>

353
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.410
<v Speaker 2>he might be too old for it and he might </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be ready for it in his he.</v>

354
00:16:31.411 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 2>So he's got so many things wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to begin with.</v>

355
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:34.904
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his,</v>

356
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.870
<v Speaker 2>the way he treats the world and his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ego and the way he's the,</v>

357
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.813
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the non presidential and non statesmen </v>

358
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:43.544
<v Speaker 2>like behavior that people thought was </v>
<v Speaker 2>cute when he was running for office and </v>

359
00:16:46.281 --> 00:16:50.420
<v Speaker 2>the LLC is a giant problem when he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatening war with nuclear weapons,</v>

360
00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:55.250
<v Speaker 2>with Korea and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this thing is a new thing.</v>

361
00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this swarm of bad feeling and in return,</v>

362
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:00.974
<v Speaker 2>good feeling when something good happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a new thing and I think that it's </v>

363
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:05.654
<v Speaker 2>going to shape the way human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with each other in a really </v>

364
00:17:09.441 --> 00:17:10.274
<v Speaker 2>radical way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't think it's ever existed </v>

365
00:17:12.351 --> 00:17:14.030
<v Speaker 2>like this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't</v>

366
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:15.423
<v Speaker 3>really has and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it is if it's a good </v>

367
00:17:16.971 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 3>thing or a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

368
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 3>I forget what I was listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day where when you were a kid,</v>

369
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you used to just go outside,</v>

370
00:17:23.511 --> 00:17:25.250
<v Speaker 3>say bye mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then come back at night,</v>

371
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:26.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's time for dinner,</v>

372
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.490
<v Speaker 3>eat dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you go play some video games,</v>

373
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 3>go to bed now it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication between your mom and stuff</v>

374
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 3>like that is so much more intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Constant.</v>

375
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 3>It's constant all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're not there,</v>

376
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:41.960
<v Speaker 3>you're getting texted by your daughter's</v>
<v Speaker 3>son and it's like constant communication</v>

377
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:44.060
<v Speaker 3>where it's more parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's good.</v>

378
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you facetime with people all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

379
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.573

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

492
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.420
<v Speaker 4>What would it take?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would,</v>

493
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.100
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you be interested in doing?</v>

494
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:29.420
<v Speaker 4>What kind of challenge?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My challenge is I talk,</v>

495
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.363
<v Speaker 4>I've been talking to Hinchcliffe about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and a few other people because one </v>

496
00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:37.921
<v Speaker 4>of the biggest things for a lot of us is</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking and it's cigarettes and uh,</v>

497
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.460
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to get like we had nine</v>
<v Speaker 4>slash 11 last year.</v>

498
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 4>It was supposed to be nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a month notice.</v>

499
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 4>All of us were supposed to click on nine</v>
<v Speaker 4>slash 11.</v>

500
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:49.070
<v Speaker 4>So we went and forget the date said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>click,</v>

501
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.580
<v Speaker 4>click,</v>
<v Speaker 4>click,</v>

502
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.280
<v Speaker 4>let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It comes out of your mind is so simple,</v>

503
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.820
<v Speaker 4>so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're so used to say,</v>

504
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.693
<v Speaker 4>but then I was the only one that did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did it for two days and then everyone </v>

505
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.123
<v Speaker 4>else didn't do it and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking when you're at the commissary </v>

506
00:23:01.571 --> 00:23:02.860
<v Speaker 4>and all your friends are smoking around </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

507
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 4>It's almost fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Tony smokes a lot.</v>

508
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.183
<v Speaker 4>Tony smokes a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people smoke a lot at the </v>

509
00:23:08.021 --> 00:23:09.910
<v Speaker 4>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my whole thing was like,</v>

510
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:10.680
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

511
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.180
<v Speaker 4>let's quit cigarettes and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>seemed down on it.</v>

512
00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.680
<v Speaker 4>Then yesterday I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

513
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 4>we still quitting next month cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

514
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you guys are going to do in November?</v>

515
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.831
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

516
00:23:20.831 --> 00:23:22.660
<v Speaker 4>I was going to try to quit and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well listen,</v>

517
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.613
<v Speaker 4>why don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we set up a chair at least </v>

518
00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:25.720
<v Speaker 4>when I get back from Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ohio.</v>

519
00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:26.554
<v Speaker 4>I'll be there next month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's think of a challenge that you </v>

520
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 4>could do and who would you do it with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need like Tony Hinchcliffe for sure.</v>

521
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.380
<v Speaker 4>No sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

522
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.600
<v Speaker 4>this is you for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No sugar,</v>

523
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.640
<v Speaker 4>no booze,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no cigarettes.</v>

524
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.800
<v Speaker 4>He would lose 30 pounds just doing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>without having cigarettes.</v>

525
00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 4>I'd gained weight because cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually like,</v>

526
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like your heartbeat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

527
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.620
<v Speaker 4>Like when you quit cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start munching more like on food.</v>

528
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:54.703
<v Speaker 4>You use again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of weight if you use it as an </v>

529
00:23:55.941 --> 00:23:58.340
<v Speaker 4>appetite suppressant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use it for breakfast.</v>

530
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it also a stimulant though?</v>

531
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um hmm.</v>

532
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.453
<v Speaker 4>I definitely need to lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also more importantly I want to </v>

533
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:14.130
<v Speaker 4>quit cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the drinking I.</v>

534
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.823
<v Speaker 4>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I quit drinking the other day for </v>

535
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 4>like four days and I smoked while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mean I didn't train for four days.</v>

536
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.050
<v Speaker 4>I smoked weed though instead next day I </v>
<v Speaker 4>had,</v>

537
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.520
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do I have a hangover?</v>

538
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 4>It was a weed hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we'd hang on.</v>

539
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:28.304
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even realize that when you </v>

540
00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:32.030
<v Speaker 4>first start smoking weed used to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>these.</v>

541
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 4>Like the next day you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

542
00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:35.600
<v Speaker 4>I smoke so much weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like dumb or something like that.</v>

543
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.513
<v Speaker 4>The next morning I hadn't had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It had been wild because usually when </v>

544
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:41.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm smoking I'm drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was blamed on the drinking.</v>

545
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Like God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like hungover.</v>

546
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never had a weed hangover.</v>

547
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you're going to have one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you start smoking,</v>

548
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:47.984
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be a so fucking high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to smoke half a joint and </v>

549
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:51.614
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

550
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 4>I want to be handled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm legitimately nervous,</v>

551
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 4>legitimately nervous about smoking pot </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

552
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 4>But here's my real concern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really wondering like,</v>

553
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:01.544
<v Speaker 4>what is going on where I am dreaming so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much more vividly without pot and is </v>

554
00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 4>that a bad thing that I'm not dreaming </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm smoking pot?</v>

555
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:12.260
<v Speaker 4>Like am I somehow or another doing some </v>
<v Speaker 4>damage?</v>

556
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

557
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.940
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for sure that marijuana,</v>

558
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.860
<v Speaker 4>if you smoke a lot of marijuana that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have as good a dreams.</v>

559
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:21.723
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you realize you are not a </v>

560
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 4>neuroscientist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Brian,</v>

561
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Dr Brian here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Red Band.</v>

562
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.440
<v Speaker 4>But what exactly do you think is what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>causing the lack of dreams?</v>

563
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Another thing you might have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

564
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 4>thc in your fat and so you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>thc,</v>

565
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still,</v>

566
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>burning off.</v>

567
00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Especially since you're doing yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably like,</v>

568
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.213
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably still fucking with you a </v>

569
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.300
<v Speaker 4>little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

570
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.163
<v Speaker 4>maybe I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean we got high before most of </v>

571
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 4>the podcasts with comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got high before most comedy shows,</v>

572
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 4>so that's like three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four nights a week at least now I take a</v>

573
00:25:56.091 --> 00:25:58.760
<v Speaker 4>day or two off and it was nothing super </v>
<v Speaker 4>easy to do.</v>

574
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.370
<v Speaker 4>It was never a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I never took a month off.</v>

575
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.640
<v Speaker 4>So when I would take a day or two off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if I go on vacation,</v>

576
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.960
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I went on vacation,</v>

577
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 4>I would take a week off people.</v>

578
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.383
<v Speaker 4>People were mocking me relentlessly </v>
<v Speaker 4>online before I told everybody that I </v>

579
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:12.920
<v Speaker 4>was taking the month off when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>started doing all this.</v>

580
00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Pray for Joe People was going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

581
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

582
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in quotes,</v>

583
00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:20.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't smoke weed on vacation Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

584
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.480
<v Speaker 4>that's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a problem,</v>

585
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just like,</v>

586
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be in Europe or something like that,</v>

587
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't get weed,</v>

588
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:32.690
<v Speaker 4>don't bring it with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't wanna go to jail.</v>

589
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.670
<v Speaker 4>So just don't smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was no problem.</v>

590
00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:36.260
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need pot.</v>

591
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.123
<v Speaker 4>It's not an issue and I don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously I've gone through this whole </v>

592
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.900
<v Speaker 4>month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm really.</v>

593
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm stunned at</v>

594
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.510
<v Speaker 2>the differences in the way I'm dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like stunned.</v>

595
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I never expected it to be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme,</v>

596
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.340
<v Speaker 2>so vivid every night I'm having fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy dreams every night</v>

597
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.343
<v Speaker 4>and they're almost all primal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're almost all like animals and </v>

598
00:27:01.401 --> 00:27:06.401
<v Speaker 4>waterfalls and fucking ocean and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>all a lot of falling,</v>

599
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:07.993
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of like</v>

600
00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 2>balancing on shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Ooh.</v>

601
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.590
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

602
00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:16.360
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about that lately.</v>

603
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.433
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I do too much shit and I never </v>

604
00:27:19.931 --> 00:27:21.310
<v Speaker 2>thought that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought that.</v>

605
00:27:21.311 --> 00:27:25.360
<v Speaker 2>But you would think that like smoking </v>
<v Speaker 2>pot would make you think you're too busy</v>

606
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.320
<v Speaker 2>but not smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me think I'm too busy.</v>

607
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.820
<v Speaker 2>It makes me think that</v>

608
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.630
<v Speaker 4>you're probably thinking clear though in</v>
<v Speaker 4>some ways.</v>

609
00:27:32.631 --> 00:27:34.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind's not fogged with.</v>

610
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:35.421
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

611
00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:39.590
<v Speaker 4>you're overthinking about music instead </v>
<v Speaker 4>of like life,</v>

612
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.940
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

613
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>food does not taste as good.</v>

614
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.440
<v Speaker 4>Tell you the food's way better when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're smoking.</v>

615
00:27:45.441 --> 00:27:47.270
<v Speaker 4>Weed is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Movies aren't as good.</v>

616
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.590
<v Speaker 4>Music doesn't sound as good.</v>

617
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I think the key to it is using it </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally.</v>

618
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think marijuana,</v>

619
00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:57.843
<v Speaker 2>like daily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terence Mckenna talked about this many </v>

620
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.213
<v Speaker 2>years ago and he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a daily smoker and one of the </v>

621
00:28:03.831 --> 00:28:07.880
<v Speaker 2>things that he was saying he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a lecture and he was saying</v>

622
00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:12.881
<v Speaker 2>that the correct way to do marijuana is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to not do it for a long time and then do</v>

623
00:28:12.951 --> 00:28:17.480
<v Speaker 2>as much as you can stand and then just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hold on.</v>

624
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's how he would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would do,</v>

625
00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis when he was doing it correctly,</v>

626
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.410
<v Speaker 2>when he wasn't like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an inveterate daily smoker.</v>

627
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:32.030
<v Speaker 2>He would do it like a psychedelic who </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do it in these big bursts where he</v>

628
00:28:32.031 --> 00:28:32.720
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

629
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.610
<v Speaker 2>and he was recommending like that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to do it.</v>

630
00:28:34.611 --> 00:28:38.810
<v Speaker 2>And that people will think they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what cannabis is if they smoked cannabis</v>

631
00:28:38.811 --> 00:28:39.644
<v Speaker 2>on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really know like the way to </v>

632
00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:45.170
<v Speaker 2>really know what it is is to take a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time off</v>

633
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.290
<v Speaker 4>or obviously eat one of Joey's edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

634
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't do edit was anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing I quit completely.</v>

635
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:51.624
<v Speaker 4>I don't fuck with edibles at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see what happens with </v>

636
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:55.440
<v Speaker 4>Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he took a week off,</v>

637
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.750
<v Speaker 4>a month off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joey would be violent.</v>

638
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.310
<v Speaker 4>He would attack people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

639
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.170
<v Speaker 4>It took a month off of edibles or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

640
00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:02.004
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever give it up for lent choice </v>

641
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 4>about religious?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give it a full month dog.</v>

642
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be here Friday by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>folks.</v>

643
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.123
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

644
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.550
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if he did take a month off,</v>

645
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:16.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean he didn't take a month off weed </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

646
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was just eating it.</v>

647
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He told me that once he told me he was,</v>

648
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.260
<v Speaker 4>I can't do these fucking edibles </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

649
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.790
<v Speaker 4>The too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too Much Joe Rogan.</v>

650
00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking too much.</v>

651
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.270
<v Speaker 4>It's messing me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next time I saw him,</v>

652
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.670
<v Speaker 4>next time I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was down and stars to death.</v>

653
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Literally the next time I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

654

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.020
<v Speaker 4>throwing down to slash 25 milligrams </v>
<v Speaker 4>stars of death.</v>

656
00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are a monster.</v>

657
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 4>You saw the episode</v>

658
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.420
<v Speaker 3>where he passed out right on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>microphone.</v>

659
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even see.</v>

660
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.223
<v Speaker 3>He's looking at life to be like slits </v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's like barely crack in the page </v>

661

<v Speaker 3>of a book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 3>we put the money in and the curtain </v>

666
00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:10.390

<v Speaker 3>masturbating.</v>

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.673
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Felicia did this movie where she asked </v>

<v Speaker 3>shouldn't go and it's so great.</v>

<v Speaker 3>when there's somebody doing that and </v>

674
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:34.490
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of question?</v>

675
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

676
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.813
<v Speaker 3>just like sex questions and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember because it was so long </v>

677
00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:40.360
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot I even did it.</v>

678
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.270
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

679
00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Felicia was on the other day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to Lee on that,</v>

680
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 3>like he's leads never been to a strip </v>
<v Speaker 3>club before,</v>

681
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:49.360
<v Speaker 3>but his little voice when he chimes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

682
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 3>I've never been to a strip club </v>
<v Speaker 3>authority.</v>

683
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Never been scared of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

684
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I want to take that guy to a strict so </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

685
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Why is he scared?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He don't know.</v>

686
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.103
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a money thing because he's </v>

<v Speaker 3>Then they tried to get money that </v>

689
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:09.883
<v Speaker 3>someone told a story recently about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremiah Watkins trying to took them to </v>

690
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:15.090
<v Speaker 3>a strip club and he freaked out and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like ran out the back base.</v>

691
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.260
<v Speaker 3>Same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

692
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.850

<v Speaker 3>doesn't want to go or.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the front.</v>

695
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.270
<v Speaker 3>Never looking up all the way to the pack</v>
<v Speaker 3>out the back door.</v>

696
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

712
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.313

<v Speaker 3>but then every time you talked to them </v>

713
00:32:06.611 --> 00:32:07.211
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

715
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.423
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she was like,</v>

716
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty crazy for hostile.</v>

717
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.730
<v Speaker 3>What about the clientele?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

718
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.290
<v Speaker 3>well they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

719
00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 3>they were mostly there for us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>

720
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.220
<v Speaker 3>George just pretty much we had the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>club board ourselves.</v>

721
00:32:21.221 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 3>I've always all people coming to see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

722
00:32:23.081 --> 00:32:23.914
<v Speaker 3>So it was strippers too though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And strippers to what was the idea that </v>

723
00:32:26.831 --> 00:32:27.664
<v Speaker 3>you would get people in there for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show and then the girls would dance for </v>

724
00:32:29.321 --> 00:32:30.400
<v Speaker 3>them afterwards?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

725
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.263
<v Speaker 3>And while we're doing the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were coming and sitting on table </v>

726
00:32:33.521 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 3>and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to go get him?</v>

727
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:39.690
<v Speaker 3>But sex upstairs just making that up.</v>

728
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.030
<v Speaker 4>Or was it was it was foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever you want.</v>

729
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:49.390
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I even fucking scary.</v>

730
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go to a bad neighborhood,</v>

731
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's levels to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

732
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the levels of stress and pressure that a</v>

733
00:32:58.551 --> 00:32:59.384
<v Speaker 4>check has to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If she's a stripper in a really bad </v>

734
00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how diamonds get developed.</v>

735
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 4>Son Diamonds in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a fluffy pillow,</v>

736
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.843
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna,</v>

737
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.340
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna make a diamond on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tempurpedic mattress.</v>

738
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 4>Fucking pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Serious.</v>

739
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:18.914
<v Speaker 4>Serious pressure man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you see one of the street </v>

740
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:22.214
<v Speaker 4>hookers walking in a bad neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like that's where they all </v>

741
00:33:24.591 --> 00:33:29.591
<v Speaker 4>worked with Tom and Brian Callen met his</v>
<v Speaker 4>ex girlfriend walking the streets.</v>

742
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.270
<v Speaker 4>That was harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

743
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.130
<v Speaker 4>that's when.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you just go,</v>

744
00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:36.220
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

745
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:40.880
<v Speaker 4>He was outside of the coach and horses </v>
<v Speaker 4>on sunset,</v>

746
00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.053
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that place where Stan hope used to love </v>

747
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:43.190
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

748
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:44.420
<v Speaker 4>It's closed now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is it?</v>

749
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:46.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure that's too bad.</v>

750
00:33:46.771 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a good little joint.</v>

751
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 4>I remember Ralphie may rest in peace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

752
00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:56.780
<v Speaker 4>we were supposed to meet Ralphie there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Ralphie showed up an hour later.</v>

753
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

754
00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:02.630
<v Speaker 4>Ralphie look in the backseat and he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>like 13 boxes.</v>

755
00:34:02.631 --> 00:34:04.730
<v Speaker 4>Those Jalapeno poppers from Jack in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>box.</v>

756
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just had gone off on holiday.</v>

757
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:12.541
<v Speaker 4>Pino poppers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Poor Ralphie when he,</v>

758
00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:13.604
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had his stomach stapled and when he </v>

759
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 4>had a stomach stapled for some reason he</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't eat meat.</v>

760
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 4>Like there's something about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>operation they did.</v>

761
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:27.410
<v Speaker 4>It made him have a real issue with meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he still loved to cook it.</v>

762
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.480
<v Speaker 4>So used to barbecue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went over his house once and he,</v>

763
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:33.710
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a fucking killer.</v>

764
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:36.620
<v Speaker 4>Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ralphie makes some barbecue sauce,</v>

765
00:34:36.621 --> 00:34:38.420
<v Speaker 4>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big baby barbecue sauce.</v>

766
00:34:38.421 --> 00:34:39.254
<v Speaker 4>I went to his house and he cooked like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing and got to eating meat </v>

767
00:34:42.711 --> 00:34:43.610
<v Speaker 4>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

768
00:34:43.611 --> 00:34:44.150
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

769
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 4>he got his staples removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he did himself.</v>

770
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 4>He just ate right through those staples.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

771
00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:57.040
<v Speaker 4>He had this idea that he was gonna lose </v>
<v Speaker 4>all this weight and then it,</v>

772
00:34:57.041 --> 00:34:59.480
<v Speaker 4>it did kind of work for like a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>

773
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:04.760
<v Speaker 4>Well the problem was he was so big that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like if he said he lost weight,</v>

774
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:05.421
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

775
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:07.780
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much you know,</v>

776
00:35:07.781 --> 00:35:09.800
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd say he lost 100 pounds and you'd be</v>

777
00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:11.490
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm about.</v>

778
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.340
<v Speaker 4>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to tell.</v>

779
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.750
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you couldn't.</v>

780
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.863
<v Speaker 4>But imagine like how strong his legs </v>
<v Speaker 4>must've been the strongest feet in the </v>

781
00:35:20.091 --> 00:35:20.924
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that guy I could probably kick </v>

782
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:24.140
<v Speaker 4>through a fucking building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about it.</v>

783
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:27.050
<v Speaker 4>Like if he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he's carrying around 500 pounds,</v>

784
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.670
<v Speaker 4>imagine if I took you and I threw 300 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds of weights on your back.</v>

785
00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:32.523
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just walking around with 300 </v>

786
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:36.290
<v Speaker 4>pounds everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be able to do it.</v>

787
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.150
<v Speaker 4>Like I lift weights all the time and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be able to do it.</v>

788
00:35:39.151 --> 00:35:41.360
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck man be.</v>

789
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.480
<v Speaker 4>You'd walk everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buster was giving us cool Ed.</v>

790
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.320
<v Speaker 4>He had those calves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

791
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:49.590
<v Speaker 4>those fat dude calves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did a develop this model.</v>

792
00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 4>But if you could like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the musculature in his legs,</v>

793
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.870
<v Speaker 4>I bet if you get through all the fat and</v>
<v Speaker 4>his arms,</v>

794
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:59.520
<v Speaker 4>his arms like normal size arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I bet he had some jacked fucking Lee</v>

795
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.350
<v Speaker 4>Haney quads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

796
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.720
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that that's a tender </v>
<v Speaker 4>meat down there.</v>

797
00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Like it's weird when you see people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have those big calves,</v>

798
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 4>but they're always blue like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Diabetes legs.</v>

799
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.240
<v Speaker 4>That's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That diabetes blue.</v>

800
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's super common though,</v>

801
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:14.611
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

802
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:15.444
<v Speaker 4>There's a homeless homeless guy by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by my house just hanging out at </v>

803
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 4>starbucks and he hasn't so bad where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's blistered and every time he walks a</v>

804
00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:25.950
<v Speaker 4>little blood squirts often do ribs down </v>

832
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.980
<v Speaker 4>town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi,</v>

833
00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:30.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi Carrie,</v>

834
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 4>you would feel like a homeless guy would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be skinny.</v>

835
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.840
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like the ultimate diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No food,</v>

836
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:40.703
<v Speaker 4>a lot of walking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the only food that we're eating </v>

837
00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:45.290
<v Speaker 4>probably is like fast food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fast food,</v>

838
00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.770
<v Speaker 4>so fucking cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other day.</v>

839
00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:50.350
<v Speaker 4>Arby's has this new steak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should go to Venice,</v>

840
00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.213
<v Speaker 4>Venison Burger or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they have elk only in a couple </v>

841
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.473
<v Speaker 4>places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have venison and a bunch of </v>

842
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:55.620
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

843
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.210
<v Speaker 4>Venison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had it yesterday.</v>

844
00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like having a steak on a on too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

845
00:38:00.091 --> 00:38:02.550
<v Speaker 4>but it was only $5 and it was great.</v>

846
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.470
<v Speaker 4>It was a real life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's venison.</v>

847
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.050
<v Speaker 4>They do these mass executions of deer in</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

848
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.750
<v Speaker 4>some places where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

849
00:38:09.751 --> 00:38:14.220
<v Speaker 4>they have to eradicate these deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to get a little too crazy.</v>

850
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.310
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that's probably where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're getting some of their meat from.</v>

851
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:19.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's lonely for a limited time.</v>

852
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.800
<v Speaker 4>Only in limited places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you can only hunt them for so long.</v>

853
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:23.663
<v Speaker 4>Like if it's in during hunting season,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not allowed to sell it </v>

854
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:27.270
<v Speaker 4>commercially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like hunting meat.</v>

855
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can buy farm raised deer,</v>

856
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.370
<v Speaker 4>they might have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think like a,</v>

857
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:34.343
<v Speaker 4>I think it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it's illegal to sell </v>

858
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 4>wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like to actually sell it,</v>

859
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:40.120
<v Speaker 4>sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you could sell the meat,</v>

860
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.530
<v Speaker 4>but I have some for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have my,</v>

861
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.160
<v Speaker 4>I have elk Jerky for you.</v>

863
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 4>I have elk Salami for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that one thing you made me that</v>

<v Speaker 4>That was wild boar.</v>

866
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.733

<v Speaker 4>Wild pig is so and wild pig is very </v>

867
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 4>sustainable.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he released a bunch of wild boars,</v>

890
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:57.483
<v Speaker 4>Eurasian bores all over the backyard so </v>
<v Speaker 4>we could just hunt them and shoot them </v>

891
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:01.383
<v Speaker 4>because he was just crazy rich asshole </v>
<v Speaker 4>and those motherfuckers populated the </v>

00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 4>entire northern California region.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he lived in big Sur.</v>

894
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.100
<v Speaker 4>He used to go hunt wild boars with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine gun.</v>

895
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.520
<v Speaker 4>There's like a famous classic picture of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hunter s Thompson holding a knife and an</v>

896
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:21.783
<v Speaker 4>AK 47 while there's a wild boar that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging from his back legs and he's </v>

897
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:27.490
<v Speaker 4>cutting it open and about to cook.</v>

1055
00:47:00.391 --> 00:47:01.224
<v Speaker 4>but the Stevia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm pretty sure we should have </v>

1062
00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:18.630
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy was crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He was a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1064
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.493
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had some awesome videos of him snort </v>

1065
00:47:23.211 --> 00:47:24.044
<v Speaker 4>and Stevia talking about Stevia burns </v>
<v Speaker 4>off calories and it gives you muscles </v>

1066
00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.690
<v Speaker 4>route here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1067
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.750
<v Speaker 4>we got root beer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>soda.</v>

1068
00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.840
<v Speaker 4>This is zero calories and it's sweetened</v>
<v Speaker 4>with Stevia and it's like a lacroix with</v>

1069
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 4>that tastes better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grapefruit citrus.</v>

1070
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.620
<v Speaker 4>People going to think this is some </v>
<v Speaker 4>really fucking low level,</v>

1071
00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:42.454
<v Speaker 4>sketchy commercial man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I wasn't wearing my me undies right </v>

1072
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:45.604
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1073
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 4>Well if you just go to stamps.com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1074
00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:53.240
<v Speaker 4>It tastes like root beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.480
<v Speaker 4>Legit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1076
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.880
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything wrong with Stevia?</v>

1077
00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:01.480
<v Speaker 4>We need to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there was something recently</v>

1078
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does Stevia kill you?</v>

1079
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.433
<v Speaker 4>My Dad still on the thing where if it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>any kind of artificial sweetener and </v>

1080
00:48:08.731 --> 00:48:11.780
<v Speaker 4>your brain thinks it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it releases chemicals unnecessarily.</v>

1081
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.240
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't have any where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he says it's still bad for you.</v>

1082
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:16.870
<v Speaker 4>Any artificial sweeteners?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1083
00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:18.890
<v Speaker 4>So this isn't an artificial sweetener in</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1084
00:48:18.891 --> 00:48:22.150
<v Speaker 4>I just know Stevia is with the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why that was a little green leaf.</v>

1085
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.180
<v Speaker 4>That's what Stevie it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but isn't it your brain think like,</v>

1086
00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:26.140
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is sugar though.</v>

1087
00:48:26.141 --> 00:48:27.610
<v Speaker 4>It tastes like sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1088
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:30.410
<v Speaker 4>Maybe your brain dust.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My sleeping,</v>

1089
00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.220
<v Speaker 4>my brain smart enough to know my brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>

1090
00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Yo bro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fake,</v>

1091
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:37.090
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't fake sugar bro.</v>

1092
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:38.583
<v Speaker 4>Don't get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a real coke the other day by </v>

1093
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:42.250
<v Speaker 4>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1094
00:48:42.251 --> 00:48:43.084

<v Speaker 4>was late at night and I was fucking </v>

1095
00:48:45.761 --> 00:48:47.050

<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1096
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 4>I've worked all day and I've worked out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was just like,</v>

1097
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:51.070
<v Speaker 4>I just need to get a fucking burger king</v>
<v Speaker 4>or not.</v>

1098
00:48:51.071 --> 00:48:52.960

1099
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:53.933

1100
00:48:57.161 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 4>hooked me up with a regular coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Please do.</v>

1101
00:48:58.631 --> 00:49:00.220
<v Speaker 4>That shit pisses me off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's still good.</v>

1102
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 4>It was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had a regular coke and years.</v>

1103
00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.840
<v Speaker 4>I treat myself once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get a little Mexican coke.</v>

1104
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.630
<v Speaker 4>I went to in and out the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am not on board within an hour.</v>

1105
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna get shit on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's wrong with you?</v>

1106
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:17.010
<v Speaker 4>It it in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cigarettes killed your fucking teeth,</v>

1107
00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.930
<v Speaker 4>but you got to Wendy's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so much better.</v>

1108
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.750
<v Speaker 4>What if you have a group?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a burger from in and out,</v>

1109
00:49:22.751 --> 00:49:23.584
<v Speaker 4>in a burger from Wendy's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have Chinese tastes a million times </v>

1110
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:26.284
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are.</v>

1111
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:31.030
<v Speaker 4>You definitely have fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a show called good mythical.</v>

1112
00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:32.710
<v Speaker 4>What he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what you're saying.</v>

1113
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.573
<v Speaker 4>There's a show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really think that Wendy's is better </v>

1114
00:49:34.751 --> 00:49:36.360
<v Speaker 4>than in and out a million times better </v>
<v Speaker 4>than it.</v>

1115
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:39.880
<v Speaker 4>That's a million million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't trust you with anything from now</v>

1116
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:40.714
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1117
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.220
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're from California though.</v>

1118
00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:43.420
<v Speaker 4>So you grew up on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in and out,</v>

1119
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.210
<v Speaker 4>but most of your life is spent here in </v>
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>

1120
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:47.343
<v Speaker 4>I just used it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Columbus bias on Wendy's though from </v>

1121
00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:52.120
<v Speaker 4>where we were from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean it's better.</v>

1122
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:52.963
<v Speaker 4>True from California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You all getting to know I would love to </v>

1123
00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:56.880
<v Speaker 4>take five guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1124
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:57.783
<v Speaker 4>all the burger places that we know of </v>
<v Speaker 4>and have a taste test with blind taste </v>

1125
00:50:01.351 --> 00:50:02.184
<v Speaker 4>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you tell me which one's the best </v>

1126
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:08.310
<v Speaker 4>night out will be nowhere close to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys with Bacon and Jalapenos would.</v>

1127
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 4>But fuck all the rest of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just said it.</v>

1128
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.830
<v Speaker 4>Five guys is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked it.</v>

1129
00:50:13.831 --> 00:50:17.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the fries as much as I see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got a problem with your face.</v>

1130
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:18.723
<v Speaker 4>Fat Burger's really way up there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>many of them to come to compare their </v>

1131
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:23.403
<v Speaker 4>taste wise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just one like a mile away from </v>

1132
00:50:25.391 --> 00:50:25.841
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1133
00:50:25.841 --> 00:50:29.120
<v Speaker 4>But I mean there's just not tons of them</v>
<v Speaker 4>all around the world and country.</v>

1134
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:30.680
<v Speaker 4>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty good.</v>

1135
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 4>Really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They give you frozen meat.</v>

1136
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:33.853
<v Speaker 4>I think it's frozen meat that they cook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that's that big of a </v>

1137
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:37.161
<v Speaker 4>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what,</v>

1138
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:39.250
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole frozen versus</v>

1139
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.133
<v Speaker 2>this is fresh argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the real thing is like when you </v>

1140
00:50:42.091 --> 00:50:42.924
<v Speaker 2>cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to cook it like right there and </v>

1141
00:50:44.401 --> 00:50:45.234
<v Speaker 2>then you know like right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the problem with a lot of these </v>

1142
00:50:46.891 --> 00:50:47.390
<v Speaker 2>fast food</v>

1143
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.800
<v Speaker 4>places that didn't have that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1144
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:49.634
<v Speaker 4>Cook way in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just nuke them and then hand them </v>

1145
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 4>to your microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Burger King says flame broiled,</v>

1146
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 4>but you know what they do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They flame broil it.</v>

1147
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.753
<v Speaker 4>Then they put it in a pan with all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>beef juice and they just let sit it in </v>

1148
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:00.200
<v Speaker 4>this pan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like kind of like a caterer,</v>

1149
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.150
<v Speaker 4>like when you go to catering where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>just pull it out.</v>

1150
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.840
<v Speaker 4>It's discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1151
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:07.770
<v Speaker 4>the grossest burger you'll ever have in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your life is Carl's Jr.</v>

1152
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:12.770
<v Speaker 4>Grassfed burger at some time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you'll throw it out your window made</v>

1153
00:51:12.771 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 4>me sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How disGusting it was.</v>

1154
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:15.643
<v Speaker 4>Establishing lawsuits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people are big fans of </v>

1155
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 4>water burger when we talk about in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

1156
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:20.503
<v Speaker 4>like where they have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think like Texas is a big place where </v>

1157
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.870
<v Speaker 4>I went to burger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're all Texas doubt.</v>

1158
00:51:23.871 --> 00:51:26.600
<v Speaker 4>They've got a fucking big belt buckle </v>
<v Speaker 4>and cow horns on their front.</v>

1159
00:51:26.601 --> 00:51:27.434
<v Speaker 4>Cadillac had a burger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>delicious fucking mind by the spicy </v>

1160
00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:32.980
<v Speaker 4>ketchup from amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the best ever have.</v>

1161
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 4>But you buy water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>burger,</v>

1162
00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:36.831
<v Speaker 4>burger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spicy,</v>

1163
00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:37.940
<v Speaker 4>ketchup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazon,</v>

1164
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:43.220
<v Speaker 4>I'll buy you say it's fucking the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>catch up in the rod of burgers.</v>

1165
00:51:43.221 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

1166
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:45.980
<v Speaker 2>maybe be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say no if I was hungry,</v>

1167
00:51:45.981 --> 00:51:48.800
<v Speaker 2>But it cannot fuck with five guys are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and out.</v>

1168
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Let's do a taste test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1169
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with steve?</v>

1170
00:51:51.911 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 2>You?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1171
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Stevie is short for stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reb bod deanna,</v>

1172
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.573
<v Speaker 2>a plant from the chrysanthemum family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which grows in parts of Brazil and </v>

1173
00:52:03.021 --> 00:52:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Paraguay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The compound that makes the stevia sugar</v>

1174
00:52:05.411 --> 00:52:07.730
<v Speaker 2>is extracted from the leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's used in the uae,</v>

1175
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:09.200
<v Speaker 2>east asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

1176
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.511
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1177
00:52:09.511 --> 00:52:09.771
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1178
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:10.604
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's about 200 to 300 times sweeter </v>

1179
00:52:12.351 --> 00:52:14.060
<v Speaker 2>than sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1180
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:16.100
<v Speaker 2>When did the fda approve it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 19 nineties,</v>

1181
00:52:16.101 --> 00:52:21.020
<v Speaker 2>fda rejected stevia as a food ingredient</v>
<v Speaker 2>after research linked it to reproductive</v>

1182
00:52:21.021 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 2>problems and possible genetic mutations </v>
<v Speaker 2>in rats.</v>

1183
00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:27.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a rat.</v>

1184
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:29.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1185
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:30.194
<v Speaker 2>in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fda approved a specific formula of </v>

1186
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:38.470
<v Speaker 2>pure stevia rebar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The said,</v>

1187
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I would say that owes side a pure via.</v>

1188
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.840
<v Speaker 2>And truvia both contain the reb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a version of stevia,</v>

1189
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.793
<v Speaker 2>which is fda approved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fda recommended daily dose is no </v>

1190
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:58.100
<v Speaker 2>more than one point three milligrams per</v>
<v Speaker 2>kilogram of body weight.</v>

1191
00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.113
<v Speaker 2>For healthy adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to have at least 29 truvia </v>

1192
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:07.010
<v Speaker 2>packets a day to exceed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do the experts say if you're stevia</v>

1193
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:09.530
<v Speaker 2>isn't made from reb a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>

1194
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.573
<v Speaker 2>the whole leaf extract that's sold at </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural food markets and labeled as a </v>

1195
00:53:13.851 --> 00:53:17.270
<v Speaker 2>dietary supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't been vetted for safety by the fda</v>

1196
00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.613
<v Speaker 2>for truvia and pure via.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fda concluded with reasonable </v>

1197
00:53:21.441 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 2>certainty that renee is not harmful </v>
<v Speaker 2>under its intended of use</v>

1198
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:31.460
<v Speaker 4>based on studies it looked at concerning</v>
<v Speaker 4>reproductive blood pressure and toxicity</v>

1199
00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:32.454
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>AltHough scientific studies in 1960 and </v>

1200
00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:35.754
<v Speaker 4>19 eighties found that stevia derived </v>
<v Speaker 4>products decreased fertility and female </v>

1201
00:53:40.261 --> 00:53:45.261
<v Speaker 4>rats feed at the church full of loads </v>
<v Speaker 4>and potentially lead to mutations.</v>

1202
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.863
<v Speaker 4>The fda concluded that those problems </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't apply to a based on additional </v>

1203
00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:53.274
<v Speaker 4>research that's one paid off the problem</v>
<v Speaker 4>with those fucking I don't trust any </v>

1204
00:53:56.731 --> 00:54:01.230
<v Speaker 4>studies from back in the day anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After that sugar study got exposed where</v>

1205
00:54:01.231 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 4>you found out from the New York times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did this whole expo say on how the sugar</v>

1206
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:09.540
<v Speaker 4>industry bribed all these scientists to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say that sugar is not bad for you,</v>

1207
00:54:09.541 --> 00:54:12.530
<v Speaker 4>it's a saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

1208
00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.533
<v Speaker 4>although they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pushed all the blame on heart </v>

1209
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:17.280
<v Speaker 4>attacks and heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat.</v>

1210
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:18.960
<v Speaker 4>So it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this,</v>

1211
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.823
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell what they're pretty much </v>

1212
00:54:22.231 --> 00:54:27.231
<v Speaker 4>saying is like the whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pure extracted stevia plants are not</v>

1213
00:54:27.511 --> 00:54:30.400
<v Speaker 4>good for you or they're saying it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>fda have to,</v>

1214
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:31.200
<v Speaker 4>hasn't been vetted.</v>

1215
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.840
<v Speaker 4>That's thE stuff that we put in coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was also a four year old article.</v>

1216
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1217
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.420
<v Speaker 4>they're jones.com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which seemed like a good place,</v>

1218
00:54:36.421 --> 00:54:37.254
<v Speaker 4>but it was mother jones is a good place </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have stinky feet and you're like </v>

1219
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:42.470
<v Speaker 4>wearing birkenstocks and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have wouldn't beads.</v>

1220
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Mother jones is a good magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're super left wing hippie.</v>

1221
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:51.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they're right though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might be right.</v>

1222
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.640
<v Speaker 4>Makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:54.990
<v Speaker 4>I was just looking for some fda results </v>
<v Speaker 4>on that.</v>

1224
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:57.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no biological free rides.</v>

1225
00:54:57.841 --> 00:54:59.550
<v Speaker 4>If you talked to the doctors to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1226
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:02.730
<v Speaker 4>there's something probably going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1227
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:05.040
<v Speaker 4>like I used to think that advil was </v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

1228
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.530
<v Speaker 4>I think that advil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

1229
00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.383
<v Speaker 4>no problem with advil until dr rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patrick explained to me about strokes </v>

1230
00:55:10.261 --> 00:55:11.094
<v Speaker 4>and fucking the heart attacks and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of crazy shit that you can get </v>

1231
00:55:13.681 --> 00:55:15.480
<v Speaker 4>from consuming advil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>advil,</v>

1232
00:55:15.481 --> 00:55:16.650
<v Speaker 4>the thing that you're supposed to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

1233
00:55:16.651 --> 00:55:17.940
<v Speaker 4>if you're having a heart attack.</v>

1234
00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.310
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to ask for aspIrin.</v>

1235
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.080
<v Speaker 4>Aspirin and supposedly prevents heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacks,</v>

1236
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:27.620
<v Speaker 4>but I wonder why like do you think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it something in the aspirin?</v>

1237
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.910
<v Speaker 4>If I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she probably googled.</v>

1238
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.100
<v Speaker 4>I think it comes from the bark of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tree.</v>

1239
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.533
<v Speaker 4>I think actual aspirin is an extraction </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a plant extraction and somehow or </v>

1240
00:55:39.031 --> 00:55:39.864
<v Speaker 4>another aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it does reduce inflammation is </v>

1241
00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:45.510
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be good for people that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>heart problems.</v>

1242
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:46.613
<v Speaker 4>Aspirin blocks an enzyme called cyclo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oxy jennay's that makes your body less </v>

1243
00:55:53.431 --> 00:55:56.010
<v Speaker 4>likely to produce chemicals that can </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause inflammation.</v>

1244
00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:57.643
<v Speaker 4>It helps prevent blood clots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's important because they clog the </v>

1245
00:55:59.971 --> 00:56:02.940
<v Speaker 4>arteries and blink bring blood to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart muscles in the brain,</v>

1246
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:05.010
<v Speaker 4>which increases your risk of heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack and stroke,</v>

1247
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.113
<v Speaker 4>so a aspirin blocks that enzyme and </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you less likely to have heart </v>

1248
00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:12.180
<v Speaker 4>attacks and stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty bad ass,</v>

1249
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.660
<v Speaker 4>but what is aspirin from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>where does aspirin come from?</v>

1250
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.140
<v Speaker 4>Is aspirin safe to take a vitamin every </v>
<v Speaker 4>day?</v>

1251
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 4>Actually encourage you to take aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what else can be done</v>

1252
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:29.130
<v Speaker 2>that could probably mimic the effects </v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you talk to people that really</v>

1253
00:56:29.471 --> 00:56:30.304
<v Speaker 2>understand like health ailments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the big things they all seem to </v>

1254
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:35.194
<v Speaker 2>bring up is inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like inflammation is like one of the </v>

1255
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 2>number one sources of malaise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you say that?</v>

1256
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:46.621
<v Speaker 2>Malaise disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a massive issues.</v>

1257
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Health health issues that people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>

1258
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:53.020
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think is a huge factor in cancer.</v>

1259
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Huge factor in heart attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strokes,</v>

1260
00:56:55.301 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An inflammation is just fucking bad.</v>

1261
00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Like anytime you're eating inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods,</v>

1262
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.433
<v Speaker 2>that's the big problem with sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the big problem with refined </v>

1263
00:57:04.931 --> 00:57:05.764
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates is that they produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation in people like a lot of </v>

1264
00:57:08.681 --> 00:57:10.690
<v Speaker 2>people that have like joint problems and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

1265
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 2>they go on a low carbohydrate diet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other joint problems go away.</v>

1266
00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ankles and shit.</v>

1267
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.733
<v Speaker 2>While a lot of people have found that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just changing your diet makes that </v>

1268
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:23.150
<v Speaker 2>go away because a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation is just the.</v>

1269
00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Your body just not responding very well </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your diet.</v>

1270
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:27.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1271
00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.270
<v Speaker 4>But that's different people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what does it say?</v>

1272
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:31.400
<v Speaker 4>Anything about it being from a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1273
00:57:31.401 --> 00:57:32.830
<v Speaker 4>I made it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it's.</v>

1274
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:34.220
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

1275
00:57:34.221 --> 00:57:37.940
<v Speaker 4>I've heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something that sounds familiar,</v>

1276
00:57:37.941 --> 00:57:39.260
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know if it was aspirin or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

1277
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:41.270
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does it say it's comes from?</v>

1278
00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:44.610
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just a chemical compound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think acid tilak acid,</v>

<v Speaker 4>how to make like pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

00:59:14.421 --> 00:59:16.400
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm diseased right now.</v>

1313
00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 3>We played the video a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1314
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Of what?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Your rat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We showed dreaming of your ra.</v>

1316
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Did we play with the screaming one that </v>
<v Speaker 3>found the link late to like later.</v>

1317
00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:41.744
<v Speaker 3>And we lived on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian caught a rat in a trap and set up </v>

1318
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:48.230
<v Speaker 3>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you what happened.</v>

1319
00:59:48.231 --> 00:59:49.640
<v Speaker 3>The second part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

1320
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:50.653
<v Speaker 3>So there's two rats were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One the second one with the video with </v>

1321
00:59:53.061 --> 00:59:56.600
<v Speaker 3>the screaming one escaped for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't see it.</v>

1322
00:59:56.601 --> 00:59:57.434
<v Speaker 3>All my cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have like all these night vision </v>

1323
00:59:58.221 --> 00:59:58.760
<v Speaker 3>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1324
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.700
<v Speaker 3>well it must have ran away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1325
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:03.080
<v Speaker 3>so I took all my traps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting them underneath the sink.</v>

1326
01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:03.914
<v Speaker 3>What am I traps was a electrocute </v>
<v Speaker 3>electric one when they walk in and they </v>

1327
01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:08.420
<v Speaker 3>get electrocuted.</v>

1328
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:10.540
<v Speaker 3>So I put that in underneath this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

1329
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 3>cut to three months later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It smelled like death in my kitchen.</v>

1330
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.500
<v Speaker 3>You've smelled death before and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1331
01:00:15.501 --> 01:00:16.490
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that?</v>

1332
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.863
<v Speaker 3>Sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I opened it up and I see this flashing </v>

1333
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:22.370
<v Speaker 3>red light is the rat had gone into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>electricity thing.</v>

1334
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Electrocuted himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been there for three months,</v>

1335
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.420
<v Speaker 3>went in there after after a must have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must have been injured in my,</v>

1336
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.530
<v Speaker 3>underneath my sink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might have been injured.</v>

1337
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.110
<v Speaker 3>It's the same rat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1338
01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I had so many cameras that I,</v>

1339
01:00:37.861 --> 01:00:41.060
<v Speaker 3>I could tell there was one bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pregnant one that we killed first.</v>

1340
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.133
<v Speaker 3>Then there was the father or the husband</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like it was like two different </v>

1341
01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:47.000
<v Speaker 3>sizes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One was like,</v>

1342
01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:49.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crazy big one was smaller,</v>

1343
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:53.390
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I look and I see this rat tail coming</v>

1344
01:00:53.391 --> 01:00:55.400
<v Speaker 3>out and it smelled like death right when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I opened up the thing.</v>

1345
01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:56.523
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>luckily I'm dating an asian who eats </v>

1346
01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.970
<v Speaker 3>fish eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

1347
01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.110
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get that outta here.</v>

1348
01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.130
<v Speaker 3>So he made her do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1349
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:02.270
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She does.</v>

1350
01:01:02.271 --> 01:01:07.000
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has no emotion about death fishing.</v>

1351
01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:12.380
<v Speaker 3>And so she takes it out and she puts it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the trashcan.</v>

1352
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.273
<v Speaker 3>Like I just told her to throw the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing away and we're not going to reuse </v>

1353
01:01:14.751 --> 01:01:15.584
<v Speaker 3>that electricity thing and it fell out </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the trashcan and bust open and all </v>

1354
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:21.800
<v Speaker 3>these maggots just come out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1355
01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.530
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of maggots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a burst open.</v>

1356
01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:26.570
<v Speaker 3>Like the skin just couldn't take it </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1357
01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.580
<v Speaker 3>She'd take pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1358
01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:31.130
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she did.</v>

1359
01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I was freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She definitely take pictures of it now.</v>

1360
01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:35.980
<v Speaker 3>The rats back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New grad.</v>

1361
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you you probably had a ton </v>
<v Speaker 3>of rats living in your house.</v>

1362
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:40.743
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>

1363
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:41.783
<v Speaker 3>we figured we got the exterminator out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have one of those crawl spaces </v>

1364
01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.310
<v Speaker 3>underneath my house and the whole house </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been,</v>

1365
01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:47.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gritted up so there's no rats can get </v>

1366
01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:49.604
<v Speaker 3>inside.</v>

1367
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:50.503
<v Speaker 3>So how they're getting in was confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone found out her stupid ass </v>

1368
01:01:53.511 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 3>neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1369
01:01:54.621 --> 01:01:57.560
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rat chewed through my screen in the back</v>

1370
01:01:57.561 --> 01:02:01.910
<v Speaker 3>of my house the other a couple months </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and he has a cat,</v>

1371
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.030
<v Speaker 3>so they've been coming in his house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going in his kitchen,</v>

1372
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 3>going underneath the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going out into my house.</v>

1373
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:08.624
<v Speaker 3>So he just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he didn't tell us that he has a </v>

1374
01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:12.980
<v Speaker 3>big hole in his back fucking screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>make,</v>

1429
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.493

<v Speaker 4>a screen and they put a fish down and </v>

1430
01:04:37.681 --> 01:04:40.410
<v Speaker 4>then they put the screen on top of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they bury it and they're.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like not a screen.</v>

1434
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.850

<v Speaker 4>is in between the sticks,</v>

1435
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:48.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:51.870
<v Speaker 4>it basically just holds the fish in </v>
<v Speaker 4>place while they cook it over the fire.</v>

1437
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.230

<v Speaker 4>these giant fucking trenchless.</v>

1438
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.290

<v Speaker 4>private jet really that you can print </v>
<v Speaker 4>out private jets through an app.</v>

1605
01:12:13.351 --> 01:12:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Now I think it's still pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive.</v>

1606
01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:19.710
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called jet smarter jet.</v>

1607
01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:20.544
<v Speaker 4>Set it the one here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can only just go to like san </v>

1608
01:12:22.201 --> 01:12:24.840
<v Speaker 4>francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegas and maybe like oakland,</v>

1609
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.920
<v Speaker 4>but it's cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cheap.</v>

1610
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:27.440
<v Speaker 4>It's super 200 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>250 bucks,</v>

1611
01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.640
<v Speaker 4>250 bucks to go to vegas on a private </v>
<v Speaker 4>jet.</v>

1612
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:31.350
<v Speaker 4>And you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could rent out the whole jet,</v>

1613
01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:32.373
<v Speaker 4>just your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to reserve it in time and make </v>

1614
01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:34.704
<v Speaker 4>sure there's only after um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the vegas massacre tickets for </v>

1615
01:12:39.571 --> 01:12:43.350
<v Speaker 4>like 70 bucks you have to vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how does that work?</v>

1616
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:46.500
<v Speaker 4>Does the airline just decide?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to vegas.</v>

1617
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:48.130
<v Speaker 4>We need to make it cheap and easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1618
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:51.200
<v Speaker 4>Where do they go in cahoots with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>casinos?</v>

1619
01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Like I just happened fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1620
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.353
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if they're in cahoots with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>casinos Because here's one thing that I </v>

1621
01:12:55.831 --> 01:12:58.350
<v Speaker 4>noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't get a late night flight out of</v>

1622
01:12:58.351 --> 01:12:59.950
<v Speaker 4>vegas.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1625
01:13:03.361 --> 01:13:06.750
<v Speaker 4>I think that's because of noise order or</v>
<v Speaker 4>like same with burbank.</v>

1626
01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:09.630
<v Speaker 4>you can't fly out or las vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Noisy fan.</v>

1634
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:30.470

<v Speaker 4>now he's dead,</v>

1642
01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:51.050

1645
01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:58.373
<v Speaker 4>He's kind of a truther.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a vegas truth or there's reporters </v>

1646
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:02.400

<v Speaker 4>I don't need to do that job for them.</v>

1647
01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.010
<v Speaker 4>They're looking into what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a second gunman.</v>

1648
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:05.873
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>third,</v>

1649
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:06.743
<v Speaker 4>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fourth.</v>

1650
01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.170
<v Speaker 4>The team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just say this.</v>

1651
01:14:10.171 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 4>Much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was happening.</v>

1652
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 4>I was</v>

1653
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.813
<v Speaker 2>listening to the police scanner audio </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just following along the </v>

1654
01:14:14.441 --> 01:14:16.690
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story changed and I had questions on</v>

1655
01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:18.010
<v Speaker 2>why it changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems super normal.</v>

1656
01:14:18.011 --> 01:14:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Sitting around listening to police get </v>
<v Speaker 2>her audio.</v>

1657
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean multiple shooters from multiple</v>

1658
01:14:21.521 --> 01:14:22.420
<v Speaker 2>hotels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1659
01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:23.254
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because he was shooting towards </v>

1660
01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:27.040
<v Speaker 2>multiple hotels and then shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight towards that,</v>

1661
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.313
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some reports of people </v>

1662
01:14:30.761 --> 01:14:34.360

<v Speaker 2>New York and.</v>

1663
01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:37.120
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take into consideration.</v>

1664
01:14:37.121 --> 01:14:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Whenever there's a mass shooting like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like this guy</v>

1717
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.843
<v Speaker 4>had this history of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had planned this out and apparently </v>

1718
01:17:13.491 --> 01:17:14.324
<v Speaker 4>gone to several music festivals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking hotel rooms overlooking the </v>

1719
01:17:17.061 --> 01:17:17.894
<v Speaker 4>arena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably plot it out in his head when </v>

1720
01:17:20.061 --> 01:17:21.400
<v Speaker 4>they found a note,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people would.</v>

1721
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:24.800
<v Speaker 4>The notes say with the note was </v>
<v Speaker 4>ballistic calculations.</v>

1722
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:27.980
<v Speaker 4>He was doinG ballistic calculations like</v>
<v Speaker 4>drop a bullets,</v>

1723
01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:31.100
<v Speaker 4>like you know you're shooting someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're,</v>

1724
01:17:31.101 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're at a certain distance,</v>

1725
01:17:32.931 --> 01:17:37.931
<v Speaker 4>like some hunters have like a sheet of </v>
<v Speaker 4>paper that they put on their rifle sight</v>

1726
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:42.530
<v Speaker 4>and the rifle site it'll say like at </v>
<v Speaker 4>this in a hold here,</v>

1727
01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:44.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at 500 yards,</v>

1728
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.720
<v Speaker 4>turn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn to seven or six or whatever,</v>

1729
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:51.830
<v Speaker 4>whatever they've calibrated as this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>had those calculations written down on a</v>

1730
01:17:51.831 --> 01:17:54.590
<v Speaker 4>piece of paper while he was gunning </v>
<v Speaker 4>people down out the window,</v>

1731
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:56.263
<v Speaker 4>straight up psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just hard to believe that that's a real </v>

1732
01:17:59.031 --> 01:17:59.864
<v Speaker 4>person and if you believe a people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are quote unquote experts in these sort </v>

1733
01:18:05.571 --> 01:18:08.780
<v Speaker 4>of Mass killings and these psychological</v>
<v Speaker 4>outbursts,</v>

1734
01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:10.893
<v Speaker 4>they think that they come in clusters </v>
<v Speaker 4>that like this happens and then someone </v>

1735
01:18:13.881 --> 01:18:16.700
<v Speaker 4>decided that I want to be the next guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they do it somewhere else.</v>

1736
01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.470
<v Speaker 7>So think about that</v>

1737
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:24.343
<v Speaker 4>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The day of case stuff didn't come out </v>

1738
01:18:26.381 --> 01:18:26.771
<v Speaker 4>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1739
01:18:26.771 --> 01:18:29.730
<v Speaker 4>That's supposed to dump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or clInton trump.</v>

1740
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:31.180
<v Speaker 4>Trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess supporting it.</v>

1741
01:18:31.181 --> 01:18:33.250
<v Speaker 4>He's gonna release it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course they try to kill him.</v>

1742
01:18:33.251 --> 01:18:34.084
<v Speaker 4>Pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing they trying to kill </v>

1743
01:18:35.201 --> 01:18:36.034
<v Speaker 4>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's going to show </v>

1744
01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:37.720
<v Speaker 4>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1745
01:18:37.721 --> 01:18:39.100
<v Speaker 4>I think someone's trying to kill trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1746
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:42.790
<v Speaker 4>Do you think if you had to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't anyone ever.</v>

1747
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:44.890
<v Speaker 4>Every president is probably always </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting threatened,</v>

1748
01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:45.913
<v Speaker 4>but not just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think there's ever been a like a </v>

1749
01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:50.350
<v Speaker 4>meeting where they got behind closed </v>
<v Speaker 4>doors,</v>

1750
01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.510
<v Speaker 4>like some shadow government type shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they said,</v>

1751
01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.440
<v Speaker 4>do we do this or what do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you want to do this?</v>

1752
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:58.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing?</v>

1753
01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:01.400
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's talking about the c,</v>

1754
01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:02.283
<v Speaker 4>the he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>

1755
01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:03.123
<v Speaker 4>There was like a recent thing where he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was blaming the fbI for something about </v>

1756
01:19:07.331 --> 01:19:12.331
<v Speaker 4>Russia saying the fbi was involved in </v>
<v Speaker 4>suppressing inflammation and everybody's</v>

1757
01:19:12.371 --> 01:19:13.204
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you understand that the president of </v>

1758
01:19:14.381 --> 01:19:18.130
<v Speaker 4>the United States is questioning the </v>
<v Speaker 4>integrity of the intelligence community?</v>

1759
01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.930
<v Speaker 4>Like how crazy that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't trust them or whatever.</v>

1760
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:24.370
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't trust the three letter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he loves to do that though.</v>

1761
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:28.810
<v Speaker 4>He loves to make everyone else seem </v>
<v Speaker 4>untrustworthy.</v>

1762
01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His thing is about fake news,</v>

1763
01:19:31.841 --> 01:19:34.150
<v Speaker 4>the failing New York times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fake news,</v>

1764
01:19:34.151 --> 01:19:34.984
<v Speaker 4>cnn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did fake news that like word exist </v>

1765
01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.950
<v Speaker 4>two years ago and it's now like it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1766
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:41.303
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't go a day without fucking </v>

1767
01:19:42.671 --> 01:19:43.504
<v Speaker 4>hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not remember the term fake news </v>

1768
01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:49.000
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember right before clinton or trump</v>

1769
01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:49.923
<v Speaker 4>became president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember talking to my mom about how </v>

1770
01:19:52.001 --> 01:19:54.780
<v Speaker 4>horrible everything was and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>

1771
01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:56.860
<v Speaker 4>the biggest problem I habits with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>fake news,</v>

1772
01:19:56.861 --> 01:20:00.100
<v Speaker 4>and that was before fake news was talked</v>
<v Speaker 4>about on tv,</v>

1773
01:20:00.101 --> 01:20:03.130
<v Speaker 4>but I was talking about fake news on </v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook.</v>

1774
01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.233
<v Speaker 4>I was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my sister keeps on posting this </v>

1775
01:20:05.651 --> 01:20:09.060
<v Speaker 4>bullshit's fake stuff that posting and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was getting mad at my sister.</v>

1776
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:09.894
<v Speaker 4>It's like fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember my mom lives at is a lot of </v>

1777
01:20:11.761 --> 01:20:12.594
<v Speaker 4>fake news and then literally like up two</v>
<v Speaker 4>months later everyone's talking about </v>

1778
01:20:15.331 --> 01:20:17.430
<v Speaker 4>the fake news was kind of obvious </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1779
01:20:17.431 --> 01:20:18.264
<v Speaker 4>That was like when they said that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed a mountain lion outside the ice </v>

1780
01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:21.243
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

1781
01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 4>That was like fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was another one.</v>

1782
01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:27.750
<v Speaker 4>There's someone said that I disarm </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody at the comedy store,</v>

1783
01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:30.930
<v Speaker 4>a buddy of mine is a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually sent me a text saying,</v>

1784
01:20:30.931 --> 01:20:31.561
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way to go.</v>

1785
01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:32.970
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough situation to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1786
01:20:32.971 --> 01:20:34.170
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1787
01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:38.020
<v Speaker 4>you disarm somebody at the commerce to </v>
<v Speaker 4>argue disarming nobody,</v>

1788
01:20:38.021 --> 01:20:39.360
<v Speaker 4>but what the fuck you talking about?</v>

1789
01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:41.403
<v Speaker 8>I guess thinking that through what </v>
<v Speaker 8>happened next I would guess or I would </v>

1790
01:20:44.501 --> 01:20:45.334
<v Speaker 8>say is that people started manipulating </v>
<v Speaker 8>those websites to not be parody or </v>

1791
01:20:50.051 --> 01:20:53.650
<v Speaker 8>satire even,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they would make it look like a local</v>

1792
01:20:53.651 --> 01:20:56.050
<v Speaker 8>news channel in some part of </v>
<v Speaker 8>Pennsylvania,</v>

1793
01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:56.884

<v Speaker 8>little bit and I weapon.</v>

1796

<v Speaker 8>were being turned into bots.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Hood to someone who saved it.</v>

1852
01:23:37.551 --> 01:23:39.860
<v Speaker 4>wrote all of shakespeare's plays because</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was black.</v>

1853
01:23:39.861 --> 01:23:40.694
<v Speaker 4>They would not publish her work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She died in poverty because she never </v>

1854
01:23:42.501 --> 01:23:43.334
<v Speaker 4>received a dime for work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shakespeare was illiterate and could </v>

1855
01:23:45.051 --> 01:23:46.190
<v Speaker 4>barely write his own name.</v>

1856

<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's funny.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like the white man,</v>

1867
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:17.330
<v Speaker 4>the white male privilege of Shakespeare </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed him to steal?</v>

1868

<v Speaker 4>but they're.</v>

1887
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:03.950
<v Speaker 4>What they're doing is very clever </v>

<v Speaker 4>Like it seems legit.</v>

1890
01:25:10.871 --> 01:25:12.220
<v Speaker 4>like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen many,</v>

1891
01:25:12.221 --> 01:25:16.660
<v Speaker 4>many crazy radical black activists on </v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter that say things that are,</v>

1892
01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.720
<v Speaker 4>aren't nearly as ridiculous as that or </v>
<v Speaker 4>are the more ridiculous than that's less</v>

1893
01:25:23.021 --> 01:25:24.070
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous than what they say.</v>

1894
01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.470
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is one.</v>

1895
01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:27.723
<v Speaker 8>If it's part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't even know what's the right way </v>

1896
01:25:28.751 --> 01:25:29.584
<v Speaker 8>to word the phrase it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but like this is going on all over the </v>

1897
01:25:31.661 --> 01:25:32.494
<v Speaker 8>internet and different forms and </v>
<v Speaker 8>variations and it's being used and not </v>

1898
01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:36.664
<v Speaker 8>so like nefarious ways,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's being used for potentially </v>

1899
01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:41.140
<v Speaker 8>good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what the good would be,</v>

1900
01:25:41.141 --> 01:25:44.440
<v Speaker 8>but someone is probably figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 8>to use these bots.</v>

1901
01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:48.880
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember before retweeting was an</v>
<v Speaker 4>option on twitter?</v>

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:59.960
<v Speaker 4>tea and just make up a bunch of shit </v>

<v Speaker 4>this is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never said this.</v>

1906
01:26:01.811 --> 01:26:02.644
<v Speaker 4>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people would just say the most </v>

1907
01:26:04.251 --> 01:26:05.084
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I love the taste of cox and they </v>

1912
01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:18.620
<v Speaker 4>but it was like the early days of </v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter because I was like,</v>

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.353

<v Speaker 4>And then people would believe that you </v>

1915
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:25.130
<v Speaker 4>said a bunch of racist shit or a bunch </v>

01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:43.400
<v Speaker 4>so his name's not attached to any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1946
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:45.740
<v Speaker 4>so this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He will not divide us thing.</v>

1947
01:27:45.741 --> 01:27:46.574
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would go to these places and say he </v>

1948
01:27:48.261 --> 01:27:49.580
<v Speaker 4>will not divide us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He will not divide us.</v>

1949
01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:50.563
<v Speaker 4>And people would show up and they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>show up with like keka stand shirts on </v>

1950
01:27:54.981 --> 01:27:56.270
<v Speaker 4>with pepe the frog.</v>

1951
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:57.740
<v Speaker 4>They would wear make America great </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1952
01:27:57.741 --> 01:27:58.574
<v Speaker 4>Hats on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they weren't even necessarily trump </v>

1953
01:28:00.021 --> 01:28:00.854
<v Speaker 4>supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just people trying to have </v>

1954
01:28:01.611 --> 01:28:02.361
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1955
01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:03.800
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to fuck with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1956
01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:04.993
<v Speaker 4>So what they did was shiela above put up</v>
<v Speaker 4>a flag in the middle of nowhere that </v>

1957
01:28:11.721 --> 01:28:12.554
<v Speaker 4>said he will not divide us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then had a live stream where you </v>

1958
01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:19.370
<v Speaker 4>could go and look at the flag as it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>waving in the breeze.</v>

1959
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They found the fucking flag.</v>

1960
01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:25.040
<v Speaker 4>They found out where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No way they found it was genius and it's</v>

1961
01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:25.874
<v Speaker 4>all detailed in this radio lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact they took it down is actually </v>

1962
01:28:29.481 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 4>making me mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would they?</v>

1963
01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Because what these guys did was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1964
01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.480
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was brilliant.</v>

1965
01:28:35.630 --> 01:28:36.463
<v Speaker 4>They found social media Posts that </v>
<v Speaker 4>showed that people had met sheil above </v>

1966
01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:42.730
<v Speaker 4>in some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I say his name,</v>

1967
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:43.640
<v Speaker 4>the above,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the above.</v>

1968
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:47.000
<v Speaker 4>They found out that they had met him in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some weird place in Tennessee.</v>

1969
01:28:47.001 --> 01:28:48.920
<v Speaker 4>So they triangulate where he would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1970
01:28:49.130 --> 01:28:52.940
<v Speaker 4>So then what they did was they went </v>
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>

1971
01:28:52.941 --> 01:28:53.774
<v Speaker 4>they had one of their members go around </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a car and beep the horn so they </v>

1972
01:28:57.861 --> 01:29:01.560
<v Speaker 4>could hear the horn on the camera and </v>
<v Speaker 4>once they heard the horn on camera,</v>

1973
01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 4>then they knew</v>

1974
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.050
<v Speaker 2>he was there or then they knew that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire was there.</v>

1975
01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:07.440
<v Speaker 2>So Then they found out where it is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>stars.</v>

1976
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:08.483
<v Speaker 2>They looked at the fucking stars and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured out where the area is </v>

1977
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.133
<v Speaker 2>because when it's nighttime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the stars on the live feed </v>

1978
01:29:15.001 --> 01:29:16.530
<v Speaker 2>and you figured out what constellation </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1979
01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:20.340
<v Speaker 2>They went to the fucking flag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took it down,</v>

1980
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:24.030
<v Speaker 2>put a make America great again hat on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a pepe the frog thing up there,</v>

1981
01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:26.370
<v Speaker 2>and the guy walks up to the camera and </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1982
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:27.580
<v Speaker 2>fuck shiela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Above,</v>

1983
01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.280
<v Speaker 2>and that's the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So great.</v>

1984
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:34.470
<v Speaker 2>The fact of radio lab took that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's depressing.</v>

1985
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Why did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then?</v>

1986
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Understanding what's happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a.</v>

1987
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Here's how they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like when he was moving around,</v>

1988
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.970
<v Speaker 2>they found the log cabin he was in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1989
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.390
<v Speaker 2>let's look for rental cabins that </v>
<v Speaker 2>matched the wood pattern.</v>

1990
01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:52.800
<v Speaker 2>There are around 3000 rental caverns in </v>
<v Speaker 2>lappin lapland.</v>

1991
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.320
<v Speaker 2>We just need to match the wood patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easy enough.</v>

1992
01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Then you just spend time doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shit,</v>

1993
01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.440
<v Speaker 2>your animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love this.</v>

1994
01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why they were mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the others did it too,</v>

1995
01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:08.810
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this one,</v>

1996
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:09.643
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why radio lab would </v>

1997
01:30:10.411 --> 01:30:11.920
<v Speaker 2>take that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you google that?</v>

1998
01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Why did radio lab take down the twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth or trolls?</v>

1999
01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Troll trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trolls.</v>

2000
01:30:18.691 --> 01:30:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so rare you listen to radio.</v>

2001
01:30:21.181 --> 01:30:23.190
<v Speaker 2>I haven't ever listened to radio lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

2002
01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.313
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a news or it's one of my </v>

2003
01:30:26.701 --> 01:30:29.120
<v Speaker 2>favorite podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have all kinds of crazy shit on the</v>

2004
01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:29.963
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have stuff on all sorts of </v>

2005
01:30:30.841 --> 01:30:31.674
<v Speaker 2>different inch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2006
01:30:31.730 --> 01:30:35.780
<v Speaker 2>radio lab removes its truth trolls </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode from podcast feed.</v>

2007
01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:36.240
<v Speaker 2>This was.</v>

2008
01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.073
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to find the actual because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it say why they posted the reason why </v>

2009
01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:45.600
<v Speaker 2>this isn't second what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's saying that they removed it,</v>

2010
01:30:45.601 --> 01:30:46.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was someone reading the article.</v>

2011
01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:48.053
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they removed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Editorial radiolab is decided to take </v>

2012
01:30:51.241 --> 01:30:53.760
<v Speaker 2>down this episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some listeners called us out saying that</v>

2013
01:30:54.090 --> 01:30:56.580
<v Speaker 2>in telling the capture the flag story </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way that we did,</v>

2014
01:30:56.790 --> 01:31:01.710
<v Speaker 2>we essentially condone some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>despicable ideology and behavior.</v>

2015
01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

2016
01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.550
<v Speaker 2>To all the listeners who felt that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone else,</v>

2017
01:31:08.551 --> 01:31:12.120
<v Speaker 2>please know that we hear you and that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>take these criticisms to heart.</v>

2018
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:16.320
<v Speaker 2>I feel awful that the things we said </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be interpreted that way.</v>

2019
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:17.183
<v Speaker 2>That's on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was certainly not our intention and </v>

2020
01:31:20.461 --> 01:31:22.440
<v Speaker 2>we apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on folks.</v>

2021
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:25.290
<v Speaker 2>You guys are missing the humor of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

2022
01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.153
<v Speaker 2>these aren't despicable people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are saying things that are </v>

2023
01:31:28.921 --> 01:31:29.754
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous because it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot of people that say a </v>

2024
01:31:34.081 --> 01:31:36.360
<v Speaker 2>lot of fucked up shit online.</v>

2025
01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:37.493
<v Speaker 2>Do they actually mean this stuff or are </v>
<v Speaker 2>they saying it because they are </v>

2026
01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:41.454
<v Speaker 2>anonymous and because it's fun to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up things online that you're not </v>

2027
01:31:44.821 --> 01:31:47.430
<v Speaker 2>supposed to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say the latter.</v>

2028
01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:48.683
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a bunch of people that </v>

2029
01:31:49.531 --> 01:31:51.270
<v Speaker 2>are really legitimately fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

2030
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.313
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of other people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's fun because they're stuck at </v>

2031
01:31:54.421 --> 01:31:55.254
<v Speaker 2>some goddamn soul sucking job and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking cubicle somewhere and they have </v>

2032
01:31:59.111 --> 01:31:59.944
<v Speaker 2>access to the internet and so they go on</v>
<v Speaker 2>message boards and they fuck around and </v>

2033
01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:06.470
<v Speaker 2>they troll this asshole shiela above is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a dumb dumb,</v>

2034
01:32:06.630 --> 01:32:07.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

2035
01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.073
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking plagiarist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this guy has been busted for </v>

2036
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:13.330
<v Speaker 2>plagiarizing like giant chunks of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's work.</v>

2037
01:32:13.331 --> 01:32:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what did he get busted for?</v>

2038
01:32:14.861 --> 01:32:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Plagiarizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2039
01:32:15.901 --> 01:32:16.734
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in jail every couple of weeks for </v>

2040
01:32:18.311 --> 01:32:21.960
<v Speaker 2>being an asshole and being drunk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>silly fool.</v>

2041
01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I think that that gig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a fucking movie star is insane.</v>

2042
01:32:27.190 --> 01:32:31.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's insanely pressure filled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way harder than what we do in terms</v>

2043
01:32:31.061 --> 01:32:31.894
<v Speaker 2>of like dealing with all the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you and managing all the </v>

2044
01:32:35.231 --> 01:32:39.460
<v Speaker 2>relationships and brief history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shiela above copying the work of others.</v>

2045
01:32:39.610 --> 01:32:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a ton of shit.</v>

2046
01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:42.993
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He plagiarized and apology to alec </v>

2047
01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:49.510
<v Speaker 2>baldwin in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly quit.</v>

2048

<v Speaker 2>show orphans due to creative </v>

2049
01:32:52.151 --> 01:32:52.984
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is he couldn't get along with alec </v>

2050
01:32:54.221 --> 01:32:55.390
<v Speaker 2>baldwin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to reports,</v>

2051
01:32:55.810 --> 01:32:56.643
<v Speaker 2>the decided the best way to explain his </v>
<v Speaker 2>departure would be to tweet out a photo </v>

2052
01:32:59.351 --> 01:33:03.130
<v Speaker 2>of his email apology to the cast and </v>

01:33:39.131 --> 01:33:39.964
<v Speaker 2>2013.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That viewers began to notice that the </v>

2066
01:33:42.341 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 2>film is almost an exact adaptation of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>graphic novel.</v>

2067
01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:49.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what the one by daniel close,</v>

<v Speaker 2>much of the story to public light.</v>

2071
01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.800
<v Speaker 2>The first ever heard of the film was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning when someone sent me a link.</v>

2072
01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:00.663
<v Speaker 2>I've never spoken or met mr leboeuf have</v>
<v Speaker 2>never seen even one of his films that I </v>

2073
01:34:05.051 --> 01:34:09.700
<v Speaker 2>can recall and I was shocked to say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least when I saw that he took the script</v>

2074
01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:10.953
<v Speaker 2>and even many of the visUAls from a vEry</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal story I did six or seven years </v>

2075
01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:16.630
<v Speaker 2>ago and pass it off as his own work.</v>

2076
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2077
01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:21.460
<v Speaker 2>I actually can't imagine what was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through his mind.</v>

2078
01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.593
<v Speaker 2>He then apologize for plagiarism by </v>
<v Speaker 2>plagiarizing a yahoo answers post from </v>

2079
01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:28.250
<v Speaker 2>four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2080
01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:30.003
<v Speaker 2>hE says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>copying is in particulArly creative </v>

2081
01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being inspired by someone else's idea to</v>

2082
01:34:33.851 --> 01:34:37.060
<v Speaker 2>produce something new and different is </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative work.</v>

2083
01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2084
01:34:41.441 --> 01:34:44.410
<v Speaker 2>that's not totally copying what he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>fRom the,</v>

2085
01:34:44.411 --> 01:34:45.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose answers,</v>

2086
01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:47.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty god damn clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2087
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:48.663
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously got mental issues and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're real or whether he's </v>

2088
01:34:52.391 --> 01:34:53.224
<v Speaker 2>trolling or whether he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether he's having a psychological </v>

2089
01:34:55.331 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>meltdown because of all the pressure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being an</v>

2090
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.130
<v Speaker 4>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a shitload of pressure and being</v>

2091
01:35:01.131 --> 01:35:06.050
<v Speaker 4>in transformers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so gross.</v>

2092
01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.330
<v Speaker 4>Some of them are great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong.</v>

2093
01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.193
<v Speaker 4>I've met a lot of cool actors a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would say 10 percent of them are </v>

2094
01:35:12.771 --> 01:35:13.980
<v Speaker 4>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

2095
01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.310
<v Speaker 4>that's a big number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big number.</v>

2096
01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:20.690
<v Speaker 4>I would say three percent of comedians </v>
<v Speaker 4>are useless.</v>

2097
01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.700
<v Speaker 4>My being generous with the open </v>
<v Speaker 4>microsoft.</v>

2098
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:27.740
<v Speaker 4>Microsoft professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2099
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:29.270
<v Speaker 4>Three percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three percent,</v>

2100
01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:32.060
<v Speaker 4>maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 percent of just loopy,</v>

2101
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:36.260
<v Speaker 4>but at the comedy store is even less </v>
<v Speaker 4>like paid regulars at the comedy store.</v>

2102
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:37.963
<v Speaker 4>I would sAy it's less than one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's totally different because when </v>

2103
01:35:40.671 --> 01:35:41.504
<v Speaker 4>you're including all comedians near,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about like the cruise </v>

2104
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:46.490
<v Speaker 4>ship comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comedy store,</v>

2105
01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:49.120
<v Speaker 4>comedian or I mean a comedy class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comedians,</v>

2106
01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.420
<v Speaker 4>blabbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flappers,</v>

2107
01:35:50.421 --> 01:35:52.340
<v Speaker 4>the whole establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2108
01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.233
<v Speaker 4>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole broad spectrum of humans to </v>

2109
01:35:55.701 --> 01:35:56.870
<v Speaker 4>tell jokes on stage.</v>

2110
01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:00.620
<v Speaker 4>I ran into a buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to work on fear factor and uh,</v>

2111
01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:03.290
<v Speaker 4>he's now doing standup in burlington,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vermont.</v>

2112
01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.390
<v Speaker 4>he didn't start until he was in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>forties.</v>

2113
01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.181
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2114
01:36:06.181 --> 01:36:09.560

<v Speaker 4>I've got a dream.</v>

2115
01:36:09.561 --> 01:36:10.394
<v Speaker 4>I've got a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he just decided to start doing </v>

2116
01:36:13.641 --> 01:36:17.390
<v Speaker 4>standup comedy in his forties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dean delray started at really young.</v>

2117
01:36:17.391 --> 01:36:19.910

<v Speaker 4>I think it is 38 or something like that.</v>

2118
01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:23.870
<v Speaker 4>I want to say dean was in his forties as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well because deans in his fifties now,</v>

2119
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:26.030

<v Speaker 4>10 years.</v>

2120
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:27.223
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't.</v>

2121
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:30.120
<v Speaker 4>started open mikes with him or like </v>
<v Speaker 4>seven years ago.</v>

01:36:30.121 --> 01:36:31.850
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's pretty fucking funny now,</v>

01:36:31.851 --> 01:36:32.840
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what.</v>

2124
01:36:32.841 --> 01:36:34.550
<v Speaker 4>Dean had a set the other night at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>improv.</v>

2125
01:36:34.551 --> 01:36:37.520

<v Speaker 4>He had some funny jokes.</v>

2126
01:36:37.521 --> 01:36:40.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't Want to say what the joke the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit about,</v>

2127
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:41.600
<v Speaker 4>but it was about people don't wear </v>
<v Speaker 4>condoms.</v>

2128
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.433
<v Speaker 4>It Was fucking really well written.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes on stage more than anyone I </v>

2129
01:36:46.431 --> 01:36:47.264
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He actually writes down each time he </v>

2130
01:36:48.441 --> 01:36:49.274
<v Speaker 4>goes onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he doesn't go up two or three times </v>

2131
01:36:50.451 --> 01:36:53.270
<v Speaker 4>at night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he Freaks out like he has.</v>

2132
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:55.700
<v Speaker 4>He Doesn't dAte.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have any relationships.</v>

2133
01:36:55.710 --> 01:36:57.960
<v Speaker 4>He just does stand up 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's he's.</v>

2136
01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:03.470
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>

2137
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 4>Every time I asked him about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's always just because I don't want it</v>

2138
01:37:06.381 --> 01:37:08.820
<v Speaker 4>to interrupt my comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so focused on comedy.</v>

2139
01:37:08.850 --> 01:37:10.620
<v Speaker 4>Was data comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2140
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:11.743
<v Speaker 4>it's probably a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't always go back and look at </v>

2141
01:37:14.991 --> 01:37:17.360
<v Speaker 4>tom and christine and natasha.</v>

2147
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:29.743

<v Speaker 4>I think she actually is moshe kasher </v>

2148
01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:34.070
<v Speaker 4>fruit fertile.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Juice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Juice.</v>

2155
01:37:45.411 --> 01:37:46.244
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit reveals the worst parts of being </v>

2156
01:37:48.261 --> 01:37:49.670
<v Speaker 4>pregnant in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2159
01:37:53.290 --> 01:37:54.123

<v Speaker 4>of cranky last time I saw her at the </v>

2160
01:37:55.591 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 4>comedy store.</v>

2161
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.630
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

2162
01:37:56.630 --> 01:37:59.510
<v Speaker 3>She didn't look pregnant though because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you had so many things on it.</v>

2240
01:41:27.461 --> 01:41:29.860
<v Speaker 3>cliffhanger.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shaun says that was hotter than anything</v>

<v Speaker 3>room,</v>

2244
01:41:37.901 --> 01:41:41.260
<v Speaker 3>me and him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to my house a 45 minutes.</v>

2245
01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm just crawling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2246
01:41:42.161 --> 01:41:43.570
<v Speaker 3>laying there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like crying.</v>

2247
01:41:43.571 --> 01:41:44.680
<v Speaker 3>I fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wake up,</v>

2248
01:41:44.681 --> 01:41:45.514
<v Speaker 3>I'm shooting blood like it's 24 hours of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hell and be an incident like I wrote </v>

2249
01:41:50.831 --> 01:41:51.190
<v Speaker 3>sean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2250
01:41:51.190 --> 01:41:52.720
<v Speaker 3>are you in the same boat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2251
01:41:52.730 --> 01:41:54.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dying to like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was that bad.</v>

2253
01:41:56.171 --> 01:41:57.004
<v Speaker 3>So if you go to hell and raise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recommend getting into mild or medium </v>

2254
01:41:59.381 --> 01:42:01.990
<v Speaker 3>hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do not get the hottest and don't ask</v>

2255
01:42:01.991 --> 01:42:05.710
<v Speaker 3>for the hidden menu item hot because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like horrible.</v>

2256
01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:08.140
<v Speaker 3>Unless you want to ruin your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when it was over,</v>

2257
01:42:08.141 --> 01:42:09.940
<v Speaker 3>did you feel good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like a near death experience?</v>

2258
01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:11.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I was who listened?</v>

2259
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Who hallucinating?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hallucinating jesus christ.</v>

2260
01:42:14.110 --> 01:42:14.943
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was eating paper towels at </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts just because it's a comedy or it </v>

2261
01:42:17.821 --> 01:42:19.840
<v Speaker 3>was too high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you try milk?</v>

2262
01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:20.801
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2263
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:23.020
<v Speaker 3>we had ice cream afterwards that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>should supposed to help,</v>

2264
01:42:23.021 --> 01:42:23.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2265
01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Ice cream kind of helps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2266
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:27.550
<v Speaker 3>but getting the oil like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

2267
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:31.190
<v Speaker 3>my idea was get the oil out of my mouth </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was uh,</v>

2268
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:32.770
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my lips were getting.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And what is the pepper that they use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like carolina?</v>

<v Speaker 3>a chip now you can buy.</v>

2274

<v Speaker 3>It's one chip that's supposedly the </v>

2275
01:42:48.581 --> 01:42:50.200
<v Speaker 3>hottest chip you can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's got,</v>

2276
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I think it's made with like two or three</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those ghost peppers or some shit like</v>

2277
