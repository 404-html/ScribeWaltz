<v Speaker 1>that didn't expect it and then just like</v>

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>going through their little computer in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the twitter comes up like,</v>

6
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:25.461
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Duncan has gone.</v>

10
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Gangster poser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poser hunter.</v>

11
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing a hat and a hunting shirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had you been hunting?</v>

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I've been hunting more than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I've been running a few times and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a controversial statement.</v>

14
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:48.081
<v Speaker 1>I think fishing is a form of haunting so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is now it's hunting for aliens.</v>

15
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>They don't even breathe our air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're weird.</v>

16
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>They breathe air or the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you got it.</v>

18
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.150
<v Speaker 1>We just went fishing and we had those </v>
<v Speaker 1>popping corks where you got to make the </v>

19
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.751
<v Speaker 1>sign of a fish eating so that it's truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to communicate with an alien </v>

20
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 1>because they hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

21
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>like a lure popper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sal pop.</v>

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like when their grip grabbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>bugs out this surface,</v>

23
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>see you're communicating to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making their noises and then </v>

24
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.081
<v Speaker 1>renting them out of their dementia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding them and taking a picture with </v>

25
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>him because the ones we got were too </v>
<v Speaker 1>small and throwing them back in.</v>

26
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with Ari and we,</v>

27
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went on the salmon run.</v>

28
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>We caught some salmon in Alaska and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the most bizarre experiences </v>

29
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>ever because you know that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

30
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:39.621
<v Speaker 1>they're going to die essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're swimming there so they can fuck </v>

31
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>and then die and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>you're taking part of it and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place.</v>

33
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>They were giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we caught some like 30 pound,</v>

34
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>40 pound salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so fun.</v>

35
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I Love Sam and Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

36
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst marathon of all time.</v>

37
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Which is you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck.</v>

38
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking at the beginning and then</v>

40
00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:58.710
<v Speaker 1>you're just running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't fuck.</v>

41
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>They never fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just come on eggs,</v>

42
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>so you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going upstream to jerk off,</v>

43
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.960
<v Speaker 1>jerking off all the way up while being </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripped out of your universe by bears and</v>

44
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>humans in birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raptors are coming down.</v>

45
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Snap you out of the water.</v>

46
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine the last thing you hear </v>

47
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>is like the whoosh of air and slobbering</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound of a bear eating.</v>

48
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Just hearing your body crunched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

49
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.420
<v Speaker 1>And you flip it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This river trying to go up this little </v>

50
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 1>embankment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to get up to sort of </v>

51
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>waterfall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doing your best flopping around and</v>

52
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:46.701
<v Speaker 1>you get caught in midair by a monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild dog that weighs 2000 pounds.</v>

53
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.370
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's like inspirational salmon </v>

54
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>speakers who was everyone's running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

55
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do it.</v>

56
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:58.731
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just believe in yourself and we'll get </v>

57
00:02:58.731 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>to the top of the stream where there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven.</v>

58
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mad genetic dash.</v>

59
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.500
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a mad dash of genes trying to get </v>

60
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.981
<v Speaker 1>through this weird pipeline where these </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant bears live to the biggest bears in</v>

61
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

62
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>the biggest barriers in the world in as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as like brown bears,</v>

63
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>it's between Kodiak bears and polar </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>

64
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Polar bears eat seals and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the brown bears the biggest brown </v>

65
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.301
<v Speaker 1>bears in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't live on near the salmon </v>

66
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:27.301
<v Speaker 1>rivers because they just fatten up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

67
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:28.290
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love watching the bears.</v>

68
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.360
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a great incarnation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The incarnation is to get a bear is one </v>

69
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.711
<v Speaker 1>of the good ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially one of those bad ass salmon </v>

70
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:37.711
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just lay around.</v>

71
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:42.510
<v Speaker 1>They fight each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always dirty and covered in </v>

72
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.510
<v Speaker 1>flies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't care.</v>

73
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I would say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except they're almost 100 percent </v>

74
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.710
<v Speaker 1>cannibals.</v>

75
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are we to judge?</v>

76
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they.</v>

77
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:54.780
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious to eat another bear ceos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

78
00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:59.781
<v Speaker 1>I know you probably saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does need to be mentioned that </v>

79
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.270
<v Speaker 1>just hit the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen the seals raping the </v>

80
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.270
<v Speaker 1>penguins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch it.</v>

82
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.970
<v Speaker 1>To watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

83
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't watch it online because it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking get us pulled from youtube.</v>

84
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.840
<v Speaker 1>That's like a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now get us pulled from youtube so you </v>

85
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.840
<v Speaker 1>can play it up there and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

86
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.730
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try the new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's on Youtube?</v>

87
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.330
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try the new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so nice,</v>

88
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:20.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>We have some new setup that we just </v>
<v Speaker 1>started looking at.</v>

90
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Sam kinison louder than hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What to watch.</v>

91
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You could watch on youtube now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

92
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.350
<v Speaker 1>My greatest hits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

93
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:36.351
<v Speaker 1>so what's going on is that seals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually harassing and raping penguins.</v>

94
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.490
<v Speaker 1>This is what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

95
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:40.620
<v Speaker 1>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not harassing.</v>

96
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:43.590
<v Speaker 1>This is rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see any pinching.</v>

97
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Their assets are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey sweetie.</v>

98
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>

99
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.960
<v Speaker 1>They're raping them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

100
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're saying sexually harassing </v>

101
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.390
<v Speaker 1>isn't interest attempted rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just they weren't successful </v>

102
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.520
<v Speaker 1>because it's not like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating.</v>

103
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 1>So how else can be the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be sexually harassing.</v>

104
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Harassing is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's putting way too much </v>

105
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.290
<v Speaker 1>intelligence on these seals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:06.540
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once someone's trying to rape you,</v>

107
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:09.090
<v Speaker 1>that's assault sexual assault at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very least.</v>

108
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>So even if you don't fuck you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault,</v>

109
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.210
<v Speaker 1>these aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These seals aren't eating on the </v>

110
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.101
<v Speaker 1>penguins man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not like texting them to march </v>

111
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're climbing on top.</v>

112
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:24.240
<v Speaker 1>And what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to see this man,</v>

113
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.200
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh this,</v>

114
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fucking poor penguin just listening</v>

115
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:38.301
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This poor penguin just sits in the seal </v>

116
00:05:38.301 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>and starts trying to fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>

117
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.700
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>

118
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>there's no scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather sits in the penguin.</v>

119
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.520
<v Speaker 1>All the other penguins are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching and is embarrassed,</v>

120
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:52.521
<v Speaker 1>sad way because they could be next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do anything about it in this </v>

121
00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just holding this penguin down.</v>

122
00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to peck at them.</v>

123
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>And is Paul Simon playing</v>

124
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 2>to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so fucked up,</v>

125
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so fucked up.</v>

126
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 2>And this is like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 2>this is like when monkeys figured out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to use tools.</v>

128
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:12.341
<v Speaker 2>There's no going back man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once they've been living with these </v>

129
00:06:12.341 --> 00:06:15.431
<v Speaker 2>penguins for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horny not knowing what to do and that </v>

130
00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:19.631
<v Speaker 2>seal is the equivalent of Tesla seals </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he figured out that you can fuck</v>

131
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:25.241
<v Speaker 2>the pink ones ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

132
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.490
<v Speaker 3>Here's the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to animals,</v>

133
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

134
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 3>we're attaching our idea of what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like to be fucked by that seal,</v>

135
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.840
<v Speaker 3>this humiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

136
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social ostracism,</v>

137
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.010
<v Speaker 3>the word ostracization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the horror that the trauma of all that,</v>

138
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.140
<v Speaker 3>but do they register those things the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way we interpret them,</v>

139
00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:56.710
<v Speaker 3>like we're interpreting them and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a social contract construct.</v>

140
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're interpreting if that was us,</v>

141
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.810
<v Speaker 3>that was me and I was on the beach and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a grizzly on top of me raping </v>

142
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.921
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially the physical </v>

143
00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:07.921
<v Speaker 3>equivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

144
00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Your friends kind of marching by would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be super upset.</v>

145
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Your friends just standing there </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching you get fucked by this grizzly </v>

146
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.770
<v Speaker 3>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be really upset.</v>

147
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.450
<v Speaker 3>Hang in there joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

148
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.860
<v Speaker 3>once they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once this,</v>

149
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 3>what's the seal that's a penguin dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's probably like the penguins just </v>

150
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.390
<v Speaker 3>psyched to be up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't,</v>

151
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably just happy lived,</v>

152
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they don't really feel </v>

153
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.870
<v Speaker 3>embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they're just like,</v>

154
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.050
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to get fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they deal with it.</v>

155
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.900
<v Speaker 2>We don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

156
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:34.940
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the great mysteries of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

157
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.510
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

158
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 3>it probably doesn't even care if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>male or a female.</v>

159
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Penguin is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

160
00:07:43.951 --> 00:07:45.120
<v Speaker 3>you're all girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

161
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.170
<v Speaker 3>goddamn giant seal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>warm and oily.</v>

162
00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:54.030
<v Speaker 3>That's all it needs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We attach all these ideas to animals.</v>

163
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.550
<v Speaker 3>We love to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the big ones that we attached</v>

164
00:07:56.551 --> 00:08:01.551
<v Speaker 3>to animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like our own interpretations of </v>

165
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:01.551
<v Speaker 3>what something means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our own versions of it.</v>

166
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

167
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:05.980
<v Speaker 2>and it all goes back to the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the big question is,</v>

168
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:10.981
<v Speaker 2>is our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our brains the things producing our </v>

169
00:08:10.981 --> 00:08:14.941
<v Speaker 2>sense of awareness and self or is there </v>
<v Speaker 2>some other disembodied awareness that </v>

170
00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:20.101
<v Speaker 2>sort of goes through organic matter when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has the right kind of nervous system </v>

171
00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:24.271
<v Speaker 2>and creates the sense of self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you believe in the mechanical </v>

172
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:24.430
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

173
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.940
<v Speaker 2>the materialist view that it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bio computer,</v>

174
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the penguins experience is probably</v>

175
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.820
<v Speaker 2>just a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something is hot and warm,</v>

176
00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:36.340
<v Speaker 2>pushing it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wants to get away.</v>

177
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.550
<v Speaker 2>And when it gets away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like waking up at night </v>

178
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.161
<v Speaker 2>screaming or avoid seals that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the most kinky penguin of all </v>

179
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe</v>

180
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.200
<v Speaker 3>he's just playing hard to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh look,</v>

181
00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:53.580
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with flipper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get a fuck me again.</v>

182
00:08:53.581 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 3>You asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets really</v>

183
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just like,</v>

184
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 2>starts leaving himself by the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falls</v>

185
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 4>sleep by the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hoping the CEO finds him.</v>

186
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.340
<v Speaker 4>He falls in love with the seal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It turns out that that's what he wanted </v>

187
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:10.340
<v Speaker 4>all the long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

188
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 4>he always thought he was a top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what he was just a really good,</v>

189
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 2>strong bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just needed to seal to show him the </v>

190
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.330
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that terrible intent.</v>

191
00:09:19.331 --> 00:09:21.730
<v Speaker 2>That website stopped prison rape.org.</v>

192
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.480
<v Speaker 4>We talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fun Terrible website man.</v>

193
00:09:26.481 --> 00:09:28.940
<v Speaker 4>But that's the one where it's got that </v>
<v Speaker 4>poem,</v>

194
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.270
<v Speaker 4>the Ninth One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ninth one who raped me.</v>

195
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of that is trolling,</v>

196
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

197
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.950
<v Speaker 4>Who is performed at the battle of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>roast battle?</v>

198
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.410
<v Speaker 4>I have a CD in my car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the singer,</v>

199
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find out who it is.</v>

200
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 4>Find out who is the guy who played that </v>
<v Speaker 4>song,</v>

201
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 4>that awesome song at the roast battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

202
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.830
<v Speaker 4>Find out who that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was fucking hilarious.</v>

203
00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:02.831
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his song that he played at the roast </v>

204
00:10:02.831 --> 00:10:02.831
<v Speaker 4>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was unbelievably funny,</v>

205
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 4>was based on a guy falling in love with </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone.</v>

206
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.080
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't probably tell the premise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably,</v>

207
00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:11.360
<v Speaker 4>she probably stopped right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just really funny.</v>

208
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.880
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's obviously fiction.</v>

209
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.030
<v Speaker 4>Total fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

210
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.710
<v Speaker 4>Whereas we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're reading the prison rape thing.</v>

211
00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:23.711
<v Speaker 4>We're assuming these are actual stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could very well be somebody that's </v>

212
00:10:23.711 --> 00:10:23.711
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>

213
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like that South Park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

214
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it just came out the one with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the south park kids try to get their </v>

215
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 2>parents to stop watching what they call </v>
<v Speaker 2>murder porn,</v>

216
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 2>which is like forensic files and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

217
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:41.391
<v Speaker 2>like you lay in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one is watching forensic files </v>

218
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 2>because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want to gather more information</v>

219
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:43.980
<v Speaker 2>about this case to see if I can solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

220
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 2>People aren't watching Nancy grace </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're like,</v>

221
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to help find this missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>

222
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.480
<v Speaker 2>People are watching these shows because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting off and a deep visceral </v>

223
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:58.581
<v Speaker 2>way at other people's suffering and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>website stinks that it's that kind of </v>

224
00:10:58.891 --> 00:10:59.120
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

225
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.640
<v Speaker 4>there's one arm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one option.</v>

226
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 4>The other option is feeding paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

227
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Like if you go over grandma's house and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's constantly,</v>

228
00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:07.060
<v Speaker 4>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those wanted,</v>

229
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:09.040
<v Speaker 4>chose on and when the guy's face come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>

230
00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:14.041
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She shushes everybody trying to get a </v>

231
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:14.590
<v Speaker 4>look at the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to memorize the student's face.</v>

232
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I ever see him,</v>

233
00:11:16.451 --> 00:11:18.010
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to call that guy.</v>

234
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

235
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's wanted.</v>

236
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

237
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 2>I think whenever I watch forensic files,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

238
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.450
<v Speaker 2>there's this kind of like a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure that comes from realizing that </v>

239
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 2>this world is like that and I'm safe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this nice hotel.</v>

240
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.850
<v Speaker 2>You Watch it and you get this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

241
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:37.800
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking crazy.</v>

242
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that showed,</v>

243
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed in Freud or whatever.</v>

244
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:47.211
<v Speaker 2>It's like that for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings and the deepest part of </v>

245
00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're really honest with yourself,</v>

246
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.880
<v Speaker 2>when you watch some awful thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>news,</v>

247
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:56.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not like your heart explodes </v>
<v Speaker 2>initially with all this sweet </v>

248
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.030
<v Speaker 2>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

249
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.730
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

250
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Look at that explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's intense,</v>

251
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:05.371
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like you're weeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like tears are falling out of </v>

252
00:12:05.371 --> 00:12:09.241
<v Speaker 2>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just sort of in awe and then </v>

253
00:12:09.241 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 2>weirdly excited way about shit blowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

254
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Carlin's got a great joke about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

255
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.220
<v Speaker 2>This is like a bell curve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a show.</v>

256
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 2>There's a bell curve created where when </v>
<v Speaker 2>something close to you is suffering,</v>

257
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:24.590
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you see an animal that's sick or if </v>

258
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 2>you're something awful happened around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

259
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 2>you would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

260
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 2>that's awful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to help.</v>

261
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:30.310
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is weird and kind of cool,</v>

262
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.460
<v Speaker 2>but somehow this bell curve happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where if that very same thing is </v>

263
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.301
<v Speaker 2>happening outside of a certain proximity</v>
<v Speaker 2>to where you're at outside your </v>

264
00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:43.711
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually in another country it goes from </v>

265
00:12:43.711 --> 00:12:46.381
<v Speaker 2>being this kind of morning hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a weird kind of creepy enjoyment and </v>

266
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:51.781
<v Speaker 2>that's what the news is making money on </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if people watch the news and </v>

267
00:12:51.781 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 2>felt terrible when they watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster,</v>

268
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 2>nobody would watch the news would make </v>
<v Speaker 2>any money.</v>

269
00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:01.270
<v Speaker 2>People like to sit and stare into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>apocalypse because it's entertaining to </v>

270
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Speaker 2>entertain apocalypse.</v>

271
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.330
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely something to that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

272
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.360
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely some draw a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it where we get this weird charge about </v>

273
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 2>watching inevitable destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

274
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 2>just not ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

275
00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 2>just not ours don't want that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you see it,</v>

276
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:22.110
<v Speaker 2>whenever it's somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of feel like you dodged a </v>

277
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.110
<v Speaker 2>bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like it's.</v>

278
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.960
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrible thing,</v>

279
00:13:22.961 --> 00:13:27.961
<v Speaker 2>but it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to watch stuff that </v>

280
00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 2>makes him sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the humane society commercial,</v>

281
00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:31.500
<v Speaker 2>you know the thing that pops on when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes of the angel in the arms,</v>

282
00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:36.501
<v Speaker 2>the angel song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can barely watch that because it's </v>

283
00:13:36.501 --> 00:13:38.080
<v Speaker 2>so terribly sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't want that,</v>

284
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:43.230
<v Speaker 2>but somehow the anesthetized war </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporting the anesthetized or the sort </v>

285
00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:48.451
<v Speaker 2>of like foamed down aerial shots of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking drone strike with that kind of </v>

286
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 2>weird flash of smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the shapes.</v>

287
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are trucks with people and um,</v>

288
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.580
<v Speaker 2>but you don't see that like smoldering </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitching human corpse or the guy </v>

289
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:03.430
<v Speaker 2>limping away with his femur jutting out </v>
<v Speaker 2>as he's like,</v>

290
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.820
<v Speaker 2>one of his eyeballs is out and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about his wife and he's </v>

291
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 2>wondering if he's ever going to see her </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

292
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.820
<v Speaker 2>You don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just see this like gone.</v>

293
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:17.821
<v Speaker 2>And Zoe that you see in the shade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nothing like a shade that you </v>

294
00:14:17.821 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 2>would ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real love.</v>

295
00:14:18.101 --> 00:14:21.300
<v Speaker 2>You seen that weird gray greenish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

296
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.570
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

297
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the representatives,</v>

298
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.980
<v Speaker 2>they'll heat signatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the people were just as sort of </v>

299
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.620
<v Speaker 2>white and then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the weirdest,</v>

300
00:14:29.621 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 2>most abstract thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about like how advanced our</v>

301
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:38.791
<v Speaker 2>ability to film things is in 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is all the footage in this like </v>

302
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 2>weird black and white?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

303
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 2>radar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dish looking fucking footage,</v>

304
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:49.201
<v Speaker 2>like you don't really see video of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact same things and hd,</v>

305
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it</v>

306
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.810
<v Speaker 4>or because they're doing it at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't.</v>

307
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

308
00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think probably they don't want people </v>

309
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

310
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:00.960
<v Speaker 2>this is just terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stopped that.</v>

311
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Like when they show that drone strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if they did start playing Sarah </v>

312
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Mclaughlin or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't do that.</v>

313
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.850
<v Speaker 2>The military doesn't put that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

314
00:15:08.851 --> 00:15:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Did their drone strikes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel when you,</v>

315
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 2>when you smash a bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you smash a bug in your house,</v>

316
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:22.260
<v Speaker 2>if I smash a bug in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel there's more of a sadness.</v>

317
00:15:22.261 --> 00:15:22.980
<v Speaker 2>When I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

318
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're a roach.</v>

319
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I got to take you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>

320
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to go into the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>incarnation now?</v>

321
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.710
<v Speaker 2>And I kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I take them outside.</v>

322
00:15:31.711 --> 00:15:36.711
<v Speaker 2>I feel more intense about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when they show humans being </v>

323
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:40.641
<v Speaker 2>exploded because they do it in such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick packaged sweet way that we're all </v>

324
00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:45.891
<v Speaker 2>numbed out to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all numbed out to the fact that </v>

325
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:48.770
<v Speaker 2>those fucking explosions that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>evaporating people or a hundred percent </v>

326
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.001
<v Speaker 2>being funded by the money that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>siphoned off of is every time we buy </v>

327
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:57.681
<v Speaker 2>lattes or whenever we sell our life </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy to other people that is being </v>

328
00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:02.001
<v Speaker 2>converted by some invisible power into </v>
<v Speaker 2>human evaporating devices.</v>

329
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.370
<v Speaker 2>We know that that doesn't occur to us at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

330
00:16:05.371 --> 00:16:06.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

331
00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:07.910
<v Speaker 2>well it's more I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

332
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:13.010
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fight for freedom so that we can </v>

333
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:13.350
<v Speaker 4>have freedom over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

334
00:16:13.351 --> 00:16:15.540
<v Speaker 4>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is some of them do,</v>

335
00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:16.740
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them do.</v>

336
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:17.650
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

337
00:16:17.651 --> 00:16:19.000
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the real heroes,</v>

338
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.830
<v Speaker 4>they go over there with real good </v>
<v Speaker 4>intentions and there's also,</v>

339
00:16:22.831 --> 00:16:27.831
<v Speaker 4>it's not as simple as black and white </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's a real issue with all </v>

340
00:16:27.831 --> 00:16:28.950
<v Speaker 4>sorts of spots in the world with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>human conflict.</v>

341
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not like if we weren't involved in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan,</v>

342
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.100
<v Speaker 4>all the shit that's going on in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be going on right now.</v>

343
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.250
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like any of the conflicts that </v>

344
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.251
<v Speaker 4>exists all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The conflict between North Korea and </v>

345
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:43.251
<v Speaker 4>South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all these,</v>

346
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:46.170
<v Speaker 4>there's everywhere you look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russians were invading Ukraine.</v>

347
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 4>There's everywhere you look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are fucking with people </v>

348
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.720
<v Speaker 4>everywhere you look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been going like that since the </v>

349
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 4>beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this idea that like if we weren't </v>

350
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 4>involved it wouldn't exist.</v>

351
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that,</v>

352
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.530
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it would be nice if everybody was</v>

353
00:17:01.531 --> 00:17:03.160
<v Speaker 4>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it had been.</v>

354
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.150
<v Speaker 4>If everybody was Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we wouldn't have to worry about shit.</v>

355
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.450
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would just chill the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadians aren't pussies,</v>

356
00:17:09.451 --> 00:17:14.451
<v Speaker 4>but they're nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're nice and I think in smart </v>

357
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:15.900
<v Speaker 4>they're smart as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the problems,</v>

358
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:20.990
<v Speaker 4>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's going on with </v>

359
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.941
<v Speaker 4>Canada is a candidate doesn't have his </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of trying to conquer the world </v>

360
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:25.050
<v Speaker 4>with all this history of like being </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>

361
00:17:25.051 --> 00:17:30.051
<v Speaker 4>Like if you get involved in a conflict </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're involved in reverberations </v>

362
00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:31.660
<v Speaker 4>of the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rebound from the conflict,</v>

363
00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:36.030
<v Speaker 4>the post conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rehabilitation of the area.</v>

364
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.400
<v Speaker 4>You're involved in a bunch of shit back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and forth,</v>

365
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:43.401
<v Speaker 4>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes a long time to not get to not </v>

366
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:46.810
<v Speaker 4>be financially and socially and </v>
<v Speaker 4>culturally entwined in that contract.</v>

367
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.960
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People never think about that.</v>

368
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 4>Once you get in twined in any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict,</v>

369
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 4>you set a whole process in motion.</v>

370
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.060
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

371
00:17:55.061 --> 00:17:57.250
<v Speaker 2>not just in war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In life in general.</v>

372
00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you get in a conflict with </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody these terrible.</v>

373
00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you're fucking ear buds </v>

374
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 2>get tangled.</v>

375
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why resolving conflict feel so good.</v>

376
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.920
<v Speaker 4>He realized just we both just got </v>
<v Speaker 4>untangled from some stupidity that </v>

377
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 4>didn't have to be there in the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

378
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 4>but when your whole fucking nation has </v>
<v Speaker 4>been doing that for 200 years,</v>

379
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.690
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

380
00:18:19.691 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 4>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

381
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.110
<v Speaker 4>and noble wars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

382
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 4>like getting involved in world war two </v>
<v Speaker 4>and try and stop the Nazi Empire,</v>

383
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 4>which was legitimately in like an evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>empire run by a madman.</v>

384
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really want to think about how </v>

385
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.871
<v Speaker 4>crazy war was in the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to take into consideration that</v>

386
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:44.301
<v Speaker 4>this was for everyone knew that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were working towards some ultimate </v>

387
00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:44.790
<v Speaker 4>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

388
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:49.850
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knew this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knew this was one of the first </v>

389
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:50.760
<v Speaker 4>wars ever that was fought with </v>
<v Speaker 4>airplanes,</v>

390
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 4>but world war one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>world war two,</v>

391
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.040
<v Speaker 4>they figured out they could fly over to </v>
<v Speaker 4>places and start bombing them.</v>

392
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.890
<v Speaker 4>So people in other continents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're at war with people.</v>

393
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:04.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was some high scale shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>really for the first time in human </v>

394
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.990
<v Speaker 4>history because before that it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody had to come over on a boat.</v>

395
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:09.360
<v Speaker 4>It took fucking forever to get here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they got here,</v>

396
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 4>they got scurvy fucking pick them off at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beach.</v>

397
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

398
00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:17.100
<v Speaker 4>we brought our canon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so good luck getting to the shore,</v>

399
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 4>which is just fucking sink you before </v>
<v Speaker 4>even get close to us.</v>

400
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:21.330
<v Speaker 4>We had canons over here too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>

401
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.380
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you gotta take your boat and go far </v>

402
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.180
<v Speaker 4>where the canons can't shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was a really short place,</v>

403
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:32.390
<v Speaker 4>a short distance warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then all of a sudden it becomes the 19 </v>

404
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:37.161
<v Speaker 4>hundreds and people can fly fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>planes and they're just flying in and </v>

405
00:19:37.161 --> 00:19:41.001
<v Speaker 4>dropping bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not just dropping bombs but dropping a </v>

406
00:19:41.001 --> 00:19:44.970
<v Speaker 4>fucking nuclear bomb on two cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're just saying,</v>

407
00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:49.080
<v Speaker 4>fuck military,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck military know we're at war,</v>

408
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.670
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>

409
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:54.330
<v Speaker 4>war means it's not like we shoot your </v>
<v Speaker 4>plans and you shoot our planes.</v>

410
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just gonna drop an annihilator.</v>

411
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.690
<v Speaker 4>Have a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bomb that doesn't give a fuck who it </v>

412
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.571
<v Speaker 4>hits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not thinking about collateral </v>

413
00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 4>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know we're going to kill 100,000</v>

414
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:09.730
<v Speaker 4>women and children at least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're,</v>

415
00:20:09.731 --> 00:20:10.770
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're willing to do that.</v>

416
00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:14.640
<v Speaker 4>We're willing to go thank press that </v>
<v Speaker 4>button to stop this bullshit.</v>

417
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.660
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

418
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big leap in the direction of </v>

419
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 2>the apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fair.</v>

420
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a timer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

421
00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:28.730
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking to Matt stags not two</v>

422
00:20:28.731 --> 00:20:32.540
<v Speaker 2>hours ago because I was trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>him to explain the.</v>

423
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:37.580
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that called the Fermi </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradox.</v>

424
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.480
<v Speaker 2>You know the idea that if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's two,</v>

425
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.910
<v Speaker 2>there's the drake equation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Fermi paradox.</v>

426
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 2>The drake equation is the equation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch people at said he came up with,</v>

427
00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:53.371
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the components we would need </v>

428
00:20:53.371 --> 00:20:53.860
<v Speaker 2>for there to be extraterrestrial life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the universe.</v>

429
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:58.861
<v Speaker 2>Let's gather all this shit up and we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get an idea of some random number of </v>

430
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:04.681
<v Speaker 2>where this could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a shitty equation or </v>

431
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 2>because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's based on one sample which is us,</v>

432
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:11.010
<v Speaker 2>but still it's an idea of like how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations are there out there and I </v>

433
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:12.760
<v Speaker 2>can't remember which guy it was.</v>

434
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.720
<v Speaker 2>One of these guys said he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think drake said he,</v>

435
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:21.721
<v Speaker 2>and this is before kepler discovered all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these other planets in the goldilocks </v>

436
00:21:21.721 --> 00:21:22.300
<v Speaker 2>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before that.</v>

437
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 2>He said 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations equivalent to ours.</v>

438
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 2>And then that gave birth to the Fermi </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradox,</v>

439
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

440
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:32.740
<v Speaker 2>if there's 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations just in our,</v>

441
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the Milky Way,</v>

442
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.630
<v Speaker 2>then that must mean in an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe there's that,</v>

443
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exponentially more.</v>

444
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Why haven't we seen them yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's all these reasons of why </v>

445
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.301
<v Speaker 2>maybe civilizations don't make it into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning into Canada,</v>

446
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:51.640
<v Speaker 2>which would be a class two association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

447
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.910
<v Speaker 2>and that is because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we've all talked about this </v>

448
00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.750
<v Speaker 2>before we blow it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we blow our fucking ass is up.</v>

449
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:04.140
<v Speaker 2>And that was when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when the clock started ticking </v>

450
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 2>right there when humans started dropping</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear bombs on other people.</v>

451
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:11.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the beginning of that ticking </v>
<v Speaker 2>clock that sets this terrible truth in </v>

452
00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:17.071
<v Speaker 2>motion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that here we have invented </v>

453
00:22:17.071 --> 00:22:18.961
<v Speaker 2>these devices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have absolute destruction and we're </v>

454
00:22:18.961 --> 00:22:22.210
<v Speaker 2>believing that our civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our society is going to last long enough</v>

455
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:26.110
<v Speaker 2>to keep these things in our hands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not in other people's hands.</v>

456
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.470
<v Speaker 2>And so in Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>

457
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.470
<v Speaker 2>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

458
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.740
<v Speaker 2>all these tumultuous areas have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>devices that evaporate human beings in </v>

459
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 2>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And clearly,</v>

460
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:45.511
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the world right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see with these masked </v>

461
00:22:45.511 --> 00:22:48.640
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but heading people,</v>

462
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

463
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what just happened in fucking Jerusalem,</v>

464
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:58.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that hatchet looney coming in and </v>

465
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.780
<v Speaker 2>just hacking up people while they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>praying.</v>

466
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 2>And then that'll be followed by an </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane attack on them.</v>

467
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.990
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are existing in such a tumultuous </v>

468
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.901
<v Speaker 2>civilization that there is a very high </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that nukes are going to get </v>

469
00:23:10.031 --> 00:23:13.960
<v Speaker 2>out into the world and that it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut the civilization down.</v>

470
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.440
<v Speaker 2>The implication being this happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all developing civilizations,</v>

471
00:23:17.441 --> 00:23:21.340
<v Speaker 2>moving from type one or class one to </v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

472
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.520
<v Speaker 2>which is what we're doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we should be putting a </v>

473
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.870
<v Speaker 2>fuck load more energy into exploring </v>
<v Speaker 2>just how important are all these various</v>

474
00:23:32.621 --> 00:23:37.621
<v Speaker 2>cultures everyone's adhering to that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>making them feel like it's okay to </v>

475
00:23:37.621 --> 00:23:41.520
<v Speaker 2>evaporate other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How important is a culture that says </v>

476
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.050
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to to kill these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're of a different religion </v>

477
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 2>or they live another country or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever.</v>

478
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a mental disease man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are already candidate where Canada </v>

479
00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 2>filled with a bunch of different colored</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have a mental contaminants in</v>

480
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:59.771
<v Speaker 2>their brain that makes them believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>various version of as if an invisible </v>

481
00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Megla maniacal doom god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

482
00:24:01.971 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 2>and so that's creating all this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the big frustration,</v>

483
00:24:05.481 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's devil's advocate though.</v>

484
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

485
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Devil's advocate is just because we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in all these conflicts all </v>

486
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:19.601
<v Speaker 3>throughout the world and just because </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States is definitely done some </v>

487
00:24:19.601 --> 00:24:21.800
<v Speaker 3>shit that most people would agree would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be horrific.</v>

488
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>

489
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:24.770
<v Speaker 3>most reasonable people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

490
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:31.090
<v Speaker 3>If there was no military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we had no involvement whatsoever,</v>

491
00:24:31.851 --> 00:24:36.851
<v Speaker 3>we could just pull out in a race all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our contacts with anyone all over the </v>

492
00:24:36.851 --> 00:24:40.781
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would we really trust that some new </v>

493
00:24:40.781 --> 00:24:43.810
<v Speaker 3>crazy fuck wouldn't rise to some extreme</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim Jong Il type of power?</v>

494
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

495
00:24:44.961 --> 00:24:46.790
<v Speaker 2>Like if we're like suddenly like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

496
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.730
<v Speaker 2>no more military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody go home melting this,</v>

497
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:54.970
<v Speaker 2>we're going to turn all of the guns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the military bases and a utopian </v>

498
00:24:55.701 --> 00:25:00.701
<v Speaker 2>civilization or human beings can have </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to infinite marijuana and float </v>

499
00:25:00.701 --> 00:25:05.291
<v Speaker 2>tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what you offer me when I moved in </v>

500
00:25:05.291 --> 00:25:07.840
<v Speaker 2>with you that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's imagine that that happened.</v>

501
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

502
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:11.780
<v Speaker 2>And that happens just in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

503
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all these people,</v>

504
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that too,</v>

505
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.750
<v Speaker 2>they're a little butt hurt to put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightly.</v>

506
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.220
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh great.</v>

507
00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:26.030
<v Speaker 2>So now you guys have your super </v>
<v Speaker 2>telescopes in your Utopian civilizations</v>

508
00:25:26.031 --> 00:25:31.031
<v Speaker 2>and your beautiful palatial gardens that</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be military structures,</v>

509
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.260
<v Speaker 2>but you remember the time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>accidentally killed my entire family and</v>

510
00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:40.010
<v Speaker 2>everyone I know because you dropped the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb in the wrong place because I do.</v>

511
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I just can't seem to forget it guys.</v>

512
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I can't seem to forget it and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people that feel like that and so</v>

513
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:50.230
<v Speaker 2>now we've created this terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible pendulum,</v>

514
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.420
<v Speaker 2>a chain reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This bouncing back and forth of war.</v>

515
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.780
<v Speaker 2>There's the essence of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel in Palestine.</v>

516
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.780
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck you just hacked up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather,</v>

517
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:04.781
<v Speaker 2>mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was praying and you fuck two of you </v>

518
00:26:04.781 --> 00:26:08.300
<v Speaker 2>psychotic fundamentalists motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 2>game and hacked up my grandfather and my</v>

519
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 2>grandmother while they were praying </v>
<v Speaker 2>right after my wedding.</v>

520
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 2>You just did that to the rest of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

521
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to forget about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

522
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.390
<v Speaker 2>And over there they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

523
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:18.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes you sad.</v>

524
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:23.711
<v Speaker 2>How about you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The time you guys devastated my entire </v>

525
00:26:23.711 --> 00:26:23.711
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just this.</v>

526
00:26:23.711 --> 00:26:25.160
<v Speaker 2>I sell fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my job.</v>

527
00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:30.161
<v Speaker 2>I sell fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys turn my fucking family and a </v>

528
00:26:30.161 --> 00:26:30.161
<v Speaker 2>hamburger meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not forgetting it either.</v>

529
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth.</v>

530
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Infinite war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite wars.</v>

531
00:26:33.661 --> 00:26:38.661
<v Speaker 2>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is how do we fix that </v>

532
00:26:38.661 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 2>question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

533
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I agree.</v>

534
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 2>It seems like the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

535
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:46.020
<v Speaker 2>it seems that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the scary problem,</v>

536
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:51.021
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is scary shit that makes a lot of </v>

537
00:26:51.021 --> 00:26:51.021
<v Speaker 2>peoples that will make a lot of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

538
00:26:51.021 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 2>would make if you're a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorist for some reason this scares </v>

539
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you do look at that,</v>

540
00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.920
<v Speaker 2>obviously the Israel Palestine thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how that's going to fix </v>

541
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.920
<v Speaker 2>itself and if you read zealot by Reza </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aslan,</v>

542
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 2>which you fucking show because you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>love it.</v>

543
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:09.140
<v Speaker 2>That fucking con,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place is just to that places like </v>

544
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.710
<v Speaker 2>been having flare ups for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

545
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:17.781
<v Speaker 2>just these terror that's the part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>human bio mass that has got some really,</v>

546
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 2>really sensitive hemorrhoids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

547
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:25.140
<v Speaker 2>and one slight little friction the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>way and that shit flares up with war.</v>

548
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

549
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about this before.</v>

550
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the cradle of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

551
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I think they're the townies of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

552
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Those are the people that never went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Civilization evolved in Mesopotamia,</v>

553
00:27:37.221 --> 00:27:40.580
<v Speaker 2>in the Sudan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and Sumir and all that.</v>

554
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.640
<v Speaker 2>That whole area is like the oldest stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we know have really written </v>

555
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.160
<v Speaker 2>language and mathematics and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

556
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:52.430
<v Speaker 2>They called Jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Romans called Jerusalem a hole in </v>

557
00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:58.101
<v Speaker 2>the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they called it because they </v>

558
00:27:58.101 --> 00:28:00.501
<v Speaker 2>just thought it was at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't this great book and it's so </v>

559
00:28:00.501 --> 00:28:00.501
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

560
00:28:00.501 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they thought of them too.</v>

561
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.390
<v Speaker 2>And they invaded them and they thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like quaint what the,</v>

562
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:10.110
<v Speaker 2>what was called the Jewish cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that the Jews.</v>

563
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.840
<v Speaker 2>So good man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that description of the temple,</v>

564
00:28:12.841 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

565
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.360
<v Speaker 2>where the Wailing Wall is now that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>

566
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:20.750
<v Speaker 2>It's so beautiful describing how that </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion worked and the way he so good </v>

567
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 2>at articulating the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a strangeness of it,</v>

568
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:30.231
<v Speaker 2>which is that you have this structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>with all these levels that you are </v>

569
00:28:30.231 --> 00:28:31.920
<v Speaker 2>different people are allowed access </v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

570
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:35.910
<v Speaker 2>So like you've got like this outer area </v>
<v Speaker 2>which anyone can be at,</v>

571
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:39.090
<v Speaker 2>and that's where everyone sells shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the money changers are.</v>

572
00:28:39.091 --> 00:28:44.091
<v Speaker 2>Because if you were going to a buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal sacrifices in the temple,</v>

573
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:46.420
<v Speaker 2>you can only do it with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

574
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Jewish money shekels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't do it with any other </v>

575
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.901
<v Speaker 2>currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had to change money there to buy </v>

576
00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:56.721
<v Speaker 2>whatever animal it was that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sacrifice and you'd give that money </v>

577
00:28:56.721 --> 00:29:00.150
<v Speaker 2>to the priest who had purchased their </v>
<v Speaker 2>position from the Romans,</v>

578
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 2>and so you would give that money to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>priests and the priests,</v>

579
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be able to,</v>

580
00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:07.950
<v Speaker 2>if you were to be able to get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain areas.</v>

581
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.010
<v Speaker 2>But there was one area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the holiest of holies,</v>

582
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:16.190
<v Speaker 2>where once a year a priest is allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this place with a rope tied around </v>

583
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:21.891
<v Speaker 2>his body in case God strikes him down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could pull his body out of the </v>

584
00:29:21.891 --> 00:29:26.541
<v Speaker 2>holiest of holies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea was that the spirit of God </v>

585
00:29:26.541 --> 00:29:30.021
<v Speaker 2>on earth was just blasting out of there </v>
<v Speaker 2>like some kind of nuclear reactor of </v>

586
00:29:30.871 --> 00:29:35.871
<v Speaker 2>spiritual energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that place was constantly,</v>

587
00:29:36.151 --> 00:29:39.510
<v Speaker 2>constantly being invaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly being overthrown,</v>

588
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 2>constantly probing problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

589
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.880
<v Speaker 2>always having problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jesus,</v>

590
00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:50.881
<v Speaker 2>this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called Zealot and it's about the </v>

591
00:29:50.881 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 2>historic Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He usually gets pretty boring to me,</v>

592
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:56.401
<v Speaker 2>but this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus was one of so many people back </v>

593
00:29:56.401 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 2>then who was saying it was the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

594
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.720
<v Speaker 2>And he wasn't saying it was the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world because he literally thought </v>

595
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.121
<v Speaker 2>it was the end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just couldn't accept the fact that </v>

596
00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:08.350
<v Speaker 2>they worship the greatest God on earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the Romans had invaded.</v>

597
00:30:08.351 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 2>So therefore the answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's must be the apocalypse.</v>

598
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.280
<v Speaker 2>The world must be ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just this incredible place,</v>

599
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:20.281
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking always in that state of </v>

600
00:30:20.281 --> 00:30:20.281
<v Speaker 2>target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's out of balance.</v>

601
00:30:20.281 --> 00:30:22.240
<v Speaker 2>The places out of fucking balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

602
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.280
<v Speaker 2>it's always this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always getting invaded</v>

603
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.950
<v Speaker 3>there it seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

604
00:30:25.951 --> 00:30:30.951
<v Speaker 3>if you think about countries that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>far removed from war as like Norway,</v>

605
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greenland,</v>

606
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.650
<v Speaker 3>people live in Greenland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should.</v>

607
00:30:37.651 --> 00:30:39.750
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a beautiful place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not really green.</v>

608
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.930
<v Speaker 3>I think it's getting greener,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is global warming,</v>

609
00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:47.690
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be an amazing Hawaii in </v>

610
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:50.151
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called white land right </v>

611
00:30:50.151 --> 00:30:50.151
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

612
00:30:50.151 --> 00:30:50.151
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

613
00:30:50.151 --> 00:30:53.801
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found a map of greenland from like </v>

614
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:56.210
<v Speaker 3>the $1,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>or some shit where we didn't even know </v>

615
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.080
<v Speaker 3>that greenland was a continent </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently until 18 hundreds,</v>

616
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:02.500
<v Speaker 3>like the western Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they found this crazy map unbelief.</v>

617
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.170
<v Speaker 3>It was greenland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I right?</v>

618
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Or was it Antarctica?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those,</v>

619
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.990
<v Speaker 3>but they found this really ancient map </v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to suggest that there was </v>

620
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:16.471
<v Speaker 3>some people from a long time ago that </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew a lot more about making maps and </v>

621
00:31:16.471 --> 00:31:17.940
<v Speaker 3>about where continents were and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the continents were different,</v>

622
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at once we know about like,</v>

623
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know about the stone age for like </v>

624
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago where the,</v>

625
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:25.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice age or other were like 10,000</v>

626
00:31:25.591 --> 00:31:27.630
<v Speaker 3>years ago in North America was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>covered in ice.</v>

627
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.960
<v Speaker 3>While they think that it's possible that</v>
<v Speaker 3>some time before then people got good </v>

628
00:31:33.271 --> 00:31:36.780
<v Speaker 3>enough so they can make a map and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of pass these maps down.</v>

629
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.530
<v Speaker 3>There's the map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this cool?</v>

630
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.880
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes up when ai starts greenland,</v>

631
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.520
<v Speaker 3>ancient map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

632
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:48.530
<v Speaker 3>it's fuck was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

633
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.080
<v Speaker 3>it was just of the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was really unusual because the </v>

634
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.800
<v Speaker 3>continent up until that point had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>like covered in ice.</v>

635
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Forget the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

636
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.590
<v Speaker 3>I hate when I have a half a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>story in my head like that,</v>

637
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:06.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's something along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but point being when you,</v>

638
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:11.210
<v Speaker 3>when you talk about Israel and Palestine</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you talk about the Saudi Arabia and </v>

639
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:18.410
<v Speaker 3>Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that those ideas to America and </v>

640
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.291
<v Speaker 3>sometimes seems so abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that shit is just over </v>

641
00:32:21.291 --> 00:32:22.890
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like if that was your neighbor,</v>

642
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:27.950
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine if the dirt was closer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your neighbor was just fucking </v>

643
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.780
<v Speaker 3>lighten your neighbor up with bombs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

644
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.970
<v Speaker 3>People were flying in with flying jets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

645
00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.700
<v Speaker 3>man that don't even have people in them.</v>

646
00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing.</v>

647
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I worked at a summer camp,</v>

648
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.940
<v Speaker 2>if a bunch of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

649
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>every great story starts with when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked at a summer camp,</v>

650
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.810
<v Speaker 2>kids were getting these fucking fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

651
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:52.811
<v Speaker 2>They're getting these ridiculous fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they begin like they become like </v>

652
00:32:52.811 --> 00:32:56.740
<v Speaker 2>arch enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how much venom can spring </v>

653
00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.281
<v Speaker 2>up between two to 12 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they will become arch enemies.</v>

654
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:06.491
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>do after they'd gotten in a fight is he </v>

655
00:33:06.491 --> 00:33:09.020
<v Speaker 2>make them sit together on a bench for </v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours.</v>

656
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.220
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bench.</v>

657
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.960
<v Speaker 2>You guys have to go sit on the bench </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

658
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And inevitably over that course of two </v>

659
00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:20.591
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they usually will make up and they'll </v>

660
00:33:20.591 --> 00:33:20.591
<v Speaker 2>become best friends for the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>

661
00:33:20.591 --> 00:33:22.760
<v Speaker 2>They'll talk and like they whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck the thing was,</v>

662
00:33:22.761 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 2>it just naturally heals itself.</v>

663
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now God forgive me,</v>

664
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that that is one of the most </v>

665
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.080
<v Speaker 2>awful naive oversimplifications of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

666
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:38.410
<v Speaker 2>but eventually the people who aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>blowing each other up on a daily basis </v>

667
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:43.280
<v Speaker 2>who are sharing a planet with the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are blowing each other up on a daily</v>

668
00:33:43.281 --> 00:33:48.281
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a planet where nuclear weapons </v>

669
00:33:48.281 --> 00:33:50.861
<v Speaker 2>exist and we're all so deeply connected </v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting more and more connected </v>

670
00:33:50.861 --> 00:33:54.610
<v Speaker 2>every single fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At what point does the planet say,</v>

671
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:58.580
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to put you on the fucking bench,</v>

672
00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:00.740
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to stop this war.</v>

673
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:01.790
<v Speaker 2>We just have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

674
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.790
<v Speaker 2>when does this civilization wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize we are not Americans,</v>

675
00:34:07.791 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Canadians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not a.</v>

676
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.920
<v Speaker 2>we're not based on the landmass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>

677
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:17.921
<v Speaker 2>we're earthlings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're earthlings and we're all living </v>

678
00:34:17.921 --> 00:34:21.461
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharing the same resources and somebody </v>

679
00:34:21.461 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 2>has got to recognize that we can give </v>
<v Speaker 2>them longer that we play around with.</v>

680
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.880
<v Speaker 2>We're all different and that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all different and we just are </v>

681
00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.671
<v Speaker 2>going to celebrate our own cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just gonna celebrate our own </v>

682
00:34:30.671 --> 00:34:33.791
<v Speaker 2>cultures into infinity and part of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures involves worshiping God damn </v>

683
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:39.350
<v Speaker 2>warmongering death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's that somehow make it seem okay for</v>

684
00:34:39.351 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 2>us to murder other people in the name of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

685
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Eventually you got to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

686
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:45.740
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing that game anymore.</v>

687
00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:51.050
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it drives me crazy when people start </v>

688
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.160
<v Speaker 4>talking about religions is something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be respected,</v>

689
00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>respecting other people's religions.</v>

690
00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:59.520
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit in religion that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't respect if you're a rational </v>

691
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.181
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit like stoning for </v>

692
00:35:03.181 --> 00:35:03.181
<v Speaker 4>adultery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

693
00:35:03.181 --> 00:35:07.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're really advocating stone </v>

694
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.950
<v Speaker 4>stoning people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hitting them with rocks until they die </v>

695
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.770
<v Speaker 4>for having sex with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to have sex with your fucking </v>

696
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:13.770
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

697
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.040
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever seen those videos?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't watch seeing the links.</v>

698
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:21.060
<v Speaker 4>I'll never watched as a father and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>daughter and it was so awful and he was </v>

699
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.120
<v Speaker 4>treating his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

700
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was sick.</v>

701
00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.790
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

702
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.660
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wouldn't talk to her.</v>

703
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.950
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't say that she was his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't look at her.</v>

704
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.840
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't touch her.</v>

705
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.880
<v Speaker 4>She wanted to hold her hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't hold his hand.</v>

706
00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:36.360
<v Speaker 4>She wouldn't touch him or he wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>touch her rather.</v>

707
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm getting flustered talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it because it's hard to watch </v>

708
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.690
<v Speaker 4>because you realize this is a father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to kill his daughter with a </v>

709
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:47.280
<v Speaker 4>rock because they both got trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some crazy ideology.</v>

710
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 4>This is his baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is his baby.</v>

711
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:55.370
<v Speaker 4>He's going to kill his baby with a rock </v>
<v Speaker 4>to show his love for an angry God that </v>

712
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 4>he's never lived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

713
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:57.360
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

714
00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

715
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

716
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.570
<v Speaker 4>but how?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you enforce it and how do you do?</v>

717
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:08.630
<v Speaker 4>You can't enforce anything with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to let people know what it </v>

718
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 4>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the word of God.</v>

719
00:36:08.881 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 4>There is no word of God out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if there is a word of God?</v>

720
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.240
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't belong to one fucking group.</v>

721
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:20.500
<v Speaker 4>That's for God damn sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that God came down and talked </v>

722
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 4>to one fucking group and his knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the only true knowledge in this group</v>

723
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 4>only has anybody who tells you that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>full of shit.</v>

724
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.320
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's just start there.</v>

725
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Let's start there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's God's going to talk to </v>

726
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.991
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to talk to Chinese people who's </v>

727
00:36:35.991 --> 00:36:38.120
<v Speaker 4>going to talk to black people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's going to have a universal </v>

728
00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:38.120
<v Speaker 4>message and if it's not a universal </v>
<v Speaker 4>message,</v>

729
00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.411
<v Speaker 4>everybody needs to sit the fuck down and</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk this through because we might be </v>

730
00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:43.920
<v Speaker 4>getting some mixed signals here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not at war with each other.</v>

731
00:36:43.921 --> 00:36:48.921
<v Speaker 4>We're just humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just a bunch of humans and this </v>

732
00:36:48.921 --> 00:36:51.831
<v Speaker 4>idea that you have to be at war because </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody wrote some shit down on animal </v>

733
00:36:51.831 --> 00:36:55.671
<v Speaker 4>skins or you have to be the chosen one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you have to be the people that have </v>

734
00:36:55.671 --> 00:36:55.671
<v Speaker 4>the truth.</v>

735
00:36:55.671 --> 00:36:58.050
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is the other religion saying this?</v>

736
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.560
<v Speaker 4>It's simple because we are the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody claps.</v>

737
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:05.610
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that in Islam videos.</v>

738
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:10.440
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that in Christian videos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen them say in Christian videos,</v>

739
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:14.040
<v Speaker 4>these online things because who will the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord?</v>

740
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:19.550
<v Speaker 4>The Bible is the only true work of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord and everybody will go crazy on how </v>

741
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.800
<v Speaker 4>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck do you know?</v>

742
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.890
<v Speaker 4>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't mean there's no god.</v>

743
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.880
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean there's no god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means that you don't know.</v>

744
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.290
<v Speaker 4>You're pretending,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

745
00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:31.260
<v Speaker 4>because it makes you feel better and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking with everybody else.</v>

746
00:37:31.261 --> 00:37:31.890
<v Speaker 4>When you do that.</v>

747
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Most people I know who are the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical atheists are,</v>

748
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:42.310
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been raised in those </v>

749
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.851
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalists households and in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I consider that to be a form of </v>

750
00:37:44.851 --> 00:37:46.240
<v Speaker 2>child abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a.</v>

751
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:49.460
<v Speaker 2>it's a psychic child abuse where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

752
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:55.150
<v Speaker 2>you get your will you get one plus one </v>
<v Speaker 2>equals three for your entire life.</v>

753
00:37:56.181 --> 00:38:01.181
<v Speaker 2>Did I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you about the time where I was </v>

754
00:38:01.181 --> 00:38:01.181
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with Christian is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I ever tell you about that?</v>

755
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.910
<v Speaker 2>And one of the Hari Krishna says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was saying to the Hari Krishna in</v>

756
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:12.160
<v Speaker 2>the Bhagavad Gita as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the Bhagavad Gita with these reports </v>

757
00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.030
<v Speaker 2>by proper pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the founder of the Hari Krishna's,</v>

758
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.800
<v Speaker 2>and there were some things in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>private pod said,</v>

759
00:38:15.801 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make sense to me.</v>

760
00:38:18.811 --> 00:38:20.660
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said to me,</v>

761
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:24.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with this here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

762
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.910
<v Speaker 2>we don't say that we don't agree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper pod.</v>

763
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.570
<v Speaker 2>We say that we don't understand what </v>
<v Speaker 2>prop pod means.</v>

764
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Just</v>

765
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.810
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that easy.</v>

766
00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:42.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you have the ability to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical enough to look at whatever the </v>

767
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.961
<v Speaker 2>particular mythology that's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>diarrhea it all over your fucking brain </v>

768
00:38:45.961 --> 00:38:45.961
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

769
00:38:45.961 --> 00:38:48.060
<v Speaker 2>this is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that you're stupid or you're,</v>

770
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.910
<v Speaker 2>you're possessed by Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demons have taken hold of you.</v>

771
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:57.080
<v Speaker 2>It's so when you're one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretically one of the most </v>

772
00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.240
<v Speaker 2>intelligent beings on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which human beings are and you're having</v>

773
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:03.241
<v Speaker 2>this shit thrown at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the fundamental one fundamental </v>

774
00:39:03.241 --> 00:39:03.280
<v Speaker 2>component of being human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a part of you are like,</v>

775
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:04.660
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>

776
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.940
<v Speaker 2>That gets subverted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gets diverted.</v>

777
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 2>If that's not child abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>

778
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:14.250
<v Speaker 2>which is why a lot of people are so a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of many radical,</v>

779
00:39:14.801 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 2>radical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry atheists.</v>

780
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 2>They should be angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

781
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.560
<v Speaker 2>and therefore that God that they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>trumpeting,</v>

782
00:39:20.561 --> 00:39:23.140
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be trumpeting it.</v>

783
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:28.170
<v Speaker 2>They should be doing tap dances on it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>moldering grave and cheering and joy.</v>

784
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another problem with religion is that </v>

785
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.960
<v Speaker 3>it's very regressive in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that it's not progressive in some of</v>

786
00:39:35.961 --> 00:39:38.870
<v Speaker 3>its ideas because like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

787
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.540
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like really good advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to live a happy life,</v>

788
00:39:41.541 --> 00:39:46.541
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the stuff that's regressive in its </v>

789
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:49.271
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it what it does is it basically goes </v>

790
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:52.511
<v Speaker 3>against all of the known laws of culture</v>
<v Speaker 3>and awareness that we have ever been </v>

791
00:39:52.851 --> 00:39:55.670
<v Speaker 3>subjected to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so our entire lives of reading books,</v>

792
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.730
<v Speaker 3>our entire lives of interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the Internet,</v>

793
00:39:58.731 --> 00:40:03.731
<v Speaker 3>interacting with people in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing films and experiencing art </v>

794
00:40:03.731 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 3>and experiencing all the different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that people have created and </v>

795
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.571
<v Speaker 3>noticing that it's getting better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and smarter and smarter all the </v>

796
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:13.661
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That science is getting more and more </v>

797
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:13.661
<v Speaker 3>aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more capable technology.</v>

798
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:16.370
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking exploding at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable increasing rates.</v>

799
00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Everything is newer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

800
00:40:18.561 --> 00:40:19.670
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter,</v>

801
00:40:19.671 --> 00:40:21.380
<v Speaker 3>more advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more intuitive,</v>

802
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:26.530
<v Speaker 3>more interconnected except religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Religions like hit the brakes.</v>

803
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go back to the time or </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing shit down on animal skins and </v>

804
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.850
<v Speaker 3>they're like hanging onto this wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>stream of information and digging their </v>

805
00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:42.020
<v Speaker 3>heels in the dirt and saying that women </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be allowed to drive.</v>

806
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're essentially what they're doing </v>

807
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:50.170
<v Speaker 2>is keeping us stuck on this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet and not flying into space.</v>

808
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Interstellar ships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

809
00:40:52.221 --> 00:40:57.221
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true because it's such a divisive </v>

810
00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:58.760
<v Speaker 2>thing and it's based on such idiocy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it.</v>

811
00:40:58.761 --> 00:41:00.890
<v Speaker 2>It's been not idiocy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's based on very colorful,</v>

812
00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:05.891
<v Speaker 2>beautiful symbols which represent arche </v>
<v Speaker 2>typical aspects of the human experience </v>

813
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:08.660
<v Speaker 2>and that you can use to like help </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself wake up,</v>

814
00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 2>but the literal interpretation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker that's keeping us stuck on </v>

815
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:18.191
<v Speaker 2>the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's weird when you consider the </v>

816
00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:20.681
<v Speaker 2>idea that Graham Hancock talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the notion of the demiurge or </v>

817
00:41:20.681 --> 00:41:23.210
<v Speaker 2>the fact that indeed there is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interdimensional nemesis.</v>

818
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.360
<v Speaker 2>That these people are worshiping the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jehovah God who appeared in the garden </v>

819
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.541
<v Speaker 2>of Eden and said to Adam and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't eat the fruit that makes you know </v>

820
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:31.760
<v Speaker 2>the difference between good and evil.</v>

821
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Don't become human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That God,</v>

822
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.160
<v Speaker 2>that Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that God was trying to keep a stupid and</v>

823
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:42.161
<v Speaker 2>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a really advanced alien </v>

824
00:41:42.161 --> 00:41:44.081
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's keep the monkeys is diamond </v>

825
00:41:44.081 --> 00:41:47.350
<v Speaker 2>divided as we possibly can because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can extract that delicious fear for </v>

826
00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:51.821
<v Speaker 2>them that we like to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now if you look at Graham </v>

827
00:41:51.821 --> 00:41:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Hancock's version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of scary to think that the </v>

828
00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.440
<v Speaker 2>direct result of all these various world</v>
<v Speaker 2>religions that have at their core,</v>

829
00:41:57.441 --> 00:42:00.020
<v Speaker 2>this mega maniacal doom God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

830
00:42:00.021 --> 00:42:05.021
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the very things keeping us from </v>

831
00:42:05.021 --> 00:42:05.390
<v Speaker 2>being free from the gravity well that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're stuck in.</v>

832
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.670
<v Speaker 2>So it is almost as though there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of dark force.</v>

833
00:42:08.671 --> 00:42:13.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like keeping you trapped on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet so we can keep eating them.</v>

834
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.570
<v Speaker 2>It's our food source.</v>

835
00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:19.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't keep them trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trapped,</v>

836
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.890
<v Speaker 3>live off fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

837
00:42:22.891 --> 00:42:27.000
<v Speaker 3>They live on the air with a straw like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut.</v>

838
00:42:27.001 --> 00:42:28.500
<v Speaker 3>When you drill a hole in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut,</v>

839
00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:33.530
<v Speaker 3>they just tap it in fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep them scared.</v>

840
00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you tried earth yet?</v>

841
00:42:35.581 --> 00:42:37.320
<v Speaker 3>It is so filled with fear.</v>

842
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should go over to earth.</v>

843
00:42:40.961 --> 00:42:42.550
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're terrified.</v>

844
00:42:42.551 --> 00:42:47.551
<v Speaker 2>Those monkeys are terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't realize how powerful they </v>

845
00:42:47.551 --> 00:42:47.551
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never will.</v>

846
00:42:47.551 --> 00:42:48.520
<v Speaker 2>That Jehovah has done such a good job </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there.</v>

847
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 3>I have a less supernatural idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My idea of why it's like this is that </v>

848
00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:59.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a communication issue and that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>old communication,</v>

849
00:42:59.521 --> 00:43:04.521
<v Speaker 3>the old information is still getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bounced around over in the spot </v>

850
00:43:04.521 --> 00:43:08.001
<v Speaker 3>where they figured out communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>first and that here we are in 2014.</v>

851
00:43:08.221 --> 00:43:10.660
<v Speaker 3>The further we get away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you know,</v>

852
00:43:10.661 --> 00:43:13.530
<v Speaker 3>like look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the West Coast is the furthest spot from</v>

853
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.170
<v Speaker 3>the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is where everybody landed and it's</v>

854
00:43:16.171 --> 00:43:21.171
<v Speaker 3>just pretty commonly known that the West</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coast is more progressive people more </v>

855
00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:22.790
<v Speaker 3>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the California lifestyle.</v>

856
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:27.600
<v Speaker 3>People talk about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a matter of,</v>

857
00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beach is here.</v>

858
00:43:29.371 --> 00:43:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Everything's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no,</v>

859
00:43:30.181 --> 00:43:32.970
<v Speaker 3>it's everybody got as far away from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit as possible.</v>

860
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:38.270
<v Speaker 3>The bullshit was like my family were </v>
<v Speaker 3>Italian and Italian and Irish immigrants</v>

861
00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:44.210
<v Speaker 3>and all those people that landed there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all landed there within decades or </v>

862
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.540
<v Speaker 3>generations was all these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>immigrants that escaped Europe,</v>

863
00:43:48.541 --> 00:43:50.720
<v Speaker 3>which has even more fucked up and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

864
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:52.050
<v Speaker 3>you go further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>further,</v>

865
00:43:52.051 --> 00:43:53.820
<v Speaker 3>further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get to Iraq,</v>

866
00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.390
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get to sue mayor.</v>

867
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.350
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get to the fucking epic </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Gilgamesh.</v>

868
00:43:58.351 --> 00:43:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're getting to.</v>

869
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:04.430
<v Speaker 3>It's all mapped out for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all real obvious where everything </v>

870
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.301
<v Speaker 3>got pop and everything got started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that stayed were assholes </v>

871
00:44:08.301 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 3>that were assholes with ridiculous ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody tried to revise your </v>

872
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:12.960
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The further we got away.</v>

873
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like Noah's Ark is essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 3>epic of Gilgamesh,</v>

874
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's Hercules.</v>

875
00:44:18.271 --> 00:44:20.280
<v Speaker 3>You can compare Hercules with Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

876
00:44:20.281 --> 00:44:22.500
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of these fucking stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are super similar,</v>

877
00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of them.</v>

878
00:44:24.721 --> 00:44:29.721
<v Speaker 3>When you compare the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual core origin of like the like </v>

879
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:31.360
<v Speaker 3>what was what was actually said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

880
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 3>What actually</v>

881
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.910
<v Speaker 4>are you saying happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The virgin gave birth to a god like,</v>

882
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.760
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

883
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.680
<v Speaker 4>Just want to be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of these are there?</v>

884
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.720
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of these are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you think about people just sitting </v>

885
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.941
<v Speaker 4>around campfires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they fucking shot or Ram with some </v>

886
00:44:46.941 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 4>homemade catapult and they're eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>this meat over the fire,</v>

887
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:53.901
<v Speaker 4>telling stories for thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 4>before anybody writes anything down,</v>

888
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:59.580
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with the echoes of </v>
<v Speaker 4>savages.</v>

889
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:05.030
<v Speaker 4>That's really what you're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally sitting in front of a fire </v>

890
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:08.930
<v Speaker 4>eating meat that they cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They killed with some fucking flint </v>

891
00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:12.150
<v Speaker 4>knife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their ideas still hot.</v>

892
00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:15.390
<v Speaker 4>Our modern minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is so cool.</v>

893
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:18.360
<v Speaker 4>No crazy at goes of savages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

894
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:19.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it is,</v>

895
00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:23.670
<v Speaker 4>it's a ghost story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like everyone's brain is haunted by</v>

896
00:45:23.671 --> 00:45:27.030
<v Speaker 4>this ancient goes story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They still floating around in there.</v>

897
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:29.770
<v Speaker 4>We believe it so much and we're so good</v>

898
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:34.810
<v Speaker 2>terrified of abandoning it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That even now some part of me is I talk </v>

899
00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:39.701
<v Speaker 2>about rising beyond religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some part of me that grew up mildly </v>

900
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:43.100
<v Speaker 2>religious might still a little part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>me is like,</v>

901
00:45:43.101 --> 00:45:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Ugh,</v>

902
00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.990
<v Speaker 4>you're going to curse yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you talk about Jehovah,</v>

903
00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:52.020
<v Speaker 4>be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still get to your man.</v>

904
00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.210
<v Speaker 4>It'll get to you because</v>

905
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 2>for what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just getting our heads up out of </v>

906
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.910
<v Speaker 2>the goddamn water of delusion here and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

907
00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:05.970
<v Speaker 2>not all religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to note that not all </v>

908
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:05.970
<v Speaker 2>religions have got their feet in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mud.</v>

909
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Got To stick up for Buddhism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not have.</v>

910
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not kicking digging its heels in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and point.</v>

911
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:13.420
<v Speaker 2>It mutates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about believing in,</v>

912
00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.630
<v Speaker 2>not all of it's got so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms,</v>

913
00:46:16.631 --> 00:46:20.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's about believing in certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental truths in the universe.</v>

914
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.700
<v Speaker 4>Not also doesn't seem very greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're never asking you for money.</v>

915
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:28.701
<v Speaker 4>You never see a Buddhist late night </v>
<v Speaker 4>televangelists with fucking robes on or </v>

916
00:46:28.701 --> 00:46:31.150
<v Speaker 4>rolex telling people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time you write a check to me,</v>

917
00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.700
<v Speaker 4>Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I become very happy,</v>

918
00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:34.220
<v Speaker 4>very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come with they check.</v>

919
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.920
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden he's Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Father Guido Sarducci.</v>

920
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:38.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

921
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

922
00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:44.541
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a late night TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have slicked back hair and </v>

923
00:46:44.541 --> 00:46:45.890
<v Speaker 4>wives with plastic faces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't drive rolls royces.</v>

924
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 4>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just trying to figure out life.</v>

925
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:50.310
<v Speaker 4>They're just trying to get through </v>
<v Speaker 4>guaranteed.</v>

926
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:55.311
<v Speaker 4>There's still sect of Buddhism that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same kind of built in guilt </v>

927
00:46:55.311 --> 00:46:55.920
<v Speaker 4>principles course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

928
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.140
<v Speaker 4>Whenever people getting control of </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

929
00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

930
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.560
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

931
00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:01.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

932
00:47:01.341 --> 00:47:04.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddhism as an example of,</v>

933
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:09.410
<v Speaker 2>of a religion that can radically </v>
<v Speaker 2>transform your life,</v>

934
00:47:09.411 --> 00:47:14.411
<v Speaker 2>minus at God just by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the focused processed or not processed,</v>

935
00:47:16.521 --> 00:47:21.521
<v Speaker 2>the focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplined assimilation of certain </v>

936
00:47:21.521 --> 00:47:24.101
<v Speaker 2>basic principles through meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll start losing the conception or </v>

937
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:28.100
<v Speaker 2>the idea of where you stop and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe starts.</v>

938
00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what Buddhism does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It dissolves that membrane between what </v>

939
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:37.831
<v Speaker 2>you think you are and what everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else is through these meditative </v>

940
00:47:37.831 --> 00:47:41.581
<v Speaker 2>practices and contemplations and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really can pop out of your little I and </v>

941
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.970
<v Speaker 2>get into the big I through Buddhas are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's pretty bad ass,</v>

942
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:51.030
<v Speaker 2>but and I think other forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity that invite you to lose </v>

943
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:56.221
<v Speaker 2>yourself and love or lose yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>selflessness or the idea of just like </v>

944
00:47:56.801 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 2>going from a receiver to a transmitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanently.</v>

945
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:05.910
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty bad ass too and that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>radically transform your life and that </v>

946
00:48:06.221 --> 00:48:08.190
<v Speaker 2>God that they're talking about the god </v>
<v Speaker 2>of love.</v>

947
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.520
<v Speaker 2>He's a god that we're in right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but both of those two things are various</v>

948
00:48:12.521 --> 00:48:17.521
<v Speaker 2>ways of losing your little I and merging</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the big guy and those are two </v>

949
00:48:17.521 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 2>that's very beautiful and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough about Islam to understand all the</v>

950
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:25.981
<v Speaker 2>varying types of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guarantee there's some version of </v>

951
00:48:25.981 --> 00:48:28.921
<v Speaker 2>Islam based on the poetry of Rumi and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mistakes that also points to this </v>

952
00:48:28.921 --> 00:48:31.690
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A dissolution of the idea or the concept</v>

953
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:36.691
<v Speaker 2>of the little eye and merging into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>big eye and that that thing that shift </v>

954
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:42.930
<v Speaker 2>in the human in human society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that happened,</v>

955
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 2>that's how we could get off the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it for that.</v>

956
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Do we want to get off the planet?</v>

957
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the fucking universe.</v>

958
00:48:51.701 --> 00:48:53.140
<v Speaker 5>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

959
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:58.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking missing this here and we're </v>

960
00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.680
<v Speaker 5>going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to go somewhere else and get</v>

961
00:48:59.681 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 5>hit by a meteor there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weightlessness brother.</v>

962
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.960
<v Speaker 5>We're just going to experience </v>
<v Speaker 5>weightlessness.</v>

963
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:06.480
<v Speaker 5>Think about that either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

964
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.330
<v Speaker 5>he's not like Manson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen brother.</v>

965
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:12.310
<v Speaker 5>What are you listening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man?</v>

966
00:49:12.311 --> 00:49:14.470
<v Speaker 5>Weightlessness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you get to experience the.</v>

967
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:19.530
<v Speaker 2>The you get to as you get to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I sound out of my business is </v>

968
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:19.770
<v Speaker 2>terrible for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

969
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.820
<v Speaker 2>you get osteoporosis and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what else is terrible for your </v>

970
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:24.860
<v Speaker 2>body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weight,</v>

971
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:27.800
<v Speaker 2>weight being stuck on a fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>

972
00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:29.810
<v Speaker 2>but your body's designed for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>

973
00:49:29.811 --> 00:49:33.530
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason they say that the majority of</v>

974
00:49:33.531 --> 00:49:37.190
<v Speaker 2>our DNA or the information in there now </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to lift from Timothy Leary,</v>

975
00:49:37.191 --> 00:49:42.191
<v Speaker 2>it's so bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that the DNA inside of us is not the</v>

976
00:49:42.201 --> 00:49:47.201
<v Speaker 2>information there hasn't even been like </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely used yet because encoded within </v>

977
00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:51.731
<v Speaker 2>it is exactly the same step encoded </v>
<v Speaker 2>within whatever makes a caterpillar </v>

978
00:49:51.731 --> 00:49:52.590
<v Speaker 2>turning into a butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

979
00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:57.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now our brains are based on not </v>

980
00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.391
<v Speaker 2>being able to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our brains are based on being able to </v>

981
00:50:01.391 --> 00:50:01.610
<v Speaker 2>walk North,</v>
<v Speaker 2>south,</v>

982
00:50:01.611 --> 00:50:02.360
<v Speaker 2>east and west.</v>

983
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.230
<v Speaker 2>But most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

984
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:05.810
<v Speaker 2>When they're giving directions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't talk about altitude,</v>

985
00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:06.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not in,</v>

986
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.440
<v Speaker 2>that's not built in the way that we move</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

987
00:50:09.441 --> 00:50:14.441
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of how much more our brains </v>
<v Speaker 2>would evolve if we removed the planet </v>

988
00:50:14.991 --> 00:50:19.991
<v Speaker 2>earth from the equation and now realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we exist in an infinite space where</v>

989
00:50:20.481 --> 00:50:24.440
<v Speaker 2>there is one day where there is just one</v>
<v Speaker 2>day happening right now.</v>

990
00:50:24.441 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 2>We think that there's this day that </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps happening over and again,</v>

991
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:32.441
<v Speaker 2>just because the goddamn planet goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a light side to a dark side over </v>

992
00:50:32.441 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it gives us incredible illusion.</v>

993
00:50:33.081 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 2>It kind of metronome of time that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

994
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:37.700
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's days and because there's days,</v>

995
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:42.701
<v Speaker 2>there's years and all these years fold </v>
<v Speaker 2>together to create a lifetime when the </v>

996
00:50:42.701 --> 00:50:43.430
<v Speaker 2>truth of matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is not a day.</v>

997
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:48.850
<v Speaker 2>There were either not a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different days there just one day or no </v>

998
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:48.850
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

999
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 2>There's no time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no space,</v>

1000
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.000
<v Speaker 2>there's infinite beingness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're in right now.</v>

1001
00:50:53.001 --> 00:50:55.790
<v Speaker 2>But because of our current situation on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking gravity,</v>

1002
00:50:55.791 --> 00:51:00.791
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's given the illusion of days and </v>

1003
00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:03.521
<v Speaker 2>minutes and seconds and then want whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives become a race to fill those days </v>

1004
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:08.890
<v Speaker 2>and minutes and seconds and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be on places on time and get mad </v>

1005
00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:11.531
<v Speaker 2>because people aren't there on time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole fucking thing is just a </v>

1006
00:51:11.531 --> 00:51:11.531
<v Speaker 2>wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a wreck.</v>

1007
00:51:11.531 --> 00:51:15.130
<v Speaker 2>So one reason that would be nice to fly </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this gravity where?</v>

1008
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aside from the fact that would be fun to</v>

1009
00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:18.710
<v Speaker 2>float in space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

1010
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:19.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>

1011
00:51:19.611 --> 00:51:21.140
<v Speaker 2>there's so many things that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1012
00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 2>So like it's Disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero who'd be amazing.</v>

1013
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:27.050
<v Speaker 2>You could go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this ride,</v>

1014
00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:32.051
<v Speaker 2>there's that Rod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine what fucking UFC would </v>

1015
00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:34.550
<v Speaker 2>look like in zero gravity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would turn to soup.</v>

1016
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.320
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bones would break?</v>

1017
00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's body would dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're assuming that they haven't </v>

1018
00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:45.460
<v Speaker 2>clearly in this equation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ridiculous fantasy I'm having of </v>

1019
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.200
<v Speaker 2>floating in space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1020
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 2>they've developed ways to like early too</v>
<v Speaker 2>generate gravity.</v>

1021
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Since I'm fantasizing here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to say they've developed what?</v>

1022
00:51:55.161 --> 00:52:00.161
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then do it like a double gravity that </v>

1023
00:52:00.161 --> 00:52:00.910
<v Speaker 2>will you come back to Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're strongest where you go.</v>

1024
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.160
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1025
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.570
<v Speaker 2>That would be like the new thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC guys would get popped doing.</v>

1026
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was hanging out in double gravity.</v>

1027
00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker.</v>

1028
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:10.640
<v Speaker 2>That bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 2>He's got double strong bones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking head.</v>

1030
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:18.431
<v Speaker 2>Got An inch wider Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to go into space because it's </v>

1031
00:52:18.431 --> 00:52:22.871
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just built into human </v>

1032
00:52:22.871 --> 00:52:22.871
<v Speaker 2>beings to want to migrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's we came,</v>

1033
00:52:22.871 --> 00:52:25.370
<v Speaker 2>we virus flirt with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah we are,</v>

1034
00:52:25.371 --> 00:52:25.820
<v Speaker 2>but what?</v>

1035
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:30.820
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're finding out now that you can re </v>

1036
00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 2>code viruses to fight cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're finding out now that viruses can</v>

1037
00:52:33.021 --> 00:52:38.021
<v Speaker 2>actually be transformed into things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are good instead of things that are </v>

1038
00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:41.651
<v Speaker 2>destructive and that is my hippie </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology in my naive belief that there </v>

1039
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:48.041
<v Speaker 2>is a way that human beings can be re </v>
<v Speaker 2>coated through technology and </v>

1040
00:52:48.041 --> 00:52:52.700
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics and through some uninvented</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that hasn't happened yet,</v>

1041
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.880
<v Speaker 2>that creates a kind of state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologically enhanced empathy that </v>

1042
00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.710
<v Speaker 2>allows us to transcend these invisible </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain boundaries created by the echoes </v>

1043
00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:04.580
<v Speaker 2>of the savages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

1044
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.940
<v Speaker 2>and once that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the byproducts of that,</v>

1045
00:53:07.941 --> 00:53:12.941
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to leave the planet and </v>

1046
00:53:12.941 --> 00:53:12.941
<v Speaker 2>whenever I start yapping about optimum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate it.</v>

1047
00:53:12.941 --> 00:53:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I'll be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to go fishing,</v>

1048
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:18.530
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to leave the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of us would like to experience</v>

1049
00:53:18.531 --> 00:53:21.140
<v Speaker 2>what that's like and that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>byproducts,</v>

1050
00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:26.141
<v Speaker 2>but maybe another part of the byproduct </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this kind of merging or fusion is </v>

1051
00:53:26.141 --> 00:53:28.830
<v Speaker 2>give a fuck about going into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe</v>

1052
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.650
<v Speaker 3>because you realize you are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

1053
00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I'm at,</v>

1054
00:53:31.971 --> 00:53:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

1055
00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:39.290
<v Speaker 3>I think space travel is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds awesome.</v>

1056
00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:44.380
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a really fun thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>bet perspective wise getting above the </v>

1057
00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:48.221
<v Speaker 3>earth would be magnificent for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be probably be life changing </v>

1058
00:53:48.221 --> 00:53:49.790
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of those guys like Edgar </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitchell,</v>

1059
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.530
<v Speaker 3>whilst astronauts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Apollo guys,</v>

1060
00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.130
<v Speaker 3>they talked about the experience being </v>
<v Speaker 3>like transcendent.</v>

1061
00:53:55.230 --> 00:54:00.230
<v Speaker 3>If there was something about being above</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth and I think if we could get </v>

1062
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:02.480
<v Speaker 3>everybody to just fucking fly above the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth to.</v>

1063
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what we really could shift a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of consciousness.</v>

1064
00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:09.930
<v Speaker 3>We get everybody to go into like near </v>
<v Speaker 3>Earth orbit and just see like,</v>

1065
00:54:09.981 --> 00:54:14.981
<v Speaker 3>look at this thing that we're on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at all this silly bullshit we're </v>

1066
00:54:14.981 --> 00:54:18.371
<v Speaker 3>involved in now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at all that because that doesn't </v>

1067
00:54:18.371 --> 00:54:22.901
<v Speaker 3>have a roof that goes on forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're down here tripping out about </v>

1068
00:54:22.971 --> 00:54:26.280
<v Speaker 3>this guy believes in that book and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>God leaves in this bucket.</v>

1069
00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:31.480
<v Speaker 3>It looks so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you ever been in an argument </v>

1070
00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:35.411
<v Speaker 3>with like a brother or sister and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>your parents come over and we'll you're </v>

1071
00:54:35.411 --> 00:54:37.130
<v Speaker 3>arguing about just instantly seems so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking dumb will either.</v>

1072
00:54:37.131 --> 00:54:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you finding about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's used my pay approach.</v>

1073
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not European brush like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1074
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:46.180
<v Speaker 3>we're fooled like I want to pretend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like older now.</v>

1075
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Want to pretend to be more mature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still six.</v>

1076
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:53.150
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look up and you're looking down</v>

1077
00:54:53.151 --> 00:54:54.530
<v Speaker 3>at our conflicts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them,</v>

1078
00:54:54.531 --> 00:54:57.440
<v Speaker 3>every single one of them and you compare</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to infinity,</v>

1079
00:54:57.441 --> 00:55:02.441
<v Speaker 3>it looks so fucking stupid that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasting our time worrying about getting </v>

1080
00:55:02.441 --> 00:55:07.100
<v Speaker 3>rid of the word bossy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're wasting our time with stupid shit.</v>

1081
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:10.670
<v Speaker 3>We just constantly distracted by stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1082
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.970
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:55:11.971 --> 00:55:12.870
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1084
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.900
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of epiphany that the </v>

1085
00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 2>planet needs in mass and then once that </v>
<v Speaker 2>epiphany happens,</v>

1086
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 2>who knows the end result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it in,</v>

1087
00:55:22.741 --> 00:55:26.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skeptic and the cynic would be right</v>

1088
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.220
<v Speaker 2>up until not very long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

1089
00:55:29.221 --> 00:55:30.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's never going to fucking happen.</v>

1090
00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:32.770
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like those words.</v>

1091
00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:34.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's never gonna happen.</v>

1092
00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be difficult,</v>

1093
00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:37.900
<v Speaker 3>but amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it can happen.</v>

1094
00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:43.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what I guess what everything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do today never happened before.</v>

1095
00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:47.650
<v Speaker 3>So that whole it's never going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>is horse shit.</v>

1096
00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:52.860
<v Speaker 3>If you go back to 500 fucking years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you bring them into a podcast </v>

1097
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.680
<v Speaker 3>studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take someone,</v>

1098
00:55:53.681 --> 00:55:58.681
<v Speaker 3>throw them in a time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw him here in 2014 sitting in that </v>

1099
00:55:58.681 --> 00:56:01.180
<v Speaker 3>chair and explain to them what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going on right now.</v>

1100
00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:06.450
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't even be able to grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be nothing about what you were </v>

1101
00:56:06.671 --> 00:56:08.920
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you could speak their language,</v>

1102
00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:12.870
<v Speaker 3>even if you could explain to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptually what a computer is the.</v>

1103
00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:17.740
<v Speaker 3>There was no fucking way they would ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to imagine that this is real.</v>

1104
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you could just download movies on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix and watch them,</v>

1105
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Pam flying through the air</v>

1106
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.800
<v Speaker 4>on why fly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck are you saying?</v>

1107
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:32.050
<v Speaker 4>It's not even connected anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a magic box in front of you </v>

1108
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:35.230
<v Speaker 4>that's watching people fuck on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This isn't the most insane thing ever.</v>

1109
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:39.480
<v Speaker 4>No one ever saw this coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1110
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:40.190
<v Speaker 4>So whenever it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

1111
00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:43.480
<v Speaker 4>it'll never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything can happen.</v>

1112
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.890
<v Speaker 4>Almost anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:49.540
<v Speaker 4>And eventually anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost anything.</v>

1114
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:54.541
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>molecular control over this universe on </v>

1115
00:56:54.541 --> 00:56:55.600
<v Speaker 4>some really deep level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At one point,</v>

1116
00:56:55.601 --> 00:56:57.700
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if technology keeps evolving,</v>

1117
00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to be just that we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>blow things up.</v>

1118
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:05.490
<v Speaker 4>We might be able to build things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We might be able to create fucking </v>

1119
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:08.191
<v Speaker 4>universes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We might literally have a universe </v>

1120
00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:10.621
<v Speaker 4>button that someone advanced one day </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we can walk by the Science Museum </v>

1121
00:57:10.621 --> 00:57:11.440
<v Speaker 4>and create your own universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to do that?</v>

1122
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.400
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Press that button.</v>

1123
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we hear it.</v>

1124
00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:19.351
<v Speaker 4>Some of them from throughout the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>cosmos because a new universe bubble </v>

1125
00:57:19.351 --> 00:57:22.470
<v Speaker 4>just got shoved into that fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and you gotta throw basketballs and the </v>

1128

<v Speaker 4>every you press that button.</v>

1131
00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.240
<v Speaker 4>You just made a universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Debbie,</v>

<v Speaker 4>People being competition to see who </v>

1136
00:57:49.291 --> 00:57:50.110
<v Speaker 4>created more universes while they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>at work.</v>

1137
00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1141
00:57:57.231 --> 00:58:01.760
<v Speaker 4>How much better you can make your own </v>

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:07.730
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that semen.</v>

1145
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:12.900
<v Speaker 2>What you just said is so beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because even as ridiculous as it may </v>

1146
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:17.041
<v Speaker 2>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still acknowledges and accepts the </v>

1147
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:22.760
<v Speaker 2>principle of novelty and the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what's going to happen </v>

1148
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.460
<v Speaker 2>and that idea of not knowing what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna happen.</v>

1149
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:28.360
<v Speaker 2>That is this Buddhist teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really into his teacher.</v>

1150
00:58:28.361 --> 00:58:30.130
<v Speaker 2>This guy I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Chai,</v>

1151
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:33.480
<v Speaker 2>was this like forest monk party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With that.</v>

1152
00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.350
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that I want to make a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I John Chow,</v>

1153
00:58:36.351 --> 00:58:37.250
<v Speaker 4>the forest monk.</v>

1154
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:39.660
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

1155
00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:44.800
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know they're are these Buddhist </v>

1156
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:44.800
<v Speaker 2>forest monks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live in the forest.</v>

1157
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.510
<v Speaker 2>They sit at the edge of open graves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch bodies decompose.</v>

1158
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.820
<v Speaker 2>They can process and understand the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are impermanent,</v>

1159
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:55.610
<v Speaker 2>which is something Jack Kornfield did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing,</v>

1160
00:58:55.611 --> 00:58:57.050
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd sit at the end.</v>

1161
00:58:57.051 --> 00:59:02.051
<v Speaker 2>Just watch for days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just sit and watch corpses rot so </v>

1162
00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:05.630
<v Speaker 2>that you clearly digest the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to die because you are made</v>

1163
00:59:05.631 --> 00:59:10.631
<v Speaker 2>of the same matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to make it out of this </v>

1164
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:13.360
<v Speaker 2>so that you understand your attachment </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the body is an attachment to a thing </v>

1165
00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:16.070
<v Speaker 2>that is completely impermanent and part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the process anyway.</v>

1166
00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:20.450
<v Speaker 2>This one of the things he said is when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go into an experience,</v>

1167
00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 2>go it not knowing what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1168
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Go into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding that today you don't know </v>

1169
00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:28.480
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen.</v>

1170
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Tune into that frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tune into that place of like you really </v>

1171
00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:34.700
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt and all the ways that you think you</v>

1172
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:39.701
<v Speaker 2>know and all the experiences that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>had and everything that you've used to </v>

1173
00:59:39.701 --> 00:59:42.911
<v Speaker 2>determine how things are going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gone devoured by the time it's not </v>

1174
00:59:42.911 --> 00:59:47.651
<v Speaker 2>there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just this one moment right now </v>

1175
00:59:47.651 --> 00:59:50.710
<v Speaker 2>and you've been using their construct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How things tend to workout is a </v>

1176
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:54.041
<v Speaker 2>protective mechanism because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept the fact that you are infinity </v>

1177
00:59:54.041 --> 00:59:58.750
<v Speaker 2>experiencing itself as this impermanent </v>
<v Speaker 2>moat of meat and so that moving into </v>

1178
01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:02.750
<v Speaker 2>those places is so exhilarating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so exhilarating,</v>

1179
01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:07.900
<v Speaker 2>and if we do that as a planet instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking what everyone fucking thinks </v>

1180
01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.831
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people think which is war is </v>

1181
01:00:11.831 --> 01:00:11.831
<v Speaker 2>inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict is inevitable.</v>

1182
01:00:11.831 --> 01:00:16.270
<v Speaker 2>It'll always be fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go into it with the idea of like </v>

1183
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:19.270
<v Speaker 2>maybe not just maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can really figure out a way to </v>

1184
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:22.310
<v Speaker 2>do the pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull us out of the God damn primordial,</v>

1185
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:27.490
<v Speaker 2>gory muck of believing invisible symbols</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make it okay to kill children.</v>

1186
01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a way to pull that out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>end up floating in space or laying in a </v>

1187
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:39.341
<v Speaker 2>fucking super utopia where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychically ta merged with the entire </v>

1188
01:00:40.761 --> 01:00:42.620
<v Speaker 2>universe through technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1189
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

1190
01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.790
<v Speaker 3>think it could be both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that that can happen,</v>

1191
01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:51.820
<v Speaker 3>but along the way I think what has </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened is this mad need for conquering</v>

1192
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:55.670
<v Speaker 3>that people seem to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially men.</v>

1193
01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:01.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go back in history and what do we </v>

1194
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:01.020
<v Speaker 3>know about history?</v>
<v Speaker 3>History is essentially military history,</v>

1195
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.890
<v Speaker 3>military and technology history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and occasionally events.</v>

1196
01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what history is.</v>

1197
01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:08.900
<v Speaker 3>The printing press was invented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bottom wasn't invented in the boat.</v>

1198
01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:13.901
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once the Japanese would not accept the </v>

1199
01:01:13.901 --> 01:01:13.901
<v Speaker 3>use of guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they quickly lost at warfare.</v>

1200
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:18.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean that the military history of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>world is the real history.</v>

1201
01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.690
<v Speaker 3>When we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1202
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:23.240
<v Speaker 3>not it is what we talk about the civil </v>
<v Speaker 3>war in this country.</v>

1203
01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:26.000
<v Speaker 3>We talk about when we fought the </v>
<v Speaker 3>British,</v>

1204
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.600
<v Speaker 3>we will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>

1205
01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:31.620
<v Speaker 3>There's all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real history of our world is a </v>

1206
01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.670
<v Speaker 3>history of conflict that's fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1207
01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.180
<v Speaker 3>in conflict.</v>

1208
01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 3>This is what's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's innovation to Adam.</v>

1209
01:01:39.081 --> 01:01:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Bomb came about because we had a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there was no threat,</v>

1210
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:47.030
<v Speaker 3>there would be no adam bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it literally was invented because</v>

1211
01:01:47.031 --> 01:01:51.530
<v Speaker 3>people were terrified of someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>inventing it first so that.</v>

1212
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it's good thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have nuclear weapons,</v>

1213
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:58.991
<v Speaker 3>but what nuclear weapons represent is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human mind set forth with resources to </v>

1214
01:02:01.101 --> 01:02:06.101
<v Speaker 3>pursue a goal and what is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is possible is this intense </v>

1215
01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:10.780
<v Speaker 3>ultimate nuclear destruction possibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>and human beings created that because of</v>

1216
01:02:11.751 --> 01:02:13.640
<v Speaker 3>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not saying that that's a good thing,</v>

1217
01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:18.641
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying that involved in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict and struggle that people have </v>

1218
01:02:18.641 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 3>always had the desire to conquer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking</v>

1219
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.340
<v Speaker 4>live in a big house with a fat Mercedes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and be fucking consume and private </v>

1220
01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:30.681
<v Speaker 4>chaired and I want an on an island and </v>
<v Speaker 4>raw that feeds this machine that makes </v>

1221
01:02:32.731 --> 01:02:37.731
<v Speaker 4>technology that feeds this machine that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is ultimately advancing us past the </v>

1222
01:02:37.731 --> 01:02:41.991
<v Speaker 4>barbaric state that feeds this </v>
<v Speaker 4>interconnectedness that we all have now </v>

1223
01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:46.431
<v Speaker 4>on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right to the all that is because people </v>

1224
01:02:46.431 --> 01:02:48.690
<v Speaker 4>before us were struggling and figuring </v>
<v Speaker 4>things out and trying to communicate.</v>

1225
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.190
<v Speaker 4>You got to send a teletype today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Da da Dee da.</v>

1226
01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.550
<v Speaker 4>Dee had to send a message to my friend </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the west coast.</v>

1227
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:58.730
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't be on trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People over there can't be trusted and </v>

1228
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:04.400
<v Speaker 4>all this shit was invented in order for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to continue pushing this goal of </v>

1229
01:03:05.401 --> 01:03:10.401
<v Speaker 4>conquering new lands and new places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new ideas and new fucking markets and </v>

1230
01:03:10.401 --> 01:03:12.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and new natural resources that are being</v>

1231
01:03:12.511 --> 01:03:17.511
<v Speaker 4>tapped into and it's all a part of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that it's advancing us ultimately.</v>

1232
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.950
<v Speaker 4>So at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the same time,</v>

1233
01:03:19.951 --> 01:03:24.120
<v Speaker 4>we're all this crazy struggle and trauma</v>
<v Speaker 4>and old bullshit's going on.</v>

1234
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.560
<v Speaker 4>Darpa technology is being used on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet,</v>

1235
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:29.760
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1236
01:03:29.761 --> 01:03:34.761
<v Speaker 4>didn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't they kind of advent of the </v>

1237
01:03:34.761 --> 01:03:34.761
<v Speaker 4>Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Darpa,</v>

1238
01:03:34.761 --> 01:03:35.100
<v Speaker 4>who was the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was the inventor of the Internet.</v>

1239
01:03:35.101 --> 01:03:37.440
<v Speaker 4>I always forget that tidbit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so sad.</v>

1240
01:03:37.441 --> 01:03:38.850
<v Speaker 4>I should know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something bizarre.</v>

1241
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1242
01:03:39.271 --> 01:03:42.780
<v Speaker 4>let's pull it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my point being they are making crazy</v>

1243
01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:47.781
<v Speaker 4>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Superintelligent robots you run up to </v>

1244
01:03:47.781 --> 01:03:48.510
<v Speaker 4>when you kick them and they balance </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves out and bounced back up.</v>

1245
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:52.410
<v Speaker 4>They're making these robot cheetah has </v>
<v Speaker 4>that can run like 60 miles an hour.</v>

1246
01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:53.610
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen those fucking things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1247
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.090
<v Speaker 4>I have exoskeletons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1248
01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.280
<v Speaker 4>That's some seriously high level shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's all being made from military </v>

1249
01:04:01.321 --> 01:04:06.321
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that shit's being made to make </v>

1250
01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:06.390
<v Speaker 4>better weapons and ot mean it.</v>

1251
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:08.970
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it military money essentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>Darpa?</v>

1252
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:09.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it stand for?</v>

1253
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:12.960
<v Speaker 4>Darpa is the Defense Department and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Department of Defense.</v>

1254
01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:15.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what does stand for </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1255
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:18.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what it is is like when it,</v>

1256
01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1257
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:23.070
<v Speaker 4>obviously don't want defense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>airborne reconnaissance projects office.</v>

1258
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.830
<v Speaker 4>You obviously don't want them using it </v>
<v Speaker 4>on you,</v>

1259
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:31.100
<v Speaker 4>but it's pretty fucking awesome stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're making robots do that </v>

1260
01:04:31.651 --> 01:04:34.740
<v Speaker 4>run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're making these like horse things,</v>

1261
01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.900
<v Speaker 4>the kickup and they fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1262
01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:42.060
<v Speaker 4>they move like the balance themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>out about the new flying aircraft </v>

1263
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:47.031
<v Speaker 4>carrier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's talking about the carries </v>

1264
01:04:47.031 --> 01:04:48.771
<v Speaker 4>drones on its back fuck floating drone </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking Goddamn starcraft </v>

1265
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:52.610
<v Speaker 4>shipment and if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

1266
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:57.720
<v Speaker 4>that's like the peak of technology when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes to robotics and function.</v>

1267
01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:02.830
<v Speaker 4>As far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't mean I don't know about </v>

1268
01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:02.830
<v Speaker 4>robotics as far as like a assembly line </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1269
01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:03.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1270
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe that's like super </v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated at this point,</v>

1271
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:08.700
<v Speaker 4>but robotics as far as like things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are on their own,</v>

1272
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:14.210
<v Speaker 4>they're just walking around or flying </v>
<v Speaker 4>around like things that aren't attached </v>

1273
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:18.231
<v Speaker 4>to you and you either use remote control</v>
<v Speaker 4>or they know what the fuck they're </v>

1274
01:05:18.231 --> 01:05:18.370
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Autonomous Defense</v>

1275
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.400
<v Speaker 2>robots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things try to go into war with </v>

1276
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:23.400
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the equivalent of the airplane.</v>

1277
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:28.291
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were talking about the </v>

1278
01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:28.291
<v Speaker 2>invention of the airplane,</v>

1279
01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Darpa wants to build an avengers like </v>
<v Speaker 3>flying aircraft carrier to make drones </v>

1280
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:36.061
<v Speaker 3>even more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start becoming like big mobs of birds.</v>

1281
01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Like you know when you see like birds </v>
<v Speaker 3>fly around and they're all in unison.</v>

1282
01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.690
<v Speaker 3>Like when those start being drones </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking,</v>

1283
01:05:43.691 --> 01:05:45.730
<v Speaker 3>that's when to Dunkin happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1284
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's going to be one of the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>privacy issues in the next decade is </v>

1285
01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.241
<v Speaker 3>going to be drones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are just gonna be able to fly </v>

1286
01:05:54.241 --> 01:05:54.241
<v Speaker 3>drones over your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check up on you,</v>

1287
01:05:54.241 --> 01:05:56.010
<v Speaker 3>like your girlfriend's going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>sooth them.</v>

1288
01:05:56.011 --> 01:06:01.011
<v Speaker 3>Motherfuckers up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking send a drone is way to fly the </v>

1289
01:06:01.011 --> 01:06:01.210
<v Speaker 3>drone over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you do today Duncan.</v>

1290
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:02.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1291
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Just wash the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1292
01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:09.270
<v Speaker 2>did you notice a tiny mosquito sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>above your computer as you were jerking </v>

1293
01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:14.550
<v Speaker 2>off to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does this casting because it's outside </v>

1294
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:17.680
<v Speaker 2>the window because everybody thinks it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big thing.</v>

1295
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:20.020
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a big thing man.</v>

1296
01:06:20.021 --> 01:06:22.750
<v Speaker 2>That the drones that everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the drones will be flying over.</v>

1297
01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:25.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be flying over.</v>

1298
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:30.360
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be these microscopic </v>
<v Speaker 2>little orbs that sort of drift through </v>

1299
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.140
<v Speaker 2>like a mist gathering information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering,</v>

1300
01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:34.870
<v Speaker 2>biometric data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at eye dilation,</v>

1301
01:06:34.871 --> 01:06:39.871
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want your fucking pulse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give like maybe measure your </v>

1302
01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:40.990
<v Speaker 2>exhalations to see what kind of food </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been eating.</v>

1303
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they can even tell how much you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been drinking,</v>

1304
01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:48.450
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that we're gonna have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>luxury much longer of looking up and </v>

1305
01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 2>seeing those cute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quaint,</v>

1306
01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:51.760
<v Speaker 2>little flying big John's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way,</v>

1307
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:54.010
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking tiny little.</v>

1308
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.810
<v Speaker 2>They must already exist.</v>

1309
01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the most obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They I know that the.</v>

1310
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 2>If you go to like a in DC they have like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spy museum and they show,</v>

1311
01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bugs,</v>

1312
01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.090
<v Speaker 2>bugs that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I guess what,</v>

1313
01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:08.460
<v Speaker 2>that's what I call them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your House is bugged,</v>

1314
01:07:08.461 --> 01:07:09.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1315
01:07:09.661 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 2>that really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

1316
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like a possibility.</v>

1317
01:07:12.881 --> 01:07:15.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say it's real for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn the Internet.</v>

1318
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can look at shit up in the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1319
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:21.961
<v Speaker 2>You'd just say what it was joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with more advanced understanding of the </v>

1320
01:07:21.961 --> 01:07:23.260
<v Speaker 2>CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the um,</v>

1321
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1322
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.960
<v Speaker 2>how are you gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to scan every ant in </v>

1323
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:30.960
<v Speaker 2>your house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to scan every moth?</v>

1324
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Reverie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nat drifting by houses are going to have</v>

1325
01:07:33.941 --> 01:07:38.941
<v Speaker 2>to have force fields that shut those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things down when they fly in or some </v>

1326
01:07:38.941 --> 01:07:41.170
<v Speaker 2>kind of way to dismantle or detect </v>
<v Speaker 2>drones.</v>

1327
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1328
01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.960
<v Speaker 3>there was A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to remember what the actual </v>

1329
01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.791
<v Speaker 3>story was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a technology they were </v>

1330
01:07:50.791 --> 01:07:53.731
<v Speaker 3>working on that was essentially going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like a grain of rice and it's going </v>

1331
01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:54.940
<v Speaker 3>to have wifi in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is going to have a camera.</v>

1332
01:07:55.170 --> 01:08:00.170
<v Speaker 3>It's going to have a gps signal and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be able to transmit video and </v>

1333
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:05.730
<v Speaker 3>it'd be the size of a grain of rice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could like literally scatter them </v>

1334
01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:09.490
<v Speaker 3>throughout a city and you would have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate view of the entire city all the</v>

1335
01:08:09.491 --> 01:08:14.491
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they would force people to start </v>

1336
01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:17.461
<v Speaker 3>using certain amount of grains of rice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like type things in all of their house.</v>

1337
01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we have a 30 grain house,</v>

1338
01:08:19.891 --> 01:08:24.891
<v Speaker 3>so hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anything the government wants to </v>

1339
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:24.891
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's 30 grains in my house,</v>

1340
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:29.580
<v Speaker 3>like one grain in your bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one grain in your living room so they </v>

1341
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.861
<v Speaker 3>know where you are at all times and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a wide angle lens that's a little </v>

1342
01:08:32.861 --> 01:08:36.101
<v Speaker 3>tiny mosquito one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this one I'm talking about isn't </v>

1343
01:08:36.101 --> 01:08:38.951
<v Speaker 3>even a bug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm talking about is actually a </v>

1344
01:08:38.951 --> 01:08:39.320
<v Speaker 3>grain of rice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're going to scatter them.</v>

1345
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Paulin.</v>

1346
01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these Darpa flying and this is like Alex</v>

1347
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Jones worst nightmares that Darpa </v>
<v Speaker 2>aircraft carrier flies over and doesn't </v>

1348
01:08:49.690 --> 01:08:53.570
<v Speaker 2>release little mini drones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just releases a dust of tiny,</v>

1349
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:58.750
<v Speaker 2>a surveillance technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These weird pollinators that just sort </v>

1350
01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:03.230
<v Speaker 2>of float on top of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transmit back whatever you want,</v>

1351
01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:08.390
<v Speaker 2>we'll show you inside of houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll show you what's inside of people </v>

1352
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:11.921
<v Speaker 2>because some people are going to inhale </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and based on like maybe the thing </v>

1353
01:09:11.921 --> 01:09:13.250
<v Speaker 2>communicates with their phones so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets a gps,</v>

1354
01:09:13.251 --> 01:09:18.251
<v Speaker 2>it gets their identity and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of the being and it can start </v>

1355
01:09:18.251 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 2>saying what they're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what their health is like.</v>

1356
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:25.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google is already working on this like </v>

1357
01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 2>an ingestible cancer detecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>surveillance technology.</v>

1358
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:27.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like people think this surveillance</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to stop.</v>

1359
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Stop with just the outside of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all these new like health measuring </v>

1360
01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:34.580
<v Speaker 2>devices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Fitbit,</v>

1361
01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:37.730
<v Speaker 2>the Apple Watch that gauge biometric and</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1362
01:09:37.731 --> 01:09:42.731
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how much of that stuff can </v>

1363
01:09:42.731 --> 01:09:43.610
<v Speaker 2>you imagine like dropping that shit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>an army and being able to get feedback.</v>

1364
01:09:43.611 --> 01:09:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Not just aware of the army was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they've been eating,</v>

1365
01:09:46.131 --> 01:09:48.960
<v Speaker 2>what their blood pressure is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what their adrenaline,</v>

1366
01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.080
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1367
01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:56.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you could get a full feedback of </v>

1368
01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:56.230
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this,</v>

1369
01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:57.950
<v Speaker 2>these soldiers are mildly terrified </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1370
01:09:57.951 --> 01:10:02.951
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if we can up their adrenaline </v>
<v Speaker 2>gland production using our nano bots </v>

1371
01:10:03.591 --> 01:10:06.110
<v Speaker 2>that they inhaled while they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ready for the fight.</v>

1372
01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.700
<v Speaker 2>So they all have heart attacks.</v>

1373
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:13.550
<v Speaker 3>There was a story from a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was like the 19th,</v>

1374
01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.240
<v Speaker 3>19 seventies or eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it was,</v>

1375
01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:23.540
<v Speaker 3>but they shouldn't even say what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the year was because I don't </v>

1376
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:23.880
<v Speaker 3>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember what city was,</v>

1377
01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:29.090
<v Speaker 3>what they wanted to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would happen if someone had </v>

1378
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.580
<v Speaker 3>released some sort of a biological agent</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a city,</v>

1379
01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:34.850
<v Speaker 3>like if there's some sort of a poison </v>
<v Speaker 3>gas or something that got released on </v>

1380
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:37.791
<v Speaker 3>the city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how would it disperse and how far </v>

1381
01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:37.791
<v Speaker 3>would it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

1382
01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:41.730
<v Speaker 3>they literally blew some like material </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they could measure on the city,</v>

1383
01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:46.940
<v Speaker 3>like blew it on all these people made </v>
<v Speaker 3>these fucking people breathe it in and </v>

1384
01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.330
<v Speaker 3>sprayed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like one of the origins of</v>

1385
01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:52.350
<v Speaker 3>the idea of chem trails is based on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality that they have done goofy shit.</v>

1386
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
<v Speaker 2>We tortured some folks torch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man,</v>

1387
01:10:58.131 --> 01:11:03.131
<v Speaker 2>they do it and of course it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate or weapon would be a way to </v>

1388
01:11:03.131 --> 01:11:04.880
<v Speaker 2>like get infinite data on the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting.</v>

1389
01:11:04.881 --> 01:11:09.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the primordial essence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>war is knowing what your enemies doing.</v>

1390
01:11:09.021 --> 01:11:10.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most important,</v>

1391
01:11:10.611 --> 01:11:15.611
<v Speaker 2>if not the most important facet of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that you can surveil them </v>

1392
01:11:15.991 --> 01:11:20.850
<v Speaker 2>without them being aware at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that commander who uh,</v>

1393
01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>recently was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1394
01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:27.440
<v Speaker 2>they noticed that the press is like gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>from b now you should be scared of isis </v>

1395
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 2>suit kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's turned into like,</v>

1396
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:32.590
<v Speaker 2>looks like isis is backing down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1397
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:35.430
<v Speaker 2>this commander,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1398
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:40.970
<v Speaker 2>to make the announcement about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential death of one of their leaders </v>

1399
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:42.090
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hear you.</v>

1400
01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:44.520
<v Speaker 2>We hear what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of like,</v>

1401
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:46.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imply that we're.</v>

1402
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.560
<v Speaker 2>So you're being surveilled that we hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you're doing and we know </v>

1403
01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.880
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's probably true.</v>

1404
01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:59.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's got to be a little bit on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying side when you realize that </v>

1405
01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:04.970
<v Speaker 2>you're being surveilled by a super power</v>
<v Speaker 2>with technology that probably no one on </v>

1406
01:12:04.981 --> 01:12:06.930
<v Speaker 2>the planet is aware that exists yet.</v>

1407
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1408
01:12:07.601 --> 01:12:12.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think about what Darpa has shown </v>

1409
01:12:12.601 --> 01:12:14.881
<v Speaker 4>us they can do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows what kind of agencies the </v>

1410
01:12:14.881 --> 01:12:15.480
<v Speaker 4>government has been fucking cooking up </v>
<v Speaker 4>these crazy with.</v>

1411
01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:16.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>

1412
01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:21.631
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But isn't that ultimately gonna work </v>

1413
01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:22.690
<v Speaker 4>against them as well?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because isn't all technology,</v>

1414
01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:25.840
<v Speaker 4>especially technology that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is small,</v>

1415
01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:31.170
<v Speaker 4>like not talking about things like </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear weapons and things that are </v>

1416
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:34.171
<v Speaker 4>difficult to acquire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all technology eventually becomes </v>

1417
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:37.381
<v Speaker 4>easier to acquire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It starts off being super difficult and </v>

1418
01:12:37.381 --> 01:12:38.530
<v Speaker 4>then x amount of years later everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>got it.</v>

1419
01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:43.740
<v Speaker 4>So ultimately everyone's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to spy on everybody at every point </v>

1420
01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.700
<v Speaker 4>in time forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1421
01:12:45.701 --> 01:12:50.701
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is the problem or does that keep going </v>

1422
01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:55.111
<v Speaker 4>in that same direction?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And do we accept some sort of a </v>

1423
01:12:55.111 --> 01:12:58.110
<v Speaker 4>biological symbiosis with technology </v>
<v Speaker 4>that enhances it and makes it even </v>

1424
01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:03.031
<v Speaker 4>better at one point in time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then do we eventually figured out </v>

1425
01:13:03.031 --> 01:13:04.930
<v Speaker 4>how to make artificial parts that work </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than all the parts of our body?</v>

1426
01:13:05.170 --> 01:13:07.390
<v Speaker 4>How many people are walking around out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there with artificial hips?</v>

1427
01:13:07.391 --> 01:13:09.550
<v Speaker 4>Graham Hancock has an artificial hip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know it.</v>

1428
01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1429
01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:13.340
<v Speaker 4>Joe Perry has an artificial knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're,</v>

1430
01:13:13.341 --> 01:13:18.341
<v Speaker 4>we're making robots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have parts in bodies that are </v>

1431
01:13:18.341 --> 01:13:18.900
<v Speaker 4>machine that someone invented and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1432
01:13:18.901 --> 01:13:23.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's being powered still by your tissue </v>

1433
01:13:23.901 --> 01:13:25.300
<v Speaker 4>and your blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But essentially they've put better parts</v>

1434
01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:26.770
<v Speaker 4>in than what you had in there.</v>

1435
01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1436
01:13:27.621 --> 01:13:32.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean it all comes down to at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point people have to wake up to the fact</v>

1437
01:13:34.611 --> 01:13:37.700
<v Speaker 2>that they're not just an eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also a week.</v>

1438
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.720
<v Speaker 2>At some point you got to wake up to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that you're not just the one little</v>

1439
01:13:41.721 --> 01:13:46.721
<v Speaker 2>ewe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're directly connected to the entire </v>

1440
01:13:46.721 --> 01:13:49.160
<v Speaker 2>universe in your tiny little pixel of </v>
<v Speaker 2>awakenness in this universe.</v>

1441
01:13:49.161 --> 01:13:51.920
<v Speaker 2>But you are the universe eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's got to happen.</v>

1442
01:13:51.921 --> 01:13:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear and the terror of being observed or</v>

1443
01:13:55.691 --> 01:14:00.691
<v Speaker 2>in surveilled is 100 percent based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion of the identity.</v>

1444
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:06.040
<v Speaker 2>And like one of the last great taboos is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the acknowledgement or the realization </v>

1445
01:14:06.531 --> 01:14:10.610
<v Speaker 2>that in fact you're not an identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not a single high.</v>

1446
01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:15.900
<v Speaker 2>You're a big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a big guy and part of this a </v>

1447
01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.110
<v Speaker 2>merging technology and that's what this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit is doing,</v>

1448
01:14:17.111 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just merging with us.</v>

1449
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:23.940
<v Speaker 2>It's merging us with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of what that's doing is dissolving </v>

1450
01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:26.920
<v Speaker 2>the boundary between you and me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone on the planet right now because</v>

1451
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:31.921
<v Speaker 2>this thing is getting transmitted at God</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how many people at this point I </v>

1452
01:14:31.921 --> 01:14:35.791
<v Speaker 2>see the awards on your table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting transmitted to a shit ton </v>

1453
01:14:35.791 --> 01:14:36.790
<v Speaker 2>of people right now and that's a form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>merging,</v>

1454
01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:41.791
<v Speaker 2>auditory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>merging and obviously the next step is </v>

1455
01:14:41.791 --> 01:14:44.020
<v Speaker 2>going to be a emerging of consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>through something that scans brain waves</v>

1456
01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>and induces similar emotional states and</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

1457
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.580
<v Speaker 2>That's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1458
01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:53.810
<v Speaker 2>and that's another form of merging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the next step from that is </v>

1459
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:57.271
<v Speaker 2>recognizing or figuring out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel what it's like to no longer have a </v>

1460
01:14:57.271 --> 01:15:01.000
<v Speaker 2>body yet still have consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's another form of merging.</v>

1461
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:06.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what we really are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somehow the thing you're hopeful </v>

1462
01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:10.620
<v Speaker 2>appraisal of the situation and military </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies that somehow through this </v>

1463
01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:14.971
<v Speaker 2>stuff it's going to usher us or push us </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the boundary from being an idea to </v>

1464
01:15:15.071 --> 01:15:15.850
<v Speaker 2>being a week.</v>

1465
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's what never gets taken to </v>

1466
01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:22.811
<v Speaker 3>consideration where things like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>drake equation that there is no space </v>

1467
01:15:22.811 --> 01:15:24.980
<v Speaker 3>travel because nobody ever bothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you get to a certain point in time,</v>

1468
01:15:24.981 --> 01:15:25.970
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1469
01:15:25.971 --> 01:15:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can create our own reality.</v>

1470
01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Like you can get to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality and regular reality,</v>

1471
01:15:33.021 --> 01:15:33.330
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1472
01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:36.740
<v Speaker 3>not only the indistinguishable but </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're interchangeable.</v>

1473
01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just experience everything at </v>

1474
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:42.180
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>

1475
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can your regular life,</v>

1476
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:46.710
<v Speaker 3>like whatever you deem your regular life</v>
<v Speaker 3>could still exist along with a complete </v>

1477
01:15:46.871 --> 01:15:51.871
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality of your choosing and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could choose to go back and forth to </v>

1478
01:15:51.871 --> 01:15:54.250
<v Speaker 3>both places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the idea that you have one or the</v>

1479
01:15:54.251 --> 01:15:55.180
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1480
01:15:55.210 --> 01:16:00.210
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could still keep fucking and going </v>

1481
01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:00.210
<v Speaker 3>into virtual realities that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were,</v>

1482
01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:03.370
<v Speaker 3>you were living in Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're flying around in a fucking dragon</v>

1483
01:16:03.371 --> 01:16:05.760
<v Speaker 3>and it's just as real as this life just </v>
<v Speaker 3>take.</v>

1484
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.850
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take some time.</v>

1485
01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.640
<v Speaker 2>It is this life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1486
01:16:08.641 --> 01:16:13.641
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is this life based on the notion of </v>

1487
01:16:13.641 --> 01:16:13.950
<v Speaker 2>that we are one consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing these.</v>

1488
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:17.370
<v Speaker 2>We always end up talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but God dammit that is it.</v>

1489
01:16:17.371 --> 01:16:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Like we're snorkeling right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're snorkeling through a technique.</v>

1490
01:16:21.271 --> 01:16:26.271
<v Speaker 2>I think Terence Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I compare this to as technological reef </v>

1491
01:16:26.271 --> 01:16:27.450
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredible essay.</v>

1492
01:16:27.451 --> 01:16:32.451
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where it came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like technology's extruding </v>

1493
01:16:32.451 --> 01:16:33.990
<v Speaker 2>from time and space and we're beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>that live.</v>

1494
01:16:33.991 --> 01:16:37.200
<v Speaker 2>They are like fish swimming through this</v>
<v Speaker 2>technological reef.</v>

1495
01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Will you this</v>

1496
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:41.570
<v Speaker 3>awesome idea of the attractor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna had this idea that we were being</v>

1497
01:16:41.571 --> 01:16:44.690
<v Speaker 3>pulled toward some ultimate attractor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1498
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:46.850
<v Speaker 3>and the strange attractor at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1499
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the our innovation and novelty and </v>

1500
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.291
<v Speaker 3>all these different historical events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was leading towards this </v>

1501
01:16:56.291 --> 01:16:59.771
<v Speaker 3>attractor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is such a bizarre way to look at </v>

1502
01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:00.650
<v Speaker 3>things but so unique like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear that and you go,</v>

1503
01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that wants us to build </v>

1504
01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.300
<v Speaker 3>it and it's pulling us through time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1505
01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:11.330
<v Speaker 3>but it could also just be we want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive and to survive you compete.</v>

1506
01:17:11.331 --> 01:17:13.040
<v Speaker 3>In order to compete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to innovate,</v>

1507
01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:18.080
<v Speaker 3>you have to worry about your enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to keep going so you can get </v>

1508
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.771
<v Speaker 3>your common to more monkeys and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>more monkeys that are like you not like </v>

1509
01:17:20.771 --> 01:17:24.281
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those Fox does Fox and then you just </v>

1510
01:17:24.281 --> 01:17:25.850
<v Speaker 3>make it better jets and better missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It better this,</v>

1511
01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:27.740
<v Speaker 3>better that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then eventually you figure out,</v>

1512
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could just do this,</v>

1513
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.580
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no more war.</v>

1514
01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Dead violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sadness,</v>

1515
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:38.890
<v Speaker 3>just bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just blessed man and computer </v>

1516
01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:38.890
<v Speaker 3>maintenance.</v>

1517
01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Pray in my life that I never seriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>say I've got to get my common tomorrow.</v>

1518
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:45.250
<v Speaker 6>Geez,</v>

1519
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:53.470
<v Speaker 3>do you have any more monkeys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's how you accelerate the </v>

1520
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:54.020
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if we still lived in Eden and it</v>

1521
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:55.130
<v Speaker 3>was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1522
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:57.350
<v Speaker 3>our friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like 20 of us.</v>

1523
01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Would we ever even invent boats?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1524
01:18:00.111 --> 01:18:02.930
<v Speaker 3>If we lived in this perfect place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was fruit everywhere,</v>

1525
01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:08.140
<v Speaker 3>we have an infinite number of animals to</v>
<v Speaker 3>choose to eat in the infinite number of </v>

1526
01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.070
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we're going to win,</v>

1527
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.850
<v Speaker 3>there's only 20 of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to invent?</v>

1528
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.070
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not inventing shit,</v>

1529
01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:14.570
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have a good time.</v>

1530
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:16.970
<v Speaker 3>We're going to sit by the campfire and </v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh.</v>

1531
01:18:16.971 --> 01:18:21.971
<v Speaker 3>We're going to smoke weed because no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one's going to lock us up in jail for </v>

1532
01:18:21.971 --> 01:18:22.660
<v Speaker 3>having a plant that makes you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to.</v>

1533
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:24.080
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have no conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1534
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.980
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have zero.</v>

1535
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:30.070
<v Speaker 3>It was just our friends and we all lived</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this unbelievably cool place where </v>

1536
01:18:30.111 --> 01:18:32.480
<v Speaker 3>there's food everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would we ever argue about?</v>

1537
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:35.570
<v Speaker 3>What would we ever invent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing and nothing.</v>

1538
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.060
<v Speaker 3>We would get together if we had an </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of food.</v>

1539
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:39.680
<v Speaker 3>It was just us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just our friends.</v>

1540
01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:44.860
<v Speaker 3>We had an infinite number of food and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're healthy and we're in a place </v>

1541
01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:45.290
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would just be laughing.</v>

1542
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what we'd do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd never get anything done.</v>

1543
01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.020
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't worry about Ari.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ari fucking acting kind of weird math.</v>

1544
01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Did you take over the kingdom now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

1545
01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.560
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see Ra rape that penguin here,</v>

1546
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:01.740
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting to worry about Diaz.</v>

1547
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.380
<v Speaker 3>He might be forming a new political </v>
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

1548
01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1549
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really good points.</v>

1550
01:19:08.871 --> 01:19:13.400
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to join dss to merge </v>
<v Speaker 3>with ts and just have one super party.</v>

1551
01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:16.310
<v Speaker 3>Why fuck around and give them choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will be pulled.</v>

1552
01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Both be co presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've co headlined.</v>

1553
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I'll speak up</v>

1554
01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.320
<v Speaker 6>president.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love that.</v>

1555
01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:25.340
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not</v>

1556
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:29.080
<v Speaker 3>the vice president of the feature act </v>
<v Speaker 3>just here two.</v>

1557
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:32.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm opening up for the president for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first two years of his presidency.</v>

1558
01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to warm the crowd up,</v>

1559
01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:35.530
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

1560
01:19:35.531 --> 01:19:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1561
01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1562
01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that there's something to be </v>

1563
01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:42.350
<v Speaker 2>said for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for turbulence being a kind of like the,</v>

1564
01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:43.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

1565
01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:48.960
<v Speaker 2>creates the friction that generates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heat necessary to fuel whatever this </v>

1566
01:19:49.061 --> 01:19:53.110
<v Speaker 2>strange technological life form is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're weaving out of nothingness.</v>

1567
01:19:53.111 --> 01:19:58.111
<v Speaker 2>So in that way I think it's a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and I think that probably as long </v>

1568
01:19:58.211 --> 01:20:01.090
<v Speaker 2>as you're on a gravity well and a planet</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we all are,</v>

1569
01:20:01.091 --> 01:20:04.870
<v Speaker 2>regardless of the resources around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still going to get in fights.</v>

1570
01:20:04.871 --> 01:20:07.440
<v Speaker 2>There's still going to be turbulence </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's too many of us.</v>

1571
01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:12.530
<v Speaker 2>It's because we think that we our eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of recognizing that we are one </v>

1572
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.530
<v Speaker 2>organism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

1573
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 3>it isn't because Rdq seat and my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit.</v>

1574
01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We as lazy dude.</v>

1575
01:20:16.981 --> 01:20:19.060
<v Speaker 3>I went and picked the fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking eat it.</v>

1576
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want us fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He brings up this fish dude.</v>

1577
01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.650
<v Speaker 3>He goes fishing gear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legs to go fishing.</v>

1578
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:27.651
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to fucking pick fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fruit's more valuable because it wasn't </v>

1579
01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:33.180
<v Speaker 3>made with fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So make me fucking fucking people.</v>

1580
01:20:33.181 --> 01:20:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Go fishing for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1581
01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:37.050
<v Speaker 3>You can't say fishing and fruit picking </v>
<v Speaker 3>is equal.</v>

1582
01:20:37.051 --> 01:20:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1583
01:20:37.861 --> 01:20:39.660
<v Speaker 3>You had a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You asshole.</v>

1584
01:20:39.661 --> 01:20:42.090
<v Speaker 3>You brought back 10 fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That must have been a thrill and a half.</v>

1585
01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:46.410
<v Speaker 3>That's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same.</v>

1586
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:51.590
<v Speaker 3>When you're out there chopping wood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to give me a fish for all </v>

1587
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.590
<v Speaker 3>this wood that are chopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

1588
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:56.271
<v Speaker 3>You had a good time making that fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing is so god damn funny.</v>

1589
01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Not that I don't know if you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lead.</v>

1590
01:20:59.181 --> 01:21:04.181
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the thing as Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would know it doesn't have to </v>

1591
01:21:04.181 --> 01:21:04.320
<v Speaker 3>leave for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh awesome.</v>

1592
01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I thought I thought.</v>

1593
01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:06.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1594
01:21:06.421 --> 01:21:10.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing Adam Carolla show today yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like 4:30.</v>

1595
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:11.740
<v Speaker 3>It's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1596
01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1597
01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:13.370
<v Speaker 3>Should be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1598
01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:13.550
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1599
01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Fishing is a fucking blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went fishing out in the mobile </v>

1600
01:21:18.670 --> 01:21:18.670
<v Speaker 2>bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Alabama.</v>

1601
01:21:18.670 --> 01:21:23.471
<v Speaker 2>And what'd you guys fish for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were fishing for trout I guess is </v>

1602
01:21:23.631 --> 01:21:26.200
<v Speaker 2>what's out there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know the,</v>

1603
01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:31.840
<v Speaker 2>we didn't catch anything man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we are with this professional </v>

1604
01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.411
<v Speaker 2>fishermen and my dad's friends with and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like this time last year at this </v>

1605
01:21:35.411 --> 01:21:37.340
<v Speaker 2>place was filled with boats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because of the climate is different,</v>

1606
01:21:37.341 --> 01:21:38.480
<v Speaker 2>the basic</v>

1607
01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:41.800
<v Speaker 3>obviously responding is that what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in the spring,</v>

1608
01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:47.500
<v Speaker 2>shrimp eggs end up on the marsh grass </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get released and then the fish come </v>

1609
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:52.211
<v Speaker 2>out of the deeper ocean to eat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shrimp shrimp bags and then that's when </v>

1610
01:21:52.211 --> 01:21:56.291
<v Speaker 2>you have the fishing booms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it hasn't been happening and some </v>

1611
01:21:56.391 --> 01:21:57.740
<v Speaker 2>people are a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

1612
01:21:57.741 --> 01:21:58.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to,</v>

1613
01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:04.120
<v Speaker 2>whenever you're fishing you want to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with a reason for not catching a </v>

1614
01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:04.120
<v Speaker 2>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1615
01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.481
<v Speaker 2>But some people are a little nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>because even though after that terrible </v>

1616
01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:14.230
<v Speaker 2>bp oil spill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was actually a boom of more fish </v>

1617
01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:17.741
<v Speaker 2>because they stopped fishing and fish </v>
<v Speaker 2>production went up or fish fish had a </v>

1618
01:22:17.741 --> 01:22:20.720
<v Speaker 2>chance to fuck and mate without getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>ripped out of the ocean by people eating</v>

1619
01:22:20.721 --> 01:22:23.510
<v Speaker 2>them for a season or somethings there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more fish.</v>

1620
01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then now it's like,</v>

1621
01:22:25.641 --> 01:22:26.720
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are they there?</v>

1622
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:30.050
<v Speaker 2>There were just a shit ton of fish here </v>
<v Speaker 2>at this exact same time last year.</v>

1623
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:32.780
<v Speaker 2>It tends to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1624
01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:33.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

1625
01:22:33.850 --> 01:22:35.900
<v Speaker 2>it's just a weather thing.</v>

1626
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you think of any other animal that</v>

1627
01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:43.690
<v Speaker 3>we would tolerate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catching and killing the way we tolerate</v>

1628
01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.720
<v Speaker 3>people catching and killing fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you think of any other animal we </v>

1629
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.441
<v Speaker 3>would tolerate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just got a bunch of machines like a </v>

1630
01:22:52.441 --> 01:22:54.130
<v Speaker 3>bunch of trucks and we'll get to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to attach a net to it.</v>

1631
01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.160
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to go run through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woods and this net is going to slice </v>

1632
01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.070
<v Speaker 3>down trees at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1633
01:23:00.071 --> 01:23:05.071
<v Speaker 3>And everything it captures in the net.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to eat every.</v>

1634
01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Now we kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of dolphins getting caught,</v>

1635
01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:14.071
<v Speaker 3>we've cut a couple joggers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some fucking asshole got caught in my </v>

1636
01:23:14.071 --> 01:23:14.440
<v Speaker 3>net geography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to catch elk.</v>

1637
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.370
<v Speaker 3>You stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1638
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't looking for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you treat people that are so stupid.</v>

1639
01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:20.160
<v Speaker 3>They get caught in the net the same way </v>
<v Speaker 3>they treat dolphins.</v>

1640
01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:21.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean by the time they get to and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold,</v>

1641
01:23:21.601 --> 01:23:23.470
<v Speaker 3>they're not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you got trampled to death.</v>

1642
01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The poor bastard.</v>

1643
01:23:24.701 --> 01:23:26.910
<v Speaker 3>He got caught up in the net right behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lcoe kick.</v>

1644
01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Kicking him in the head.</v>

1645
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd have a name for the joggers.</v>

1646
01:23:32.531 --> 01:23:34.740
<v Speaker 2>They calm like asphalt veal or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1647
01:23:38.370 --> 01:23:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Forest meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1648
01:23:40.211 --> 01:23:41.560
<v Speaker 2>like yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they call it?</v>

1649
01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Into the eating fruit bats and after </v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it Bush meat.</v>

1650
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they call it.</v>

1651
01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Like anything call the monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call bushmeat.</v>

1652
01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Bushmeat the least appealing name for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1653
01:23:52.181 --> 01:23:53.370
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1654
01:23:53.371 --> 01:23:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it is.</v>

1655
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:59.310
<v Speaker 2>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of you when you're fishing that </v>

1656
01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:02.100
<v Speaker 2>has to acknowledge the sadism that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening there because you're using a </v>

1657
01:24:02.111 --> 01:24:06.130
<v Speaker 2>device from the hellraiser movies to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Laura thing in.</v>

1658
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:08.530
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1659
01:24:08.531 --> 01:24:13.531
<v Speaker 2>and I know that ultimately we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>have compassion for all beings in and </v>

1660
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 2>wish them all a life free of violence.</v>

1661
01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:22.160
<v Speaker 3>But fish do eat other fish of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's my argument about bears.</v>

1662
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Whenever anybody was once say bears are </v>
<v Speaker 3>cute and like,</v>

1663
01:24:27.631 --> 01:24:30.990
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen one in real life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A in the real world and be.</v>

1664
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Do you know they eat babies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1665
01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.740
<v Speaker 3>They eat their own babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them.</v>

1666
01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just eat,</v>

1667
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:38.370
<v Speaker 3>they eat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If one of them dies,</v>

1668
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:41.760
<v Speaker 3>they just started eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't wait awhile back.</v>

1669
01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:42.600
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start eating,</v>

1670
01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:47.820
<v Speaker 2>but don't they eat the babies because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's not enough food for </v>

1671
01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.420
<v Speaker 2>all the babies and it makes more sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat.</v>

1672
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.920
<v Speaker 2>You're young than to waste resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>where everyone starves.</v>

1673
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I thought that's why they can't.</v>

1674
01:24:55.540 --> 01:25:00.540
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The males eat just because they like to </v>

1675
01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:01.660
<v Speaker 3>eat babies and they like to stop the </v>
<v Speaker 3>babies from breeding.</v>

1676
01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.430
<v Speaker 3>Of course they don't know what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1677
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.610
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what the real motivation</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1678
01:25:06.611 --> 01:25:09.310
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guesses because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't ask the bears obviously,</v>

1679
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.560
<v Speaker 3>but they are pretty pretty sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of factors.</v>

1680
01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:18.070
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the males will kill the bears.</v>

1681
01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:23.130
<v Speaker 3>The cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're hungry sometimes the </v>

1682
01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:26.041
<v Speaker 3>mail and they're easy to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can just go and grab them and eat </v>

1683
01:25:26.041 --> 01:25:26.041
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they might do it because of that.</v>

1684
01:25:26.041 --> 01:25:30.810
<v Speaker 3>They might do it sometimes because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to bring the female back to estrus </v>

1685
01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:34.050
<v Speaker 3>social one to fuck and Shawana have more</v>
<v Speaker 3>babies so they can come because </v>

1686
01:25:34.050 --> 01:25:35.350
<v Speaker 3>otherwise she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't want to let the fucker.</v>

1687
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:39.410
<v Speaker 3>She got her babies around the darkest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>darkest way.</v>

1688
01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Dolphins do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dolphins do the same thing.</v>

1689
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.440
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why female </v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphins are so promiscuous.</v>

1690
01:25:44.441 --> 01:25:49.441
<v Speaker 3>Apparently they studied dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They found that that female dolphins </v>

1691
01:25:49.441 --> 01:25:49.480
<v Speaker 3>will have sex with as many males as they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

1692
01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.840
<v Speaker 3>so that way when they have babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody knows whose babies who so they </v>

1693
01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.651
<v Speaker 3>leave her alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if she has babies and their babies </v>

1694
01:25:58.651 --> 01:26:00.340
<v Speaker 3>and you know that you never fucked her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just killed the babies.</v>

1695
01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:03.100
<v Speaker 3>God Damn Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's dolphins.</v>

1696
01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Sweetest things ever smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not always smiling when they're killing </v>

1697
01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:10.170
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking,</v>

1698
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.440
<v Speaker 3>you know they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>

1699
01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:13.520
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean it doesn't happen every </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1700
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:15.320
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen all over the dolphin </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1701
01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's been observed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Roger,</v>

1702
01:26:17.031 --> 01:26:20.120
<v Speaker 3>why are you smiling like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like bears though bears.</v>

1703
01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:22.580
<v Speaker 3>It's 100 percent like the males come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1704
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:26.660
<v Speaker 3>It's Steven Rinella was explained this </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me and he knows a lot about bears and</v>

1705
01:26:26.661 --> 01:26:31.661
<v Speaker 3>when I was in that bear hunting camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had seen a bear cub and then it was</v>

1706
01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:36.701
<v Speaker 3>eating it and then the mother came back </v>

1725
01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because a lot of</v>

1726
01:27:42.161 --> 01:27:45.250
<v Speaker 1>musicians who are comics aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good musicians.</v>

1727
01:27:45.251 --> 01:27:48.700
<v Speaker 1>They just know how to play a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of guitar and after to make it work,</v>

1728
01:27:48.701 --> 01:27:51.160
<v Speaker 1>but he's actually a really good musician</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of it.</v>

1729
01:27:51.161 --> 01:27:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

1730
01:27:51.911 --> 01:27:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Like he couldn't do like love songs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be awesome.</v>

1731
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.210

1750
01:28:39.561 --> 01:28:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Let's take over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

1751
01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can white,</v>

<v Speaker 1>chicken</v>

1754
01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:50.650
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the pod.</v>

1755
01:28:50.651 --> 01:28:55.651
<v Speaker 3>Does it turn into a chicken though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they just call it something </v>

1756
01:28:55.651 --> 01:28:55.651
<v Speaker 3>different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is bad ass.</v>

1758
01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a video game.</v>

1759
01:28:57.011 --> 01:28:58.340
<v Speaker 1>We probably won't get pulled over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video game.</v>

1760
01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.060
<v Speaker 1>You're not playing this are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't play this now.</v>

1761
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.030
<v Speaker 1>This is a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do</v>

1762
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.260
<v Speaker 4>you want to get credit for it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that.</v>

1763
01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:08.220
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that to Brian pulled that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought you weren't playing.</v>

1764
01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:10.940
<v Speaker 4>I thought only we were watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not full screen and it's just a</v>

1765
01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.100
<v Speaker 4>video we're getting pulled so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

1766
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:19.280
<v Speaker 4>If you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody doesn't want you playing their </v>

1767
01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.730
<v Speaker 4>video on a another video because then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you won't go to see their video.</v>

1768
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea behind it that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking hits from them.</v>

1769
01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.280
<v Speaker 4>So like pretty much anytime you play a </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube video or any sort of nature of </v>

1770
01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.460
<v Speaker 4>video or any sort of video that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a copyright on,</v>

1771
01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:32.670
<v Speaker 4>you can get pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is one.</v>

1772
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what fair use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fair use is very fucking,</v>

1773
01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:37.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you talk about fair use,</v>

1774
01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:40.350
<v Speaker 4>like you can play some things if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing commentary over them.</v>

1775
01:29:40.351 --> 01:29:45.351
<v Speaker 4>That's fair use or I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand it better to avoid </v>

1776

<v Speaker 5>my dk two or the oculus rift?</v>

1829
01:32:12.581 --> 01:32:13.430
<v Speaker 5>Alien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scared.</v>

1830
01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.730
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you heard of that?</v>

1831
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.490
<v Speaker 5>I've heard it gives people fucking heart</v>
<v Speaker 5>attacks the alien.</v>

1832
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:19.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I've heard.</v>

1833
01:32:19.481 --> 01:32:21.670
<v Speaker 5>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard people say literally,</v>

1834
01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:27.010
<v Speaker 5>I've got to stop saying literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I literally have to stop saying </v>

1835
01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:29.521
<v Speaker 5>literally have to stop saying fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't say stop for whatever reason it </v>

1836
01:32:29.521 --> 01:32:31.930
<v Speaker 5>gets close to heart attack level with </v>
<v Speaker 5>some people.</v>

1837
01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.540
<v Speaker 5>There's people that are doing it that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are worrying like,</v>

1838
01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:36.820
<v Speaker 5>well this might actually cause a heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>attack.</v>

1839
01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:42.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody used put it on my ass screen </v>

1840
01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:46.860
<v Speaker 5>when the fucking thing gets yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the rudimentary technology.</v>

1841
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:51.990
<v Speaker 5>If you could feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel that tailed fucking piercing your </v>

1842
01:32:52.211 --> 01:32:54.490
<v Speaker 5>neck or that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or if you have some sort of suit,</v>

1843
01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:59.760
<v Speaker 5>you're wearing some suit and it likes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>puts pressure on you in the areas where </v>

1844
01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.661
<v Speaker 5>the thing's supposed to bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when it comes out and grabs you </v>

1845
01:33:03.661 --> 01:33:05.070
<v Speaker 5>like you feel hands on your shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cube.</v>

1846
01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.580
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How would a freak out?</v>

1847
01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:08.830
<v Speaker 5>That would be if it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it gets you,</v>

1848
01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 5>it pops up and just grabs your shoulders</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're wearing this suit.</v>

1849
01:33:13.190 --> 01:33:18.190
<v Speaker 5>This suit is like finger press buttons </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the shoulders and it pushes down on </v>

1850
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:20.680
<v Speaker 5>you and you feel it as this thing is in </v>
<v Speaker 5>front of you.</v>

1851
01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:26.730
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tongue comes out right before it brains </v>

1852
01:33:26.730 --> 01:33:26.730
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You feel the hands on your shoulders.</v>

1853
01:33:26.730 --> 01:33:31.530
<v Speaker 5>I bet this suit comes with like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>special place where you could hang your </v>

1854
01:33:31.530 --> 01:33:31.530
<v Speaker 5>diaper inside.</v>

1855
01:33:31.530 --> 01:33:35.850
<v Speaker 5>Kids this naturally evacuate their vows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably warn you to give yourself </v>

1856
01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.750
<v Speaker 5>an enema before you play with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1857
01:33:37.751 --> 01:33:42.751
<v Speaker 5>you will shit yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to shoot yourself percent </v>

1858
01:33:42.751 --> 01:33:42.980
<v Speaker 5>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll shoot yourself just probably like</v>

1859
01:33:42.981 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a thick wet suit,</v>

1860
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:50.310
<v Speaker 5>like an armor plated wetsuit and you zip</v>
<v Speaker 5>it all the way up to the top and </v>

1861
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.530
<v Speaker 5>everything that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You in the game,</v>

1862
01:33:50.531 --> 01:33:52.120
<v Speaker 5>you feel it in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1863
01:33:52.121 --> 01:33:57.121
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking forward to the new people </v>
<v Speaker 5>have been speculating about having these</v>

1864
01:33:59.081 --> 01:34:04.081
<v Speaker 5>vr goggles on airplanes so that when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>put them on you can see the outside of </v>

1865
01:34:04.571 --> 01:34:06.760
<v Speaker 5>the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's the inside of the plane,</v>

1866
01:34:06.761 --> 01:34:07.990
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:34:07.991 --> 01:34:12.991
<v Speaker 5>And also they're talking about using a </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of projector technology and planes </v>

1868
01:34:12.991 --> 01:34:15.340
<v Speaker 5>that projects the outside of the school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen that.</v>

1869
01:34:15.341 --> 01:34:20.341
<v Speaker 5>I saw the images of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have a working plane right </v>

1870
01:34:20.341 --> 01:34:20.341
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

1871
01:34:20.341 --> 01:34:20.840
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just makes sense.</v>

1872
01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:23.680
<v Speaker 5>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm going to say this is a stupid</v>

1873
01:34:23.681 --> 01:34:27.490
<v Speaker 5>thing for me to say because like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>most technologically advanced thing that</v>

1874
01:34:27.491 --> 01:34:32.491
<v Speaker 5>I've done recently is figured out that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>could put marijuana drops into my </v>

1875
01:34:32.491 --> 01:34:35.050
<v Speaker 5>smoothies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I realized that like I am always like,</v>

1876
01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>railing against people,</v>

1877
01:34:36.701 --> 01:34:39.700
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm playing dragon age and like drinking</v>

1878
01:34:39.701 --> 01:34:42.610
<v Speaker 5>marijuana smoothies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that being said,</v>

1879
01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:47.850
<v Speaker 5>it seems easy to project outside of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>plane onto the inside of a plane based </v>

1880
01:34:48.491 --> 01:34:50.770
<v Speaker 5>on what you could even buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Brookstone,</v>

1881
01:34:50.771 --> 01:34:55.270
<v Speaker 5>they have those projectors heavy sell </v>
<v Speaker 5>fun.</v>

1882
01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:56.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what it looks like.</v>

1883
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 5>We're looking at a picture of it right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now and</v>

1884
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.980
<v Speaker 1>it's the inside of the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roof and the two sides are all like </v>

1885
01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:06.110
<v Speaker 1>a giant screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it looks like totally seamless.</v>

1886
01:35:06.111 --> 01:35:11.111
<v Speaker 1>Like you could see the sky and they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras apparently on the top of these </v>

1887
01:35:11.111 --> 01:35:14.861
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That project everything that's actually </v>

1888
01:35:14.861 --> 01:35:14.861
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if a plane was beside you,</v>

1889
01:35:14.861 --> 01:35:16.070
<v Speaker 1>you would be able to see the plane in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hd,</v>

1890
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:17.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

1891
01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that would be the best way to fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1892
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:24.050
<v Speaker 1>You hijack that thing and you like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got hackers onboard,</v>

1893
01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:29.051
<v Speaker 1>they hacked that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they show Ufo is everywhere and </v>

1894
01:35:29.051 --> 01:35:29.840
<v Speaker 1>everybody starts freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1895
01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:31.500
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 20 flights.</v>

1896
01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Are you not seeing this is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing now.</v>

1897
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see him.</v>

1898
01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred people are screaming.</v>

1899
01:35:41.490 --> 01:35:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Land the plane at dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs.</v>

1900
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1901
01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.490
<v Speaker 1>she wrecks or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1902
01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:51.910
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be the act,</v>

1903
01:35:51.930 --> 01:35:53.630
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're flying through either.</v>

1904
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:57.760
<v Speaker 1>It could be like an ace space project </v>
<v Speaker 1>space out there.</v>

1905
01:35:57.850 --> 01:36:00.080
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're flying through </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and the plane,</v>

1906
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:02.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have like an Avatar plane.</v>

1907
01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:04.730
<v Speaker 1>We're flying through like the Avatar </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

1908
01:36:04.731 --> 01:36:07.460
<v Speaker 1>You've seen the fucking dragons around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you as you're flying.</v>

1909
01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:12.660
<v Speaker 1>H Like James Cameron can have his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>airlines and you can have the full </v>

1910
01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:16.541
<v Speaker 1>avatar flight experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine how fucking cool that would </v>

1911
01:36:16.541 --> 01:36:16.541
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

1912
01:36:16.541 --> 01:36:21.101
<v Speaker 1>It's like a ride all the way to like New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York is five and a half hours of Avatar.</v>

1913
01:36:21.501 --> 01:36:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Monsters flying around the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bad ass.</v>

1914
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:26.450
<v Speaker 1>So bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked down.</v>

1915
01:36:26.490 --> 01:36:28.830
<v Speaker 1>You'd see the forest everywhere you </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked down it's program.</v>

1916
01:36:28.831 --> 01:36:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you see like those Navi running </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

1917
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:33.620
<v Speaker 1>jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swinging from ropes and shit,</v>

1918
01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:36.140
<v Speaker 1>shooting arrows at a game component?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1919
01:36:36.141 --> 01:36:41.141
<v Speaker 1>you could treat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be shooting them with machine </v>

1920
01:36:41.141 --> 01:36:43.070
<v Speaker 1>guns or lazy or you're in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>immersed in the world.</v>

1921
01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Everybody in every seat has their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>avatar and they're flying through this </v>

1922
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 1>sky and you just look up and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>

1923
01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just an infinite screen above you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck a roof.</v>

1924
01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Fuck a roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the whole thing's a screen.</v>

1925
01:36:55.230 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Why do you only have screens here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and a little bit here?</v>

1926
01:36:58.210 --> 01:36:59.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing's a screen.</v>

1927
01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know that.</v>

1928
01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.410
<v Speaker 1>And what do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who make you put your phone,</v>

1929
01:37:03.411 --> 01:37:04.460
<v Speaker 1>someone's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruin it.</v>

1930
01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Like guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the safety people be like,</v>

1931
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:09.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no way we're projecting shit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

1932
01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:12.720
<v Speaker 1>These are fart tubes that make people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to kill themselves.</v>

1933
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:15.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would happen.</v>

1934

<v Speaker 5>How that's what we're talking about.</v>

1977
01:39:01.281 --> 01:39:04.860
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about how the universe,</v>

1978
01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:10.160
<v Speaker 5>our subjective experience of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe is about to shift so radically </v>

1979
01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.550
<v Speaker 5>and so many different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if,</v>

1980
01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:16.820
<v Speaker 5>what's that new google thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're being so secretive about the </v>

1981
01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:16.820
<v Speaker 5>thing where you can see an elephant your</v>
<v Speaker 5>hand.</v>

1982
01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:17.580
<v Speaker 5>They're not talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1983
01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:19.680
<v Speaker 5>Google Hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look it up.</v>

1984
01:39:19.681 --> 01:39:24.681
<v Speaker 5>It's called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I keep forgetting it's called magic </v>

1985
01:39:24.681 --> 01:39:24.681
<v Speaker 5>something or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

1986
01:39:24.730 --> 01:39:29.730
<v Speaker 5>it's basically like some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an augmented reality that creates </v>

1987
01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:30.240
<v Speaker 5>a.</v>

1988
01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.400
<v Speaker 5>apparently they're being so secretive </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

1989
01:39:32.401 --> 01:39:35.220
<v Speaker 5>People can only speculate based on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>patents that they've taken out.</v>

1990
01:39:35.221 --> 01:39:37.620
<v Speaker 5>And I think there's a few images that </v>
<v Speaker 5>might been released,</v>

1991
01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:43.100
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's some form of augmented reality </v>

1992
01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:46.430
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's coming off of your </v>

1993
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:48.981
<v Speaker 5>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's coming off of a </v>

1994
01:39:48.981 --> 01:39:48.981
<v Speaker 5>projector.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What it's coming.</v>

1995
01:39:48.981 --> 01:39:48.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Magic leap.</v>

1996
01:39:48.981 --> 01:39:52.440
<v Speaker 5>Look at that raised half a bill that see</v>
<v Speaker 5>the elephant your hand.</v>

1997
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:55.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's in the middle to see holograms,</v>

1998
01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:59.280
<v Speaker 5>lifelike looking holograms in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1999
01:39:59.281 --> 01:40:01.290
<v Speaker 5>and I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard,</v>

2000
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:06.320
<v Speaker 5>I know someone who supposedly saw it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just said it was the most </v>

2001
01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:06.810
<v Speaker 5>incredible thing they'd ever seen in </v>
<v Speaker 5>their life and the people who've seen it</v>

2002
01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:07.920
<v Speaker 5>are all like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2003
01:40:07.921 --> 01:40:09.420
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2004
01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:14.460
<v Speaker 5>this is a game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to watch people fuck in </v>

2005
01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:14.460
<v Speaker 5>your house.</v>

2006
01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:16.860
<v Speaker 5>That's what it's going to be on your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on your bed.</v>

2007
01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:18.660
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be watching like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little mini people.</v>

2008
01:40:18.661 --> 01:40:23.661
<v Speaker 5>Fuck like you're the king.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like Gulliver's travels like </v>

2009
01:40:23.661 --> 01:40:25.770
<v Speaker 5>landed on some beach and it's filled </v>
<v Speaker 5>with hot people in the fucking,</v>

2010
01:40:25.771 --> 01:40:28.140
<v Speaker 5>but they're only like three inches tall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

2011
01:40:28.770 --> 01:40:33.770
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be able to jerk off and </v>

2012
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:34.410
<v Speaker 5>have your own head projected onto the </v>
<v Speaker 5>top of your cock.</v>

2013
01:40:34.411 --> 01:40:38.640
<v Speaker 5>So when you come you like vomit is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dream.</v>

2014
01:40:38.850 --> 01:40:41.670
<v Speaker 5>Do you think they'll get it to a point </v>
<v Speaker 5>where when you come on the characters,</v>

2015
01:40:41.671 --> 01:40:43.140
<v Speaker 5>the characters who recommended you come </v>
<v Speaker 5>down on them?</v>

2016
01:40:43.890 --> 01:40:45.990
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>

2017
01:40:45.991 --> 01:40:48.630
<v Speaker 5>I'd progress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I programmed that into the game.</v>

2018
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:50.850
<v Speaker 5>Like how?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you know the new game,</v>

2019
01:40:50.851 --> 01:40:53.550
<v Speaker 5>if you play it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't play games too scared.</v>

2020
01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:54.020
<v Speaker 5>There's</v>

2021
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:59.030
<v Speaker 1>a game shadows of Mordor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this super fun game that has a </v>

2022
01:40:59.030 --> 01:41:02.320
<v Speaker 1>thing called the nemesis system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that if a look at this,</v>

2023
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:04.210
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

2024
01:41:04.211 --> 01:41:06.300
<v Speaker 1>it leaves shadows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little elephant.</v>

2025
01:41:06.301 --> 01:41:10.210
<v Speaker 1>That law that flies around your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A million dollars just for that.</v>

2026
01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.720
<v Speaker 1>What is this though that we're seeing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a real demonstration of it or is</v>

2027
01:41:13.721 --> 01:41:16.660
<v Speaker 1>this an artistic representation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the website.</v>

2028
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:18.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it does,</v>

2029
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:20.410
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2030
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:23.380
<v Speaker 1>it's time to bring magic back into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2031
01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:28.700
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology can be awesome sometimes the </v>

2032
01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:28.700
<v Speaker 1>best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mind bogglingly,</v>

2033
01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:33.661
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the best thing in life come </v>

2034
01:41:33.661 --> 01:41:35.701
<v Speaker 1>from the most unexpected places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us know what a world with </v>

2035
01:41:35.701 --> 01:41:38.200
<v Speaker 1>dragons and Unicorns and elves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairies is just a better world.</v>

2036
01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:43.230
<v Speaker 1>That is why we're summoning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antichrist to reign forever on this </v>

2037
01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:43.230
<v Speaker 1>planning window.</v>

2038
01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Back up to what they actually said </v>
<v Speaker 1>though what,</v>

2039
01:41:46.450 --> 01:41:49.570
<v Speaker 1>but right before the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go ahead.</v>

2040
01:41:49.690 --> 01:41:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Most of us know that a world with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons and Unicorns,</v>

2041
01:41:52.031 --> 01:41:54.100
<v Speaker 1>elves and fairies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a better world.</v>

2042
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:57.990
<v Speaker 1>That's so it's a crazy thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why we are using black magic.</v>

2043
01:41:58.750 --> 01:42:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Demons ended this dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen if we use technology </v>

2044
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:06.700
<v Speaker 1>to bring magic back into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're showing a kid,</v>

2045
01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:11.760
<v Speaker 1>have a couple of kids sitting around a </v>
<v Speaker 1>table in class and it looks like the </v>

2046
01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:12.940
<v Speaker 1>number of horses are flying around in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space above them and they're not wearing</v>

2047
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:15.700
<v Speaker 1>glasses or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this must be some kind of like.</v>

2048
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a projection technology some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean where's it coming out of?</v>

2049
01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:25.051
<v Speaker 1>This is what's weird mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know if these are real images </v>

2050
01:42:25.051 --> 01:42:25.051
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking with us.</v>

2051
01:42:25.051 --> 01:42:27.720
<v Speaker 1>This is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are just photoshop match and dude,</v>

2052
01:42:27.730 --> 01:42:31.920
<v Speaker 1>ballerinas dancing on a little girl's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed watching it.</v>

2053
01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Ballerinas go back up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2054
01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2055
01:42:38.651 --> 01:42:41.770
<v Speaker 1>A little girl's face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine watching a little tiny</v>

2056
01:42:41.771 --> 01:42:46.700
<v Speaker 1>man dance with swords in front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing some crazy ancient Ali Baba?</v>

2057
01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dance.</v>

2058
01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.830
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like four inches tall.</v>

2059
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:55.080
<v Speaker 1>It would be cool if they could give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>a touch of some kind at least like,</v>

2060
01:42:55.090 --> 01:43:00.090
<v Speaker 1>like if it's in your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could kind of feel it using maybe </v>

2061
01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:02.950
<v Speaker 1>moisture or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haptic technology by using air blasts.</v>

2062
01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:05.120
<v Speaker 1>You can simulate stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2063
01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:05.770
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2064
01:43:05.771 --> 01:43:10.771
<v Speaker 1>but you have to have a fan to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to get to a point </v>

2065
01:43:10.771 --> 01:43:13.621
<v Speaker 1>where they can actually like put </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in your mind that makes you </v>

2066
01:43:13.621 --> 01:43:14.920
<v Speaker 1>respond to the program so you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory input.</v>

2067
01:43:14.921 --> 01:43:17.070
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't really exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2068
01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:19.360
<v Speaker 1>That way you can know what it looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get attacked by wolves.</v>

2069
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Wizards or hiring wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put on this,</v>

2070
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:29.220
<v Speaker 1>you put on the suit and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a virtual reality scenario </v>

2071
01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:33.121
<v Speaker 1>where you were attacked by wolves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can literally feel them tearing you </v>

2072
01:43:33.121 --> 01:43:33.121
<v Speaker 1>apart when you take off the suit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>

2073
01:43:33.121 --> 01:43:35.590
<v Speaker 1>How about a feeling to take a nap inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Jina?</v>

2074
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:42.030
<v Speaker 1>What if you take a nap inside a vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then she enjoys it and she clamps </v>

2075
01:43:42.030 --> 01:43:42.030
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't breathe and you have no way of</v>

2076
01:43:42.030 --> 01:43:45.520
<v Speaker 1>telling her that she's crushing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she's really enjoying it,</v>

2077
01:43:45.521 --> 01:43:47.210
<v Speaker 1>so she keegan's you and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2078
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:55.870
<v Speaker 1>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure that when you get in there </v>

2079
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:55.870
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>

2080
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Be Safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh baby.</v>

2081
01:43:56.261 --> 01:44:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Your Vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So soft and amazing and welcoming.</v>

2082
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:02.210
<v Speaker 1>When I get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be like magic.</v>

2083
01:44:02.211 --> 01:44:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I want to just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2084
01:44:03.681 --> 01:44:04.910
<v Speaker 1>You'll let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2085
01:44:04.911 --> 01:44:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Just put your legs in first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a problem.</v>

2086
01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:08.930
<v Speaker 1>We have no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

2087
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>

2088
01:44:09.891 --> 01:44:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go all the way in,</v>

2089
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:12.640
<v Speaker 1>so I love you honey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

2090
01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Try to make you come under climate side </v>
<v Speaker 1>of her pussy and it feels too good and </v>

2091
01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:17.660
<v Speaker 1>she just.</v>

2092
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:24.590
<v Speaker 1>The last thing you see is what appears </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a skeletal hand because she's done</v>

2093
01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:28.790
<v Speaker 1>this many times before and it looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hippo,</v>

2094
01:44:29.250 --> 01:44:31.850
<v Speaker 1>a hippo mouth closing down on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's like.</v>

2095
01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:36.740
<v Speaker 1>She slammed just a wall of the roof of </v>
<v Speaker 1>her mouth,</v>

2096
01:44:36.741 --> 01:44:41.741
<v Speaker 1>like a giant meat press coming down on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body that is fucked.</v>

2097
01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:48.890
<v Speaker 1>The mouth of the vagina just closes down</v>
<v Speaker 1>like choking on saline,</v>

2098
01:44:48.891 --> 01:44:52.340
<v Speaker 1>on all the fluids in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just sort of like in this mucusy,</v>

2099
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:56.870
<v Speaker 1>all those baby pushing muscles just </v>
<v Speaker 1>smush your bones.</v>

2100
01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:02.320
<v Speaker 1>You feel that the pressure of her Posey </v>
<v Speaker 1>just ripping your shoulders off their </v>

2101
01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.520
<v Speaker 1>sockets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to kill you?</v>

2102
01:45:04.521 --> 01:45:09.521
<v Speaker 1>Maybe at like sucks you through a tunnel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shoots you into a surprise party </v>

2103
01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:14.530
<v Speaker 1>because I think women have been getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the short end of the stick for too long </v>

2104
01:45:14.530 --> 01:45:14.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's about time to start killing us </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their pussies.</v>

2105
01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to look at it from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view.</v>

2106
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Black widow style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2107
01:45:25.671 --> 01:45:30.671
<v Speaker 1>it is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you just described was birth and </v>

2108
01:45:30.671 --> 01:45:30.671
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:45:30.671 --> 01:45:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you maybe maybe the stuff they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how we all experience trauma from </v>

2110
01:45:35.691 --> 01:45:40.691
<v Speaker 1>being squeezed out of a pussy when we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies and don't have any muscles at all</v>

2111
01:45:40.791 --> 01:45:45.420
<v Speaker 1>and can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still residual trauma inside of us.</v>

2112
01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:50.460
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say that's like one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the root problems are their roots of a </v>

2113
01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:54.941
<v Speaker 1>lot of bad trips is that we still </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't gotten over that suffocating </v>

2114
01:45:54.941 --> 01:45:58.631
<v Speaker 1>moment of falling out of a floating ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water where we had all the food we </v>

2115
01:45:58.641 --> 01:46:02.090
<v Speaker 1>wanted and then squeeze through a tunnel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was so strong.</v>

2116
01:46:02.091 --> 01:46:07.091
<v Speaker 1>It matches our head out of shape that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a trauma and it's still encoded </v>

2117
01:46:07.551 --> 01:46:10.820
<v Speaker 1>inside of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible you're a baby,</v>

2118
01:46:10.821 --> 01:46:11.840
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>

2119
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:14.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're a human being.</v>

2120
01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:16.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a big brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a little tiny ass brain,</v>

2121
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:18.710
<v Speaker 1>but the brain is still taking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>signals.</v>

2122
01:46:18.711 --> 01:46:23.711
<v Speaker 1>You still know where your mom is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still feel good and getting the </v>

2123
01:46:23.711 --> 01:46:23.790
<v Speaker 1>nipple in your mouth like you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little tiny baby.</v>

2124
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:29.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of information that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going in and we just assume they forget </v>

2125
01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:33.340
<v Speaker 1>all the fucked up shit like the being </v>
<v Speaker 1>born into the world and the cold hands </v>

2126
01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:37.571
<v Speaker 1>of a doctor as he picks you up and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking going to light on his head and </v>

2127
01:46:37.571 --> 01:46:40.340
<v Speaker 1>just this big giant like a green alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing the oxygen mask.</v>

2128
01:46:40.341 --> 01:46:42.830
<v Speaker 1>This is what the alien abductions are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say,</v>

2129
01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:44.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a big fad.</v>

2130
01:46:44.841 --> 01:46:49.841
<v Speaker 1>Rebirthing ceremonies or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would get if you would there or do </v>

2131
01:46:49.841 --> 01:46:54.540
<v Speaker 1>something where you get to be born a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd get another chance to overcome the</v>

2132
01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:59.490
<v Speaker 1>ptsd that comes from being squeezed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a pussy into this dimension.</v>

2133
01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2134
01:47:01.621 --> 01:47:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

2135
01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it gets stuck in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

2136
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:08.410
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know either could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>

2137
01:47:08.411 --> 01:47:11.740
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a very likely scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the.</v>

2138
01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:17.020
<v Speaker 1>The brain's functional and it's the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic experience ever and you don't </v>

2139
01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:18.530
<v Speaker 1>have any context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

2140
01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Don't have any language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any knowledge of why </v>

2141
01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:26.781
<v Speaker 1>you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's explained what's going to </v>

2142
01:47:26.781 --> 01:47:26.781
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you're born.</v>

2143
01:47:26.781 --> 01:47:30.920
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be unbelievably traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been hearing this on top of that.</v>

2144
01:47:32.371 --> 01:47:37.371
<v Speaker 1>Add circumcision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the slice your fucking Dick </v>

2149

2152
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:01.860
<v Speaker 1>How long do they wait for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumcised?</v>

2153
01:48:01.861 --> 01:48:06.861
<v Speaker 1>They probably don't do it right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they definitely stick you with </v>

2154
01:48:06.861 --> 01:48:06.990
<v Speaker 1>needles right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They vaccinate you like instantly got.</v>

2155

<v Speaker 1>shove needles right into that baby's </v>

2156

<v Speaker 1>A fucking farm somewhere.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the toilet paper yet it just took a </v>

2180
01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:30.480
<v Speaker 1>giant farmer Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crap.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The macy aided mountaineering baby.</v>

2184
01:49:40.170 --> 01:49:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And then he's going to smack it to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it cry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the poor thing.</v>

2186
01:49:44.041 --> 01:49:46.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

2187
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Why did I do is like the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument one day for a new type of </v>

2188
01:49:53.411 --> 01:49:55.330
<v Speaker 3>birth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if they figure out what if they go,</v>

2189
01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.600
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've found something out about the </v>

2190
01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.090
<v Speaker 3>human psyche and although we were all </v>
<v Speaker 3>created a certain way and we can't avoid</v>

2191
01:50:01.091 --> 01:50:01.980
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we founded,</v>

2192
01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:07.020
<v Speaker 3>there's considerable trauma in a less </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely chance of enlightenment when you </v>

2193
01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:10.741
<v Speaker 3>come out through a pussy and that really</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to do it is we we do it </v>

2194
01:50:11.591 --> 01:50:16.591
<v Speaker 3>nice and slow and we're going to send </v>
<v Speaker 3>you information to your baby in a form </v>

2195
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:23.070
<v Speaker 3>of like a Nano Bot that delivers video </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to get your baby used to </v>

2196
01:50:23.111 --> 01:50:25.780
<v Speaker 3>how it's going to be born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to slowly be.</v>

2197
01:50:25.781 --> 01:50:30.781
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna be an opening in the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the roof and then some loving hands </v>

2198
01:50:30.781 --> 01:50:33.070
<v Speaker 3>are going to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take you to your mother who</v>

2199
01:50:33.071 --> 01:50:36.520
<v Speaker 3>will then be stitched up until they </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out one day they're gonna.</v>

2200
01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Figure out how to dissolve skin and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>reapply it,</v>

2201
01:50:39.010 --> 01:50:40.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2202
01:50:40.230 --> 01:50:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Not going to be stitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda teleports out a beam of </v>

2203
01:50:45.230 --> 01:50:47.170
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful music on a nice soft pillow,</v>

2204
01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.810
<v Speaker 3>vanilla scented candles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How Nice.</v>

2205
01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Like calming Indian music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2206
01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no singing,</v>

2207
01:50:56.290 --> 01:50:59.090
<v Speaker 3>fucking kids not ready for that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like the tire,</v>

2208
01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:02.710
<v Speaker 3>something sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like not aggressive at all,</v>

2209
01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:07.800
<v Speaker 3>and then they cut off the tip of it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they got a nice and calm </v>

2210
01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:14.130
<v Speaker 3>dunking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're never going to get it if you </v>

2211
01:51:14.130 --> 01:51:14.550
<v Speaker 3>don't get it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it now.</v>

2212
01:51:14.590 --> 01:51:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now imagine if they did that though,</v>

2213
01:51:16.511 --> 01:51:21.511
<v Speaker 3>if they brought the kid into the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this like feeling of soothing </v>

2214
01:51:21.511 --> 01:51:23.260
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a minor dose of Mbma,</v>

2215
01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:28.030
<v Speaker 3>just the tiniest dose of mdms while in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the womb so that as the kids being born,</v>

2216
01:51:28.031 --> 01:51:30.370
<v Speaker 3>it has no inhibitions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids being mean,</v>

2217
01:51:30.371 --> 01:51:31.500
<v Speaker 3>they have a little tiny bodies.</v>

2218
01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 3>It could be like it's a fucking like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pin head of Indian men,</v>

2219
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:39.270
<v Speaker 3>but they find out that not only is Mtma </v>
<v Speaker 3>when given to babies in the womb make </v>

2220
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:42.850
<v Speaker 3>for a better birth for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they all become super geniuses.</v>

2221
01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:48.040
<v Speaker 3>All those babies become the kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most likely have no emotional problems.</v>

2222
01:51:48.130 --> 01:51:51.190
<v Speaker 3>They have zero issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a jumpstart to enlightenment.</v>

2223
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:56.430
<v Speaker 3>Just give your baby a little extra seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so love that shit probably already </v>

2224
01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:56.430
<v Speaker 3>tripping now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2225
01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:56.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're,</v>

2226
01:51:56.441 --> 01:51:59.590
<v Speaker 3>I think babies are probably tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the tripping on though.</v>

2227
01:51:59.591 --> 01:52:00.840
<v Speaker 3>They're definitely not tripping on MDI.</v>

2228
01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:03.350
<v Speaker 2>No form that this is study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2229
01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:04.180
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2230
01:52:04.190 --> 01:52:09.190
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're separate from their mother at </v>

2231
01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:10.991
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand that there's a </v>

2232
01:52:10.991 --> 01:52:10.991
<v Speaker 2>separation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

2233
01:52:10.991 --> 01:52:14.060
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea of separation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that comes later down the </v>

2234
01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:17.261
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that this is me in that to you </v>

2235
01:52:17.261 --> 01:52:19.010
<v Speaker 2>is something that comes later down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>line and that,</v>

2236
01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:20.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2237
01:52:20.031 --> 01:52:23.270
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever taken a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nice dose of Lsd,</v>

2238
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:27.170
<v Speaker 2>the moment that goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that separation goes away.</v>

2239
01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.120
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever had that on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic,</v>

2240
01:52:29.121 --> 01:52:31.040
<v Speaker 2>that's surprising moment where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2241
01:52:31.041 --> 01:52:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm everything.</v>

2242
01:52:33.621 --> 01:52:37.490
<v Speaker 2>You just merge pure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They caught expansiveness.</v>

2243
01:52:37.491 --> 01:52:40.400
<v Speaker 2>The clear mind that is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate,</v>

2244
01:52:40.730 --> 01:52:43.400
<v Speaker 2>that is as great as it can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pure freedom.</v>

2245
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a pretty intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

2246
01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:49.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's experience that probably 80 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the people never have,</v>

2247
01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least probably more.</v>

2248
01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Probably more than 80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:52:55.050 --> 01:52:56.720
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the real problems with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2250
01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 2>One of the real problems of the world is</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like super intelligent people.</v>

2251
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of different people's stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>online,</v>

2252
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:07.010
<v Speaker 2>people that I don't agree with at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super left people,</v>

2253
01:53:07.011 --> 01:53:12.011
<v Speaker 2>super right people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of people's stuff and one </v>

2254
01:53:12.011 --> 01:53:15.791
<v Speaker 2>of the things that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always shocked at how angry and </v>

2255
01:53:15.791 --> 01:53:19.601
<v Speaker 2>Shitty a lot of really smart people can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be about fairly controversial or </v>

2256
01:53:19.601 --> 01:53:24.341
<v Speaker 2>debatable issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can be really angry and shitty </v>

2257
01:53:24.341 --> 01:53:26.660
<v Speaker 2>and insulting and I know they're smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm reading this and I'm like,</v>

2258
01:53:26.661 --> 01:53:29.750
<v Speaker 2>this just screams a lack of psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

2259
01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:35.060
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody has a psychedelic </v>

2260
01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:35.060
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four slash seven,</v>

2261
01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:36.680
<v Speaker 2>but usually even if you have like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment when you were in your car,</v>

2262
01:53:36.681 --> 01:53:38.810
<v Speaker 2>like we were joking about that the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>time you were driving,</v>

2263
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000
<v Speaker 2>the last time we were driving together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were driving and you like this </v>

2264
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:44.060
<v Speaker 2>fucking asshole.</v>

2265
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of my way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you started laughing.</v>

2266
01:53:46.621 --> 01:53:48.290
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to me man.</v>

2267
01:53:48.291 --> 01:53:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm always talking about peace and </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>

2268
01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Telling US old lane a buick to go fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself.</v>

2269
01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.840
<v Speaker 2>But we were joking and laughing around </v>
<v Speaker 2>while we were doing it,</v>

2270
01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:58.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2271
01:53:58.101 --> 01:53:59.840
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just natural.</v>

2272
01:53:59.841 --> 01:54:04.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean it still comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was able to catch it with you and </v>

2273
01:54:04.841 --> 01:54:06.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what mindfulness is the training </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can catch it.</v>

2274
01:54:06.231 --> 01:54:08.390
<v Speaker 2>At least we're after it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta go there.</v>

2275
01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I it fucking pattern again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know what you.</v>

2276
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

2277
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Some people haven't quite realized yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't have to be like that and</v>

2278
01:54:20.151 --> 01:54:25.151
<v Speaker 2>I know I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen these fucking twitter fights </v>

2279
01:54:25.151 --> 01:54:28.030
<v Speaker 2>between people that are supposedly super</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and somehow they devolve </v>

2280
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:29.990
<v Speaker 2>into like 10th graders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

2281
01:54:29.991 --> 01:54:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly embarrassing.</v>

2282
01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:34.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a social retardation is what it is.</v>

2283
01:54:34.951 --> 01:54:36.930
<v Speaker 3>It's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by social retardation,</v>

2284
01:54:36.931 --> 01:54:41.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean the most advanced social </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction that I ever get out of my </v>

2285
01:54:42.421 --> 01:54:45.630
<v Speaker 3>life is when I get high with my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether I get high with them,</v>

2286
01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:48.810
<v Speaker 3>whether it's mushrooms or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's regular,</v>

2287
01:54:48.811 --> 01:54:53.811
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of wonderful deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction you could have sober or not </v>

2288
01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:55.590
<v Speaker 3>sober,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you trip with somebody,</v>

2289
01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:00.750
<v Speaker 3>there's some intense bond of humanity </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens when you trip with them,</v>

2290
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:03.540
<v Speaker 3>but when it's over and you're laughing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

2291
01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:08.800
<v Speaker 3>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the social bond that's constructed </v>

2292
01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.520
<v Speaker 3>through those moments is pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>remarkable man.</v>

2293
01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:15.900
<v Speaker 3>And if you never experienced that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of feel bad.</v>

2294
01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:19.560
<v Speaker 3>I kind of feel bad because we all go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through great moments in life.</v>

2295
01:55:19.561 --> 01:55:24.561
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a defining thing where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to have it or you won't be </v>

2296
01:55:24.561 --> 01:55:26.370
<v Speaker 3>complete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is some next level shit.</v>

2297
01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really truly is some next level shit.</v>

2298
01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:32.910
<v Speaker 3>And it's some shit that a good 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the people are just not going</v>

2299
01:55:32.911 --> 01:55:33.270
<v Speaker 3>to experience.</v>

2300
01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I like to think that a hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people experience it because I </v>

2301
01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:41.881
<v Speaker 2>think it's what happens when you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like to believe that that death </v>

2302
01:55:41.881 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 2>experience is one of complete merging </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2303
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.150
<v Speaker 2>that like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the steve jobs.</v>

2304
01:55:48.151 --> 01:55:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2305
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:50.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I'd love to get.</v>

2306
01:55:50.770 --> 01:55:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Hi Richard Dawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's everyone's dream,</v>

2307
01:55:55.171 --> 01:55:55.470
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2308
01:55:55.530 --> 01:56:00.530
<v Speaker 3>That guy is so fucking smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so hostile with so little time left,</v>

2309
01:56:01.230 --> 01:56:02.550
<v Speaker 3>he's pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was always.</v>

2310
01:56:02.970 --> 01:56:07.970
<v Speaker 3>He was getting mad at these women who </v>
<v Speaker 3>were mad at the scientist for wearing </v>

2311
01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:12.340
<v Speaker 3>the shirt with the sexy ladies on it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2312
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:15.030
<v Speaker 3>he was like saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not real feminism.</v>

2313
01:56:15.031 --> 01:56:20.031
<v Speaker 3>The real feminists aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't be mad at some ridiculous </v>

2314
01:56:20.031 --> 01:56:20.031
<v Speaker 3>shirt.</v>

2315
01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

2316
01:56:21.561 --> 01:56:26.561
<v Speaker 2>That thing like here we have one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great moments in human history and as </v>

2317
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:33.070
<v Speaker 2>part of a byproduct of landing a probe </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a goddamn comment and already they're</v>

2318
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:39.950
<v Speaker 2>reporting that they found organic matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this comment indicating that the </v>

2319
01:56:41.481 --> 01:56:46.481
<v Speaker 2>entire universe is being pollinated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>these drifting mountains that have </v>

2320
01:56:46.481 --> 01:56:50.000
<v Speaker 2>within them precursors to life as part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a byproduct.</v>

2321
01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:55.360
<v Speaker 2>One of the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the magicians as far as I'm </v>

2322
01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.940
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the magician engaged in a ritual,</v>

2323
01:56:57.050 --> 01:57:00.290
<v Speaker 2>a sorcerer that someone is being out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dust,</v>

2324
01:57:01.570 --> 01:57:06.570
<v Speaker 2>like made the metal and the put the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wires and just the right way so that it </v>

2325
01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:10.831
<v Speaker 2>could get perfect orbit around a comment</v>
<v Speaker 2>going 400 miles an hour with harpoons.</v>

2326
01:57:11.031 --> 01:57:16.031
<v Speaker 2>That didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it had fucking harpoons there could </v>

2327
01:57:16.031 --> 01:57:18.671
<v Speaker 2>shoot into the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of these sourcer is the robe he was </v>

2328
01:57:18.671 --> 01:57:21.671
<v Speaker 2>wearing happen to have women on it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a byproduct instead of feminists and </v>

2329
01:57:23.361 --> 01:57:26.750
<v Speaker 2>people who aren't feminists and atheists</v>
<v Speaker 2>and theists all being like,</v>

2330
01:57:27.230 --> 01:57:30.800
<v Speaker 2>you sir are a bad motherfucker.</v>

2331
01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Got a Po box because I want to send you </v>
<v Speaker 2>some cigars or cakes or anything you </v>

2332
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:37.460
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You deserve to get showered with.</v>

2333
01:57:37.610 --> 01:57:41.720
<v Speaker 2>All of those scientists should just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting massages for weeks.</v>

2334
01:57:41.721 --> 01:57:43.700
<v Speaker 2>They should be getting whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

2335
01:57:43.701 --> 01:57:47.750
<v Speaker 2>They should pop her Razzi should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>following them out and snapping pictures</v>

2336
01:57:47.751 --> 01:57:49.610
<v Speaker 2>of them for what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

2337
01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:53.750
<v Speaker 2>we're still stuck in this stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency where a lot of us were like,</v>

2338
01:57:53.751 --> 01:57:57.860
<v Speaker 2>can you fucking believe you would wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>that tastes lists shirt.</v>

2339
01:57:58.190 --> 01:57:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even understand.</v>

2340
01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:02.000
<v Speaker 2>He could wear whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a scientist,</v>

2341
01:58:02.150 --> 01:58:03.980
<v Speaker 2>but fighting instead of everyone being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2342
01:58:03.981 --> 01:58:05.600
<v Speaker 2>we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We worked together.</v>

2343
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:09.620
<v Speaker 2>We got a thing to land on a comet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what else we can do.</v>

2344
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:11.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my favorite part of it.</v>

2345
01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Watching men criticize the shirt doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so purely for female Brownie points</v>

2346
01:58:19.370 --> 01:58:24.370
<v Speaker 3>doing it so clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched a twitter fight between a guy </v>

2347
01:58:24.370 --> 01:58:28.031
<v Speaker 3>who claims calls himself a feminist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some woman and the woman who loves pinup</v>

2348
01:58:28.791 --> 01:58:32.690
<v Speaker 3>girls and she loves a like a rockabilly </v>
<v Speaker 3>type shit,</v>

2349
01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:37.930
<v Speaker 3>which is the girl who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way the shirt was invented by a </v>

2350
01:58:37.930 --> 01:58:39.530
<v Speaker 3>girl or created put together by a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's similar patterns at one that</v>

2351
01:58:39.531 --> 01:58:44.531
<v Speaker 3>you sent me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the link which eventually to becoming </v>

2352
01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:44.531
<v Speaker 3>sold out.</v>

2353
01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:47.250
<v Speaker 1>It's slightly different than his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone informed me that they make </v>

2354
01:58:47.250 --> 01:58:49.120
<v Speaker 1>those shirts by hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what could be going on is like,</v>

2355
01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:54.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a pattern that you can buy and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put it together and they make the </v>

2356
01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:55.660
<v Speaker 1>shirt and this girl who's his friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought the pattern,</v>

2357
01:58:55.690 --> 01:58:56.610
<v Speaker 1>bought the shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2358
01:58:56.620 --> 01:59:01.620
<v Speaker 1>bought the cloth that has the sexy </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies on it and made her friend shirt </v>

2359
01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:02.620
<v Speaker 1>because he loves her or I assume he </v>
<v Speaker 1>loves her.</v>

2360
01:59:02.890 --> 01:59:07.660
<v Speaker 1>He wore her shirt on TV and he was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and celebrate.</v>

2361
01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:13.020
<v Speaker 1>What a sweetheart man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is how you know he's a </v>

2362
01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:13.020
<v Speaker 1>sweetheart the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of going,</v>

2363
01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:13.780
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my shirt.</v>

2364
01:59:13.781 --> 01:59:15.210
<v Speaker 1>You guys are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2365
01:59:15.211 --> 01:59:20.211
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there some real shit to be worried </v>

2366
01:59:20.211 --> 01:59:22.201
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys not pay attention to the </v>

2367
01:59:22.201 --> 01:59:22.201
<v Speaker 1>fact that we landed a comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl keeping this shirt?</v>

2368
01:59:22.201 --> 01:59:22.201
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's my friend.</v>

2369
01:59:22.201 --> 01:59:26.971
<v Speaker 1>I did it for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's the equivalent of like </v>

2370
01:59:26.971 --> 01:59:26.971
<v Speaker 1>giving someone a shout out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2371
01:59:26.971 --> 01:59:29.200
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women like these kinds of shirts too,</v>

2372
01:59:29.201 --> 01:59:34.201
<v Speaker 1>but some people think that like you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the sex and fun and comedy out </v>

2373
01:59:35.321 --> 01:59:39.400
<v Speaker 1>of science and that a guy can have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and be a fucking Weirdo with</v>

2374
01:59:39.401 --> 01:59:41.580
<v Speaker 1>a bowling shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has all the sexy women on it.</v>

2375
01:59:41.590 --> 01:59:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a hero and I think he's one</v>

2376
01:59:45.341 --> 01:59:50.341
<v Speaker 1>of the coolest guys on earth today </v>
<v Speaker 1>because not only did he take part in </v>

2377
01:59:50.341 --> 01:59:50.960
<v Speaker 1>getting that fucking thing to land on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comet,</v>

2378
01:59:50.961 --> 01:59:55.961
<v Speaker 1>but he had the balls on the day that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing could not have maybe failed </v>

2379
01:59:56.710 --> 01:59:58.780
<v Speaker 1>to wear that shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2380
01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It could have fucking not worked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at that guy and there was that</v>

2381
02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:02.410
<v Speaker 1>true though.</v>

2382
02:00:02.410 --> 02:00:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Do we know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he,</v>

2383
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:08.620
<v Speaker 1>did he wear it the day that the project?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my understanding,</v>

2384

<v Speaker 3>comad scientists love gay guys that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>there just in the house.</v>

2437
02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:35.670

<v Speaker 5>I don't know kid,</v>

2439
02:02:41.150 --> 02:02:44.841
<v Speaker 5>floating mountain that has priori pre </v>
<v Speaker 5>precursors to human life on it.</v>

2440
02:02:44.970 --> 02:02:47.550
<v Speaker 5>How about that friend?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard you say homo.</v>

2441
02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:49.920

<v Speaker 5>I didn't hear all that other stuff.</v>

2442
02:02:49.921 --> 02:02:52.710
<v Speaker 5>You said Homo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Homo is derogatory.</v>

2443
02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:57.000
<v Speaker 5>Who cares what happens up in space?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we can't have freedom down here,</v>

2444
02:02:57.510 --> 02:03:02.510
<v Speaker 5>freedom to not be abused by assholes </v>
<v Speaker 5>with derogatory language use can still </v>

2445
02:03:02.671 --> 02:03:03.120
<v Speaker 5>say home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

02:03:03.121 --> 02:03:03.640
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2447
02:03:03.650 --> 02:03:05.790
<v Speaker 5>I've never been criticized for saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>homo.</v>

2448
02:03:05.970 --> 02:03:09.420
<v Speaker 5>No one's come after me for saying Homo </v>
<v Speaker 5>homos themselves.</v>

2449
02:03:09.421 --> 02:03:11.890
<v Speaker 5>Like Justin Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dale gave me a home El.</v>

2450

<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did.</v>

2452
02:03:13.861 --> 02:03:15.740
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he did,</v>

2453
02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:18.700
<v Speaker 5>but he would not come.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2454
02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:20.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying it now because I know </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be tensions.</v>

2455
02:03:20.971 --> 02:03:24.170
<v Speaker 5>The most important that the idea another</v>
<v Speaker 5>in here.</v>

2456
02:03:24.210 --> 02:03:26.670
<v Speaker 5>What's not here in the intention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2457
02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:28.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing that content.</v>

2458

2459
02:03:29.850 --> 02:03:34.850

<v Speaker 3>What's important is gender equality </v>

2460
02:03:34.850 --> 02:03:35.880
<v Speaker 3>overall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that becomes 100 percent across the</v>

2461
02:03:35.881 --> 02:03:37.680
<v Speaker 3>board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we can worry about your intention.</v>

2462
02:03:38.130 --> 02:03:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Right now it's about controlling </v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

2463
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2464
02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:44.280
<v Speaker 5>It's about you not being an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

2465
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000
<v Speaker 5>It's like the voice of all the things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like if all the blogs on earth </v>

2466
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.320
<v Speaker 5>formed into some monster and attack the </v>
<v Speaker 5>city,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the blogs on earth got together and </v>

2468
02:03:57.321 --> 02:03:58.530
<v Speaker 5>became an organism,</v>

2469
02:03:58.980 --> 02:04:01.410

<v Speaker 5>If Tumbler was a living creature,</v>

2470
02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:08.440
<v Speaker 3>it would just.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and it would just be screaming into the </v>

2472
02:04:11.411 --> 02:04:11.411

<v Speaker 5>recreational bitterness,</v>

02:06:33.690 --> 02:06:38.130
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this isn't a recreational bitterness and</v>

2533
02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:54.750
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Recreational betterness.</v>

2534
02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:56.750
<v Speaker 5>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2537
02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:00.960
<v Speaker 5>One of them said that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember which one.</v>

2538
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:05.520
<v Speaker 5>There's two.</v>

2541
02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:10.200
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>recreational bitterness,</v>

2542
02:07:10.201 --> 02:07:15.201
<v Speaker 5>how?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like that thing where you get </v>

2543
02:07:15.201 --> 02:07:17.181
<v Speaker 5>around a group of people and your </v>
<v Speaker 5>primary topic of conversation is what's </v>

2544
02:07:17.181 --> 02:07:18.960
<v Speaker 5>wrong in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Recreational betterness.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2547
02:07:22.531 --> 02:07:24.220
<v Speaker 5>where you just kind of accidentally go </v>

<v Speaker 5>that fucking idiot.</v>

2551
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.640
<v Speaker 5>Rebecca Solnit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speaking to her allies,</v>

2559
02:07:50.450 --> 02:07:51.820
<v Speaker 3>Rebecca Solnit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or she might've been,</v>

2560
02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:56.290
<v Speaker 3>she must've been quoting this person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got into 2012.</v>

2561
02:07:57.500 --> 02:07:59.590
<v Speaker 3>We looked it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she might've been quoting this other</v>

2562
02:07:59.591 --> 02:08:00.280
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying,</v>

2563
02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:02.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean I didn't read into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever,</v>

2564
02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:05.170
<v Speaker 3>either whoever created it all praise be </v>

<v Speaker 3>be fat.</v>

2566
02:08:07.781 --> 02:08:09.730
<v Speaker 3>And point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking awesome quote.</v>

2567
02:08:09.731 --> 02:08:11.470
<v Speaker 3>Recreational bitterness is some real </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2568
02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:13.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to any comedy club.</v>

2569
02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk to the guys were like on the </v>

2570
02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:19.260
<v Speaker 3>outskirts especially that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get in.</v>

2571
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:24.350
<v Speaker 2>It's the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the water they swim in and it's so </v>

2572
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:27.231
<v Speaker 2>sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like when you realize how it's </v>

2573
02:08:27.231 --> 02:08:27.420
<v Speaker 2>infected your own life in the small </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

2574
02:08:27.421 --> 02:08:32.421
<v Speaker 2>like it's the smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why mindfulness is good </v>

2575
02:08:32.421 --> 02:08:33.240
<v Speaker 2>because you just sort of watch yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next time you find yourself</v>

2576
02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:38.250
<v Speaker 2>bringing out some old bones to chew on </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your friends and you're just saying</v>

2577
02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:40.560
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what are you referring to yourself?</v>

2578
02:08:40.561 --> 02:08:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this idiot want?</v>

2579
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:45.680
<v Speaker 2>God is say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2580
02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:49.350
<v Speaker 2>you look at the content of your language</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it and it's like,</v>

2581
02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:54.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go into the idea that the </v>

2582
02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:54.620
<v Speaker 2>universe conforms to the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe it,</v>

2583
02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:58.940
<v Speaker 2>then that is a very dangerous modality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get in to get into because maybe you're </v>

2584
02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:03.291
<v Speaker 2>actually coloring the world with your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your linguistic farts.</v>

2585
02:09:03.451 --> 02:09:08.451
<v Speaker 2>The constant degradation of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe that you're in as a kind of </v>

2586
02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:09.990
<v Speaker 2>habitual fun</v>

2587
02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:14.080
<v Speaker 3>will you for sure taint taint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you.</v>

2588
02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:18.050
<v Speaker 3>You interact with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You come in contact with every person.</v>

2589
02:09:18.051 --> 02:09:20.690
<v Speaker 3>You come in contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every situation you find yourself in,</v>

2590
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:23.870
<v Speaker 3>you're in control of what kind of energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes out of you.</v>

2591
02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:28.960
<v Speaker 3>In that scenario and just in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk about the ripple effect of the </v>

2592
02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:33.200
<v Speaker 3>savages that created humanity and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's affecting us today.</v>

2593
02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Also every like good thing you do or </v>
<v Speaker 3>every good interaction that you have or </v>

2594
02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:40.820
<v Speaker 3>every great experience that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>with other people,</v>

2595
02:09:40.821 --> 02:09:44.870
<v Speaker 3>that spreads out in a good way and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>more you do that,</v>

2596
02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:49.130
<v Speaker 3>the more those people might likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned from that experience that that's</v>

2597
02:09:49.131 --> 02:09:51.620
<v Speaker 3>a good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then do it in turn to other people,</v>

2598
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:54.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the nicest fucking compliments</v>

2599
02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:58.820
<v Speaker 3>anybody ever gives me when I go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy clubs or wherever is how generous</v>

2600
02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:00.250
<v Speaker 3>the people that come to the shows are.</v>

2601
02:10:00.970 --> 02:10:02.480
<v Speaker 3>It's because we talk about it all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2602
02:10:02.481 --> 02:10:05.600
<v Speaker 3>You to have talked about it many times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving nice tips for people,</v>

2603
02:10:05.810 --> 02:10:10.810
<v Speaker 3>being friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people sincerely letting people know </v>

2604
02:10:10.810 --> 02:10:11.510
<v Speaker 3>that you're happy with what they've done</v>
<v Speaker 3>or who they are.</v>

2605
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:14.750
<v Speaker 3>Or when you do that and you show like </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendship.</v>

2606
02:10:14.830 --> 02:10:19.830
<v Speaker 3>And just a real genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unselfish gratitude when you do that or </v>

2607
02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:23.360
<v Speaker 3>a generosity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>

2608
02:10:23.361 --> 02:10:26.240
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can create a whole world where other</v>

2609
02:10:26.241 --> 02:10:31.241
<v Speaker 3>people start doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people around you start doing that </v>

2610
02:10:31.241 --> 02:10:31.241
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe the waitress,</v>

2611
02:10:31.241 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 3>she gave her a $50 tip for a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee and a donut and she's</v>

2612
02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:34.700
<v Speaker 5>gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2613
02:10:34.701 --> 02:10:39.701
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason gives somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 5>a tip or give somebody some advice that </v>

2614
02:10:39.711 --> 02:10:42.950
<v Speaker 5>you want our help a friend or you feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>inspired to be nice.</v>

2615
02:10:42.951 --> 02:10:44.390
<v Speaker 5>And who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows,</v>

2616
02:10:44.391 --> 02:10:46.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you help a friend move and you do it all</v>

2617
02:10:46.641 --> 02:10:48.110
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And selflessly,</v>

2618
02:10:48.111 --> 02:10:53.111
<v Speaker 5>and you take your time out of your day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that friend might be a fucking mover </v>

2619
02:10:53.111 --> 02:10:53.240
<v Speaker 5>helper for life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That might be like,</v>

2620
02:10:53.241 --> 02:10:58.241
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dunkin fucking got up at nine in the </v>

2621
02:10:58.241 --> 02:10:58.241
<v Speaker 5>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>met me at my house,</v>

2622
02:10:58.241 --> 02:10:59.000
<v Speaker 5>helped me get the rental truck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never asked for any money,</v>

2623
02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:00.010
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2624
02:11:00.011 --> 02:11:05.011
<v Speaker 5>and he helped me all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was dedicated to help me move my </v>

2625
02:11:05.011 --> 02:11:05.330
<v Speaker 5>fucking shit out of my apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do that for everybody now.</v>

2626
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:07.580
<v Speaker 5>And what a great feeling it is when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing that,</v>

2627
02:11:07.581 --> 02:11:12.581
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so cool and you're so good to get </v>

2628
02:11:12.581 --> 02:11:12.581
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

2629
02:11:12.581 --> 02:11:16.940
<v Speaker 5>It's so nice when it's effortless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when you practice mindfulness </v>

2630
02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:21.190
<v Speaker 5>in the midst of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get to watch the parts of yourself </v>

2631
02:11:21.190 --> 02:11:22.240
<v Speaker 5>that do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or is it because no matter how many,</v>

2632
02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:27.380
<v Speaker 5>maybe you're a supremely awakened being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there you're still going to have </v>

2633
02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:31.510
<v Speaker 5>this kind of psychic indigestion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're in the midst of helping or </v>

2634
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:35.381
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might notice certain selfish </v>

2635
02:11:35.381 --> 02:11:35.381
<v Speaker 5>thoughts start emerging about wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get something back from it.</v>

2636
02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:40.450
<v Speaker 5>And you can't blame yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were raised in a system of exchange.</v>

2637
02:11:40.551 --> 02:11:41.870
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you give me this,</v>

2638
02:11:41.871 --> 02:11:43.640
<v Speaker 5>I give you this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you hurt me this way,</v>

2639
02:11:43.641 --> 02:11:48.641
<v Speaker 5>I hurt you that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there a momentum in the direction of </v>

2640
02:11:48.641 --> 02:11:51.461
<v Speaker 5>selfishness that comes from a lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 5>of conditioning and that's why if you </v>

2641
02:11:51.461 --> 02:11:54.260
<v Speaker 5>put yourself in a situation where you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>giving to someone and add mindfulness to</v>

2642
02:11:54.261 --> 02:11:59.261
<v Speaker 5>the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll start learning a lot about </v>

2643
02:11:59.261 --> 02:12:01.421
<v Speaker 5>yourself and see your resistance to </v>
<v Speaker 5>purely being in that a complete state of</v>

2644
02:12:01.971 --> 02:12:04.880
<v Speaker 5>just letting it go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>giving it away,</v>

2645
02:12:05.090 --> 02:12:10.090
<v Speaker 5>believing that we exist in a universe of</v>
<v Speaker 5>pure abundance where there is not a </v>

2646
02:12:10.090 --> 02:12:13.661
<v Speaker 5>limited supply,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but an infinite supply and the ghost </v>

2647
02:12:13.661 --> 02:12:16.871
<v Speaker 5>story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the echo of the savages is one of its </v>

2648
02:12:16.871 --> 02:12:16.871
<v Speaker 5>primary components.</v>

2649
02:12:16.871 --> 02:12:20.180
<v Speaker 5>Talks about a universe where everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>is limited and can go away and therefore</v>

2650
02:12:20.181 --> 02:12:25.181
<v Speaker 5>you must constantly be on the defense </v>
<v Speaker 5>when maybe the new story is one where </v>

2651
02:12:25.181 --> 02:12:25.181
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2652
02:12:25.181 --> 02:12:27.290
<v Speaker 5>we live in an infinite universe of pure </v>
<v Speaker 5>abundance.</v>

2653
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:32.470
<v Speaker 5>And the more you surrender to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more selfless you become and the </v>

2654
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:34.250
<v Speaker 5>more you embody that by giving me that </v>
<v Speaker 5>to other people,</v>

2655
02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:38.660
<v Speaker 5>the more you summoned into this </v>
<v Speaker 5>dimension of brand new paradigm that has</v>

2656
02:12:38.661 --> 02:12:43.220
<v Speaker 5>as its nucleus love or you get James </v>
<v Speaker 5>Brown,</v>

2657
02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 5>James Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get.</v>

2658
02:12:45.291 --> 02:12:49.420
<v Speaker 5>If you have all those other things you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't get on that,</v>

2659
02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:54.820
<v Speaker 5>you to have some suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to have some fucking iron </v>

2660
02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:57.560
<v Speaker 5>will that's been developed to fight </v>
<v Speaker 5>against the oppressive white man.</v>

2661
02:12:57.900 --> 02:12:59.870
<v Speaker 5>So you get on that stage and you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>show one.</v>

2662
02:12:59.871 --> 02:13:04.280
<v Speaker 5>Everybody how shiny your shoes on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking spinning and splits and you live</v>

2663
02:13:04.281 --> 02:13:07.640
<v Speaker 5>in a marginalized civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a marginalized culture,</v>

2664
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:13.030
<v Speaker 5>and you're a bad motherfucker and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want the world to know it and you get </v>

2665
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:14.320
<v Speaker 5>out there with your cocktail slip back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>

2666
02:13:14.570 --> 02:13:16.820
<v Speaker 5>Tape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both are beautiful because one,</v>

2667
02:13:16.821 --> 02:13:21.410
<v Speaker 5>you got the flower growing out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sidewalk or out of the concrete where it</v>

2668
02:13:21.411 --> 02:13:23.300
<v Speaker 5>should never be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other one,</v>

2669
02:13:23.301 --> 02:13:28.301
<v Speaker 5>you've got a field of flowers that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>just infinitely growing under the </v>

2670
02:13:28.301 --> 02:13:29.030
<v Speaker 5>beautiful sun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both are incredible.</v>

2671
02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:30.950
<v Speaker 5>They're incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love them.</v>

2672
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 5>And I think that</v>

2673
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:37.070
<v Speaker 2>as long as that light of humanity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>shining on the potential to be a flower </v>

2674
02:13:38.191 --> 02:13:41.340
<v Speaker 2>bursting out of a sidewalk or to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community of flowers,</v>

2675
02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:43.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2676
02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:46.860
<v Speaker 2>There's no feeling like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this fucking culture of bitterness,</v>

2677
02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:50.370
<v Speaker 2>it's turning your back on that notion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's eliminating.</v>

2678
02:13:51.930 --> 02:13:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean you might say James Brown was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely bitter person,</v>

2679
02:13:55.290 --> 02:13:57.870
<v Speaker 2>but when I see James Brown and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2680
02:13:57.871 --> 02:13:59.070
<v Speaker 2>I know you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're not.</v>

2681
02:13:59.190 --> 02:14:04.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it might be a reactionary </v>

2682
02:14:04.190 --> 02:14:05.940
<v Speaker 2>retaliation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see that guy come out,</v>

2683
02:14:06.210 --> 02:14:11.210
<v Speaker 2>especially that amazing concert where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mick Jagger said the worst mistake </v>

2684
02:14:11.210 --> 02:14:13.560
<v Speaker 2>of his life was following James Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard about that story?</v>

2685
02:14:14.010 --> 02:14:17.400
<v Speaker 2>When you see that fucking concert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

2686
02:14:17.401 --> 02:14:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that's love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exploding out of that guy love amplified</v>

2687
02:14:20.551 --> 02:14:24.060
<v Speaker 2>through cocaine perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still love cocaine is love.</v>

2688
02:14:24.061 --> 02:14:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cocaine can amplify love though.</v>

2689
02:14:26.761 --> 02:14:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't like this stuff makes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed,</v>

2690
02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.200
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've not joking.</v>

2691
02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:33.600
<v Speaker 2>That's not a sarcastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like almost every job,</v>

2692
02:14:33.601 --> 02:14:35.280
<v Speaker 2>but I can't do cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

2693
02:14:35.490 --> 02:14:40.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do it and it just gives me the </v>

2694
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.490
<v Speaker 2>blues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>

2695
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

2696
02:14:41.390 --> 02:14:43.420
<v Speaker 3>did I never heard James Brown did </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine?</v>

2697
02:14:43.421 --> 02:14:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Did he was James Brown and the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should know that.</v>

2698
02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Brown,</v>

2699
02:14:47.890 --> 02:14:49.970
<v Speaker 2>just assuming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not fair to say.</v>

2700
02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:50.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why</v>

2701
02:14:51.010 --> 02:14:52.840
<v Speaker 3>looked it up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't want to be racist.</v>

2702
02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:58.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be racist looking up </v>

2703
02:14:58.180 --> 02:14:58.180
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2704
02:14:58.180 --> 02:14:59.140
<v Speaker 3>But he did drugs for a black man.</v>

2705
02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2706
02:15:00.341 --> 02:15:02.500
<v Speaker 2>anytime somebody does something great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people.</v>

2707
02:15:02.501 --> 02:15:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Like what drugs were you on?</v>

2708
02:15:04.050 --> 02:15:09.050
<v Speaker 3>James was smoking a lot of pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could smell something else in </v>

2709
02:15:09.050 --> 02:15:09.050
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I confronted him about it.</v>

2710
02:15:09.050 --> 02:15:13.881
<v Speaker 3>Brown had a previous objection to PCP or</v>
<v Speaker 3>angel dust and had freebased cocaine,</v>

2711
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:17.460
<v Speaker 3>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crack cocaine.</v>

2712
02:15:17.461 --> 02:15:19.680
<v Speaker 3>When you're playing Croquette,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a little coke,</v>

2713
02:15:20.690 --> 02:15:23.550
<v Speaker 3>but he shrugged it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the second I was out of there,</v>

2714
02:15:23.551 --> 02:15:26.520
<v Speaker 3>James was smoking pot laced with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger drugs.</v>

2715
02:15:27.450 --> 02:15:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is from Mick Jagger's.</v>

2716
02:15:29.161 --> 02:15:30.720

<v Speaker 2>Mick Jagger being like,</v>

2723
02:15:48.710 --> 02:15:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I smell drugs and James </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown's marijuana.</v>

2724
02:15:52.250 --> 02:15:54.840
<v Speaker 3>This is the Tommy Ray.</v>

2729
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:12.010
<v Speaker 3>over James Brown's estate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown was raised in a brothel by his </v>

2730
02:16:12.010 --> 02:16:16.481
<v Speaker 3>aunt after his mother abandoned him as </v>
<v Speaker 3>an infant and his abusive father refused</v>

2731
02:16:16.611 --> 02:16:18.690
<v Speaker 3>to care for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2732
02:16:18.710 --> 02:16:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Your prior to it was this rejection that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is believed to have led him to becoming </v>

2733
02:16:24.051 --> 02:16:26.870
<v Speaker 3>a control freak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a control freak and later life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Brown.</v>

2736
02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Even by me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she smiles.</v>

2737
02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:36.820
<v Speaker 1>It was about respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This man.</v>

2738
02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:40.750
<v Speaker 1>This was a man who came from nothing who</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragged himself up by his bootstraps.</v>

2739
02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:42.850
<v Speaker 1>He had talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was ahead of its time.</v>

2740
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:48.990
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker was a bad mother </v>

2741
02:16:48.990 --> 02:16:48.990
<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you playing up here?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why are you showing us?</v>

2743
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:50.270
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2744
02:16:50.271 --> 02:16:53.990
<v Speaker 8>on wikipedia it was saying for the </v>
<v Speaker 8>majority of his career,</v>

2745
02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:59.020
<v Speaker 8>Brown carried around a strict drug and </v>
<v Speaker 8>alcohol free policy with any member in </v>

2746
02:16:59.020 --> 02:16:59.690
<v Speaker 8>his entourage,</v>
<v Speaker 8>including band members,</v>

2747
02:16:59.691 --> 02:17:02.490
<v Speaker 8>firing people who disobeyed orders.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

2748
02:17:02.510 --> 02:17:07.010
<v Speaker 8>but said however,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in the 19 eighties it was alleged legit.</v>

2749
02:17:07.011 --> 02:17:12.011
<v Speaker 8>Brown himself was using drugs after </v>
<v Speaker 8>meeting and lady later marrying Andrea </v>

2750
02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:12.320
<v Speaker 8>Rodriguez.</v>

2751
02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So early in his career he was drug free </v>

2752
02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:17.580
<v Speaker 1>and then later in his life he started </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hit it hard.</v>

2753
02:17:18.350 --> 02:17:20.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It domestic violence started.</v>

2754
02:17:21.490 --> 02:17:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to do PCP,</v>

2755
02:17:23.861 --> 02:17:28.861
<v Speaker 1>that's the best way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do like a pushy </v>

2756
02:17:28.861 --> 02:17:29.350
<v Speaker 1>people snort PCP?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they do,</v>

2757
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:34.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I went through a phase of watching </v>

2758
02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:36.490
<v Speaker 1>PCP videos that people on PCP because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like they're possessed by demons.</v>

2759
02:17:36.850 --> 02:17:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the emergency room videos of people</v>

2760
02:17:39.761 --> 02:17:44.761
<v Speaker 1>on PCP?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as close as you get to demonic </v>

2761
02:17:44.761 --> 02:17:47.761
<v Speaker 1>possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't know who the fuck they </v>

2762
02:17:47.761 --> 02:17:47.761
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying weird shit.</v>

2763
02:17:47.761 --> 02:17:49.450
<v Speaker 1>They have to strap them down with </v>
<v Speaker 1>leather straps,</v>

2764
02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:52.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the exorcist man that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person on a bay,</v>

2765
02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:57.960
<v Speaker 1>those are the stories where you know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops shoot them nine times and they </v>

2766
02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:58.280
<v Speaker 1>don't drop a break.</v>

2767
02:17:58.290 --> 02:18:03.290
<v Speaker 1>The handcuffs shatter their risk trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get them off when they say like </v>

2768
02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:06.810
<v Speaker 1>ancient Sumeria and darkness was on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always tell you about my old </v>

2769
02:18:09.911 --> 02:18:11.170
<v Speaker 1>boxing coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2770
02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:16.200
<v Speaker 1>My old boxing coach was on pcp and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got his finger bitten off in a street </v>

2771
02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:18.310
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His finger on his right hand was gone.</v>

2772
02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:23.340
<v Speaker 1>His index finger that got bid it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had his big toe removed and his </v>

2773
02:18:24.311 --> 02:18:29.311
<v Speaker 1>big toe attached to where his index </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger was but permanently curved so </v>

2774
02:18:29.311 --> 02:18:31.270
<v Speaker 1>that he could still throw right hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2775
02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So when you shake his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would shake his hand.</v>

2776
02:18:33.581 --> 02:18:35.830
<v Speaker 1>You'd get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would get like a hand in one thing.</v>

2777
02:18:35.831 --> 02:18:40.831
<v Speaker 1>It would be curved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had the doctor fix it and sew it </v>

2778
02:18:40.831 --> 02:18:41.470
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curved because it was one of two things.</v>

2779
02:18:41.471 --> 02:18:46.471
<v Speaker 1>Either it would have to stay straight or</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it have to be curved and he went </v>

2780
02:18:46.471 --> 02:18:46.540
<v Speaker 1>with this so he could still throw right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooks.</v>

2781
02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I gotta tell you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost want to get my finger a place </v>

2782
02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:55.021
<v Speaker 1>of my toe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has to tell that story because </v>

<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he walks away and the guy is just a </v>

2840
02:21:22.770 --> 02:21:23.260
<v Speaker 3>guy who was 150 pounds at the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe's a big guy.</v>

2841
02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:29.040
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I show up at the open mic night and Joe </v>

2842
02:21:29.411 --> 02:21:34.411
<v Speaker 3>shows up and this guy who works the club</v>
<v Speaker 3>sees Joe and turns white like a sheet.</v>

2843
02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:37.660
<v Speaker 3>And Joe walks over to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts his hand on his shoulders.</v>

2844
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:40.330
<v Speaker 3>He's towering over this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puts his hands on him and he says,</v>

2845
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:42.580
<v Speaker 3>this is my friend over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan,</v>

2846
02:21:42.610 --> 02:21:44.380
<v Speaker 3>who's an up and comer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very funny kid.</v>

2847
02:21:44.381 --> 02:21:45.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should give him some work.</v>

2848
02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.910
<v Speaker 3>And the guy's like looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never worked at club ever</v>

2849
02:21:50.390 --> 02:21:55.390
<v Speaker 1>the rest of my days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took forever to get into that club I </v>

2850
02:21:55.901 --> 02:21:57.970
<v Speaker 1>did for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did all the other clubs.</v>

2851
02:21:57.971 --> 02:21:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will fuck me.</v>

2852
02:21:59.771 --> 02:22:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad that story ends like that.</v>

2853
02:22:03.310 --> 02:22:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's so much cooler than getting mafia </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into a comedy club.</v>

2854
02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't say the name of this club,</v>

2855
02:22:08.050 --> 02:22:10.330
<v Speaker 1>but this club was famous for paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in cocaine.</v>

2856
02:22:10.930 --> 02:22:14.770
<v Speaker 1>This club was run by run by people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unscrupulous connections.</v>

2857
02:22:14.771 --> 02:22:19.771
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know whether or not any of it </v>

2858
02:22:19.771 --> 02:22:22.261
<v Speaker 1>was true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had witnessed things that would </v>

2859
02:22:22.261 --> 02:22:22.261
<v Speaker 1>lead me to believe that it probably was </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

2860
02:22:22.261 --> 02:22:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I think I know the club you're telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2861
02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like fucking candy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2862
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:28.020
<v Speaker 3>The guys are ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're good guys.</v>

2863
02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:30.930
<v Speaker 3>It was a terrible situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that hadn't happened,</v>

2864
02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I probably would have got along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2865
02:22:33.061 --> 02:22:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I eventually did.</v>

2866
02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:38.160
<v Speaker 3>They had to realize that I didn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>grudge and I do.</v>

2867
02:22:38.161 --> 02:22:39.840
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was embarrassed,</v>

2868
02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:45.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this guy now was in the club again </v>

2869
02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:45.510
<v Speaker 3>and he couldn't do anything about it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing was a mess,</v>

2870
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:48.510
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a mess and that guy always had it</v>

2871
02:22:48.511 --> 02:22:49.260
<v Speaker 3>out for me because</v>

2872
02:22:51.010 --> 02:22:54.340
<v Speaker 5>he just thought you had brought a thug </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get your way on stage.</v>

2873
02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:54.730
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2874
02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's exactly what he thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking terrified.</v>

2875
02:22:58.790 --> 02:23:02.020
<v Speaker 3>But when you meet guys like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like read you,</v>

2876
02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:03.260
<v Speaker 3>you to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2877
02:23:03.261 --> 02:23:08.261
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy like that out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ever start thinking that you </v>

2878
02:23:08.261 --> 02:23:08.261
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2879
02:23:08.261 --> 02:23:09.690
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking bad ass,</v>

2880
02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:11.600
<v Speaker 3>all my mentality is different than you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2881
02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:14.690
<v Speaker 3>you need to be a guy who got his finger </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitten off in a fight because he was</v>

2882
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:19.790
<v Speaker 5>pc,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had his toe sewed in place of that </v>

2883
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.790
<v Speaker 5>fucking finger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in a way that.</v>

2884
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:22.260
<v Speaker 5>So we can punch in a way so that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could keep punching.</v>

2885
02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:26.040
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I got an a PCP street fight,</v>

2886
02:23:26.190 --> 02:23:29.070
<v Speaker 5>if it ever happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like somehow I don't know,</v>

2887
02:23:29.071 --> 02:23:34.071
<v Speaker 5>my fucking neighbors mad about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>laundry room or something and we get in </v>

2888
02:23:34.071 --> 02:23:38.110
<v Speaker 5>a PCP fueled street where my neighbor </v>
<v Speaker 5>bites off my finger and I'm in the </v>

2889
02:23:39.811 --> 02:23:43.560
<v Speaker 5>hospital and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can put your toe back on.</v>

2890
02:23:43.710 --> 02:23:48.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you just make sure you put it on a </v>

2891
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.710
<v Speaker 5>way I can keep fucking fighting?</v>

2892
02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a boxer and he was a boxing </v>

2893
02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:55.440
<v Speaker 3>coach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him because I was working at this,</v>

2894
02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:59.880
<v Speaker 3>this gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was teaching taekwondo at this </v>

2895
02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:02.340
<v Speaker 3>nautilus plus place in revere and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was this gym that was attached to it,</v>

2896
02:24:03.371 --> 02:24:05.290
<v Speaker 3>like a kickboxing gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I took over,</v>

2897
02:24:05.291 --> 02:24:10.291
<v Speaker 3>I was teaching the Jehan Kim Taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 3>Institute's classes other than revere,</v>

2898
02:24:10.331 --> 02:24:15.331
<v Speaker 3>and he was a boxer that would come by </v>
<v Speaker 3>and use the weights and all that stuff </v>

2899
02:24:15.331 --> 02:24:16.870
<v Speaker 3>and we just became friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we exchanged techniques.</v>

2900
02:24:16.930 --> 02:24:18.790
<v Speaker 3>He would teach me how to box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was teaching them how to kick.</v>

2901
02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:20.500
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We became friends and I was like,</v>

2902
02:24:20.501 --> 02:24:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's fucking crazy.</v>

2903
02:24:22.211 --> 02:24:22.560
<v Speaker 3>He's a</v>

2904
02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:25.370
<v Speaker 5>great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's cool to be a martial artist.</v>

2905
02:24:25.371 --> 02:24:27.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't have memories like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

2906
02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:30.590
<v Speaker 5>one day they're gonna I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>memories like that,</v>

2907
02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:32.630
<v Speaker 5>but that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are cool memories.</v>

2908
02:24:32.631 --> 02:24:33.710
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'd be cool memories,</v>

2909
02:24:33.711 --> 02:24:34.610
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I love to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be able to be like,</v>

2911
02:24:36.981 --> 02:24:39.590
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that my star craft coach,</v>

2912
02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:44.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's as close as I've gotten to that </v>

2913
02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:46.970
<v Speaker 5>kind of any kind of competition that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>as close as I got.</v>

2914
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

2915
02:24:47.511 --> 02:24:50.120
<v Speaker 3>it was so long ago when I feel like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>lying when I tell the stories,</v>

2916
02:24:50.210 --> 02:24:53.540
<v Speaker 3>like I know they're all true and that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can verify them and I'll call my friends</v>

2917
02:24:53.541 --> 02:24:55.160
<v Speaker 3>who were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my good friend Steve Graham,</v>

2918
02:24:55.161 --> 02:24:56.740
<v Speaker 3>who I'm still friends with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2919
02:24:56.870 --> 02:25:01.870
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk about the old days all the </v>

2920
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:01.870
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I talk about it,</v>

2921
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:06.341
<v Speaker 3>it seems like a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't seem like it was really </v>

2922
02:25:06.341 --> 02:25:06.341
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as in</v>

2923
02:25:06.341 --> 02:25:06.850
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't seem like a lie to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2924
02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:07.650
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean to me,</v>

2925
02:25:08.010 --> 02:25:09.060
<v Speaker 5>even though it was my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2926
02:25:09.061 --> 02:25:10.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you meant you think.</v>

2927
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:11.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2928
02:25:11.271 --> 02:25:11.550
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2929
02:25:11.551 --> 02:25:16.551
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying in my life when I tell the </v>

2930
02:25:16.551 --> 02:25:16.551
<v Speaker 5>story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I know I met,</v>

2931
02:25:16.551 --> 02:25:18.420
<v Speaker 5>I saw him again a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He really does some permanently curve.</v>

2932
02:25:18.421 --> 02:25:20.340
<v Speaker 5>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

2933
02:25:20.341 --> 02:25:21.750
<v Speaker 5>when I tell that story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why did I make that?</v>

2934
02:25:21.751 --> 02:25:22.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2935
02:25:22.231 --> 02:25:23.770
<v Speaker 5>I didn't make that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really know that guy.</v>

2936
02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:24.150
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

2937
02:25:24.420 --> 02:25:29.420
<v Speaker 3>knew a dude who's arrested when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in Boston because someone had </v>

2938
02:25:29.860 --> 02:25:34.860
<v Speaker 3>killed this guy and broken virtually </v>
<v Speaker 3>every bone in his body and continually </v>

2939
02:25:35.231 --> 02:25:40.231
<v Speaker 3>injected him with cocaine to wake him up</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he would black out and they kept </v>

2940
02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:42.670
<v Speaker 3>breaking his bones probably with like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hammer or something like that.</v>

2941
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably hitting him with a sledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>hammer and just breaking his body and </v>

2942
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:50.821
<v Speaker 3>when he would pass out from the shock </v>
<v Speaker 3>that injected with cocaine and they did </v>

2943
02:25:50.821 --> 02:25:53.881
<v Speaker 3>that over and over and over again until </v>
<v Speaker 3>they eventually killed them and then </v>

2944
02:25:53.881 --> 02:25:56.251
<v Speaker 3>they chopped them up into little pieces </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this guy and I've got arrested for </v>

2945
02:25:56.251 --> 02:25:58.000
<v Speaker 3>that and I don't know if he did it and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if he didn't do it,</v>

2946
02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:01.750
<v Speaker 3>but I know who she was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a scary guy.</v>

2947
02:26:01.751 --> 02:26:03.940
<v Speaker 3>He was a scary guy that went to jail for</v>
<v Speaker 3>several years.</v>

2948
02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:06.410
<v Speaker 5>What did the guy do that they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing?</v>

2949
02:26:06.570 --> 02:26:09.040
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was a big story.</v>

2950
02:26:09.250 --> 02:26:13.420
<v Speaker 5>It was a big story in the news and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I got arrested for it I was like,</v>

2951
02:26:13.450 --> 02:26:14.720
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2952
02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:19.860
<v Speaker 5>Now I shouldn't say friend training,</v>
<v Speaker 5>partner guy who showed up the same gym </v>

2953
02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:23.101
<v Speaker 5>as me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we'd never didn't have more </v>

2954
02:26:23.101 --> 02:26:23.510
<v Speaker 5>morehouse reports to Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the floors,</v>

2955
02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:26.250
<v Speaker 5>fucking things I ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time you,</v>

2956
02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:29.140
<v Speaker 5>you finally fall into the abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Finally you're like,</v>

2957
02:26:29.141 --> 02:26:30.070
<v Speaker 5>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's over.</v>

2958
02:26:30.071 --> 02:26:33.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm passing out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get a cocaine rush.</v>

2959
02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:34.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2960
02:26:34.940 --> 02:26:37.580
<v Speaker 3>they killed that guy slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he did.</v>

2961
02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:42.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he must've done something awful or </v>

2962
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.790
<v Speaker 3>something must've gone awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who fucking knows?</v>

2963
02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:47.980
<v Speaker 3>But I knew a lot of people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird thing about like fight </v>

2964
02:26:47.980 --> 02:26:50.630
<v Speaker 3>gyms as you come in contact with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>really scary people.</v>

2965
02:26:50.631 --> 02:26:55.631
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who want to learn how to defend </v>

2966
02:26:55.631 --> 02:26:55.631
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want to learn how to kill people.</v>

2967
02:26:55.950 --> 02:27:00.950
<v Speaker 5>People who are a training,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not out of some kind of recreation or </v>

2968
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:04.281
<v Speaker 5>the enjoyment of a sport,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but actually your training because they </v>

2969
02:27:04.281 --> 02:27:06.150
<v Speaker 5>have to daily get into fights and </v>
<v Speaker 5>torture.</v>

2970
02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy that used to come to our</v>

2971
02:27:08.561 --> 02:27:13.440
<v Speaker 3>gym that legitimately was a Hitman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was legitimately hitman for the,</v>

2972
02:27:13.690 --> 02:27:18.170
<v Speaker 3>the Irish mob in Boston and he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally ask how,</v>

2973
02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:19.930
<v Speaker 3>how would you kill somebody in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation?</v>

2974
02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:22.090
<v Speaker 3>What would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was a very nice guy,</v>

2975
02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:27.320
<v Speaker 3>like he was very quiet and very now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was almost like a guy who knew </v>

2976
02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:30.040
<v Speaker 3>some exciting shit was about to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>so he could stay really calm most of the</v>

2977
02:27:30.041 --> 02:27:35.041
<v Speaker 3>time until the exciting shit happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like when you would train with this </v>

2978
02:27:35.041 --> 02:27:35.950
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I helped this guy out a little bit,</v>

2979
02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:39.790
<v Speaker 3>we did some drills with them and showed </v>
<v Speaker 3>them some stuff and he was very calm,</v>

2980
02:27:39.791 --> 02:27:41.680
<v Speaker 3>like he would never imagine this guy was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a killer.</v>

2981
02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:46.920
<v Speaker 3>He was very calm and very relaxed and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew sort of who he was or what he was.</v>

2982
02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:49.330
<v Speaker 3>So it was really weird showing them all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff,</v>

2983
02:27:49.970 --> 02:27:52.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just trying to get them to respect</v>

2984
02:27:52.151 --> 02:27:57.151
<v Speaker 3>me and I was just trying to teach them </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best I could and just ignore all </v>

2985
02:27:57.151 --> 02:27:57.640
<v Speaker 3>that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what you do,</v>

2986
02:27:57.730 --> 02:28:02.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to know what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to show you this is the </v>

2987
02:28:02.730 --> 02:28:03.900
<v Speaker 3>best way to do this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was teaching them and fucking wind</v>

2988
02:28:03.901 --> 02:28:08.901
<v Speaker 3>up getting arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of them getting arrested for </v>

2989
02:28:08.901 --> 02:28:08.901
<v Speaker 3>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in jail for like,</v>

2990
02:28:08.901 --> 02:28:13.051
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a part of that whole Whitey </v>

2991
02:28:13.051 --> 02:28:13.540
<v Speaker 3>bulger thing and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whitey bulger Shit went down.</v>

2992
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.130
<v Speaker 5>There's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that Brad Pitt movie where</v>

2993
02:28:17.131 --> 02:28:19.540
<v Speaker 5>he plays a Hitman?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know the one I'm talking about?</v>

2994
02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:22.020
<v Speaker 5>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>James Gandolfini</v>

2995
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:23.490
<v Speaker 4>on his last movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2996
02:28:23.530 --> 02:28:25.820
<v Speaker 4>that was a killing them softly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2997
02:28:26.210 --> 02:28:26.780
<v Speaker 4>Pretty fucking good</v>

2998
02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:28.790
<v Speaker 2>movie man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good.</v>

2999
02:28:28.791 --> 02:28:33.440
<v Speaker 2>But it's sort of like it was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections.</v>

3000
02:28:33.441 --> 02:28:37.460
<v Speaker 2>It was Bush versus what were the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections going on in the movie?</v>

3001
02:28:37.461 --> 02:28:42.461
<v Speaker 2>It was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like throughout the entire movie </v>

3002
02:28:42.461 --> 02:28:45.790
<v Speaker 2>on Tvs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's playing the elections because it's </v>

3003
02:28:45.790 --> 02:28:48.830
<v Speaker 2>trying to make this amazing comparison </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the new mob.</v>

3004
02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:54.040
<v Speaker 2>The mob have evolved or changed into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of corporate structure to the </v>

3005
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:59.050
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having also shifted to this corporate </v>

3006
02:28:59.050 --> 02:29:00.821
<v Speaker 2>structure where there's this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>diffusion of responsibility and Brad </v>

3007
02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Pitt is sort of the embodiment of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like diffusion of responsibility</v>

3008
02:29:05.091 --> 02:29:10.091
<v Speaker 2>because the point of pride was that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way he killed people was by surprise so </v>

3009
02:29:10.701 --> 02:29:15.701
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't know that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting killed and that's a feel like </v>

3010
02:29:15.701 --> 02:29:16.040
<v Speaker 2>that makes it any better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3011
02:29:16.041 --> 02:29:20.060
<v Speaker 2>that somehow like that's like a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality to have.</v>

3012
02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:21.740
<v Speaker 2>But God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a great movie man,</v>

3013
02:29:21.741 --> 02:29:24.470
<v Speaker 2>but was also great because it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a hit man movie.</v>

3014
02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:26.450
<v Speaker 4>I love the Gandolfini character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3015
02:29:26.670 --> 02:29:31.670
<v Speaker 4>he was so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So out of control and it was just like </v>

3016
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.830
<v Speaker 4>you saw them just ramp up the out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>

3017
02:29:31.831 --> 02:29:33.740
<v Speaker 4>He just got more and more crazy as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie went on.</v>

3018
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:34.710
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh.</v>

3019
02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:36.960
<v Speaker 4>It was like one of his best roles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

3020
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:41.990
<v Speaker 4>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because you really believed he was </v>

3021
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.450
<v Speaker 4>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looked like he was so fat.</v>

3022
02:29:42.451 --> 02:29:44.970
<v Speaker 4>He was having a hard time breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tell irritable.</v>

3023
02:29:44.971 --> 02:29:49.971
<v Speaker 4>He would be like in real life when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>would fucking scream and spit would be </v>

3024
02:29:49.971 --> 02:29:51.680
<v Speaker 4>flying out of his mouth and holding onto</v>
<v Speaker 4>a drink here.</v>

3025
02:29:52.460 --> 02:29:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Nailed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3026
02:29:53.710 --> 02:29:55.220
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know he was in the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

3027
02:29:55.221 --> 02:30:00.221
<v Speaker 2>That was just one of those movies where </v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend said it's good and I was just </v>

3028
02:30:00.221 --> 02:30:00.221
<v Speaker 2>like laying in bed watching Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3029
02:30:00.221 --> 02:30:01.790
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a good movie.</v>

3030
02:30:01.950 --> 02:30:06.950
<v Speaker 4>James Gandolfini was a bad motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Tony Soprano character was the </v>

3031
02:30:07.591 --> 02:30:09.180
<v Speaker 4>greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

3032
02:30:09.181 --> 02:30:12.090
<v Speaker 4>the greatest individual character in any</v>
<v Speaker 4>show ever.</v>

3033
02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:14.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right,</v>

3034
02:30:14.101 --> 02:30:15.000
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was,</v>

3035
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:19.830
<v Speaker 4>if not the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's maybe there's an equal level</v>

3036
02:30:19.890 --> 02:30:24.210
<v Speaker 4>that they all reach at some someplace,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was like right up there.</v>

3037
02:30:25.050 --> 02:30:25.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a.</v>

3038
02:30:25.801 --> 02:30:30.060
<v Speaker 4>He was a bad ass like Kim and Rhoda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like right there.</v>

3039
02:30:30.330 --> 02:30:31.380

02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:19.260
<v Speaker 5>that's what the comics are like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was like.</v>

02:33:19.261 --> 02:33:23.040
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3107
02:33:40.051 --> 02:33:42.880

<v Speaker 5>works is it?</v>

3108

<v Speaker 4>have gotten involved.</v>

<v Speaker 4>success and they're assholes because it </v>

3158

<v Speaker 4>seems to disrupt the principles you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>come to understand that allows success </v>

3159
02:35:46.651 --> 02:35:50.140
<v Speaker 4>to grow into your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is being sweet and generally being</v>

02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:16.430
<v Speaker 3>It's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said all nice things first.</v>

3217

3219
02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:24.620
<v Speaker 3>but I've heard those trucks before and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them was actually from a movie,</v>

3220
02:38:24.621 --> 02:38:29.621
<v Speaker 3>the movie boiler room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The joke was they should put people on </v>

3221
02:38:29.621 --> 02:38:33.481
<v Speaker 3>an island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone says that to a gay guy who </v>

3222
02:38:33.481 --> 02:38:33.481

<v Speaker 3>It's a good line.</v>

3225

3226
02:38:41.210 --> 02:38:44.150
<v Speaker 3>you have to call that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I tried to do it in a nice way to say</v>

3227
02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:47.630
<v Speaker 3>nice things first and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen those jokes before,</v>

3228
02:38:47.631 --> 02:38:48.680
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do that man.</v>

3229
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:50.180
<v Speaker 3>And I have to say that I can't just let </v>
<v Speaker 3>it pop.</v>

3230
02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:53.570
<v Speaker 3>And then monique was saying Shit like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that might've been something that you've</v>

3233
02:38:56.861 --> 02:38:58.700
<v Speaker 3>made it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Buddy Hackett starts yelling at</v>

3238
02:39:11.691 --> 02:39:14.360
<v Speaker 3>think about joke writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way we think of as joke writing,</v>

3239
02:39:14.390 --> 02:39:15.560
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:18.140
<v Speaker 3>You went on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely those people are never going</v>

3242
02:39:18.141 --> 02:39:23.141
<v Speaker 3>to see you again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go from place to place to place and </v>

3243
02:39:23.141 --> 02:39:23.141
<v Speaker 3>if you ever get famous and put that shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>on tv,</v>

3245
02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:25.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it on the Ed Sullivan show,</v>

3246
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.040
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3247
02:39:27.170 --> 02:39:32.170
<v Speaker 3>when they all would like struggle for it</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't become the art form that it is </v>

3248
02:39:32.170 --> 02:39:35.120
<v Speaker 3>now until like the Lenny Bruce had </v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Pryor error where it became this</v>

3249
02:39:35.121 --> 02:39:40.121
<v Speaker 3>new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like what he's talking </v>

3250
02:39:40.121 --> 02:39:40.121
<v Speaker 3>about as far as comedy and when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about comedy,</v>

3251
02:39:40.121 --> 02:39:44.681
<v Speaker 3>is there a totally different thing he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about being a band for Bar </v>

3252
02:39:44.681 --> 02:39:46.550
<v Speaker 3>Mitzvahs and do it all with all due </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect,</v>

3253
02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:48.100
<v Speaker 3>showing up in these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3254
02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:53.150
<v Speaker 3>these halls where you're going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>music band and a guy tells jokes and </v>

3255
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:54.100
<v Speaker 3>then Sinatra is gonna come out and play </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

3256
02:39:54.101 --> 02:39:59.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a comedy club and the art form </v>

3257
02:39:59.101 --> 02:39:59.101
<v Speaker 3>was not established way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's established now.</v>

3258
02:39:59.101 --> 02:40:00.350
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a different experience for them.</v>

3259
02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:04.700
<v Speaker 3>So I'm defining his experience in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that challenges his entire career.</v>

3260
02:40:04.730 --> 02:40:06.020
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you kid.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know he's right.</v>

3262
02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:09.020

<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember those jokes,</v>

3267
02:40:18.991 --> 02:40:21.390

<v Speaker 4>reverberate my adulthood where I'm </v>

3289
02:41:11.811 --> 02:41:14.100
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be rational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times it skip the tracks.</v>
