00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first man to smoke marijuana never </v>

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>really smoked it and held.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a Chinese man.</v>

5
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>He was a very great man and whenever he </v>
<v Speaker 1>lit the plant,</v>

6
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't to get high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he would start to get high and every</v>

7
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:25.821
<v Speaker 1>time he got high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blue bird would come to him and tell </v>

8
00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:30.261
<v Speaker 1>him to conquer his neighboring </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods and he listened to those </v>

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>to the bird and that's exactly what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did and he became a great emperor in </v>

10
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.581
<v Speaker 1>China at that point in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar because his doctor and he </v>

11
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been to Disney land?</v>

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>And the doctor goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Pablo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this very clean,</v>

14
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>very organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's it,</v>

15
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First gather Chinese dude that burnt the</v>

16
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>plant because he liked the smell of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant and gave him a soothing.</v>

17
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>But after days of doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it packed up in his body and he started </v>

18
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.361
<v Speaker 1>to loosen that and he saw a blue bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blue Bird came to him and told him that </v>

19
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:19.431
<v Speaker 1>he had to conquer the neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a region or crazy bird.</v>

20
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>He got high and a bird started talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

21
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.770
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is one of the things that are </v>

23
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>the part of fishing Nana was always used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say is that,</v>

24
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a priest walks down the aisle and </v>

25
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>they have that thing that they swing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's burning incense inside of it.</v>

26
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>They used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd.</v>

27
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what they used to do was to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what dimension?</v>

28
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>

29
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:48.951
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got it became that shit that Batman </v>

30
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>shot at the Green Hornet like pedophile </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke.</v>

31
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up,</v>

32
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>your shirts bombed backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shit.</v>

33
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Your pants are missing.</v>

34
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did,</v>

35
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>what is it now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of instances?</v>

36
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It's smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

37
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the church,</v>

38
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>every once in a while now you have to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the full effect.</v>

39
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>One like the five in the afternoon on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday and the early morning Sunday </v>

40
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.041
<v Speaker 1>they don't break out the incense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't start breaking out the fucking </v>

41
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:19.731
<v Speaker 1>Melaleuca fucking some kid and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out and when the guy comes out </v>

42
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>their own water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus and then the other guy.</v>

43
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird how somebody made a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>point on twitter the other day.</v>

44
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you me,</v>

45
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Mitch Hedberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's five of us to deliver </v>

46
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>newspapers is $5.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The delivered newspapers.</v>

47
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>You Hedberg did it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:45.231
<v Speaker 1>You delivered them in a call the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>places I was an asshole that took a </v>

49
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>route but not the route in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

50
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>The route in the neighborhood over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had to beat the kids there before </v>

51
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.641
<v Speaker 1>they get there and steal the papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would deliver them right to the doors </v>

52
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did too and then you collected.</v>

53
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I collected from only a handful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

54
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Most</v>

55
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>people are on like a monthly </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscription plan.</v>

56
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 2>They had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were switching over,</v>

57
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>but the people that you'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>collect from Yeley this envelope,</v>

58
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>like a tan envelope and you had to mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>off like,</v>

59
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 2>you know when they owe things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely remember it because it was only a</v>

60
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 2>couple of the clients and after awhile I</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of got away from doing them.</v>

61
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do these people that </v>

62
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 2>have because it's too hard to collect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's annoying.</v>

63
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to go to.</v>

64
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 2>That was I didn't like it must have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

65
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:31.171
<v Speaker 2>That was just when I first got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic school and my mom gave me an </v>

66
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:32.100
<v Speaker 2>option that I had to go up there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>work in the afternoon.</v>

67
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I got to figure something out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to go up there anymore</v>

68
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 2>and my friend said I'm giving up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspaper route,</v>

69
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.440
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't give up the one that my </v>
<v Speaker 2>navel.</v>

70
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 2>He gave up the one and the next city </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the next town over that city.</v>

71
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I could still walk day so I'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave school run over there because of </v>

72
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 2>not the dude who steal my papers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sell them as their own,</v>

73
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 2>the fucking street corners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd have to get them,</v>

74
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:01.021
<v Speaker 2>put the circulars in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in a thing and then throw them </v>

75
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:04.201
<v Speaker 2>on people's balcony and then on Fridays </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Saturdays I have to go back with a </v>

76
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>ring after dinner and collect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you doing Mr Rogan.</v>

77
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to pick up seventy five cents </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they give you like a dollar 50.</v>

78
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:15.901
<v Speaker 2>That was your tip and you got like </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenty two cents a week for the of the </v>

79
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you collect from everybody?</v>

80
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I collected from everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was this.</v>

81
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 2>What years were these?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has to be 73.</v>

82
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Seventy four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy five.</v>

83
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess when I started doing it is </v>

84
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.201
<v Speaker 2>when I started driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had been like 83.</v>

85
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I probably started 83.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably started when I was 17.</v>

86
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was 85.</v>

87
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 2>80 five probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's when I probably started </v>

88
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you're too old to be collected.</v>

89
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it wasn't even that,</v>

90
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 2>it was just annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what you wanted to do was go to the</v>

91
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>depot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up the papers,</v>

92
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>chuck them into the People's driveways </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.</v>

93
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.550
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a few people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted it inside the door so you'd have </v>

94
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 2>to get out of your car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open up their screen door,</v>

95
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 2>put it in there and then leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea was that those people,</v>

96
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 2>everybody would say those people tip you</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

97
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Those two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delta p Bennett Miller.</v>

98
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:12.511
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we would only have like a few of </v>

99
00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:15.901
<v Speaker 2>those and I think after the first couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of years they stopped doing those kinds </v>

100
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 2>of collections or I definitely stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing them.</v>

101
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.750
<v Speaker 2>But it was an awesome job when you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a young comic or you know,</v>

102
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 2>even before it was a comical and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>

103
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.460
<v Speaker 2>it was just a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to do anything where </v>

104
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 2>someone was telling me what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could get my car,</v>

105
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I could listen to whatever I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to Charles Laquidara,</v>

106
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.120
<v Speaker 2>he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning the big mattress on,</v>

107
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it was bcn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it's wbcn in Boston,</v>

108
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 2>which is awesome radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to that.</v>

109
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Chuck newspapers out windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that for like three hours every </v>

110
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.680
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

111
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>It was the best ever because</v>

112
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 3>then I would make enough money where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could pay my bills,</v>

113
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.540
<v Speaker 3>but I still had all the time in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

114
00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 3>You stand up</v>

115
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 3>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world train all the time in the </v>

116
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.531
<v Speaker 3>world do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it definitely fucked me up because </v>

117
00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to be getting up </v>
<v Speaker 3>that early every day.</v>

118
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 3>Like that can't be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

119
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to people that know things</v>
<v Speaker 3>about sleep,</v>

120
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 3>like getting up at 4:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning or five in the morning </v>

121
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 3>every day and not being responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the beginning.</v>

122
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.110
<v Speaker 3>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the beginning of the new Joe </v>

123
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Rogan podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the first podcast I listened to</v>

124
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 3>that I agreed with a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

125
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:44.681
<v Speaker 3>I had a couple of mitigating factors </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I believe that everybody's body </v>

126
00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 3>is a lot different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I could rock and roll.</v>

127
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 3>I could throw down on seventh street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's got to be seven straight.</v>

128
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

129
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get up the two times because once you're</v>

130
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 3>50 it could be up and down.</v>

131
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.970
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you turn 50,</v>

132
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 3>48,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything changed his papa.</v>

133
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 3>So if you had night chicken come to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

134
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 3>It has to come up throughout the night </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you will be up all fucking night on </v>

135
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 3>the hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every hour.</v>

136
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:13.790
<v Speaker 3>There's no rem sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no rem sleep.</v>

137
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 3>So you have to come control once you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

138
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:21.281
<v Speaker 3>you have to control your thyroid dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a specialist on asleep since </v>

139
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:25.751
<v Speaker 3>day one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the most interesting </v>

140
00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:27.730
<v Speaker 3>podcasts you had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought the book and everything and he </v>

141
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 3>made some great points in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

142
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't raised under that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the bar with a cop.</v>

148
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.910
<v Speaker 3>If I got tired at one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back there and take a nap,</v>

<v Speaker 2>order because I didn't think that George</v>

347
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Soros was a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also painful.</v>

348
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.620
<v Speaker 2>What's up Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rob?</v>

349
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening brother?</v>

350
00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Everything's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

351
00:18:23.111 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel good.</v>

352
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you buddy for real.</v>

353
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 2>But you say some silly shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where this all comes from.</v>

354
00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.490
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean I don't love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a great guy,</v>

355
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.480
<v Speaker 2>but there's some shit that's just silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wasted time.</v>

356
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.290
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those things,</v>

357
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:47.440
<v Speaker 2>it's just a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

358
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's real conspiracies,</v>

359
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's some that,</v>

360
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just get caught up and looking </v>

361
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.130
<v Speaker 2>for conspiracies and everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>after a while it's exhausting.</v>

362
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Let's get the ball off the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the guy with the podcasts with </v>

363
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:07.460
<v Speaker 2>already last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>

364
00:19:07.461 --> 00:19:11.370
<v Speaker 2>18 attorney's son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones going to hear that.</v>

365
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:12.900
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll finish.</v>

366
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry.</v>

367
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

368
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the guy.</v>

369
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't support a lot of the shit </v>

370
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:20.900
<v Speaker 2>that he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the sandy hook stuff.</v>

371
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's since disavowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

372
00:19:23.431 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he changed his opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

373
00:19:25.951 --> 00:19:30.951
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at a certain point in time you're </v>

374
00:19:30.951 --> 00:19:30.951
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

375
00:19:30.951 --> 00:19:30.951
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>

376
00:19:30.951 --> 00:19:32.040
<v Speaker 2>are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

377
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.520
<v Speaker 2>you got to be really sure before you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>something crazy like that.</v>

378
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>

379
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>

380
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a great guy and as a person</v>

381
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not attacking it.</v>

382
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:49.660
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

383
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:54.560
<v Speaker 2>when he goes crazy and gets mad at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

384
00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:59.561
<v Speaker 2>I want to hug them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Lee told me this story about </v>

385
00:19:59.561 --> 00:20:00.770
<v Speaker 2>trucks pulling up in front of your house</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they could see through your walls.</v>

386
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.910
<v Speaker 2>They probably can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do that in different neighborhoods.</v>

387
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to do something like that,</v>

388
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.900
<v Speaker 2>but then have to five of those and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was my experience.</v>

389
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.060
<v Speaker 2>He'll tell you something that you got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit there and go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>professors and all these different </v>

405
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:59.140
<v Speaker 2>people that are doing different things </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went back with the CIA.</v>

409
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:10.850
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't gonna say nothing either cheaper</v>

410
00:21:15.161 --> 00:21:16.480
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fourth of July.</v>

411
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Fireworks like fucking CBS Radford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

412
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I think conspiracies are fun and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem with conspiracies.</v>

413
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:28.390
<v Speaker 2>They're fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fun to chase down.</v>

414
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.370
<v Speaker 2>They really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're interests.</v>

415
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what's fun to chase down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to read about one and to absorb it by </v>

416
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.631
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I get into a room with three men </v>

417
00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 2>and we're on a conspiracy for 48 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

418
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.330
<v Speaker 2>that's when I get aggravated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

419
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.160
<v Speaker 2>that's what I don't ever want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

420
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.220
<v Speaker 2>That's what the shit that kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the time to discuss with </v>

421
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>little moon landing or that we all have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea of what we think happened.</v>

422
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't want to talk about not on</v>

423
00:21:56.771 --> 00:21:58.940
<v Speaker 2>the fucking fourth of July.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

424
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.140
<v Speaker 2>The problem with them is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a tendency,</v>

425
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.080
<v Speaker 2>is that when people get really into </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories,</v>

426
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 2>they're into everything being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>

427
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:13.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they're into conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories and also into the history of </v>

428
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.801
<v Speaker 2>Cuba and then give you a detailed </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of some really crazy shit that </v>

429
00:22:16.801 --> 00:22:21.121
<v Speaker 2>went down like how many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really into conspiracy theories could </v>

430
00:22:21.121 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 2>give you a rundown on how Castro took </v>
<v Speaker 2>over Cuba,</v>

431
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.240
<v Speaker 2>which is like a real thing that happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our parents' lifetimes.</v>

432
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

433
00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.400
<v Speaker 2>How many people that are really into </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

434
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:39.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not there's bases on the </v>

435
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.710
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

436
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:40.490
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

437
00:22:40.491 --> 00:22:42.770
<v Speaker 2>all these different things that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened through human history.</v>

438
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.220
<v Speaker 2>The Mongols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Roman Empire,</v>

439
00:22:46.221 --> 00:22:51.221
<v Speaker 2>the Greek camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either this crazy shit that definitely </v>

440
00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:53.771
<v Speaker 2>really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the stuff that happened during the </v>

441
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff that happened during the </v>

442
00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Nixon administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff's real.</v>

443
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.620
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating shit to look into,</v>

444
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.050
<v Speaker 2>but then you get the dumb ones like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

445
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 2>we really discussed and whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth is flat.</v>

446
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Is this a real conversation like people </v>
<v Speaker 2>really doing that satellites aren't real</v>

447
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:22.260
<v Speaker 2>goal on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll find a bunch of people to agree </v>

<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two.</v>

<v Speaker 2>50 years or 60 minutes.</v>

452
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.540
<v Speaker 2>It was showing how they interviewed </v>
<v Speaker 2>different people.</v>

453
00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Now the one guy went to some crusade </v>
<v Speaker 2>assignment,</v>

459
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.210
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the best interviews he </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever did was when he pushed the guy,</v>

460

<v Speaker 3>the guy that was standing behind Kennedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the car,</v>

461
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:11.590
<v Speaker 3>the the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the agent that should have taken the </v>

462
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.060
<v Speaker 3>bullet for Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They interviewed that guy.</v>

463
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.000
<v Speaker 3>That's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got on that one now,</v>

464
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.130
<v Speaker 3>but he was one step behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

465
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:21.420
<v Speaker 3>he breaks down into tears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a real American,</v>

466
00:24:21.421 --> 00:24:23.990
<v Speaker 3>like this is a guy that's a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>American.</v>

467
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Took that job and then like it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>your fault and he's like,</v>

468
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a second behind.</v>

469
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 3>If I would have been there just one </v>
<v Speaker 3>second earlier,</v>

470
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:38.660
<v Speaker 3>I would've caught it in my back and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president would have been a lot.</v>

471
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking crazy.</v>

472
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He imagined being dedicated to protect a</v>

473
00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:51.011
<v Speaker 3>guy with your own life and to really </v>
<v Speaker 3>drink the serum and to believe it like </v>

474
00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:57.131
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those serves very special human beings </v>

475
00:24:57.621 --> 00:25:01.340
<v Speaker 3>that can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a lot of human beings that have that</v>

476
00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:06.341
<v Speaker 3>kind of resolve or throw their life in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of a bullet to protect someone </v>

477
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:08.360
<v Speaker 3>else's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's intense.</v>

478
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:14.870
<v Speaker 3>It is intense pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to hear where the bullet is </v>

479
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.460
<v Speaker 3>coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what your response time as the B to b.</v>

480
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.500
<v Speaker 3>This is when you were real high level </v>
<v Speaker 3>body guard.</v>

481
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.830
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are the highest of the highest.</v>

482
00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:32.831
<v Speaker 3>You're hearing is impeccable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This means when you're walking down the </v>

483
00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:37.181
<v Speaker 3>street with this guy inside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to learn by yourself how the </v>

484
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:43.790
<v Speaker 3>shadow of nature and noises and listened</v>
<v Speaker 3>to footsteps,</v>

485
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 3>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clicking,</v>

486
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 3>holsters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opening.</v>

487
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Think of how interesting.</v>

488
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Just that alone is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why sometimes when you see him,</v>

489
00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:58.481
<v Speaker 3>they're holding one ear because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>zero with anything particular a car's </v>

490
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:04.751
<v Speaker 3>tires screeching differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of that fucking job because that's</v>

491
00:26:04.991 --> 00:26:08.830
<v Speaker 3>what their job is to react to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there's.</v>

492
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.420
<v Speaker 3>If Joe Rogan has eight guys when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>train,</v>

493
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.480
<v Speaker 3>and I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never trained in Quantico,</v>

494
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.550
<v Speaker 3>but I just know that I think the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>two guys,</v>

495
00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:23.000
<v Speaker 3>the first four guys will lead guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a mission.</v>

496
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.480
<v Speaker 3>One guy gets to the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's a shooting,</v>

497
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 3>the other guy ducked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two guys buck for the president.</v>

498
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.890
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be planned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like formations and football tunes.</v>

499
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.780
<v Speaker 3>What if the line back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes this way,</v>

500
00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:40.781
<v Speaker 3>you want around me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just take a fucking genius to tell you </v>

501
00:26:40.781 --> 00:26:44.530
<v Speaker 3>there has to be formation to protect the</v>
<v Speaker 3>president or whoever it is you're </v>

502
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:44.820
<v Speaker 3>protecting and that level.</v>

503
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:50.390
<v Speaker 3>When I'm protecting Kevin Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people are going to try to </v>

504
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.081
<v Speaker 3>assassinate Kevin Hart when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting our president?</v>

505
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:00.960
<v Speaker 3>How many people are going to really try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to shoot that precedent with weapons?</v>

506
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go to the Ronald Reagan attempt.</v>

507
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to these attempts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How fucking fast this is.</v>

508
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:12.710
<v Speaker 3>You have to be so high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He leapt Vietnam,</v>

509
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.200
<v Speaker 3>another war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you had to do a tour with </v>

510
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.200
<v Speaker 3>something else where you would just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sport.</v>

511
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.560
<v Speaker 3>You tiptoed in chilled people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>toothpicks and shit.</v>

512
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:26.020
<v Speaker 3>This is my dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I think the training you.</v>

513
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.650
<v Speaker 3>I will think you're just born to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rambo.</v>

514
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I think they have to take you to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government and they start with a hundred</v>

515
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Rambo's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just keep training,</v>

516
00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:37.530
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

517
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.830
<v Speaker 3>You'll lose some along the way and after</v>
<v Speaker 3>every hundred you get eight fucking </v>

518
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 3>savages that never had chance to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>

519
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.110
<v Speaker 3>The government never gave him a chance </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get married.</v>

520
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.590
<v Speaker 4>They're that good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

521
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:56.010
<v Speaker 4>all these guys that I know that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been navy seals,</v>

522
00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:01.100
<v Speaker 4>all of them are any special forces guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just you.</v>

523
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.070
<v Speaker 4>Those are different humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

524
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.660
<v Speaker 4>to Digitas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different people,</v>

525
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.320
<v Speaker 4>but what's Jocko navy seal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

526
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.620
<v Speaker 4>So in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

527
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.800
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just just a level that you have to be,</v>

528
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.710
<v Speaker 4>you have to have more control over your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>

529
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 4>more control over your will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more control over your discipline.</v>

530
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:28.670
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the most elite branch of the </v>

531
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:28.670
<v Speaker 4>military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

532
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 4>this is the elite of the elite money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make it insanely difficult to get in.</v>

533
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:37.010
<v Speaker 4>So you just get the cream of the crops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people who are they just a mental </v>

534
00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:41.610
<v Speaker 4>fortitude is just unlike an average </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

535
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.280
<v Speaker 4>If you meet a bunch of people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

536
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:47.960
<v Speaker 4>you realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

537
00:28:47.961 --> 00:28:50.210
<v Speaker 4>people come in all kinds of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>levels.</v>

538
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.160
<v Speaker 4>There's people that just only surround </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves with other excellence</v>

539
00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.770
<v Speaker 4>and those dudes like those Jocko type </v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes or Tim Kennedy type dudes,</v>

540
00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:06.460
<v Speaker 4>those different kinds of human like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't make a lot of those.</v>

541
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:11.990
<v Speaker 4>You just want to have only those boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta.</v>

542
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.890
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot that has to happen before </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can become a person like that.</v>

543
00:29:15.891 --> 00:29:20.891
<v Speaker 4>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to travel through many valleys </v>

544
00:29:20.891 --> 00:29:24.880
<v Speaker 4>of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the body to get to be a person like </v>

545
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.620
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a person have a insane resolve in a time</v>

546
00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:30.230
<v Speaker 4>of war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>

547
00:29:30.231 --> 00:29:33.730
<v Speaker 4>very intense human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even a time a war.</v>

548
00:29:33.731 --> 00:29:37.290
<v Speaker 4>Look at these 12 Filipino kids in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking back caves down there.</v>

549
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.940
<v Speaker 4>Local went to get them to fucking seals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>

550
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 4>The seal team</v>

551
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 1>went down that that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

552
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:48.300
<v Speaker 1>there's different various agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a seal team there.</v>

553
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the seal team that that's his </v>

554
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.100
<v Speaker 1>elite elite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you.</v>

555
00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.070

<v Speaker 1>That's how you probably become a fucking</v>

556
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:05.250
<v Speaker 1>a bodyguard to the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to fucking start like as an </v>

<v Speaker 1>Just to adjust to human life and life </v>
<v Speaker 1>without fucking Aaron bombs.</v>

559
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:16.951
<v Speaker 1>Go off every 20 minutes and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then move up in that system until you </v>

560
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:19.510
<v Speaker 1>get to that level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the secret service.</v>

561
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>

562
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:27.811
<v Speaker 1>They put you to the secret service </v>
<v Speaker 1>training school and you're there in 60 </v>

575
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.250
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have so many shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have so many accidents out</v>

576
00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 1>there were police officers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't hire enabled kids anymore.</v>

577
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:19.500
<v Speaker 1>They hire college graduates that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>never had what we had seen when you were</v>

578
00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:22.030

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.050
<v Speaker 1>you've never been arrested in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really could have been a cop.</v>

580
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.660
<v Speaker 1>You're a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you really could have been killed.</v>

581
00:31:29.661 --> 00:31:34.661
<v Speaker 1>A cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have been joe the cop in </v>

582
00:31:34.661 --> 00:31:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Quincy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass that drives around and shit like </v>

585
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.320
<v Speaker 1>but joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cop would have been different if </v>

586
00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cop would've came in here and see me</v>

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.870
<v Speaker 1>and Jamie argue joe the cop wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrest me and Jamie,</v>

588
00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cop would say,</v>

589
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to meet you motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

590
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Retreat will give us both boxing gloves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we would box so that when we were 12</v>

591
00:31:54.461 --> 00:31:57.040
<v Speaker 1>and both go home and get ice cream the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next day joe,</v>

592
00:31:57.041 --> 00:31:58.870
<v Speaker 1>the cop wouldn't throw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was both in jail.</v>

593
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cop wouldn't throw us against a wall</v>

594
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 1>and if we turned around and shoot one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us in the fucking leg,</v>

595
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.310
<v Speaker 1>he was part of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe The cop and Joe on the cop knew what</v>

596
00:32:09.311 --> 00:32:13.030
<v Speaker 1>it was like living in that community as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a child.</v>

597
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

598
00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:20.461
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about a lot of </v>

599
00:32:20.461 --> 00:32:20.461
<v Speaker 1>baptists and I ran into somebody and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked them,</v>

600
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.130
<v Speaker 1>why are we having the situation we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having in this country?</v>

601
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:29.370
<v Speaker 1>The one last week and fucking East </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pittsburgh is just mind blowing.</v>

602
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:35.670
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker just now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different angles for </v>

603
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.911
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had just finished doing a shoot </v>

604
00:32:38.911 --> 00:32:40.020
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kid took off this cop watch them</v>

605
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.440
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay God down,</v>

606
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:45.440
<v Speaker 2>drop down military style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blast him three times.</v>

607
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh shoot me in the leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

608
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Shoot me in the leg for running away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what joe the cop would do.</v>

609
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even shooting someone in the leg </v>

610
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you get,</v>

611
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be something that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really fucked up.</v>

612
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that she showed me some of </v>

613
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:02.440
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take your fucking life.</v>

614
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I hear Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather shoot you in the leg then </v>

615
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.750
<v Speaker 2>take your life if it's an iffy call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just so you know,</v>

616
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not safe to shoot someone in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leg.</v>

617
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Speaker 2>People die from getting shot in the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>ankle.</v>

618
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.410
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

619
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:20.411
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just mentioning the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give anybody the </v>

620
00:33:20.411 --> 00:33:20.411
<v Speaker 2>impression they can just go around </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting people.</v>

621
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.840
<v Speaker 2>How many movies did we grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the guy got shot in the </v>

622
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:25.840
<v Speaker 2>shoulder.</v>

623
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.810
<v Speaker 2>We just went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live getting show miss shaver.</v>

624
00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:32.850
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get pistol whipped and then when </v>

625
00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:32.850
<v Speaker 2>they wake up it's like nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just start duking it out.</v>

626
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.640
<v Speaker 2>They got pistol whipped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was pistol whipping.</v>

627
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.650
<v Speaker 2>People remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would club them in the head with </v>

628
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:41.990
<v Speaker 2>the pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was so crazy.</v>

629
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.710
<v Speaker 2>That was like a thing and then these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people will wake up.</v>

630
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

631
00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:52.421
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get pistol whipped with the but</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got pistol whipped with the gun to the</v>

632
00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:56.390
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing blood,</v>

633
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.460
<v Speaker 2>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if fucking hurt,</v>

634
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck type of gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like an automatic,</v>

635
00:34:02.391 --> 00:34:04.650
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a nine millimeter tighten.</v>

636
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a revolver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got hit with the bud or what a </v>

637
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 2>weird feature of the human body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you hit it in the right spots,</v>

638
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 2>it goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have like a plug.</v>

639
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:19.460
<v Speaker 2>We have like a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some people's plugs.</v>

640
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:22.700
<v Speaker 2>A little looser than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people's plugs like Mark Hunt.</v>

641
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.510
<v Speaker 2>It takes forever to knock it loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people could just take it,</v>

642
00:34:27.511 --> 00:34:29.760
<v Speaker 2>some people can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking weird.</v>

643
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.700
<v Speaker 2>So weird characteristic hit people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they go unconscious.</v>

644
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:39.130
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange feature that we </v>

645
00:34:39.841 --> 00:34:41.700
<v Speaker 2>exploit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

646
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:47.970
<v Speaker 2>but movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always make it like it's no big </v>

647
00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:47.970
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big fucking deal.</v>

648
00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:50.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should avoid having it done to you.</v>

649
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal to get knocked </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>

650
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird.</v>

651
00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.380
<v Speaker 2>When we first started hanging out one </v>
<v Speaker 2>afternoon,</v>

652
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.280
<v Speaker 2>you took me to see that boxing coach at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time he had four academy award.</v>

653
00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:11.381
<v Speaker 2>God as he was training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that Terry Clay Bond try reclaimed </v>

654
00:35:11.381 --> 00:35:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Monteith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terry's amazing.</v>

655
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.070
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We walked in there,</v>

656
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.310
<v Speaker 2>we went upstairs and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think uh,</v>

657
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.050
<v Speaker 2>at the time when we walked the Nicholas </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage is up there at the time,</v>

658
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:25.880
<v Speaker 2>was a piece on his shit at the bar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

659
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:30.881
<v Speaker 2>And then Terry came over and gave you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hug and we went downstairs and tyree </v>

660
00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.090
<v Speaker 2>grab Steve Simone later on because Steve</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked there at the time.</v>

661
00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.600
<v Speaker 2>This is 97,</v>
<v Speaker 2>98 as a gym.</v>

662
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

663
00:35:39.661 --> 00:35:41.770
<v Speaker 1>that guy's in the wrong profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a comic,</v>

664
00:35:41.771 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 1>he should've been a boxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a meal,</v>

665
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.980
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never forgot that him saying that </v>

666
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.510
<v Speaker 1>and all the stuff you talk about brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage and and whatever,</v>

667
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.800
<v Speaker 1>it took a lot for you that at that age </v>
<v Speaker 1>to realize that this was fucking for </v>

668
00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.430
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>

669
00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.610
<v Speaker 2>this was dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no money in it.</v>

670
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.310
<v Speaker 2>There was no temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This head,</v>

671
00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.780
<v Speaker 2>this head shit is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>

672
00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.800
<v Speaker 2>It was real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was also a.</v>

673
00:36:06.801 --> 00:36:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what happened before this?</v>

674
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened to the guys that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw playing football and black and white</v>

675
00:36:16.961 --> 00:36:18.400
<v Speaker 2>with leather helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

676
00:36:18.401 --> 00:36:19.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leather helmets are safer,</v>

677
00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.570
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not because you don't feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>as confident.</v>

678
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.420
<v Speaker 2>When they had those leather helmets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't crash into each other the same</v>

679
00:36:25.421 --> 00:36:27.000
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

680
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:32.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I agree with it because </v>

681
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know much about the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an opinion that no pads,</v>

682
00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 2>no helmets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>football would be safer because you </v>

683
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be able to do the same things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're doing now.</v>

684
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.020
<v Speaker 2>You can't just run into people head to </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

685
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.830
<v Speaker 2>You just just destroy you and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>only do it a few times.</v>

686
00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Your body will start breaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're putting helmets on and </v>

687
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:53.131
<v Speaker 2>pads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it accentuates your ability to run into </v>

688
00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 2>someone with all your force that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>unnatural and it creates an unnatural </v>

689
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:59.500
<v Speaker 2>jarring of the body and the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rugby guys don't get.</v>

690
00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.840
<v Speaker 2>The rugby guys don't have all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>paths,</v>

691
00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.940
<v Speaker 2>so when they're clashing into each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

692
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:08.230
<v Speaker 2>they're learning how to roll with things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not just colliding into each other.</v>

693
00:37:08.231 --> 00:37:10.720
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a different game when you've got</v>

694
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.910
<v Speaker 2>padding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you take away the padding,</v>

695
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:17.110
<v Speaker 2>people have to be more careful and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're engaged.</v>

696
00:37:17.111 --> 00:37:19.270
<v Speaker 2>They can't just charge in and smash into</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

697
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:24.420
<v Speaker 2>They won't last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always cte the game context sport for </v>

698
00:37:25.331 --> 00:37:27.640
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting banged up.</v>

699
00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a contact sport context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there any.</v>

700
00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting fun though.</v>

701
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.670
<v Speaker 2>I remember being a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from New Jersey.</v>

702
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a real good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fucking Jersey,</v>

703
00:37:38.321 --> 00:37:38.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

704
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.940
<v Speaker 2>we know football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even go to soccer back then </v>

705
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:44.950
<v Speaker 2>when I lived in Jersey through soccer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of Spanish people,</v>

706
00:37:44.951 --> 00:37:49.660
<v Speaker 2>played the dark side of the court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It played soccer on Sundays.</v>

707
00:37:49.661 --> 00:37:51.090
<v Speaker 2>They will even let.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants me,</v>

708
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.410
<v Speaker 2>a couple of Spanish guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But besides that,</v>

709
00:37:53.411 --> 00:37:54.240
<v Speaker 2>soccer was not</v>

710
00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.820
<v Speaker 1>begging my area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

711
00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:02.050
<v Speaker 1>when I moved to Aspen I would go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital on Saturday just to walk around</v>

712
00:38:02.271 --> 00:38:05.300
<v Speaker 1>and get a big of the sandwich and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>see rugby.</v>

713
00:38:05.301 --> 00:38:10.301
<v Speaker 1>I had never saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know what the fuck it was </v>

714
00:38:10.301 --> 00:38:10.301
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in good shape.</v>

715
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:14.180
<v Speaker 1>And after about three times I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys at I want you to show up</v>

716
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.540
<v Speaker 1>on a fucking Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at them like,</v>

717
00:38:17.541 --> 00:38:19.750
<v Speaker 1>what are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

718
00:38:19.751 --> 00:38:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what the fuck you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing.</v>

719
00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.980
<v Speaker 1>They have a big rug rug fest in Aspen </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year,</v>

720
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.850
<v Speaker 1>pretty much every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I first saw rugby was in </v>

721
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>

722
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you've ever seen it live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only seen it on TV.</v>

723
00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it live,</v>

724
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

725
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 2>I saw three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw two things that blew me away live </v>

726
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.611
<v Speaker 2>and in Colorado I saw rugby and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they did like a tour de France star</v>

727
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:51.090
<v Speaker 2>type race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did it sludge snowmass village </v>

728
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 2>and I knew exactly what it was the road </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and how we would have to be a circle </v>

729
00:38:55.181 --> 00:39:00.181
<v Speaker 2>to go by and you didn't have to go back </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to rule to would just do circles </v>

730
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 2>around snowmass and I still remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>being on a hill,</v>

731
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:09.510
<v Speaker 2>listening to them going up the hill and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it just blew my fucking mind the way the</v>

732
00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:16.801
<v Speaker 2>tire was hitting the speeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how fast they were going uphill and</v>

733
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:23.341
<v Speaker 2>then 20 years later you realize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing ppo and fucked and hanging out </v>

734
00:39:23.341 --> 00:39:26.320
<v Speaker 2>with Sheryl Crow's though husband </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting all that shit.</v>

735
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine when they were shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the eighties when I saw him,</v>

736
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Jesus was shit stronger back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine what's the drug that </v>

737
00:39:34.811 --> 00:39:37.120
<v Speaker 2>they shoot at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The legs won't stop moving at night.</v>

738
00:39:37.121 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 2>So they got a gun on a bicycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

739
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.750
<v Speaker 2>epo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the delay,</v>

740
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:45.910
<v Speaker 2>the blood gets thick apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably saying it wrong,</v>

741
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.120
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this feeling like they have to</v>

742
00:39:49.121 --> 00:39:54.121
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of our buddies was a biker and you </v>

743
00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:56.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was professional tour guide,</v>

744
00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:57.460
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

745
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 2>not like a super famous super successful</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

746
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:05.221
<v Speaker 2>but he was a professional bike rider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you call one of those </v>

747
00:40:05.221 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 2>cyclists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professional cyclists.</v>

748
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And he would tell us about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how guys you'd hear them.</v>

749
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.320
<v Speaker 2>He knew that they were on epo and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would hear them when they were on a </v>

750
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 2>tour bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd get up in the middle of the night</v>

751
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 2>and go ride their bike.</v>

752
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Like they felt like they had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>

753
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:22.250
<v Speaker 2>So I guess if you're on a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

754
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.840
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it would be awesome </v>

755
00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.051
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could take some drug that like </v>

756
00:40:31.051 --> 00:40:32.230
<v Speaker 2>super juiced up your endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds awesome.</v>

757
00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:37.330
<v Speaker 2>But apparently it's just not very safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were saying that um,</v>

758
00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot of executives take it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

759
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
<v Speaker 2>there's people that are executives that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just entering endurance races and </v>

760
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:52.171
<v Speaker 2>they're taking epo and entering into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these endurance races that like regular </v>

761
00:40:52.211 --> 00:40:55.470
<v Speaker 2>people with regular jobs just decided to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it.</v>

762
00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 2>There was some article about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if he could find it.</v>

763
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.800
<v Speaker 2>It was like Ceos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

764
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:07.450
<v Speaker 2>entering into an endurance races taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>epo,</v>

765
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:12.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's a few fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm been caught with it and it </v>

766
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:14.200
<v Speaker 2>apparently just really juices up your </v>
<v Speaker 2>urine.</v>

767
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:18.250
<v Speaker 2>You go 16 rounds instead of fucking type</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

768
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend that used to shoot me </v>

769
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.450
<v Speaker 2>steroids and never do a pushup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

770
00:41:24.451 --> 00:41:26.730
<v Speaker 2>he was whacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy dog.</v>

771
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.750
<v Speaker 2>When are you going to go to the gym?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next week?</v>

772
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 2>That's same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget seeing him eat like </v>

773
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 2>half a bottle</v>

774
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.470
<v Speaker 3>of Winnie v,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pink football.</v>

775
00:41:36.471 --> 00:41:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Like the pink ones in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would just put them into this.</v>

776
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick the X.</v>

779
00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:50.831

780
00:41:57.411 --> 00:42:00.230
<v Speaker 3>came out of always wanting you to do the</v>
<v Speaker 3>impersonation from you.</v>

781
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:03.150

<v Speaker 3>From that,</v>

782

924
00:49:43.281 --> 00:49:44.120
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was rudy,</v>

925

<v Speaker 1>the Haitian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the only Haitian kid in the </v>

926
00:49:49.121 --> 00:49:50.831
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lived on 88th street and I fucked </v>

00:49:50.831 --> 00:49:53.811
<v Speaker 1>them up this day and his father came </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and held my arms and he made rudy </v>

928
00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.670
<v Speaker 1>punched me and I'll never forget that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>lip was bleeding and he took me upstairs</v>

929
00:49:58.671 --> 00:50:03.671
<v Speaker 1>and knocked on my mother's door and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother opened up the door and half a </v>

00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:05.210
<v Speaker 1>fucking angle and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>

931
00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.590
<v Speaker 1>She goes out with Coco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

932
00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.620
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next time you sun hits my son,</v>

933
00:50:09.621 --> 00:50:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

934
00:50:10.691 --> 00:50:15.691

<v Speaker 1>My mom turned around and got a butcher </v>

00:50:15.691 --> 00:50:17.900
<v Speaker 1>knife and chased rudy's.</v>

937
00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 1>So she didn't see a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at that point we were done in the </v>

938
00:50:26.031 --> 00:50:27.500
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez.</v>

939
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.560
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the worse there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I moved to North Bergen,</v>

940
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I saw parents that you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever hear a comedian go hang out </v>

941
00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:43.110
<v Speaker 1>with white kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't a house.</v>

942
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:45.510
<v Speaker 1>How they talked to their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never talk to about.</v>

943
00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:50.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first thing I noticed when I </v>

944
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:50.520
<v Speaker 1>went to jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

945
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.370

<v Speaker 1>the addition go,</v>

946
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fish sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I ever did that in my house.</v>

947
00:50:57.081 --> 00:51:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan are you fucking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom would take the dish,</v>

948
00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:07.530
<v Speaker 1>throw it against the wall and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're not fucking eat and go to </v>

949
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:07.530
<v Speaker 1>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that type of shit.</v>

950

<v Speaker 1>And a kid standing right here with </v>

954
00:51:22.511 --> 00:51:24.290

967
00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.711
<v Speaker 1>devil probably because his dad beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was another kid when I </v>

968

<v Speaker 1>which can you imagine that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would they give that guy yet?</v>

989
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 1>What they give Le Bron?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron's getting about 30 or 40,</v>

990
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 1>but yet he got $6,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>over two years or that was Julius and</v>

991
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.210
<v Speaker 3>he was the biggest play in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>that now this guy's getting 1:54</v>

992
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:35.070

<v Speaker 3>So Dr Jay switches number from 32 to six</v>

993
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.580
<v Speaker 3>and now the NBA All star game came.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all the critics were like,</v>

994
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.210
<v Speaker 3>he came from the Aba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna,</v>

995
00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:46.810
<v Speaker 3>get his ass kicked in the NBA All star </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

996
00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.810
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go look at those statistics.</v>

997
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:54.140
<v Speaker 3>He went off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went off because I'm a white dude </v>

998
00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:55.590
<v Speaker 3>named Pistol Pete Maravich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

999
00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.840
<v Speaker 3>He went to Lsu and lead the country in </v>
<v Speaker 3>scoring a white dude and ended up </v>

1000
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.791
<v Speaker 3>becoming a fucking booze about that dude</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew how to handle the ball because his </v>

1001
00:54:04.791 --> 00:54:09.771
<v Speaker 3>father would beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His father would make him sleep in the </v>

1002
00:54:09.771 --> 00:54:12.951
<v Speaker 3>garage and the winter and beat him until</v>
<v Speaker 3>he learned how to play basketball </v>

1003
00:54:12.951 --> 00:54:14.460
<v Speaker 3>because there was no losing in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking house.</v>

1004
00:54:14.461 --> 00:54:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan?</v>

1005
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking my fucking house.</v>

1006
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Sleep in the garage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No data pistol.</v>

1007
00:54:24.601 --> 00:54:27.630
<v Speaker 3>Pete knew how to dribble jacket with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pistol.</v>

1008
00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Pete would take you deep pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pete can.</v>

1009
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Anybody could cover by the best black </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude in the league and cover pistol </v>

1010
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:39.021
<v Speaker 3>pete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you watch the NBA All star Game </v>

1011
00:54:39.021 --> 00:54:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Pistol Pete stomping chomping people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>give them behind the back passes to </v>

1012
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Julius Irving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He even looks at a do a one path.</v>

1013
00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.400
<v Speaker 3>He's looking at Bob Mcadoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming,</v>

1014
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:52.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't think just puts the ball between</v>
<v Speaker 3>his legs and he gives it to Julia </v>

1015
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:52.590
<v Speaker 3>serving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1016
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:54.660
<v Speaker 3>Because that kid's father stayed on.</v>

1017
00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:59.390
<v Speaker 3>There's different thoughts of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people can handle that.</v>

1018
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Some people have to like some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guys are broken,</v>

1019
00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:07.420
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it's like how much pressure </v>
<v Speaker 3>is too much pressure to create like a </v>

1020
00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.270
<v Speaker 3>superstar like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1021
00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:13.271
<v Speaker 3>Tiger Woods didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His Dad put a lot of pressure on him as </v>

1022
00:55:13.271 --> 00:55:13.271
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1023
00:55:13.271 --> 00:55:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Now let's talk about the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy that died last week,</v>

1024
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.180
<v Speaker 3>but that's a different thing I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He created three fucking kids that </v>

1030
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.240
<v Speaker 3>He did sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>

1031
00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.240
<v Speaker 3>Got To be really careful with the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1032
00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen this to me.</v>

1033
00:55:34.611 --> 00:55:35.840
<v Speaker 3>Two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things come out.</v>

1034
00:55:35.841 --> 00:55:40.841
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's getting the blame for </v>

1035
00:55:40.841 --> 00:55:40.841
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1036
00:55:40.841 --> 00:55:43.930
<v Speaker 3>But this is something you really heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have heard sexual abuse allegations </v>

1037
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:44.380
<v Speaker 3>from his father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1038
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.420
<v Speaker 3>but I listen to what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to what did he create,</v>

1039
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:53.470
<v Speaker 3>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did Joe Jackson do by making them </v>

1040
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.210
<v Speaker 3>not letting them fucking and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let me tell you something to one kid</v>

1041
00:55:56.211 --> 00:55:58.490
<v Speaker 3>could have gone to a college to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball.</v>

1042
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:03.200
<v Speaker 3>The kids had talent as it was gary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indiana ever go to carry and then.</v>

1043
00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:04.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like hell</v>

1044
00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.970
<v Speaker 3>a fucking Delaware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Gary,</v>

1045
00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:11.430
<v Speaker 3>Indiana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1046
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:14.860
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Gary's like crazy.</v>

1047
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.460
<v Speaker 3>He made these kids for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She pulled them out of Gary,</v>

1048
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.380
<v Speaker 3>took him up to fucking Berry Gordy,</v>

1049
00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about this shit.</v>

1050
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Some of them probably hated him for what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

1051
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:31.090
<v Speaker 1>You look back at those lessons that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got Joe Rogan.</v>

1052
00:56:31.091 --> 00:56:33.580
<v Speaker 1>How many people did you look at one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

1053
00:56:33.581 --> 00:56:38.581
<v Speaker 1>fuck you motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then two years later you look back </v>

1054
00:56:38.581 --> 00:56:43.051
<v Speaker 1>and you look at the lesson you learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the whole experience and you </v>

1055
00:56:43.051 --> 00:56:44.320
<v Speaker 1>actually have to go back and hug that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and go,</v>

1056
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:46.720
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for that time.</v>

1057
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:51.990
<v Speaker 1>It made me better motherfucker tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what you did made me a better </v>

1058
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:55.990
<v Speaker 1>person will have to agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that happens along the way.</v>

1059
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Joe wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's maintenance.</v>

1060
00:56:58.391 --> 00:56:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck we are today?</v>

1061
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:05.370
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting thing because we </v>
<v Speaker 4>grew up in a time where kids were just </v>

1062
00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:08.950
<v Speaker 4>allowed to run around outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody ran around outside.</v>

1063
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:11.170
<v Speaker 4>That was just normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1064
00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 4>When you were a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ran around outside.</v>

1065
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.920
<v Speaker 4>Nobody just runs around outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the first time I saw a grown </v>

1066
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 4>lady hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She hit my cousin.</v>

1067
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:26.890
<v Speaker 4>We were both around the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was probably six and she was five and </v>

1068
00:57:28.751 --> 00:57:33.751
<v Speaker 4>this lady slipped on ice in front of her</v>
<v Speaker 4>apartment building and she got up and my</v>

1069
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:39.961
<v Speaker 4>cousin just unfortunately happened to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing right in front of her when she </v>

1070
00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:41.110
<v Speaker 4>fell and she got up and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you laugh at me?</v>

1071
00:57:41.111 --> 00:57:44.530
<v Speaker 4>And she smacked her in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wasn't laughing at her either.</v>

1072
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:47.770
<v Speaker 4>Just she smashed her in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man like it was.</v>

1073
00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 4>She smacked her hard and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

1074
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:56.820
<v Speaker 4>Was that we were both little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little kids and watching some grown </v>

1075
00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:00.240
<v Speaker 4>adults smash our cousin in the face real</v>
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

1076
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.160
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1077
00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:05.970

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>even do anything wrong.</v>

1080
00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Here's some evil fuckers out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll hit little kids.</v>

1081
00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:21.210
<v Speaker 3>That's a dark shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smack and little kids in the face.</v>

1082
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read into probably when I first moved </v>

1083
00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:27.990
<v Speaker 3>from Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to Ada street,</v>

1084
00:58:27.991 --> 00:58:32.991
<v Speaker 3>there was a dude on the block that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>smack the little kids and I'm telling </v>

<v Speaker 3>was words on the street that he would </v>

<v Speaker 3>the ass.</v>

1087
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is that early 70 [inaudible].</v>

1088
00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:51.650
<v Speaker 3>This was the early seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I turned into a joke later on </v>

1089
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:52.400
<v Speaker 3>because it would be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I understood the anger,</v>

1107

<v Speaker 3>that your mother's role is changing </v>

<v Speaker 3>That was at that time.</v>

1257
01:06:53.581 --> 01:06:57.300
<v Speaker 3>That was a big issue because a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks before that,</v>

1258
01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:02.780
<v Speaker 3>a guy named Portora was a baseball coach</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he threw a kid off for speaking </v>

1259
01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:07.761
<v Speaker 3>Spanish on the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me there's no Spanish on the </v>

1260
01:07:07.761 --> 01:07:07.761
<v Speaker 3>bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the kid goes,</v>

1261
01:07:07.761 --> 01:07:08.670
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they spoke Spanish.</v>

1262
01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.130
<v Speaker 3>They threw them off like 20 miles from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the house.</v>

1263
01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Became a big problem in my hometown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to kill the fucking dude,</v>

1264
01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:17.190
<v Speaker 3>but I remember going home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom going,</v>

1265
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:19.410
<v Speaker 3>he's talking to the truth</v>

1266
01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:24.060
<v Speaker 3>and now she speaks Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is America outside.</v>

1267
01:07:24.061 --> 01:07:27.840
<v Speaker 3>You speak American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my mom cut me off right there.</v>

1268
01:07:27.841 --> 01:07:32.841
<v Speaker 3>Like I went home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like ready to fucking be like a </v>

1269
01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:32.841
<v Speaker 3>protestor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

1270
01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:33.450
<v Speaker 3>that don't happen here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're Americans.</v>

1271
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:35.460
<v Speaker 3>He wants to expand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally like the house.</v>

1272
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a real benefit to being </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to speak more than one language.</v>

1273
01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Definitely is complete different </v>
<v Speaker 3>mindset.</v>

1274
01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I speak to my daughter in Spanish.</v>

1275
01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:50.460
<v Speaker 3>If I tell him I asked him mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1276
01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:55.210
<v Speaker 3>I reasked her in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I read,</v>

1277
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.940
<v Speaker 3>I read tyler and spread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

1278
01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:02.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say that things like that they're </v>

1279
01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:05.480
<v Speaker 3>learning new languages in particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>opens up parts of your brain that if </v>

1280
01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.650
<v Speaker 3>you're just a dummy like me that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaks English.</v>

1281
01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:13.070
<v Speaker 3>You can access different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just different ways of looking at </v>

1282
01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:13.630
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1283
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very analytical.</v>

1284
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Say you wanted</v>

1285
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 2>to be a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of your pre.</v>

1286
01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Whatever would be a language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1287
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:26.240
<v Speaker 2>You'd also have a heavy math to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyer,</v>

1288
01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a very heavy math </v>
<v Speaker 2>prereq.</v>

1289
01:08:29.631 --> 01:08:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Iom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1290
01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:35.621
<v Speaker 2>a lot of history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably ended up being a history </v>

1291
01:08:35.621 --> 01:08:38.021
<v Speaker 2>major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there'd be a lot of math while the </v>

1292
01:08:38.021 --> 01:08:38.930
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot on the analytics because it forces</v>

1293
01:08:38.931 --> 01:08:42.800
<v Speaker 2>your mind to solve equations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when,</v>

1294
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:46.670
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the prerequisites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you whatever the fuck it is,</v>

1295
01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:47.890
<v Speaker 2>what is the glue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Requisites.</v>

1296
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Prerequisites to be an attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of math involved.</v>

1297
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be the language involved.</v>

1298
01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:57.850
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be politics involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American political systems,</v>

1299
01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.560
<v Speaker 2>American history systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit,</v>

1300
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:04.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to be heavy math once you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the law.</v>

1301
01:09:04.491 --> 01:09:07.970
<v Speaker 2>School was heavy reading and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But before that,</v>

1302
01:09:07.971 --> 01:09:09.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of problem solving.</v>

1303
01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>

1304
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:15.260
<v Speaker 2>That's how you become a problem solver </v>
<v Speaker 2>by fucking whatever.</v>

1305
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

1306
01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before I got locked up,</v>

1307
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:22.770
<v Speaker 2>I was planning to be an attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was really.</v>

1308
01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm a history major.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1309
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:26.780
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the fucking plan.</v>

1310
01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:30.230
<v Speaker 2>And then history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>

1311
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the best.</v>

1312
01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of going back to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1313
01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:35.020
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1314
01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:35.330

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1318
01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:41.111
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just listening and refresh and then go </v>

1319
01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:43.811
<v Speaker 2>on and read about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you listen to the great but a </v>

<v Speaker 2>total of about 6,000</v>

<v Speaker 2>is hard to do and it's definitely not </v>

1404
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.501
<v Speaker 2>good for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think you get beat up doing that </v>

<v Speaker 2>Different kinds of human.</v>

1407
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believes that in some ways they take </v>

1408
01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:12.980
<v Speaker 2>them to recover from something that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1409
01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:16.891
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just a good good time for that </v>

1410
01:14:16.891 --> 01:14:16.891
<v Speaker 2>question because he just ran a race </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1411
01:14:16.891 --> 01:14:21.360
<v Speaker 2>He ran like a six mile race and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that his legs are not fully </v>

1412
01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 2>recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was saying in the post that,</v>

1413
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his cardio was really good,</v>

1414
01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:28.030
<v Speaker 2>but you got to figure you run for 24 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

1415
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:32.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean he ran for 24 hours just a month </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

1416
01:14:32.321 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1417
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Was it a month ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even a month ago,</v>

1418
01:14:34.991 --> 01:14:36.400
<v Speaker 2>three weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

1419
01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit takes time and he's 50,</v>

1420
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're 50 years old,</v>

1421
01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:45.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not as a recovery is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Recovery is very tough.</v>

1422
01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.150
<v Speaker 2>He's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives to push himself like that.</v>

1423
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm more inclined to try to preserve my </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1424
01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 2>I like pushing myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just a chicken shit.</v>

1425
01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:03.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be breaking hips and </v>

1426
01:15:03.210 --> 01:15:04.180
<v Speaker 2>knees and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our brother just had shoulder surgery,</v>

1427
01:15:04.181 --> 01:15:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo and he just got the stitches</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1428
01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:09.820
<v Speaker 2>This is his second surgery that he's had</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this year,</v>

1429
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had um,</v>

1430
01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:15.850
<v Speaker 2>he had knee surgery real recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a few months ago,</v>

1431
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:21.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't he have his meniscus done a few </v>

1432
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:23.760
<v Speaker 2>months ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This generation of Jujitsu guys is </v>

1433
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.340
<v Speaker 2>learning a lot and they're learning what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to pass on to the next </v>

1434
01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:27.700
<v Speaker 2>generation is that it's great to roll.</v>

1435
01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.190
<v Speaker 2>The lego blocks are great at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is great.</v>

1436
01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:35.850
<v Speaker 2>But there's another aspect to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disposition was called yoga and keeping </v>

1437
01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:37.900
<v Speaker 2>your muscles strong conditioning has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be good.</v>

1438
01:15:37.901 --> 01:15:39.210
<v Speaker 2>And your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1439
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just take care of yourself.</v>

1440
01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.590
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys didn't.</v>

1441
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:45.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't.</v>

1442
01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:45.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1443
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:46.580
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1444
01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.640
<v Speaker 2>it took a while to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality of Jujitsu is it's a </v>

1445
01:15:52.061 --> 01:15:57.061
<v Speaker 2>thing that as you get older you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be much more careful who you trained </v>

1446
01:15:57.061 --> 01:15:58.990
<v Speaker 2>with and how you train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just go balls to the wall like</v>

1447
01:15:58.991 --> 01:16:03.991
<v Speaker 2>you could when you were 27.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep your shit together and </v>

1448
01:16:03.991 --> 01:16:05.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries are real.</v>

1449
01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:08.770
<v Speaker 2>You can't just work through them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was a big fallacy.</v>

1450
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:13.771
<v Speaker 2>People would get hurt and they would try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to roll light and nobody ever rose </v>

1451
01:16:13.771 --> 01:16:13.810
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we say they're gonna roll light and</v>

1452
01:16:13.811 --> 01:16:14.920
<v Speaker 2>then the guy almost gets you in.</v>

1453
01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Then you're trying to get him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know you're defending and</v>

1454
01:16:17.351 --> 01:16:20.080
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heated up roll session,</v>

1455
01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:21.970
<v Speaker 2>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you're like,</v>

1456
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:23.810
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're next.</v>

1457
01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:24.780
<v Speaker 2>All fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you go,</v>

1458
01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:25.470
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next guy.</v>

1459
01:16:25.471 --> 01:16:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to lay on my back at </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

1460
01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:31.831
<v Speaker 2>My half guard bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as it starts getting hot and </v>

1461
01:16:31.831 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost got caught in an arm bar.</v>

1462
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:34.450
<v Speaker 2>They didn't try to pop up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then try to pass his guard.</v>

1463
01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Then you get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1464
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:38.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a thing that's exciting,</v>

1465
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:40.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she jitsu.</v>

1467
01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even.</v>

1468
01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:48.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>addicted to it.</v>

1477
01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:07.930
<v Speaker 2>It's changed who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1478
01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.580
<v Speaker 2>I had an attack from a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation.</v>

1479
01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I was attacking it from looking at Jamie</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going,</v>

1480
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:19.240
<v Speaker 2>I got to do what Jamie does and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing I got Jamie by 25 years and I </v>

1481
01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:24.011
<v Speaker 2>can't do what Jamie does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my game has to be completely </v>

1482
01:17:24.011 --> 01:17:26.000
<v Speaker 2>different to Jamie's Mondays when I come</v>
<v Speaker 2>into class,</v>

1483
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.680
<v Speaker 2>it's more about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1484
01:17:27.681 --> 01:17:29.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1485

<v Speaker 2>could do?</v>

1541

<v Speaker 2>We could do like a circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a circuit training because I have that,</v>

1542
01:20:26.881 --> 01:20:30.180

<v Speaker 2>that echo bike I've never done.</v>

1543
01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:34.870
<v Speaker 2>That's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could do a rose the ACO bike and I</v>

1544
01:20:34.871 --> 01:20:36.750
<v Speaker 2>got a versa climber and I like to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1545
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.300
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do those Tabata sequences.</v>

1546
01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:44.301
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you go hard for 20 seconds </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you rest for 10 seconds and </v>

1547
01:20:44.301 --> 01:20:49.221
<v Speaker 2>then you go hard for 20 seconds and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and you do like eight rounds </v>

1548
01:20:49.221 --> 01:20:49.650
<v Speaker 2>of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking intense.</v>

1549
01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.560
<v Speaker 2>And then you jump on over to the row </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

1550
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:54.600
<v Speaker 2>The machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another one similar number.</v>

1551
01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:56.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like 30,</v>

1553
01:20:57.630 --> 01:21:00.150

<v Speaker 2>And then you go to the versa climber and</v>

1554
01:21:00.151 --> 01:21:01.820
<v Speaker 2>you plug in some.</v>

<v Speaker 2>learned and what I read about 50,</v>

<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1570
01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.770
<v Speaker 2>There's a funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>had racist views that were kind of funny</v>

1573
01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:11.280
<v Speaker 2>and he was just some way in deering </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was such a good actor and it </v>

1574
01:22:11.861 --> 01:22:16.861
<v Speaker 2>was such a good character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So well written and his relationship </v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1585
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:53.370
<v Speaker 2>he looks something like Puerto Rican </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink.</v>

1586
01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.730

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.240
<v Speaker 2>How about some pineapple juice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

<v Speaker 2>It wasn't hateful.</v>

1590
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.450
<v Speaker 2>It was queens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Racism.</v>

1591
01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pineapple juice is delicious.</v>

1592
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:19.120

<v Speaker 2>island would want some pineapple juice?</v>

1593
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:24.210
<v Speaker 2>I would think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you be culturally sensitive to </v>

1594
01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:28.591
<v Speaker 2>like introduce that possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that something that you do have a </v>

1595
01:23:28.591 --> 01:23:29.620
<v Speaker 2>tradition of drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if I said to you,</v>

1596
01:23:29.621 --> 01:23:30.460
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaving him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Somebody heard me say it to you right </v>

1598
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:36.940
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow we'd be good fucking.</v>

1599
01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would have a problem.</v>

1600
01:23:38.411 --> 01:23:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I would have a problem where everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows at 20 years ago,</v>

1601
01:23:41.471 --> 01:23:46.471
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be heading to Chinatown in New York </v>

1602
01:23:46.471 --> 01:23:46.471
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck on the matter of fireworks.</v>

1603
01:23:46.471 --> 01:23:49.750
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 44 bottle rockets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of Roman candles.</v>

1604
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:54.870
<v Speaker 2>You know what's the most stupid man is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the food is somehow racist.</v>

1605
01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's food that's racist food.</v>

1606
01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Like if you talked about black people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also talked about delicious fried </v>

1607
01:24:03.930 --> 01:24:07.921
<v Speaker 2>chicken or delicious Orange Soda or </v>
<v Speaker 2>grape soda would be grape soda right </v>

1608
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:09.310
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orange Soda.</v>

1609
01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.510
<v Speaker 2>So it white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1610
01:24:11.511 --> 01:24:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Orange Soda is a white people thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1611
01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.530
<v Speaker 2>White Trash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orange Soda?</v>

1612
01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.390
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

1613
01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm anti Orange Soda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying like those foods like </v>

1614
01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.640
<v Speaker 2>watermelon and particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you talk about a black person and you</v>

1615
01:24:24.641 --> 01:24:27.580
<v Speaker 2>talk about watermelon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a racist term.</v>

1616
01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Even though watermelon is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking weird.</v>

1617
01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Like what the hell could be wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 2>watermelon if you don't like the taste </v>

1618
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:40.801
<v Speaker 2>of watermelon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a hot summer day and somebody </v>

1619
01:24:40.801 --> 01:24:42.100
<v Speaker 2>busts open a cooler and gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>slice of watermelon,</v>

1620
01:24:42.101 --> 01:24:43.720
<v Speaker 2>how fucking pumped are you?</v>

1621
01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.350
<v Speaker 2>How could watermelon ever be negative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That don't make any sense.</v>

1622
01:24:47.351 --> 01:24:52.351
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes zero sense and the only way it </v>

1623
01:24:52.351 --> 01:24:55.081
<v Speaker 2>makes sense that fried chicken can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative to you is if you're a Vegan or </v>

1624
01:24:55.081 --> 01:24:56.500
<v Speaker 2>a vegetarian and you don't want to eat a</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken.</v>

1625
01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way it makes sense that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a negative because </v>

1626
01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.410
<v Speaker 2>otherwise like fried chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking delicious.</v>

1627
01:25:02.411 --> 01:25:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Who doesn't like fried chicken?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you eat meat,</v>

1628
01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:07.390
<v Speaker 2>fried chicken is something you smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1629
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's really good at making it </v>

1630
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.750
<v Speaker 2>and they got a nice flaky lay on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside,</v>

1631
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:17.611
<v Speaker 2>you bite into that juicy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly cooked chicken fried chicken </v>

1632
01:25:17.611 --> 01:25:21.590

<v Speaker 2>fried chicken.</v>

1635
01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could that be bad?</v>

1636
01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:31.580
<v Speaker 2>How could that ever be racist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1637
01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:32.950
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1638
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:38.950
<v Speaker 2>We got to let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you a racist but not </v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1732
01:29:47.071 --> 01:29:52.071
<v Speaker 3>you counted on by points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what they do is they do it </v>

<v Speaker 3>stuff that you have to do on something </v>

<v Speaker 3>don't miss nothing.</v>

1802
01:33:06.370 --> 01:33:08.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I learned I didn't know this,</v>

1803
01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I will go get an outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He bought American thinks announcer.</v>

1804
01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Ebola was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me explain something to you.</v>

1805
01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Eating a banana and putting them banana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The blend is two different things.</v>

1806
01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:23.410
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that when that was making</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those,</v>

1807
01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:25.590
<v Speaker 3>because I switched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have on it proteins,</v>

1808
01:33:25.630 --> 01:33:27.670
<v Speaker 3>which I use the vanilla or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chocolate,</v>

1809
01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:32.720
<v Speaker 3>the Mexican chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I had this other one that's a </v>

1810
01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.041
<v Speaker 3>polio type protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's coconut milk and I put a use that </v>

1811
01:33:36.521 --> 01:33:41.521
<v Speaker 3>one in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me put a bland in this </v>

1812
01:33:41.521 --> 01:33:41.521
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker just to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1813
01:33:41.521 --> 01:33:41.521
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is delicious.</v>

1814
01:33:41.521 --> 01:33:43.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm onto something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gained weight that week.</v>

1815
01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.640
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the banana.</v>

1816
01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.660
<v Speaker 3>When you blend the banana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's eight points,</v>

1817
01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 3>but when you eat a banana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gods,</v>

1818
01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:57.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's for you because when you eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit and when you drink fruit,</v>

1819
01:33:57.731 --> 01:34:00.700
<v Speaker 3>it's two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why walgreens fat people,</v>

1820
01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:02.290
<v Speaker 3>when you see him going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat breakfast.</v>

1821
01:34:02.290 --> 01:34:05.200
<v Speaker 3>I drink a smoothie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're killing yourself.</v>

1822
01:34:05.650 --> 01:34:10.510
<v Speaker 3>You were killing yourself every time you</v>
<v Speaker 3>puree fruit because when you eat fruit,</v>

1823
01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:13.320
<v Speaker 3>the sativa,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and he was the host and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1936
01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:06.000

1938
01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:12.870

<v Speaker 4>And so a half an hour in,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking I'm just going to check it </v>

01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:20.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna tell him forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I'm thinking this in my head,</v>

1942
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:22.830
<v Speaker 4>I walked up to him and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got you in jail.</v>

1943
01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:23.670

<v Speaker 4>have five minutes.</v>

1945
01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.170
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Thanks man.</v>

1948
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was ready to push out,</v>

1949
01:40:31.981 --> 01:40:36.981
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was totally ready to push you out and </v>

1950
01:40:36.981 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 4>I was so nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first time I went on stage,</v>

1951
01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:42.711
<v Speaker 4>I was fucking terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe it was the name of </v>

1952
01:40:42.711 --> 01:40:42.711
<v Speaker 4>the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stitches,</v>

1953
01:40:42.711 --> 01:40:42.711
<v Speaker 4>stitches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy club.</v>

1954
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.370
<v Speaker 4>August 27,</v>
<v Speaker 4>19,</v>

1955
01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:46.740
<v Speaker 4>88.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was terrified.</v>

1956
01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe I was scared.</v>

1957
01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.030
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't make any sense to me.</v>

1958
01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think I was going to be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought maybe it'd be like a little</v>

1959
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'd never performed before.</v>

1960
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:58.990
<v Speaker 1>So this idea of doing and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1961
01:40:58.991 --> 01:40:59.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1962
01:40:59.581 --> 01:41:04.581
<v Speaker 1>I've taught taekwondo classes in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people before I can talk in front of </v>

1963
01:41:04.581 --> 01:41:08.221
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought about the idea to </v>

1964
01:41:08.221 --> 01:41:10.090
<v Speaker 1>stand up in front of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't fuck it took me.</v>

1965
01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.120
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me a year to think about it </v>

1966
01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.951
<v Speaker 1>because then it snowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't go to work because we can't </v>

1967
01:41:19.951 --> 01:41:21.590
<v Speaker 1>roof in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1968
01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Should I read to the punchline with Tom </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hanks and sally fields?</v>

1969
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Angel Salazar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damon Wayans,</v>

1970
01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:36.330
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched punchline and that pissed me </v>

1971
01:41:37.451 --> 01:41:40.690
<v Speaker 1>the fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

1972
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I went into the yellow pages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found comedy clubs.</v>

1973
01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I called them and comedy works offered a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday night open mic.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You have to call in and they'll give you</v>

<v Speaker 1>sound guy in the bar back and after </v>

2035
01:45:21.471 --> 01:45:24.650
<v Speaker 1>about six months I had two jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hated going home.</v>

2036
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I had a marriage that was just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the one that we all talk about</v>

01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:31.880
<v Speaker 1>when you cannot go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not your home anymore.</v>

2038
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I would basically leave at six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come home at five,</v>

<v Speaker 1>truck and go back to Westminster.</v>

2041
01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:47.980
<v Speaker 1>It was a club away from the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

2042
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:50.450
<v Speaker 1>It was in Westminster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>

2043
01:45:50.451 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 1>It didn't get the best people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2044
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:54.680
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to lose people in there.</v>

2045
01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:57.620
<v Speaker 1>People will poach bands and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2046
01:45:58.490 --> 01:46:01.670
<v Speaker 1>So I still have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the middle of all that,</v>

2047
01:46:01.671 --> 01:46:06.671
<v Speaker 1>it took me two months to get a spot from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wendy and then I went down at Nicholson </v>

2048
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:09.270
<v Speaker 1>army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the original owners.</v>

2049
01:46:09.610 --> 01:46:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Mr Wendy with comedy comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy works in Denver.</v>

2050
01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:16.390
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the original owners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he had Nicholson,</v>

2051
01:46:16.450 --> 01:46:21.450
<v Speaker 1>he told me to keep coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I knew when I walked off that stage,</v>

2052
01:46:22.670 --> 01:46:26.870
<v Speaker 1>that life as I knew it has ad ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>

2053
01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Whatever I thought life was at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

2054
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I had gone out the window like I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday was fucked up for me because </v>

2055
01:46:36.921 --> 01:46:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Saturday I was supposed to be somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>this week,</v>

2056
01:46:39.681 --> 01:46:43.130
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go to my friend's mother's 80th</v>

2057
01:46:43.131 --> 01:46:46.310
<v Speaker 1>birthday party and why it was important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in Philly.</v>

2058
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:49.070
<v Speaker 1>It was away from philly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's in an old folks home.</v>

2059
01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.310
<v Speaker 1>They're the second family that took me </v>
<v Speaker 1>in when my mom died,</v>

2060
01:46:54.190 --> 01:46:56.620
<v Speaker 1>but they took me in a crucial spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gel,</v>

2061
01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:01.560
<v Speaker 1>you're throwing me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 17 and I know where to go.</v>

2062
01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't go to my stepfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had an aunt in New York and I can </v>

2063
01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:11.961
<v Speaker 1>live with and I had a godmother in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harlem and I didn't want to live with </v>

2064
01:47:11.961 --> 01:47:11.961
<v Speaker 1>both on the job.</v>

2065
01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just mentioned to a friend one day we </v>

2066
01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:18.840
<v Speaker 1>were out snorting coke drinking and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>told him,</v>

2067
01:47:18.841 --> 01:47:23.841
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gonna throw me out of the data and </v>

2068
01:47:23.841 --> 01:47:26.040
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't even good friends with me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a week later I saw him at school.</v>

2069
01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to my father.</v>

2070
01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:30.540
<v Speaker 1>You could move in with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was whose birthday?</v>

2071
01:47:30.541 --> 01:47:35.541
<v Speaker 1>It was on Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I got off the phone with her I </v>

2072
01:47:35.541 --> 01:47:36.810
<v Speaker 1>was thinking about how important they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were to me,</v>

2073
01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:41.930
<v Speaker 1>but I still remember being 17 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on that hill on 86th and county </v>

2074
01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:46.401
<v Speaker 1>blvd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about how I had nowhere to go </v>

2075
01:47:46.401 --> 01:47:48.540
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like This was my only shot.</v>

2076
01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Like I had nowhere to go nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't like a homeless shelter.</v>

2077
01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know where the fuck to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably had $10 in my pocket and then</v>

2078
01:47:58.591 --> 01:48:00.010
<v Speaker 1>the younger brother ran up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2079
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:05.030
<v Speaker 1>When he goes dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're waIting for you to come to eat </v>

2080
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.030
<v Speaker 1>the dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm over there.</v>

2081
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I had never met the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How lucky am I?</v>

2082
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I never met the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty lucky and I walked in and </v>

2083
01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:16.980
<v Speaker 1>they had like six kids and there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what I was used to living.</v>

2084
01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.040
<v Speaker 1>They had nowhere to conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parents were blue collar and they </v>

2085
01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:22.860
<v Speaker 1>took me in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made me a part of that home,</v>

2086
01:48:23.850 --> 01:48:28.850
<v Speaker 1>never asked me for rent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the fucking best house on the </v>

2087
01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:32.751
<v Speaker 1>bLock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to this day I'm tight with all the </v>

2088
01:48:32.751 --> 01:48:33.090
<v Speaker 1>four brothers and sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2089
01:48:33.091 --> 01:48:34.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all one big family,</v>

2090
01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but then kind of fucking lucky like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even talking about being thankful </v>

2091
01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:43.080
<v Speaker 1>for the comedy bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a personal bridge over like I was a</v>

2092
01:48:43.081 --> 01:48:48.081
<v Speaker 1>killer and in and at that point I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost all faith in humanity.</v>

2093
01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I was done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I wasn't a catholic no more.</v>

2094
01:48:53.250 --> 01:48:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I was just waiting to kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2095
01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:57.210
<v Speaker 1>That's all I was waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2096
01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:02.780
<v Speaker 1>It's such a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not even worried about the </v>

2097
01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:06.051
<v Speaker 1>comedy bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more was the personaL bridge where I </v>

2098
01:49:06.051 --> 01:49:06.051
<v Speaker 1>grew the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2099
01:49:06.051 --> 01:49:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how we got In this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2100
01:49:06.511 --> 01:49:08.420

<v Speaker 1>It's good weed.</v>

2101
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.070
<v Speaker 3>They're going to kill the good weed now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2102
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:12.810
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does this work?</v>

2103
01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:13.660
<v Speaker 3>How does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2104
01:49:13.661 --> 01:49:14.150
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2105
01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:16.040
<v Speaker 3>I still got some guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2106
01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you do legally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but illegally for.</v>

2107
01:49:18.931 --> 01:49:21.170
<v Speaker 3>It'll still be available for medicinal </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have.</v>

2108
01:49:21.230 --> 01:49:23.190
<v Speaker 3>we've got to get a card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recreational.</v>

2109
01:49:23.191 --> 01:49:24.990
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be to renew that card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Son.</v>

2110
01:49:25.290 --> 01:49:27.990
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to redo that car.</v>

2111
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:33.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any of your bullshit weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don'T want to eat your fucking water </v>

2112
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.470
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd.</v>

2113
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.780
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got to water it down.</v>

2114
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:36.630
<v Speaker 3>18 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like that,</v>

2115
01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:38.310
<v Speaker 3>but never fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing.</v>

2116
01:49:38.610 --> 01:49:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that strong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

2117
01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.580
<v Speaker 3>we've got a da went to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow.</v>

2118
01:49:44.581 --> 01:49:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Will you think you're dealing with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>joy?</v>

2119
01:49:45.850 --> 01:49:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got state,</v>

2120
01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:47.770
<v Speaker 3>federal.</v>

2121
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:50.470
<v Speaker 2>We've got them coming from all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2122
01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Damn tea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

2123
01:49:54.490 --> 01:49:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Just in case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just in case with tom cruise,</v>

2124
01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 2>the american made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking up the medicinal rules in </v>

2125
01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:06.541
<v Speaker 2>Ohio recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't grow your own there if you </v>

2126
01:50:06.541 --> 01:50:06.541
<v Speaker 2>have a card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2127
01:50:06.541 --> 01:50:06.790
<v Speaker 2>they're sneaky with that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2128
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully people eventually voted that </v>

2129
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.910
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you had to get it in there first.</v>

2130
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:12.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way It would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed.</v>

2131
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:14.930
<v Speaker 2>They have everything wired up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a.</v>

2132
01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:18.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a victory because it's gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to make it illegal.</v>

2133
01:50:18.850 --> 01:50:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Now that it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be very difficult to go </v>

2134
01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:26.191
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you have to figure out like why </v>

2135
01:50:26.191 --> 01:50:28.420
<v Speaker 2>do these companies have a monopoly on </v>
<v Speaker 2>making it as if it's legal,</v>

2136
01:50:28.450 --> 01:50:30.910
<v Speaker 2>why can't you make it yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aren't tomatoes legal?</v>

2137
01:50:31.090 --> 01:50:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I can grow tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I.</v>

2138
01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.640
<v Speaker 2>You could even probably grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2139
01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:37.090
<v Speaker 2>do you need a tax stamp or something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow tobacco?</v>

2140
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:40.390
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe to sell it.</v>

2141
01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:44.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want it to grow your own tobacco,</v>

2142
01:50:44.501 --> 01:50:45.970
<v Speaker 2>would you be able to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you said,</v>

2143
01:50:45.971 --> 01:50:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I want to make my own fucking pipes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fill them with my own tobacco,</v>

2144
01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I want to make my own cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you do that?</v>

2145
01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:57.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a possible for personal use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2146
01:50:57.281 --> 01:51:02.281
<v Speaker 2>So if you could do that federally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're saying you can't in Ohio,</v>

2147
01:51:02.441 --> 01:51:06.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't grow your own weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so stupid.</v>

2148
01:51:07.210 --> 01:51:12.200
<v Speaker 2>That's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you even know what you're doing.</v>

2149
01:51:12.510 --> 01:51:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Know I don't know dick about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it,</v>

2150
01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:19.270
<v Speaker 2>but you should be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's legal,</v>

2151
01:51:19.271 --> 01:51:22.330
<v Speaker 2>of course you should be able to grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it's a fucking plant.</v>

2152
01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Not blow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where can you not grow?</v>

2153
01:51:25.031 --> 01:51:26.620
<v Speaker 2>In Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a card,</v>

2154
01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:31.800
<v Speaker 2>here's the worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worry is that you wouldn't charge </v>

2155
01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:32.050
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would keep the money.</v>

2156
01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.060
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just do it with cash.</v>

2157
01:51:34.061 --> 01:51:36.190
<v Speaker 2>You do cash transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the worry,</v>

2158
01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:40.090
<v Speaker 2>but that would be a tax worry more that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2159
01:51:40.091 --> 01:51:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying tobacco to?</v>

2160
01:51:41.711 --> 01:51:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can grow as much as you want.</v>

2161
01:51:43.210 --> 01:51:44.220
<v Speaker 2>You just can't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2162
01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:49.290
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you did not even allowed to grow </v>

2163
01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:49.290
<v Speaker 2>their own for personal use when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to marijuana,</v>

2164
01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:51.220
<v Speaker 2>so it's more restrictive than tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2165
01:51:51.221 --> 01:51:54.220
<v Speaker 2>hi larry,</v>

2167
01:51:58.010 --> 01:52:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

2168
01:52:03.010 --> 01:52:06.030

<v Speaker 2>like why would you let other people </v>

2169
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:08.101
<v Speaker 2>decide that different people in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>group can't grow a plant that's legal </v>

2170
01:52:08.651 --> 01:52:10.750

<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy how you see your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it with your kids.</v>

2191
01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I took my kid to science camp and when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>came from Cuba,</v>

2192
01:53:11.151 --> 01:53:16.151
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of problems medically here </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I came to this country and one of </v>

2193
01:53:16.151 --> 01:53:20.861
<v Speaker 1>them was the allergies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The allergies were completely different </v>

2194
01:53:20.861 --> 01:53:21.440
<v Speaker 1>than what I was used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A different country.</v>

2195
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Their fucking mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my allergies.</v>

2196
01:53:24.691 --> 01:53:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever hit me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made that noise?</v>

2197
01:53:26.810 --> 01:53:28.970

<v Speaker 1>Because I don't.</v>

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't scratch the back of my throat </v>
<v Speaker 1>like normal people.</v>

2199
01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Normal people do that noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you all sealed up up there.</v>

2200
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:40.790
<v Speaker 1>The first week of camp I saw my daughter</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do shit.</v>

2201
01:53:40.890 --> 01:53:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I felt so bad for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would try to scratch her nose and I </v>

2202
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:49.961
<v Speaker 1>would see her get frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe rogan just scratching and scratching</v>

2203
01:53:50.361 --> 01:53:54.820
<v Speaker 1>and scratching and now it's three weeks </v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2205
01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:58.970
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you build up your immune system.</v>

2206
01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.690
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird how you see it in front of</v>

<v Speaker 1>with me at that age when I came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba right away I was in the hospital on</v>

<v Speaker 1>tonsils and the fucking allergies and </v>

<v Speaker 2>thing that did disturb me though,</v>

2385

2386
02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:21.740

<v Speaker 2>but there's a thing about when a dude is</v>

<v Speaker 2>what it would like to be a chicken.</v>

<v Speaker 2>was 12,</v>

02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:35.660
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms dot tina used to call him.</v>

2416
02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:42.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had to sit there and take it.</v>

2417
02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:47.160
<v Speaker 3>It was whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be.</v>

2418
02:04:47.161 --> 02:04:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a little jimmy lightness slippers.</v>

2419
02:04:49.351 --> 02:04:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Everybody should just let him be who he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

2420
02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:55.350
<v Speaker 3>He had a dog named tramp that wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have his dog ever.</v>

2421
02:04:55.540 --> 02:05:00.540
<v Speaker 3>He lived outside tramp skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you pet the fucking thing was </v>

2422
02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:01.380
<v Speaker 3>the hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a,</v>

2423
02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:04.140
<v Speaker 3>like with those brushes you scrub the </v>
<v Speaker 3>metal brush,</v>

2424
02:05:04.710 --> 02:05:07.440
<v Speaker 3>like you've lived outside tramp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he followed him everywhere.</v>

2425
02:05:07.441 --> 02:05:10.920
<v Speaker 3>He was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love dogs,</v>

2426
02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:15.570
<v Speaker 3>but you're very lucky because I did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>

2427
02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:20.640
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in an environment standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you when my man on the corner,</v>

2428
02:05:20.641 --> 02:05:23.380
<v Speaker 3>we see a trans gender person crossed </v>
<v Speaker 3>mystery,</v>

2429
02:05:23.410 --> 02:05:25.230
<v Speaker 3>like look at the shape of this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2430
02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:30.180
<v Speaker 3>As simple as that is as a judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that judgment,</v>

2431
02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:32.220
<v Speaker 3>but it was more of a sense of humor.</v>

2432
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:35.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we were looking at a picture of a</v>

2433
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:40.790
<v Speaker 3>of archie bunker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>America understood it because he knew </v>

2434
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:43.530
<v Speaker 3>where he was coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't saying nothing malicious.</v>

2435
02:05:44.070 --> 02:05:49.070
<v Speaker 3>It was a world where he came from and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea was that he was reluctantly </v>

2436
02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.770
<v Speaker 3>open to occasionally taking new </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

2437
02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every guy's sItting at home fucking </v>

2438
02:05:58.820 --> 02:05:58.820
<v Speaker 3>looking at a window,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick him,</v>

2439
02:05:58.820 --> 02:05:59.810
<v Speaker 3>waiting to fuck him to get me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2440
02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:05.680
<v Speaker 3>there's a thousand men at home waiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now to get me fucking to everyday </v>

2441
02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:06.810
<v Speaker 3>a new guy get called out for something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2442
02:06:07.290 --> 02:06:09.210
<v Speaker 3>What's this going to be like in five </v>
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>

2443
02:06:09.211 --> 02:06:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's going to be able to even ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>for fucking piece,</v>

2444
02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:13.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's going to go,</v>

2445
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:15.030
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me give you a little stab.</v>

2446
02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you a little buckaloo wish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

2447
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:24.270
<v Speaker 4>going to come a time and then I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's going to be very long within </v>

2448
02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:26.950
<v Speaker 4>10 years where we're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>read each other's minds.</v>

2449
02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:32.340
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate in a different way and I </v>

2450
02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:36.151
<v Speaker 4>think it's just going to be step one </v>
<v Speaker 4>into some sort of a technological world </v>

2451
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:41.430
<v Speaker 4>where we all read each other's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can connect together and some almost </v>

2452
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:43.150
<v Speaker 4>like telepathic web way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way you use a.</v>

2453
02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:48.540
<v Speaker 4>This is obviously just an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that if technology continues</v>

2454
02:06:50.861 --> 02:06:52.810
<v Speaker 4>to give us closer and closer access to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2455
02:06:52.811 --> 02:06:57.811
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna lose all boundaries between </v>
<v Speaker 4>what a person is and you're going to </v>

2456
02:06:57.811 --> 02:07:01.771
<v Speaker 4>know everything about everyone's past </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone's going to know everything </v>

2457
02:07:01.771 --> 02:07:04.030
<v Speaker 4>about yours and it's going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 4>some unlimited library of the mind.</v>

2458
02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:06.340
<v Speaker 4>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can travel through anyone's mind and</v>

2459
02:07:06.341 --> 02:07:11.341
<v Speaker 4>read anyone's thoughts and as hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>years goes by and the technology gets </v>

2460
02:07:11.341 --> 02:07:12.940
<v Speaker 4>better and a thousand years go by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to integrate.</v>

2461
02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:17.290
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna fIgure out a way whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in our grandchildren's lifetimes or</v>

2462
02:07:17.291 --> 02:07:22.291
<v Speaker 4>their grandchildren's lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that cultural shifts and </v>

2463
02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:25.690
<v Speaker 4>things that are happening in the news </v>
<v Speaker 4>and people waking up to things that they</v>

2464
02:07:25.691 --> 02:07:30.040
<v Speaker 4>think are horrible and people trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>correct the misdeeds of the past.</v>

2465
02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:35.400
<v Speaker 4>All of that is us waking up in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of our culture and trying to </v>

2466
02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:42.060
<v Speaker 4>figure out what's right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring out what's the healthy way to </v>

2467
02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:42.880
<v Speaker 4>move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure balance this thing out.</v>

2468
02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing?</v>

2469
02:07:45.730 --> 02:07:50.730
<v Speaker 4>We're waking up as grown adults trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out our system and there's </v>

2470
02:07:50.730 --> 02:07:52.930
<v Speaker 4>some injustices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those injustices have to be corrected or</v>

2471
02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:57.931
<v Speaker 4>at least recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to understand what's the </v>

2472
02:07:57.931 --> 02:08:00.541
<v Speaker 4>difference between normal male female </v>
<v Speaker 4>interaction and what sexual harassment.</v>

2473
02:08:02.170 --> 02:08:04.510
<v Speaker 4>What when is it when someone doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want you to do it,</v>

2474
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:09.750
<v Speaker 4>when does it become a crime and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want your daughter to ever </v>

2475
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:13.141
<v Speaker 4>experienced that and I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody that's a woman to experience </v>

2476
02:08:13.141 --> 02:08:16.531
<v Speaker 4>real sexual harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the worst fucking thing that could </v>

2477
02:08:16.531 --> 02:08:19.741
<v Speaker 4>probably ever happen to you because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't do anything physically about it </v>

2478
02:08:19.741 --> 02:08:21.940
<v Speaker 4>other than rape or being beaten up or </v>
<v Speaker 4>murdered too creepy place to be in.</v>

2479
02:08:23.050 --> 02:08:28.050
<v Speaker 4>I've had guys hit on me before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever had a guy hit on you </v>

2480
02:08:28.050 --> 02:08:28.050
<v Speaker 4>before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We use.</v>

2481

<v Speaker 3>I was like 13.</v>

2482
02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran out of the car and it was my fault</v>

2483
02:08:32.931 --> 02:08:37.931
<v Speaker 3>for getting in the fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also acknowledged it never fucking </v>

02:14:56.230 --> 02:14:57.710
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So It's,</v>

2609
02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:02.710
<v Speaker 4>it's age 12 is the age of minimum age of</v>
<v Speaker 4>consent,</v>

2610
02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:07.150
<v Speaker 4>but the age in which there are no </v>
<v Speaker 4>restrictions for consensual sex is 18.</v>

2611
02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:10.900
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is that sex between someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's 12 and 18,</v>

2612
02:15:11.740 --> 02:15:15.370
<v Speaker 4>it's not illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they might be able to lock you up if</v>

2613
02:15:15.371 --> 02:15:18.520
<v Speaker 4>you do something super creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is nuts,</v>

2614
02:15:18.521 --> 02:15:23.521
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You imagine if there was some person </v>

2615
02:15:23.521 --> 02:15:26.761
<v Speaker 4>that just only went after 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the United States or Mexico?</v>

2616
02:15:28.190 --> 02:15:30.230
<v Speaker 4>It's Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's why people would fly down.</v>

2617
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Actually I typed it in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is an article on wikipedia </v>

2618
02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:37.210
<v Speaker 4>about aging consent in north America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why federal law?</v>

2619
02:15:37.211 --> 02:15:38.410
<v Speaker 4>So I'll find out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

2620
02:15:38.411 --> 02:15:40.570
<v Speaker 4>that what I just read was about north </v>
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

2621
02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:43.210
<v Speaker 4>How is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just saw north America too,</v>

2622
02:15:43.211 --> 02:15:44.740
<v Speaker 4>and that's why I asked her states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2623
02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:46.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not in north America.</v>

2624
02:15:46.271 --> 02:15:47.640
<v Speaker 4>United states of America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2625
02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:49.030
<v Speaker 4>North americas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada to.</v>

2627
02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:52.750
<v Speaker 4>that is not possible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is it?</v>

2628
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:58.350
<v Speaker 4>Is that really possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The 12 can be the age of consent </v>

2629
02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:58.930
<v Speaker 4>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>

2630
02:15:58.931 --> 02:16:00.200
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>18,</v>

2631
02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:01.980

<v Speaker 4>That's the federal law of Mexico.</v>

2632
02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:03.910
<v Speaker 4>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He scared the shit out of me.</v>

2636
02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:11.410
<v Speaker 4>Age of consent in north America.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So 12 for the ones.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There were people moving to Florida in </v>

2681
02:18:31.390 --> 02:18:33.401
<v Speaker 4>talked about many times called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxycontin express and they sort of </v>

2682

<v Speaker 4>documented that whole route from Ohio </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Kentucky and all the way down </v>

2683
02:18:39.201 --> 02:18:44.201

02:18:44.201 --> 02:18:46.001
<v Speaker 4>Florida just to get pain pills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all you had to do is just get into </v>

2685
02:18:46.001 --> 02:18:48.800
<v Speaker 4>Florida and you'd get a doctor and say </v>
<v Speaker 4>you hurt your back and they would have a</v>

2686

<v Speaker 3>If I offend you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't offend you to before.</v>

3062
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:21.130
<v Speaker 4>In the beginning of the shoW,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said something very offensive until </v>

3063
02:37:21.130 --> 02:37:21.860
<v Speaker 4>term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in my reality was really,</v>

3064
02:37:21.861 --> 02:37:26.861
<v Speaker 4>you won't fire crackers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You buy it from a chinese dude now then </v>

3065
02:37:26.861 --> 02:37:26.861
<v Speaker 4>charlie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is that racist?</v>

3066
02:37:26.861 --> 02:37:28.550
<v Speaker 4>Because that's racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as a society,</v>

3067
02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:32.080
<v Speaker 4>how is it racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>factual chinese people out of fireworks?</v>

3068
02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:36.140
<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's weird ones that we all let fly.</v>

3069
02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:38.990
<v Speaker 4>Like black dudes with big dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's complaining about that.</v>

3070
02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:44.140
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever hear that you assume black </v>

3071
02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:44.140
<v Speaker 4>dude as a big deck because anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>combined?</v>

3072
02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:48.550
<v Speaker 4>Probably They're looking to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that might be like maybe I'm the </v>

3073
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.550
<v Speaker 4>first one to get called out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's racist.</v>

3074
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:50.000
<v Speaker 4>To think that black dudes have big </v>
<v Speaker 4>decks.</v>

3075
02:37:51.890 --> 02:37:56.300
<v Speaker 4>Is it is if it's positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it pot is like a positive attribute.</v>

3076
02:37:56.301 --> 02:37:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you said asian people are better</v>

3077
02:37:59.451 --> 02:38:00.950
<v Speaker 4>at math,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people would say that's racist.</v>

3078
02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:02.660
<v Speaker 4>How is it racist?</v>

3079
02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:07.660
<v Speaker 4>If they're really good at something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if they have more talent or skill </v>

3080
02:38:07.761 --> 02:38:12.170
<v Speaker 4>or more accomplishments hasn't racist </v>
<v Speaker 4>but isn't that racial if it's good,</v>

3081
02:38:13.430 --> 02:38:14.810
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like jews accepted.</v>

3082
02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:19.990
<v Speaker 4>If you tell ari that more european jews,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one nobel science prizes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>of course we're smarter.</v>

3084
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:25.610
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it racist to talk about how many jEws</v>

<v Speaker 4>once,</v>

3090
02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:44.980

<v Speaker 4>the experiences and what led to just </v>

02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:49.670
<v Speaker 4>google the numbers of european jews that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have won nobel science prizes.</v>

3092

<v Speaker 4>You know how many Guinea from New Jersey</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is where we get started</v>

3135
02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:52.850
<v Speaker 1>is where we get started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to.</v>

3136
02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:54.870
<v Speaker 1>We got daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When do you think about.</v>

3137
02:40:54.871 --> 02:40:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you think about ever stopping doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup?</v>

3138
02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Because I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally I think about it and then I</v>

3139
02:40:59.411 --> 02:41:04.411
<v Speaker 1>take a flight back with dice from New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York and I look at dyson before I </v>

3140
02:41:04.411 --> 02:41:04.411
<v Speaker 1>approach them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit down,</v>

3141
02:41:04.411 --> 02:41:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I look at them from 10 feet away for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and I think to myself,</v>

3142
02:41:09.031 --> 02:41:10.890
<v Speaker 1>is this what I want to be doing at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>age?</v>

3143
02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:13.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think about what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would we be doing?</v>

3144
02:41:15.270 --> 02:41:20.270
<v Speaker 1>What would you really want to be a run </v>

<v Speaker 1>When george was 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget.</v>

3171
02:42:44.971 --> 02:42:45.990
<v Speaker 1>He called me one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3173
02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:47.750
<v Speaker 1>I go home to sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3174
02:42:47.770 --> 02:42:51.000
<v Speaker 1>drive to Colorado springs and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage.</v>

3175
02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Open up me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3176
02:42:51.831 --> 02:42:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't get on that stage because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous manager.</v>

3177
02:42:55.410 --> 02:42:56.660
<v Speaker 1>That was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>

3178
02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:59.640
<v Speaker 1>That club at the time [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't let you get on stage unless you</v>

3179
02:42:59.641 --> 02:43:02.310
<v Speaker 1>took a comedy class with 35 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3180
02:43:02.311 --> 02:43:04.170
<v Speaker 1>that was a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

3181
02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll waive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he threw me out on stage and this old</v>

3182
02:43:08.731 --> 02:43:12.280
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that old guy had no career</v>

3183
02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:14.320
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did the local places.</v>

3184
02:43:14.321 --> 02:43:18.700
<v Speaker 2>He owned two clubs and he worked a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple clubs at,</v>

3185
02:43:18.701 --> 02:43:22.150
<v Speaker 2>hired him still he died on the road or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3186
02:43:22.151 --> 02:43:26.770
<v Speaker 2>My point being that he helped me a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an old guy.</v>

3187
02:43:26.771 --> 02:43:31.771
<v Speaker 2>Like I looked at him and at first my </v>
<v Speaker 2>first opinion of him was this whole </v>

3188
02:43:31.771 --> 02:43:31.771
<v Speaker 2>losing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3189
02:43:31.771 --> 02:43:34.270
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a no loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hadn't been doing it for 30 years.</v>

3190
02:43:34.271 --> 02:43:38.290
<v Speaker 2>He committed to this and no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 2>his turnout was or whatever,</v>

3191
02:43:38.291 --> 02:43:40.090
<v Speaker 2>he was still a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died a comic.</v>

3192
02:43:40.750 --> 02:43:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him maybe two years until he</v>
<v Speaker 2>died and I had lost contact with them.</v>

3193
02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Well george carlin died on the road.</v>

<v Speaker 2>other guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>For years he was known as a heroin </v>
<v Speaker 2>addict,</v>

3219

<v Speaker 2>and the chicks on drugs.</v>

3222
02:45:08.621 --> 02:45:11.170
<v Speaker 2>She's doing the press conference while </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's on drugs.</v>

3223
02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:16.440
<v Speaker 2>What's his name rather than one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy that was in heat that the neuro </v>

3224
02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:19.150
<v Speaker 2>put them in a rehaB himself and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>married heidi fleiss for awhile.</v>

3225
02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Who was with tom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's been a junkie for 2000 years.</v>

3226
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:30.510
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't I remember his last sizemore </v>

3227
02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:31.840
<v Speaker 2>size?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mom have some girl comes up when she had</v>

3228
02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:33.700
<v Speaker 2>26.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3229
02:45:33.701 --> 02:45:36.000
<v Speaker 2>he molested me on a movie set when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

3230
02:45:36.030 --> 02:45:41.030
<v Speaker 2>That's great and dandy dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't ruin some of these life </v>

3231
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.980
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you think is happening?</v>

3232
02:45:42.010 --> 02:45:43.780
<v Speaker 2>This is my question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why are.</v>

3233
02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Why are people accepting these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these situations like the chris hardwick</v>

3234
02:45:48.911 --> 02:45:53.911
<v Speaker 2>situation or why is everybody instantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that the guy's guilty?</v>

3235
02:45:54.370 --> 02:45:57.070
<v Speaker 2>No one giving him the benefit of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doubt.</v>

3236
02:45:57.071 --> 02:45:59.280
<v Speaker 2>No court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no justice court.</v>

3237
02:45:59.290 --> 02:46:01.450
<v Speaker 2>There's no nothing and in some some </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases,</v>

3238
02:46:01.451 --> 02:46:03.550
<v Speaker 2>like the worst case was garrison </v>
<v Speaker 2>keillor,</v>

3239
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:05.530
<v Speaker 2>garrison keillor's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the host of the lake,</v>

3240
02:46:05.531 --> 02:46:09.460
<v Speaker 2>woebegone chronicles like this radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>show on pbs think it is,</v>

3241
02:46:09.461 --> 02:46:10.070
<v Speaker 2>is that what it is?</v>

3242
02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:14.540
<v Speaker 4>He apparently hugged a woman and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand went down her back.</v>

3243
02:46:14.590 --> 02:46:17.000
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the depiction,</v>

3244
02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:20.510
<v Speaker 4>and he apologized to her and he sent her</v>
<v Speaker 4>an email.</v>

3245
02:46:20.511 --> 02:46:21.590
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't Worry about it.</v>

3246
02:46:21.591 --> 02:46:23.240
<v Speaker 4>It's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was nothing.</v>

3247
02:46:23.390 --> 02:46:25.550
<v Speaker 4>And then they continued,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

3248
02:46:25.551 --> 02:46:30.551
<v Speaker 4>to correspond and we're friends again </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then this is all this stuff start </v>

3249
02:46:30.551 --> 02:46:35.381
<v Speaker 4>happening with al franken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he had this complaint brought </v>

3250
02:46:35.871 --> 02:46:39.110
<v Speaker 4>up by this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She reintroduced it and said that a long</v>

3251
02:46:39.111 --> 02:46:44.111
<v Speaker 4>time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he put his hand on my back and they </v>

3252
02:46:44.111 --> 02:46:46.181
<v Speaker 4>canceled the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took his name off of it and they </v>

3253
02:46:46.181 --> 02:46:48.860
<v Speaker 4>did it like really quickly and it's one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of those things where you just go,</v>

3254
02:46:48.861 --> 02:46:53.861
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really like the guy in one moment in </v>

3255
02:46:53.861 --> 02:46:56.210
<v Speaker 4>time touches someone's back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was creepy or not.</v>

3256
02:46:56.420 --> 02:47:00.290
<v Speaker 4>Let's assume it was a terrible error and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was creepy.</v>

3257
02:47:00.350 --> 02:47:02.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3258
02:47:02.990 --> 02:47:05.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's it.</v>

3259
02:47:06.110 --> 02:47:10.040
<v Speaker 4>Just touching someone's back and you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a hysterical reaction.</v>

3260
02:47:10.190 --> 02:47:15.190
<v Speaker 4>That is hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's almost the definition of </v>

3261
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:17.561
<v Speaker 4>hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're not talking about evil person </v>

3262
02:47:17.561 --> 02:47:17.561
<v Speaker 4>talking about a person who touched </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's back,</v>

3263
02:47:17.561 --> 02:47:21.851
<v Speaker 4>like we got to be real careful with what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you destroy a person's whole life with.</v>

3264
02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.760
<v Speaker 4>So on the one side you have the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>case scenario,</v>

3265
02:47:25.761 --> 02:47:29.930
<v Speaker 4>which is like a bill cosby who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugging people and raping people.</v>

3266
02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:34.960
<v Speaker 4>So worst case scenario for these </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful elite type people that are </v>

3267
02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.930
<v Speaker 4>getting these women into their web and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend he's another one,</v>

3268
02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:44.330
<v Speaker 4>which they will all live on it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knew about it was written into</v>

3269
02:47:44.331 --> 02:47:47.660
<v Speaker 4>his contract.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was sexual harassment clauses were in</v>

3270
02:47:47.661 --> 02:47:49.040
<v Speaker 4>his contract,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3271
02:47:49.140 --> 02:47:50.960
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was known for.</v>

3272
02:47:51.270 --> 02:47:52.220
<v Speaker 4>Make sure we're correct.</v>

3273
02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:57.680
<v Speaker 4>We really bothers me about harvey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going tell it what bothers me about </v>

3274
02:47:57.680 --> 02:47:58.250
<v Speaker 4>harvey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we got to die.</v>

3275
02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:03.320
<v Speaker 4>There is a lot of people that have to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>indicted and this is one of my feeling </v>

3276
02:48:03.351 --> 02:48:04.300
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This would be,</v>

3277
02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:08.060
<v Speaker 4>this should be a rico act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the rico act.</v>

3278
02:48:08.390 --> 02:48:12.520
<v Speaker 4>Agents manages oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eddie,</v>

3279
02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:16.730
<v Speaker 4>because everYbody knew everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's a question.</v>

3280
02:48:16.731 --> 02:48:21.731
<v Speaker 4>How much do they know in 2005?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody knew Joe Diaz was a kofi.</v>

3281

02:53:52.090 --> 02:53:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I always knew I was fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I always knew I was already lit art.</v>

3396
02:53:55.480 --> 02:53:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Listening to what I always knew that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was funny.</v>

3397
02:53:58.481 --> 02:54:03.481
<v Speaker 1>So I always worked on being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think somebody was on let me </v>

3398
02:54:03.481 --> 02:54:06.340
<v Speaker 1>suck their dick or eat their pussy to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a star.</v>

3399
02:54:06.400 --> 02:54:09.870
<v Speaker 1>So that was never in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But think about people who.</v>

3400
02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:12.790
<v Speaker 1>How many people have you met with sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

3401
02:54:12.791 --> 02:54:17.791
<v Speaker 1>So when this town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people have come and gone in </v>

3402
02:54:17.791 --> 02:54:20.281
<v Speaker 1>front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why our friendship is still </v>

3403
02:54:20.281 --> 02:54:20.281
<v Speaker 1>intact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you know more and worker,</v>

3404
02:54:20.281 --> 02:54:21.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always hard worker.</v>

3405
02:54:22.030 --> 02:54:25.390
<v Speaker 1>You respect hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times did you pull me aside and</v>

3406
02:54:25.391 --> 02:54:26.740
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking clown.</v>

3407
02:54:27.810 --> 02:54:30.700
<v Speaker 1>You're not trying to be judgemental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just know that he's pulling the wool</v>

3408
02:54:30.701 --> 02:54:35.701
<v Speaker 1>over anybody's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know who's talking to talk and </v>

3409
02:54:35.701 --> 02:54:36.930
<v Speaker 1>walking the walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see it on stage,</v>

3410
02:54:37.260 --> 02:54:42.260
<v Speaker 1>we hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only twitter or facebook hear about </v>

3411
02:54:42.260 --> 02:54:42.400
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get to that club.</v>

3412
02:54:42.430 --> 02:54:45.280
<v Speaker 1>The club owner otitis joel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe was here two weeks ago.</v>

3413
02:54:45.550 --> 02:54:48.670
<v Speaker 1>He was falling asleep on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know his shit.</v>

3414
02:54:48.690 --> 02:54:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same thing.</v>

3415
02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3416
02:54:56.141 --> 02:54:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3417
02:54:57.791 --> 02:55:02.791
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what's one of the things that </v>

3418
02:55:02.791 --> 02:55:03.980
<v Speaker 1>stand up is good for is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an</v>

3419
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:08.870
<v Speaker 4>exercise that you're doing while you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>living your life and the better stand up</v>

3420
02:55:08.871 --> 02:55:13.871
<v Speaker 4>gets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's usually a better indication that </v>

3421
02:55:13.871 --> 02:55:16.061
<v Speaker 4>you're thinking better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your life's more in order you more </v>

3422
02:55:16.061 --> 02:55:16.061
<v Speaker 4>tuned in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3423
02:55:16.061 --> 02:55:18.950
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing stuff that's hitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>harder because you've got better points,</v>

3424
02:55:18.951 --> 02:55:23.630
<v Speaker 4>you know how to edit it better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they usually that you can use that.</v>

3425
02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:24.920
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember,</v>

3426
02:55:24.921 --> 02:55:26.030
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember that moving mo.</v>

3427
02:55:26.031 --> 02:55:27.710
<v Speaker 4>Betta blues',</v>
<v Speaker 4>denzel Washington.</v>

3428
02:55:27.711 --> 02:55:32.711
<v Speaker 4>I love that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I loved about that </v>

3429
02:55:32.711 --> 02:55:34.871
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got inspired to work on my act after </v>

3430
02:55:34.871 --> 02:55:34.871
<v Speaker 4>that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3431
02:55:34.871 --> 02:55:34.871
<v Speaker 4>thinking about how much musicians </v>
<v Speaker 4>practice.</v>

3432
02:55:35.330 --> 02:55:36.070
<v Speaker 4>He was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3433
02:55:36.071 --> 02:55:37.310
<v Speaker 4>he's practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these girls,</v>

3434
02:55:37.311 --> 02:55:39.470
<v Speaker 4>these hot girls would want to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

3435
02:55:39.471 --> 02:55:40.280
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not right now.</v>

3436
02:55:40.310 --> 02:55:41.660
<v Speaker 4>I got to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to practice.</v>

3437
02:55:41.661 --> 02:55:42.380
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

3438
02:55:42.381 --> 02:55:47.381
<v Speaker 4>the discipline crazy discipline that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that man has to play that trumpet and </v>

3439
02:55:47.381 --> 02:55:47.870
<v Speaker 4>practice it over and over again.</v>

3440
02:55:48.110 --> 02:55:50.210
<v Speaker 4>And it made me really think like as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>comic,</v>

3441
02:55:50.990 --> 02:55:53.600
<v Speaker 4>we don't work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to rehearse all day,</v>

3442
02:55:53.940 --> 02:55:55.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't really rehearse at all.</v>

3443
02:55:55.460 --> 02:55:57.650
<v Speaker 4>But musicians like a really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>musician.</v>

3444
02:55:57.651 --> 02:56:02.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're always working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're always trying and training and </v>

3445
02:56:02.651 --> 02:56:04.010
<v Speaker 4>working on their craft and we do it on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage in front of people.</v>

3446
02:56:04.011 --> 02:56:09.011
<v Speaker 4>Probably more than a lot of musicians do</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless they're constantly regularly </v>

3447
02:56:09.011 --> 02:56:10.000
<v Speaker 4>touring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

3448
02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:15.160
<v Speaker 4>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have that kind of a work ethic </v>

3449
02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:18.041
<v Speaker 4>attached to what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you want to play a phenomenal </v>

3450
02:56:18.041 --> 02:56:18.041
<v Speaker 4>trumpet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those guys,</v>

3451
02:56:18.041 --> 02:56:19.910
<v Speaker 4>their breath control and the way they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can blow those horns,</v>

3452
02:56:19.911 --> 02:56:22.100
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they practice all the time.</v>

3453
02:56:22.370 --> 02:56:25.460
<v Speaker 4>They put an hours and hours working on </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3454
02:56:25.810 --> 02:56:28.430
<v Speaker 4>And I was thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a different kind of craft.</v>

3455
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:30.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a different kind of craft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3456
02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:32.450
<v Speaker 4>the ability to play a musician musical </v>
<v Speaker 4>instrument,</v>

3457
02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:36.470
<v Speaker 4>the thing about standup that becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem sometimes is that it's kind of,</v>

3458
02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:42.040
<v Speaker 4>you can kind of pull it off like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could do it really well or you can kind </v>

3459
02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:42.800
<v Speaker 4>of pull it off and to kind of pull it </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

3460
02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:47.800
<v Speaker 4>You don't need a whole lot of effort and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just need a few good subjects and a few </v>

3461
02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:51.910
<v Speaker 4>good ways of expressing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to get that where you can kind of </v>

3462
02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:56.291
<v Speaker 4>pull it off and turn it into a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just smashes a bit that you put it </v>

3463
02:56:56.291 --> 02:57:00.521
<v Speaker 4>in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't wait to get to that punchline </v>

3464
02:57:00.521 --> 02:57:00.521
<v Speaker 4>because you know it's gonna be a nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 4>bomb.</v>

3465
02:57:00.521 --> 02:57:02.900
<v Speaker 4>That's where the real work comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for a lot of us,</v>

3466
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:06.560
<v Speaker 4>it's the difference between how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy you put towards anything,</v>

3467
02:57:06.561 --> 02:57:09.320
<v Speaker 4>whether it's your standup comedy or </v>
<v Speaker 4>painting or whatever the fuck you do.</v>

3468
02:57:10.250 --> 02:57:11.540
<v Speaker 4>How much energy put towards your </v>
<v Speaker 4>writing,</v>

3469
02:57:11.570 --> 02:57:13.220
<v Speaker 4>how much energy to put towards thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

3470
02:57:13.460 --> 02:57:15.620
<v Speaker 4>The more you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the better it's going to be,</v>

3471
02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:18.560
<v Speaker 4>and that's a fundamental thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody ever tells you.</v>

3472
02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:21.500
<v Speaker 4>People tell you you should write,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not just that you should write,</v>

3473
02:57:21.830 --> 02:57:23.210
<v Speaker 4>you should also listen to your shit.</v>

3474
02:57:23.210 --> 02:57:28.210
<v Speaker 4>You should also perform,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the whole key to it all is just </v>

3475
02:57:28.210 --> 02:57:30.520
<v Speaker 4>applying different kinds of focus </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards your act and if you look at like</v>

3476
02:57:30.530 --> 02:57:32.480
<v Speaker 4>a movie like mo betta blues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's doing,</v>

3477
02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:39.010
<v Speaker 4>he's playing that fucking trumpet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize like this guy is like lost </v>

3478
02:57:39.010 --> 02:57:42.440
<v Speaker 4>in the act of practicing this beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 4>musical instrument and this is his craft</v>

3479
02:57:42.441 --> 02:57:45.470
<v Speaker 4>and he takes pride and being excellent </v>
<v Speaker 4>at his craft.</v>

3480
02:57:45.471 --> 02:57:50.471
<v Speaker 4>He could just hang around all day and </v>
<v Speaker 4>still probably blowing awesome tune at </v>

3481
02:57:50.471 --> 02:57:50.471
<v Speaker 4>night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

3482
02:57:50.471 --> 02:57:52.310
<v Speaker 4>he fucking practices and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about that going,</v>

3483
02:57:52.311 --> 02:57:54.020
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's probably something that's missing</v>

3484
02:57:54.021 --> 02:57:59.021
<v Speaker 4>from the lives of most stand ups and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>should probably try to think about that </v>

3485
02:57:59.021 --> 02:58:00.740
<v Speaker 4>more with my own life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love.</v>

3486
02:58:00.741 --> 02:58:01.710
<v Speaker 4>I love the</v>

3487
02:58:02.730 --> 02:58:06.330
<v Speaker 1>writing and I love the performing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate the listening.</v>

3488
02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard part.</v>

3489
02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is very rough for me and I </v>

3490
02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:13.240
<v Speaker 1>listened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forced myself in before the special.</v>

3491
02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I forced myself to listen a lot and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>made me to fucking over critical,</v>

3492
02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:24.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got me to over fucking critical a week </v>

3493
02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:27.801
<v Speaker 1>before I tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also went to places that I didn't put </v>

3494
02:58:27.801 --> 02:58:30.660
<v Speaker 1>my name on the gazebo just to see how my</v>
<v Speaker 1>job should do in front of regular people</v>

3495
02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:32.730
<v Speaker 1>and that fucked with my head a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

3496
02:58:32.940 --> 02:58:35.340
<v Speaker 1>A couple of little mistakes in training </v>
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>

3497
02:58:36.120 --> 02:58:38.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's a training camp before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry you.</v>

3498
02:58:39.640 --> 02:58:40.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3499
02:58:40.310 --> 02:58:42.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not been doing this for 27 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved doing it.</v>

3500
02:58:42.960 --> 02:58:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I get better every fucking year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My breathing,</v>

3501
02:58:46.590 --> 02:58:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I get something better going up on stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>or confidence levels and a talk.</v>

3502
02:58:52.730 --> 02:58:54.210
<v Speaker 1>It's 27 fucking years.</v>

3503
02:58:54.660 --> 02:58:59.660
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be doing 30 this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next month is going to be 30 fucking </v>

3504
02:59:00.451 --> 02:59:05.451
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see yourself doing this for</v>

3505
02:59:05.731 --> 02:59:10.731
<v Speaker 1>30 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still remember walking into the main </v>

3506
02:59:10.831 --> 02:59:15.831
<v Speaker 1>room and mitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in a booth and paul was onstage </v>

3507

3509
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:26.850

<v Speaker 1>guillotine.</v>

3517
02:59:51.270 --> 02:59:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know you're on your back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and looking up with the army and that's </v>

3518
02:59:56.440 --> 03:00:01.440
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel myself when I see a guy with a </v>

3519
03:00:01.440 --> 03:00:03.490
<v Speaker 1>coral belt on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3520
03:00:03.530 --> 03:00:05.400
<v Speaker 1>that's the level now that we're at.</v>

3521
03:00:05.610 --> 03:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I can control a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

3522
03:00:08.911 --> 03:00:13.911
<v Speaker 1>one of your secrets was following me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was putting yourself in bad </v>

3523
03:00:13.911 --> 03:00:18.261
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in jujitsu is like getting the </v>

3524
03:00:18.261 --> 03:00:18.261
<v Speaker 1>biggest guy in the room and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3525
03:00:18.261 --> 03:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>you busy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I tell you on the road with me?</v>

3526
03:00:21.691 --> 03:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong of me?</v>

3527
03:00:24.571 --> 03:00:29.571
<v Speaker 1>And just choked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You taking me on the road is like </v>

3528
03:00:29.571 --> 03:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>somebody going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3529
03:00:30.330 --> 03:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>come here for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you wait $300?</v>

3530
03:00:33.570 --> 03:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>I weigh 1:40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on top of me and amount.</v>

3531
03:00:37.100 --> 03:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I put one hand and we'll start there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start right there.</v>

3532
03:00:42.020 --> 03:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Start right fucking there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only if you think about it that way.</v>

3533
03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:51.200
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's important about it and </v>

3534
03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing that's important about</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling with all really funny people.</v>

3535
03:00:52.190 --> 03:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>It only becomes a negative when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think at it as a negative.</v>

3536
03:00:55.980 --> 03:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>When someone's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be laughing and enjoying it </v>

3537
03:01:00.980 --> 03:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>and it</v>

3538
03:01:00.980 --> 03:01:02.270
<v Speaker 4>makes your time more enjoyable when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>go on stage.</v>

3539
03:01:02.271 --> 03:01:07.271
<v Speaker 4>Yes it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I needed to learn that and the way I </v>

3540
03:01:07.271 --> 03:01:10.411
<v Speaker 4>learned that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the ways was going on the road </v>

3541
03:01:10.411 --> 03:01:12.301
<v Speaker 4>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew that you were going to crush and </v>

3542
03:01:12.301 --> 03:01:13.600
<v Speaker 4>so I knew that everybody else would like</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take,</v>

3543
03:01:13.780 --> 03:01:18.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were both relatively young in our </v>

3544
03:01:18.780 --> 03:01:18.780
<v Speaker 4>comedy careers back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3545
03:01:18.780 --> 03:01:22.321
<v Speaker 4>So it was like we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing comedy maybe nine years </v>

3546
03:01:22.321 --> 03:01:24.220
<v Speaker 4>or eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were a lot wiser about the game,</v>

3547
03:01:24.310 --> 03:01:29.310
<v Speaker 4>like you introduced me to shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've never even like I read a few </v>

3548
03:01:29.310 --> 03:01:30.760
<v Speaker 4>books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watched a few tapes,</v>

3549
03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:33.670
<v Speaker 4>but you had the practical knowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I needed.</v>

3550
03:01:33.730 --> 03:01:36.580
<v Speaker 4>Like you were the votech school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3551
03:01:36.581 --> 03:01:39.940
<v Speaker 4>what I did is I thought about it the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same way I thought about martial arts.</v>

3552
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:45.150
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go on the road with your all the </v>

3553
03:01:45.150 --> 03:01:45.150
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3554
03:01:45.150 --> 03:01:47.490
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get better or aspiring people </v>

3555
03:01:47.490 --> 03:01:49.141
<v Speaker 4>that suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get better when you spar with </v>

3556
03:01:49.141 --> 03:01:51.840
<v Speaker 4>wizards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta be real careful when you're </v>

3557
03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:51.840
<v Speaker 4>sparring with wizards and so it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3558
03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:56.220
<v Speaker 4>what I would need to do is have someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who goes on stage in front of me and </v>

3559
03:01:56.220 --> 03:01:59.191
<v Speaker 4>just crushes and we had some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had some Tough sets going on after </v>

3560
03:01:59.191 --> 03:02:02.731
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember one time in rascals rascals </v>

3561
03:02:02.731 --> 03:02:02.800
<v Speaker 4>and a west orange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3562
03:02:02.830 --> 03:02:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Was in west orange or east orange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>west west orange,</v>

3563
03:02:05.471 --> 03:02:07.900
<v Speaker 4>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking great club,</v>

3564
03:02:07.930 --> 03:02:12.930
<v Speaker 4>but you went up and you got into it with</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people in the audience about </v>

3565
03:02:12.930 --> 03:02:15.430
<v Speaker 4>something and you were just on fire just</v>
<v Speaker 4>on fire.</v>

3566
03:02:15.790 --> 03:02:20.790
<v Speaker 4>You crushed and I had a real hard time </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on after you and I remember </v>

3567
03:02:20.790 --> 03:02:20.790
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3568
03:02:20.790 --> 03:02:22.480
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a very important lesson.</v>

3569
03:02:22.510 --> 03:02:27.510
<v Speaker 4>Like this is important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's something that I'm not </v>

3570
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:27.510
<v Speaker 4>doing right that he is doing right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3571
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:27.510
<v Speaker 4>what am I?</v>

3572
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:28.780
<v Speaker 4>How come I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3573
03:02:28.781 --> 03:02:33.781
<v Speaker 4>I'm nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm nervous going on after him so I'm </v>

3574
03:02:33.781 --> 03:02:36.511
<v Speaker 4>not having fun up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's having fun and I'm being tense </v>

3575
03:02:36.511 --> 03:02:36.511
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh jesus,</v>

3576
03:02:36.511 --> 03:02:40.771
<v Speaker 4>it's better not suck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm putting in my head this better </v>

3577
03:02:40.771 --> 03:02:40.771
<v Speaker 4>not suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the total wrong way to approach.</v>

3578
03:02:40.771 --> 03:02:41.680
<v Speaker 4>Like if you approached a fight like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3579
03:02:42.220 --> 03:02:43.480
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get smashed.</v>

3580
03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:48.510
<v Speaker 4>Most likely you want to approach a fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about the things you're going </v>

3581
03:02:48.510 --> 03:02:51.171
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the things that you want to like </v>

3582
03:02:51.171 --> 03:02:51.280
<v Speaker 4>worry about what's going to happen if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get hit,</v>

3583
03:02:51.310 --> 03:02:56.310
<v Speaker 4>you don't think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just think about doing your thing </v>

3584
03:02:56.310 --> 03:02:58.780
<v Speaker 4>and then adjusting along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I had the wrong mindset and I needed</v>

3585
03:02:58.781 --> 03:03:01.570
<v Speaker 4>to see someone kill a bunch of times in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of me and then bomb,</v>

3586
03:03:01.571 --> 03:03:04.420
<v Speaker 4>go after them to realize something's </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong here,</v>

3587
03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:09.720
<v Speaker 4>the wrong things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going onstage tense because </v>

3588
03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:09.720
<v Speaker 4>someone was funny.</v>

3589
03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:10.630
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I should be the opposite.</v>

3590
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:14.950
<v Speaker 4>I should be happy that someone was funny</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I love comedy and this is what I</v>

3591
03:03:14.951 --> 03:03:15.910
<v Speaker 4>like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3592
03:03:15.911 --> 03:03:18.460
<v Speaker 4>I like to watch it if I'm not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so why am I so tense?</v>

3593
03:03:18.810 --> 03:03:23.810
<v Speaker 4>It was just a bad way of approaching a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem and I think this is one of the </v>

3594
03:03:23.810 --> 03:03:28.681
<v Speaker 4>things that fucks people up in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You approach a problem the same way </v>

3595
03:03:28.681 --> 03:03:32.551
<v Speaker 4>every time and you never stop and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely look at the whole thing from </v>

3596
03:03:32.551 --> 03:03:33.700
<v Speaker 4>the top down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>JusT look at the whole thing.</v>

3597
03:03:33.701 --> 03:03:34.270
<v Speaker 4>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3598
03:03:34.510 --> 03:03:39.510
<v Speaker 4>What am I trying to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get tighter and funnier </v>

3599
03:03:39.510 --> 03:03:42.601
<v Speaker 4>and better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do I gotta do I gotta do a lot of </v>

3600
03:03:42.601 --> 03:03:44.461
<v Speaker 4>sets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to write and I got to work with </v>

3601
03:03:44.461 --> 03:03:44.461
<v Speaker 4>murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the key.</v>

3602
03:03:44.461 --> 03:03:48.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like working with guys like you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of us working together and also </v>

3603
03:03:48.940 --> 03:03:49.390
<v Speaker 4>people knew if they came to see us like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3604
03:03:49.391 --> 03:03:54.391
<v Speaker 4>this isn't just going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe goes up and he's the hero of the </v>

3605
03:03:54.391 --> 03:03:57.271
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're going to get ari who's going </v>

<v Speaker 4>and murder and then I'm going to go up.</v>

3607
03:03:57.560 --> 03:03:58.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking</v>

3608
03:03:58.790 --> 03:04:00.530
<v Speaker 2>rock 'em sock.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We went on the road,</v>

3610
03:04:02.271 --> 03:04:05.270
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3611

<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did.</v>

<v Speaker 2>crazy numbers just over and over again,</v>

3614

<v Speaker 2>bonding together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of shows together,</v>

3615
03:04:18.290 --> 03:04:21.860
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how to fucking get </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything perfect.</v>

3616
03:04:21.861 --> 03:04:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Figure out the right amount of weed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke before you go on stage,</v>

3617
03:04:25.310 --> 03:04:27.590
<v Speaker 2>the right amount of getting joey diaz </v>
<v Speaker 2>riled up.</v>

3618
03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:32.950
<v Speaker 2>You would come in yelling about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something or hair or I want you to see </v>

3619

03:06:44.990 --> 03:06:49.990
<v Speaker 2>being on top of that hill at 17 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being homeless is because I had a lot of</v>

<v Speaker 1>And thinking about getting out on bail.</v>

3673
03:07:00.540 --> 03:07:03.810
<v Speaker 1>when I got out on bail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of fucking doubts my friend.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get not a bail and knowing you're going </v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking loser as it is.</v>

3676
03:07:10.740 --> 03:07:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Think of all those opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to break into a friend's house to</v>

3677
03:07:15.001 --> 03:07:20.001
<v Speaker 1>sleep in this house at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slept in a rocket ship for a month </v>

3678
03:07:20.001 --> 03:07:24.830
<v Speaker 1>outside of the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and see those rocket ships and your </v>

3679
03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:28.161
<v Speaker 1>kids play on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still remember going up to the third </v>

3680
03:07:28.161 --> 03:07:28.161
<v Speaker 1>floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rocketship finishing off my coke and</v>

3681
03:07:28.161 --> 03:07:33.111
<v Speaker 1>jerking off on the third floor at five </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning outside in the fucking </v>

3682
03:07:33.480 --> 03:07:38.480
<v Speaker 1>park with leaves around me and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a lot of times I had that one.</v>

3683
03:07:40.480 --> 03:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no fucking idea.</v>

3684
03:07:42.350 --> 03:07:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I would go up to the third floor with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle of fucking schmear silver vodka,</v>

3685
03:07:48.350 --> 03:07:50.460
<v Speaker 1>a bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hooded sweatshirt,</v>

3686
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:55.550
<v Speaker 1>gloves with a missing finger so I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking touch the rock and put them in </v>

<v Speaker 1>But when you're.</v>

3690

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking weird.</v>

3698
03:08:29.741 --> 03:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>That was in those positions for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3699
03:08:32.650 --> 03:08:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I got to look at you and go,</v>

03:08:37.530 --> 03:08:37.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3702
03:08:37.980 --> 03:08:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Tina turner'S son killed himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

3703
03:08:40.530 --> 03:08:43.100
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like son with her,</v>

3704
03:08:43.770 --> 03:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this trend of fucking people isin </v>

3705
03:08:48.770 --> 03:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scares me.</v>

3706
03:08:48.770 --> 03:08:49.630
<v Speaker 1>That concerns me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this something where we're eating?</v>

3707
03:08:49.650 --> 03:08:51.670
<v Speaker 1>This is something that we're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakened,</v>

3708
03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no drugs and bourdain system </v>

3709
03:08:57.080 --> 03:08:57.080
<v Speaker 1>so we can't blame fucking prescription</v>

3710
03:08:57.080 --> 03:09:00.690
<v Speaker 4>drugs while he was on one medication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of medication.</v>

3711
03:09:01.090 --> 03:09:04.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was something that was prescribed</v>

3712
03:09:04.501 --> 03:09:09.501
<v Speaker 4>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone told me that it was malaria </v>

3713
03:09:09.501 --> 03:09:09.501
<v Speaker 4>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3714
03:09:09.501 --> 03:09:09.501
<v Speaker 4>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they've released that,</v>

3715
03:09:09.501 --> 03:09:11.460
<v Speaker 4>but I'm sure he had to take some of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff sometimes,</v>

3716
03:09:11.461 --> 03:09:16.461
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what it was that did him </v>

3717
03:09:16.461 --> 03:09:16.461
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>According to some people,</v>

3718
03:09:16.461 --> 03:09:17.800
<v Speaker 4>he really wasn't doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3719
03:09:17.801 --> 03:09:18.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3720
03:09:18.541 --> 03:09:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3721
03:09:20.250 --> 03:09:25.250
<v Speaker 4>it's almost unnecessary to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me to get the full story.</v>

3722
03:09:25.470 --> 03:09:26.910
<v Speaker 4>I missed the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gone.</v>

3723
03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:28.150
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3724
03:09:28.200 --> 03:09:33.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when whenever someone does </v>

3725
03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:34.410
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

3726
03:09:34.411 --> 03:09:36.450
<v Speaker 4>if there's one thing that people could </v>
<v Speaker 4>point to and say,</v>

3727
03:09:36.451 --> 03:09:41.451
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a chemical that's responsible </v>

3728
03:09:41.451 --> 03:09:43.221
<v Speaker 4>for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or there's a gene problems responsible </v>

3729
03:09:43.221 --> 03:09:46.551
<v Speaker 4>for this or the like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how could someone who's loved so much </v>

3730
03:09:46.551 --> 03:09:49.800
<v Speaker 4>want to step out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that must be a terrible moment of</v>

3731
03:09:49.950 --> 03:09:51.870
<v Speaker 4>pain to want to do it.</v>
