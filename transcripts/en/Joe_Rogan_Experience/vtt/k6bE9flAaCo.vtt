<v Speaker 3>guy soccer was just this really cool guy</v>

88
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 3>who made this great product and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>about keeping your skin healthy when you</v>

89
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.210
<v Speaker 3>do Jujitsu because when you do Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 3>You're getting scratched and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling around.</v>

00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:33.931
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of abrasions all over your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body and if you don't wash with a good </v>

00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:35.880
<v Speaker 3>healthy soap,</v>

93
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 3>like ringworm and people don't tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

94
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.960
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking really annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to find out from other people </v>

95
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.231
<v Speaker 3>that do Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my friend already had a staph </v>

96
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 3>infection on his knee and his knee had </v>
<v Speaker 3>swollen up.</v>

97
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 3>We were playing pool and he's walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the pool table with this like </v>

98
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 3>weird lump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go,</v>

99
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 3>what's going on man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

100
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 3>I got a spider bite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

101
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me see it.</v>

102
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 3>So he pulls his pants up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to,</v>

103
00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.390
<v Speaker 3>that's a staph infection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought it was a spider bite because </v>

104
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.361
<v Speaker 3>it was this big pus filled red mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like he had gotten poisoned </v>

105
00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:04.361
<v Speaker 3>with something you looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like,</v>

106
00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Arizona.</v>

107
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.570
<v Speaker 3>So if I had noticed that it probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>could have got systemic and he would've </v>

108
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 3>had to been in the hospital with ivy </v>
<v Speaker 3>intravenous antibiotics.</v>

109
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really dangerous stuff.</v>

110
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.760
<v Speaker 3>What's the ringworm thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that to say no?</v>

111
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 3>It's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

112
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing as athlete's foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really the same exact fungus.</v>

113
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 3>It's just different parts of your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what ringworm is.</v>

114
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like it grows and it looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ring,</v>

115
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it starts to infect you,</v>

116
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.010
<v Speaker 3>like a big circle on your body and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you crop circles.</v>

117
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Skin.</v>

164
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 3>He's not a natural athlete,</v>

169
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:30.251
<v Speaker 3>The guys that are really strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they're getting away with a </v>

170
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:33.371
<v Speaker 3>lot of it is just through athleticism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're not quite as technical as </v>

171
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:33.371
<v Speaker 3>the guys who are like naturally not that</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>

172
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 3>It was the best guys to learn from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy wanted one of the nicest guys in </v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

178
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 3>it was an arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an arm bar.</v>

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 3>He got me in and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and luke got me on a regional not,</v>

180
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.120

181
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 4>I know my son and I could feel the </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion,</v>

182
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.710
<v Speaker 4>like the boys and their dads have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

183
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 4>like especially when boys turns like 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>19,</v>

184
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to go through this thing where</v>

185
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 4>they have to push their dad's away for </v>
<v Speaker 4>some reason.</v>

186
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:14.331
<v Speaker 4>It's part of the natural transition into</v>
<v Speaker 4>manhood and he was going,</v>

187
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:20.091
<v Speaker 4>he's going through that right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's 18 and I could tell he </v>

188
00:09:20.091 --> 00:09:20.510
<v Speaker 4>wanted to hurt me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I knew I needed to.</v>

189
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.940
<v Speaker 4>I knew I needed to just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>

190
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

191
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 4>I tapped and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't tap.</v>

192
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

193
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

194
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 4>I tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

195
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.920
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just wanted to know how he didn't </v>

196
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.651
<v Speaker 4>want you to take a moment to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would he not want you to tap if you </v>

197
00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 4>got you got you want to break your arm?</v>

198
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he wanted to break my arm,</v>

199
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 4>but that's what happens when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get the tap.</v>

200
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 4>You just want to give me a little more </v>
<v Speaker 4>pain before I tapped out.</v>

201
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking weird,</v>

202
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:47.670

<v Speaker 4>I don't know how I'd handle that.</v>

203
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:52.671
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to beat the fuck out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I might have to beat the fuck </v>

204
00:09:52.671 --> 00:09:52.671
<v Speaker 4>out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're lucky you have girls.</v>

205
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 4>Don't know how to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to choke that dude.</v>

206
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.280
<v Speaker 4>I might have to be loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to figure some shit out </v>

207
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.280
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Damn.</v>

208
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Don't want to have to go through that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some fucking young buck running around </v>

209
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.620
<v Speaker 4>your house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his chest puffed out and not listening </v>

<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

212
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 4>You got to put the hooks in some other </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

213
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.990
<v Speaker 4>I got to get through to him.</v>

214
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.050
<v Speaker 4>Just squeeze them out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to be able to consistently </v>

215
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 4>squeeze them out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's most important.</v>

216
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.430
<v Speaker 4>You can't just squeeze them out every </v>
<v Speaker 4>third time.</v>

217
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 4>You've got to be able to squeeze them </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

218
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Every time you guys fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get Eddie's Mondays and </v>

<v Speaker 4>This is what you need to do.</v>

223
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 4>All you need to do is be consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be consistent.</v>

224
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:47.750

<v Speaker 4>Get unlike lifting.</v>

226
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 4>Kettle bells were the best because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really lightweight.</v>

227
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 4>You can do it with like a 30 pound </v>

230
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 4>It's just 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 4>pound kettle bell.</v>

231
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.920

232
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:06.921
<v Speaker 4>your use your whole body and it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>forces you to use everything like </v>

233
00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 4>athletically as opposed to like like </v>
<v Speaker 4>just bench pressing,</v>

234
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 4>isolating or twice as stuff doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really enhance your ability to move </v>

235
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.621
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you have like something </v>

236
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:18.621
<v Speaker 4>that you have to control and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>balance it.</v>

237
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 4>Then you develop like a different kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a strength,</v>

238
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 4>a strength that has like stability and </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance and strength and muscle.</v>

239
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.930
<v Speaker 4>Muscle groups using muscles adjust when </v>
<v Speaker 4>things are going wrong and when you're </v>

240
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 4>getting tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that's what's really important.</v>

241
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.780
<v Speaker 4>You do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll choke the fuck out of that kid </v>

242
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:35.780
<v Speaker 4>that I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That little mother fucker shut up.</v>

243
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.280
<v Speaker 4>You got to be able to get them all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

244
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 4>It's very important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

245
00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:44.931
<v Speaker 4>You have to let him know that every time</v>
<v Speaker 4>you roll you're going to choke the fuck </v>

246
00:11:44.931 --> 00:11:44.931
<v Speaker 4>out of them.</v>

247
00:11:44.931 --> 00:11:47.360
<v Speaker 4>That's is a foregone conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are certain dudes that you can you</v>

248
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.400
<v Speaker 4>just own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I first started doing Jujitsu </v>

249
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 4>was this kid who was his purple belt who</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good and this dude owned me.</v>

250
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.640
<v Speaker 4>Every time we rolled he owned me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a foregone conclusion I was going</v>

251
00:11:59.641 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 4>to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sucked.</v>

252
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:05.701
<v Speaker 4>I was a white belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what I was doing and he </v>

253
00:12:05.701 --> 00:12:07.801
<v Speaker 4>was a really good purple belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was strong as fuck and he used to </v>

254
00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 4>like to run through me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we would like to do.</v>

255
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking squash me as quick as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could and it was like God damn.</v>

256
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 4>But there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you kept it as an order.</v>

257
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well He,</v>

258
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he left and I went to another school,</v>

259
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 4>the school that we were at close now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the important thing was I knew every</v>

260
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 4>time I rolled with that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless I got way,</v>

261
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way better,</v>

262
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 4>get way better than I was.</v>

263
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.730
<v Speaker 4>That guy was gonna fuck me up every </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

264
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:32.731
<v Speaker 4>So there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to roll with them because </v>

265
00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:32.731
<v Speaker 4>he owned me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know what I'm saying?</v>

<v Speaker 4>The only shit that I can't that would </v>

291
00:13:48.691 --> 00:13:50.311

292
00:13:50.311 --> 00:13:50.680
<v Speaker 4>coyotes to kill cats and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could kill a coyote.</v>

293
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've had cats.</v>

294
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 4>I've had my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

295
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.410
<v Speaker 4>my dog had killed by mountain lion in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Colorado.</v>

296
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.540
<v Speaker 4>What are we going hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you have time?</v>

297
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:03.541
<v Speaker 4>We're going to figure it out right after</v>
<v Speaker 4>my book was supposed to be done with my </v>

298
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:06.031
<v Speaker 4>book by October 15th because November </v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll be cooler and we can hunt deer,</v>

299
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can hunt deer pig.</v>

300
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the way deer taste.</v>

301
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.930
<v Speaker 4>I want to do it because I've been a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mediator my entire life and I've taken </v>

302
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 4>no responsibility for my desire to </v>
<v Speaker 4>consume me.</v>

303
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:22.480
<v Speaker 4>I have not felt any remorse from pulling</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trigger and seeing an animal die.</v>

304
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:27.510
<v Speaker 4>I haven't made a connection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real connection between what you're </v>

305
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:27.910
<v Speaker 4>doing when you're eating meat and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think as a person who thinks,</v>

306
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.390
<v Speaker 4>I think that's actually probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>important to try out an important,</v>

307
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting gathering was our past with some</v>

308
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 4>men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially hunting,</v>

309
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:41.521
<v Speaker 4>gathering and like the further we get </v>
<v Speaker 4>away from that and that vibe of hunting </v>

310
00:14:41.521 --> 00:14:45.100
<v Speaker 4>and gathering and providing and testing </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves like that.</v>

311
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.370
<v Speaker 4>I think the more out of touch we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming with who we are leading a </v>

312
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:50.370
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that is.</v>

313
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 4>I think the world and technology</v>

314
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.340
<v Speaker 3>have evolved faster than people and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think there's certain reward systems </v>

315
00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.030
<v Speaker 3>that are set up in the human mind to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ensure that we're going to continue to </v>

316
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.351
<v Speaker 3>do certain things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to continue to want to fuck </v>

317
00:15:05.351 --> 00:15:08.110
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to tend to continue to want </v>

318
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.110
<v Speaker 3>to hunt like you get like a response </v>
<v Speaker 3>from hunting.</v>

319
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I know I do from fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been hunting,</v>

320
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:14.681
<v Speaker 3>but I've been fishing and there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>primal thing about pulling a big fish </v>

321
00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 3>out of the water that knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to eat this thing,</v>

322
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 3>like you just went out into the wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>another world,</v>

323
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:21.880
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Floating around on the fucking ocean and</v>

324
00:15:21.881 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 3>you pulled something out of that world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now you're going to eat it.</v>

325
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 3>It's going to give you life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a little.</v>

326
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 3>There's energy that's attached to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you feel good about it.</v>

327
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

328
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.240
<v Speaker 3>if the truth is of hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gathering,</v>

329
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 3>societies had succeeded.</v>

330
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 3>They haven't succeeded because they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced by mass farm production </v>

331
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 3>societies plus changed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We changed everything was the ability to</v>

332
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:47.321
<v Speaker 3>stay in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have like this sort of a nomadic </v>

333
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:50.680
<v Speaker 3>genetic connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy who lives in Alaska and </v>

334
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.220
<v Speaker 3>they chronicled him on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see VBS DOT TV?</v>

335
00:15:52.221 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 3>You ever go to that website?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

336

<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

337
00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.250
<v Speaker 3>There's a series called the vice squad </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the vice guide and they,</v>

338
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.410
<v Speaker 3>they do all kinds of weird shit like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to Africa and they go all over the </v>

339
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.380
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea,</v>

340
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.030
<v Speaker 3>but the one of the really coolest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to this guy who lives by himself</v>

341
00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:16.031
<v Speaker 3>and his wife in a cabin out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of nowhere in Alaska.</v>

342
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean he lives around bears and all he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does all day is hunt and bring food </v>

343

<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he does for vegetables</v>

346
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.990
<v Speaker 3>cause he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

347
00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:28.040
<v Speaker 3>it's frozen up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>

348
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.230
<v Speaker 3>he's eating fucking Pine Collins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he's eating.</v>

349
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know he gets some supplies </v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped to him.</v>

350
00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:39.420
<v Speaker 3>He never saw nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hasn't even seen a photo of off the </v>

351
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:39.420
<v Speaker 3>grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are guides.</v>

352
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.210
<v Speaker 3>They're holding off the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's guys,</v>

353
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:43.540
<v Speaker 3>they're doing that out there and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

354
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.610
<v Speaker 3>but he's like so off the grid and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>says he's extremely happy and he,</v>

355
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.130
<v Speaker 3>and he's very articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not like a crazy guy.</v>

356
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:57.270
<v Speaker 3>He's a very articulate guy who's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this for a long time and he says </v>

357
00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 3>that as man gets further away from his </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>

358
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.510
<v Speaker 3>like this hunter gatherer nature you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

359
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.860
<v Speaker 3>you like lose your connection with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>

360
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:08.861
<v Speaker 3>your lose your happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he thought that that's the reason </v>

361
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:08.861
<v Speaker 3>why people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

362
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.430
<v Speaker 3>like so many people are depressed and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people hate what they do.</v>

363
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Hunter and hunter and gathering like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

364
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:15.830
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a visceral response,</v>

365
00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 3>like your genes get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

366
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it clears your mind.</v>

367
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:23.891
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're out trying to provide food </v>

368
00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:23.891
<v Speaker 3>for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your family,</v>

369
00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:25.050
<v Speaker 3>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if that's all you're focused on,</v>

370
00:17:25.051 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 3>then this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this other stuff and doesn't sort of</v>

371
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:29.440
<v Speaker 3>add up anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

372
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.430
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't really matter.</v>

373
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.670
<v Speaker 3>And so hunting gathering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really where we came from,</v>

374
00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:36.500
<v Speaker 3>but we're a dying breed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>

375
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:41.501
<v Speaker 3>gathering people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that that's one of the </v>

376
00:17:41.501 --> 00:17:41.501
<v Speaker 3>reasons why suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really does make sense,</v>

377
00:17:41.501 --> 00:17:46.091
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that's one of the reasons why </v>

378
00:17:46.091 --> 00:17:47.321
<v Speaker 3>people in society are so depressed is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we are living a life like </v>

379
00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 3>technology and society has gotten far </v>
<v Speaker 3>past</v>

380
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.960
<v Speaker 4>where our genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our genetics still require some acts for</v>

381
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:56.420
<v Speaker 4>us to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

382
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.450
<v Speaker 4>they have like there's a set in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

383
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:03.470
<v Speaker 4>a reward system in place for doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things like sex feels good so that you </v>

384
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.251
<v Speaker 4>make babies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Food feels good so that you keep eating </v>

385
00:18:07.251 --> 00:18:09.791
<v Speaker 4>and your survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these reward systems are set up and </v>

386
00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 4>if you take a few of them out without </v>
<v Speaker 4>correcting the body,</v>

387
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:16.570
<v Speaker 4>like you're going to have like these </v>
<v Speaker 4>holes are going to have these problems </v>

388
00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.930
<v Speaker 4>yet these voids over there and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>filled with other things that are </v>

389
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.651
<v Speaker 4>probably not nearly as healthy or good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a fascinating idea though that </v>

390
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.900
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really is like you're looking at </v>

391
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:29.900
<v Speaker 4>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're looking at it,</v>

392
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 4>you can tune back into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>

393
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.400
<v Speaker 4>if you look at like the way it's set up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's set up to make sure that we do </v>

394
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.930
<v Speaker 4>certain things and if you take these </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain things away,</v>

395
00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the body gets fucked up.</v>

396
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Like it gets like W,</v>
<v Speaker 4>W we,</v>

397
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.290
<v Speaker 4>there's things were missing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people who don't have sex.</v>

398
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 4>I've always said this like it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter how religious you are,</v>

399
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:54.381
<v Speaker 4>if you're not having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have sexual organs and you're not </v>

400
00:18:54.381 --> 00:18:57.501
<v Speaker 4>using like do not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to experience any </v>

401
00:18:57.501 --> 00:18:57.501
<v Speaker 4>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't wanna,</v>

402
00:18:57.501 --> 00:18:59.530
<v Speaker 4>you don't wanna exchange love with </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody like that.</v>

403
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.160
<v Speaker 4>You're going to break even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not good.</v>

404
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.590
<v Speaker 4>That's not good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

405
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.360
<v Speaker 4>Sex is good because it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>grow.</v>

406
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.400
<v Speaker 4>The natural food is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's all these reward systems </v>

407
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 4>that are set up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

408
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:16.161
<v Speaker 4>it's really fascinating that so few of </v>
<v Speaker 4>us are tuned into the hunter gatherer </v>

409
00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:17.540
<v Speaker 4>thing that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>

410
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean I grew up hunting like breathing </v>
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>

411
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:25.090
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's just part of my life and </v>

412
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:25.090
<v Speaker 4>I bow hunt and I hunt with shotguns.</v>

413
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 4>I hunt with a rifle as I hunt with blow </v>
<v Speaker 4>guns and spear guns.</v>

414
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.510
<v Speaker 4>I just hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just have to.</v>

415
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the,</v>

416
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.980
<v Speaker 4>one of the Dranamo I think was the great</v>
<v Speaker 4>Indian warrior when he was finally </v>

417
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.520
<v Speaker 4>caught and put on the reservation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said to him,</v>

418
00:19:38.521 --> 00:19:40.040
<v Speaker 4>so no drama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

419
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.960
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no more hunting for you.</v>

420
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

421
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.730
<v Speaker 4>we will hunt mice because we hunters and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to hunt and,</v>

422
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.710
<v Speaker 4>and that's just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in your blood that needs a hobby.</v>

423
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.860
<v Speaker 4>That shit's ridiculous in mice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about you play chess on,</v>

424
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 4>settled down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to go hunt mice.</v>

425
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.400
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leave the fucking mice alone,</v>

426
00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:02.670
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

427
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.840
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily always the kilo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the pursuit of something.</v>

428
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.870
<v Speaker 4>So do you feel like when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

429
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.630
<v Speaker 4>when you kill something and then get to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat it,</v>

430
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:13.790
<v Speaker 4>do you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does,</v>

431
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:19.010
<v Speaker 4>is it triggers some sort of like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>primitive reward system that you feel </v>

432
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.860
<v Speaker 4>you feel it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

433
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:25.250
<v Speaker 4>funny enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually don't like to eat a lot of </v>

434
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.220
<v Speaker 4>what I kill blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>

435
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:26.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

436
00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:28.170
<v Speaker 4>We had this conversation and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

437
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:29.400
<v Speaker 4>beef,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's what's for dinner.</v>

438
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:34.730
<v Speaker 4>I like beef,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but none of my meat that I've ever </v>

439
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.980
<v Speaker 4>killed goes to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always give like my,</v>

440
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.200
<v Speaker 4>like I don't particularly like deer or </v>
<v Speaker 4>venison meat because it's so lean,</v>

441
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like fat.</v>

442
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:41.790
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like um,</v>

443
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:43.770
<v Speaker 4>Ribeye steaks that are just full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>marbling.</v>

444
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 4>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I hunt,</v>

445
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean I do clean the meat and take care</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it and I was doing it to somebody,</v>

446
00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 4>a friend or family or somebody that </v>
<v Speaker 4>needs it.</v>

447
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

448
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.560
<v Speaker 4>it's really the pursuit and the capture </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the game that I get the,</v>

449
00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 4>the reward from the actual taking a bite</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it really.</v>

450
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

451
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:05.960
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

452
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 4>I get that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think,</v>

453
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.660
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something in deer meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something in deer and </v>

454
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.930
<v Speaker 4>elk and this hear me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This sounds totally crazy,</v>

455
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.020
<v Speaker 4>but I think the things that are hard to </v>
<v Speaker 4>catch or better for you,</v>

456
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that if you've got a cow that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just hanging around being a fat fuck and</v>

457
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:22.060
<v Speaker 4>you walk right up to him and shoot him </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the head,</v>

458
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't see how that's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean immediately it is good.</v>

459
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:28.030
<v Speaker 4>It tastes delicious and everything and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat steak like anybody,</v>

460
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:33.031
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's better to eat deer </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're hard to catch when it </v>

461
00:21:33.031 --> 00:21:33.031
<v Speaker 4>flees.</v>

462
00:21:33.031 --> 00:21:34.050
<v Speaker 4>Be Really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

463
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you want to kill fleas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All data for the same reasoning.</v>

464
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

465
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.220
<v Speaker 4>because you're not eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not animals that are praying you</v>

466
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.840
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could squash them.</v>

467
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I've ever seen a brian.</v>

468
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.030
<v Speaker 4>There's a thing called free split free </v>
<v Speaker 4>spray fleas.</v>

469
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.910
<v Speaker 4>You could fucking kill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Billions of them was a stroke of a hand.</v>

470
00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 4>When you're ready to go hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me know.</v>

<v Speaker 4>another podcast when we get back.</v>

474
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:06.940

476
00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:13.420
<v Speaker 4>no one is shooting any of these deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're so relaxed.</v>

477
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 4>They're just standing there big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>10 point bucks just standing on the side</v>

478
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:19.990
<v Speaker 4>of the road looking at you and I stopped</v>
<v Speaker 4>the car and I'm like,</v>

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.130
<v Speaker 4>I rolled down the window and I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>to Diego.</v>

485
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.240
<v Speaker 4>When we went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we looked at some property in evergreen </v>

486
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:36.240
<v Speaker 4>because I was convinced that that was my</v>
<v Speaker 4>move.</v>

487
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 4>I needed to move to the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was my.</v>

488
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get you in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

489
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 4>let's not talk about that on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>internet or a fucking psycho stalkers or</v>

490
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:48.960
<v Speaker 4>listening to pay going Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's.</v>

491
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.520
<v Speaker 4>Anyway Evergreen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

492
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.650
<v Speaker 4>when we were looking at property in </v>
<v Speaker 4>evergreen,</v>

493
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.190
<v Speaker 4>there's a herd of elk that wandered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had photos.</v>

494
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.280
<v Speaker 4>They wandered down a certain path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They walked through the fucking main </v>

495
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.881
<v Speaker 4>street in town every year and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like hundreds of them in their fucking </v>

496
00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:10.441
<v Speaker 4>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how bad ass is that like you're </v>

497
00:23:10.441 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 4>standing there and as you're standing </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

498
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.690
<v Speaker 4>a herd of elk just walked through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking town.</v>

499
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.580
<v Speaker 4>It's still not natural though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean really.</v>

500
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean where I hunt elk and deer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

501
00:23:17.621 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just wild.</v>

502
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Speaker 4>So it's not natural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not natural for not having fear,</v>

503
00:23:22.721 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

504
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:24.630
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not natural.</v>

505
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:25.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

506
00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:30.541
<v Speaker 4>Well the problem is somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this town was built on a path that they </v>

507
00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:31.510
<v Speaker 4>always take the migration thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

508
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.700
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess maybe there's also.</v>

509
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.030
<v Speaker 4>There's more fear of mountain lions than</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are people,</v>

510
00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:38.110
<v Speaker 4>so they figure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

511
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.730
<v Speaker 4>at least we're around these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>assholes.</v>

512
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.850
<v Speaker 4>One of us is getting shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not all going to get picked apart </v>

513
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.641
<v Speaker 4>by a fucking flock of mountain lions </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that with mountain lions packs </v>

514
00:23:47.641 --> 00:23:47.641
<v Speaker 4>packs</v>

515
00:23:47.641 --> 00:23:48.290
<v Speaker 3>even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They travel solo anyway.</v>

516
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.110
<v Speaker 3>No pack wouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they'd be like,</v>

517
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:52.550
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're spider.</v>

518
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 3>They found in the Amazon you ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a spider.</v>

519
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 3>They found the Amazon that attacks in </v>
<v Speaker 3>packs as the only spider in the world.</v>

520
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 3>They attacked thousands of them at once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they make these gigantic nests.</v>

521
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spiderwebs were like,</v>

522
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.520
<v Speaker 3>like a deer could get stuck and when to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill much larger things.</v>

523
00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:12.390
<v Speaker 3>They kill rats and all kinds of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

524
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 3>It's the Amazon did the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazon is.</v>

525
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:19.350
<v Speaker 3>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a BBC documentary about the </v>

526
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a two part series that I watched once.</v>

527
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I still have it on vhs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't find it on DVD.</v>

528
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking phenomenal.</v>

529
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 3>They go into the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

530
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:27.850
<v Speaker 3>and that's where they show these </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiders.</v>

531
00:24:27.851 --> 00:24:32.851
<v Speaker 3>Like there's shit that's evolving in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazon right now with the Amazon was is </v>

532
00:24:32.851 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 3>it used to be like fields and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>became a rainforest overnight.</v>

533
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Not overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really quickly.</v>

534
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:42.310
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of animals get stuck inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>this rain forest and they evolved like </v>

535
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 3>there's an antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it swims,</v>

536
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:49.630
<v Speaker 3>it's got little short legs and it swims </v>
<v Speaker 3>like up to 100 yards underwater and it </v>

537
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.801
<v Speaker 3>eats fish and it's a fucking antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy how to do that because it </v>

538
00:24:53.801 --> 00:24:55.070
<v Speaker 3>gets stuck there and the water and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to figure out another way to eat.</v>

539
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 3>There's a fish that fucking climbs out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the water,</v>

540
00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 3>walks till it finds the next pond and </v>
<v Speaker 3>jumps in.</v>

541
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.800
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty sick too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like so much crazy shit there.</v>

542
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.960
<v Speaker 3>It's all these animals that are adapting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this,</v>

543
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucked up.</v>

544
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Changing the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bad Ass.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But the spider.</v>

547
00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found one spider.</v>

548
00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:18.560
<v Speaker 3>They've never thought spiders did this </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

549
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:23.590
<v Speaker 3>but they found this one spider that acts</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a pack that's sick killer nor </v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rattlesnake was all the time.</v>

576
00:26:23.101 --> 00:26:25.470
<v Speaker 4>Rattle snakes all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have rattlesnake fencing.</v>

577
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.090
<v Speaker 4>You know my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my two pit bulls,</v>

578
00:26:27.091 --> 00:26:29.820
<v Speaker 4>both of them had gotten bitten by </v>
<v Speaker 4>rattlesnakes when I had them.</v>

579
00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.940
<v Speaker 4>Fucking rattle snakes are dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

580
00:26:32.941 --> 00:26:33.990
<v Speaker 4>They're all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

581
00:26:33.991 --> 00:26:38.991
<v Speaker 4>When I lived in Calabasas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always found snakes all around the </v>

582
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:41.931
<v Speaker 4>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like eaten by other animals like </v>

583
00:26:41.931 --> 00:26:44.210
<v Speaker 4>coyotes and step on one accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta be real careful when you're </v>

584
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.210
<v Speaker 4>hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We running.</v>

585
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:48.561
<v Speaker 4>I went running with the dogs and we run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's this hill that we run this dirt </v>

586
00:26:48.561 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 4>road and when we were running down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hill I was like,</v>

587
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we are running over this log</v>

588
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.160
<v Speaker 2>and as I'm running over the log,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking snake.</v>

589
00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I realized as my feet were running over </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

590
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.200
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

591
00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.440
<v Speaker 2>he's a rattle snake is fat as my arms </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant.</v>

592
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.260
<v Speaker 2>The biggest rattlesnake I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

593
00:27:09.261 --> 00:27:12.230
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was sat dude.</v>

594
00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:14.210
<v Speaker 2>It was fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a pitch.</v>

595
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.450
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that thing got you into like feel the</v>

596
00:27:17.451 --> 00:27:22.451
<v Speaker 2>hot lava,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking venom going into your </v>

597
00:27:22.451 --> 00:27:25.061
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream immediately that Colt out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia that actually holds snakes and </v>

598
00:27:25.641 --> 00:27:27.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of their religion.</v>

599
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.630
<v Speaker 2>If they don't get bit by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rattlesnake,</v>

600
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.220
<v Speaker 2>then that means they're like pure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

601
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:37.130
<v Speaker 2>So there was this preacher guy who's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison right now because he wanted to </v>

602
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.781
<v Speaker 2>kill his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he stuffed her mailbox full of </v>

603
00:27:40.781 --> 00:27:44.260
<v Speaker 2>rattlesnakes and she opened it up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>put her hand in and got bit in the jail </v>

604
00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.580
<v Speaker 2>for attempted murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

605
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.610
<v Speaker 2>that's some fire and brimstone type </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

606
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.560
<v Speaker 2>That's type of shit like a preacher </v>
<v Speaker 2>would think.</v>

607
00:27:51.561 --> 00:27:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Uncle Barry finch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking snakes.</v>

608
00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.930
<v Speaker 2>Tom Story and Shit and a ride he killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>down by putting a moon.</v>

609
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:08.200
<v Speaker 2>She reached out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angela Lansbury somehow</v>

610
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.550
<v Speaker 4>involved with this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just something primal about doing that.</v>

611
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Getting some evil animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do your dirty work.</v>

612
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Sentence somebody up that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like,</v>

613
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.230
<v Speaker 4>that's like way cooler than just </v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting somebody.</v>

614
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.040
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said fucking rattlesnake Jackson.</v>

615
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:28.730
<v Speaker 4>When people eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always fucking husband and his </v>

616
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.730
<v Speaker 4>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

617
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.760
<v Speaker 4>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to know about the </v>

618
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:31.760
<v Speaker 4>percentage of people that kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves or kill each other.</v>

619
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.501
<v Speaker 4>Rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What percentage are husband and wife or </v>

620
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.770
<v Speaker 4>the husband kills the wife or the wife </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed a husband?</v>

621
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.520
<v Speaker 4>Is it more than I like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the percentage as far as like </v>

622
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.251
<v Speaker 4>people getting killed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how many of them are husband and </v>

623
00:28:49.251 --> 00:28:49.251
<v Speaker 4>wife?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of them are just,</v>

624
00:28:49.251 --> 00:28:49.830
<v Speaker 4>here's the guy that works at the post </v>
<v Speaker 4>office that I was fucking pissed me off,</v>

625
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 4>so I shot him and how many of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>husband and wives I don't understand.</v>

626
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it would be as much as you</v>

627
00:28:56.841 --> 00:28:58.340
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think domestic violence would be huge.</v>

628
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 2>We've seen it goes all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

629
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.370
<v Speaker 4>think we've all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've all seen for couples that are just</v>

630
00:29:03.371 --> 00:29:05.540
<v Speaker 4>fucking violent to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

631
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's scary.</v>

632
00:29:07.061 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That must be so scary for a cop.</v>

633
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.720
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They always say that those are the most </v>

634
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:15.720
<v Speaker 4>dangerous calls to take domestic </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence cases.</v>

635
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.750
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you watched the show cops,</v>

636
00:29:16.751 --> 00:29:18.140
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem like it's that big of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal to.</v>

637
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.530
<v Speaker 4>That was abused by his ex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't go into details,</v>

638
00:29:23.531 --> 00:29:27.130
<v Speaker 4>but she came out with a knife she met </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a few times.</v>

639
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.130
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't fucking her correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No chip.</v>

640
00:29:30.131 --> 00:29:31.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking has ever come at me with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>knife.</v>

641
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.430
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to keep them in check.</v>

642
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:38.640
<v Speaker 4>Have you got to have control?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do not get involved in any sort of </v>

643
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.030
<v Speaker 4>relationship where you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not the man.</v>

644
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 4>If you're actually a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get involved in</v>

645
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 2>a relationship where you're not the man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you feel like,</v>

646
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:47.310
<v Speaker 2>well somehow with her I don't feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the man and just.</v>

647
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get Out,</v>

648
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 2>get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting your souls getting stolen</v>

649
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:54.600
<v Speaker 2>from you in the night while you sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't realize everybody's Alpha.</v>

650
00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.370
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's don't.</v>

651
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Then whatever the role is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure it's a harmonious one.</v>

652
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:08.180
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let someone all of a sudden be </v>

653
00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:08.180
<v Speaker 2>like the dominant one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You figure you're not dominant anymore.</v>

654
00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Like men who get in situations like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>where their wife gets the yelling and </v>

655
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.110
<v Speaker 2>the fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the husbands always going,</v>

656
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.440
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

657
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:14.640
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

658
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.520
<v Speaker 2>That's not your name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not healthy there.</v>

659
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.000
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a girl out there somewhere.</v>

660
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.570
<v Speaker 2>It's probably nice and if they found </v>
<v Speaker 2>that girl instead of the one they went,</v>

661
00:30:25.571 --> 00:30:30.571
<v Speaker 2>they found some chick who just likes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the positive side of things and </v>

662
00:30:30.571 --> 00:30:33.691
<v Speaker 2>she likes going to cool movies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating and fun places and she doesn't </v>

663
00:30:33.691 --> 00:30:33.691
<v Speaker 2>require a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

664
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.660
<v Speaker 2>that goes out there.</v>

665
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably dead inside for that.</v>

666
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 2>That was very good qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:42.270
<v Speaker 2>that's why she's given up on life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like up.</v>

668
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:48.090
<v Speaker 2>She's enjoying things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is when a chick isn't </v>

669
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:48.090
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's given up on.</v>

670
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sit down and watch like a dead.</v>

671
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think that any chick that's like,</v>

672
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:57.160
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really.</v>

673
00:30:57.161 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really think this out and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing something on the table there.</v>

674
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were committed to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

675
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not committed to this argument.</v>

676
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Rick doesn't even know what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

677
00:31:09.391 --> 00:31:12.230
<v Speaker 2>I kind of went over my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took.</v>

678
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Rick showed up to his very first UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

679
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.330
<v Speaker 2>I was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>

680
00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:21.331
<v Speaker 2>But the balance with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be inside where you guys </v>

681
00:31:21.331 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like on the outside and I was like</v>

682
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:22.890
<v Speaker 2>too far.</v>

683
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I was looking up and I didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great view when you guys were on the </v>

684
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.650
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a floor seats are not my favorite.</v>

685
00:31:28.651 --> 00:31:32.470
<v Speaker 2>It float my affairs one or two up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

686
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:37.471
<v Speaker 2>I think the first risers risers the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>spot because you're still close enough </v>

687
00:31:37.471 --> 00:31:37.990
<v Speaker 2>to see the action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

688
00:31:37.991 --> 00:31:39.100
<v Speaker 2>but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

689
00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not looking up.</v>

690
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Plus when they go to the ground on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side of the cage,</v>

691
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.280
<v Speaker 2>if you're on the HD,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I bought all the time on paper.</v>

692
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.750
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get like the close ups.</v>

693
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I hear the sounds more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was more in the fight commentary here.</v>

694
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hear any commentary.</v>

695
00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:01.230
<v Speaker 2>You can get these little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these little radio things and </v>

696
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.300
<v Speaker 2>you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sell them a UFC fight link,</v>

697
00:32:01.301 --> 00:32:06.301
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you listened to it and you get to </v>

698
00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:06.301
<v Speaker 2>listen to the commentary.</v>

699
00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:06.301
<v Speaker 2>They broadcast it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike a wireless signal,</v>

700
00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 2>like a radio station on iphone APP for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

701
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.790
<v Speaker 2>They should totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Dana gunders shit son.</v>

704

<v Speaker 2>It was cool though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

705
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.710
<v Speaker 2>We use a huge UFC fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wrote a movie about it.</v>

706
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.050
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

707
00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean Rick Schroeder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chuck,</v>

708
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Norris Talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

709
00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:25.950
<v Speaker 2>it's like 15 years ago Chuck Norris </v>
<v Speaker 2>hugged me.</v>

710
00:32:25.951 --> 00:32:28.570
<v Speaker 2>He's the greatest moment of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

711
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.390
<v Speaker 2>did he try to start some MMA league?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

712
00:32:31.391 --> 00:32:32.860
<v Speaker 2>he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a kickboxing league,</v>

713
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the world combat </v>
<v Speaker 2>league.</v>

714
00:32:35.381 --> 00:32:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if that's the right name.</v>

715
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize from because I'm a huge</v>

716
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.160
<v Speaker 3>chuck Norris Fan and when he tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get me in on that way back in the </v>

717
00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.450
<v Speaker 3>beginning like let's build a team in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what he was doing.</v>

718
00:32:47.451 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 3>He was doing kickboxing teams and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to do that with the IFL.</v>

719
00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 3>IFL is the international fight league </v>
<v Speaker 3>and had some really good fighters,</v>

720
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 3>but they tried to do that team thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

721
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:56.540
<v Speaker 3>They had tried to have them fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>teams.</v>

722
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:59.390
<v Speaker 3>The only thing would be fun is if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all at once.</v>

723
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:00.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.540
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

725
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>

726
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:03.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say it's not the right way to go,</v>

727
00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:08.861
<v Speaker 3>but at least it's something different </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are talking about it like it </v>

728
00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:08.861
<v Speaker 3>makes for a subject of debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like this?</v>

729
00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:09.730
<v Speaker 3>You're not like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

730
00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 3>it makes it a little novel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

731
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:13.370
<v Speaker 3>it's not the way to do it.</v>

732
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Teams aren't the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

733
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:15.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

734
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when all those things were coming around</v>

735
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:22.601
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing an individual sport </v>

736
00:33:22.601 --> 00:33:22.940
<v Speaker 3>team?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what they're doing is they're just</v>

737
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 3>trying to get in on some unique way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

738
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Speaker 3>like everybody else is doing it this </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

739
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:32.741
<v Speaker 3>So we're gonna have teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Denver douchebags and the fucking </v>

740
00:33:32.741 --> 00:33:33.010
<v Speaker 3>the Montreal monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

741
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.560
<v Speaker 3>folding chairs and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it seemed very roller derby.</v>

742
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say that you went pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling on the same wavelength there.</v>

743
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:46.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

744
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

745
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.040
<v Speaker 3>The only way to do is just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just have to stop trying to dress it up.</v>

746
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do like some strikeforce rules.</v>

747
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Strikeforce has put rules in when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have elbows.</v>

748
00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people like elbows.</v>

749
00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Fuck elbows cut people up man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know you should just protect </v>

750
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:04.100
<v Speaker 3>yourself from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

751
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:09.101
<v Speaker 3>and elbows can stop fights too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very dangerous weapons but I </v>

752
00:34:09.101 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 3>kinda like strikeforce held,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just use punches.</v>

753
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:11.060
<v Speaker 3>They don't elbow each other on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

754
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.370
<v Speaker 3>I think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it make,</v>

755
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:18.610
<v Speaker 3>it might make fighters' careers longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people like it though and it's a </v>

756
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.451
<v Speaker 3>very effective technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they need some sort of a pat on </v>

757
00:34:22.451 --> 00:34:22.490
<v Speaker 3>the elbow if that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

758
00:34:22.491 --> 00:34:27.491
<v Speaker 3>that might not be a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't cut it because it's such a </v>

759
00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:30.461
<v Speaker 3>short movement when you're on top of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gun and shoot your fucking short </v>

760
00:34:30.461 --> 00:34:33.590
<v Speaker 3>distance to stop and so much power you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can generate and it's just bone on bone.</v>

761
00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Just smashing your fucking face and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a.</v>

762
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:38.210
<v Speaker 3>that's a God damn dangerous technique </v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

763
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Make it happen.</v>

764
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Like a sound like a dog toy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time they do it,</v>

765
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:46.181
<v Speaker 3>it's like a squishy toys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't think there's any.</v>

766
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with elbows.</v>

767
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:51.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>

768
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't take them out either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I looked at the strikeforce rule and</v>

769
00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:56.810
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's the way to go.</v>

770
00:34:56.811 --> 00:34:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I'll look at it and go,</v>

771
00:34:58.491 --> 00:34:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's around.</v>

772
00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.220
<v Speaker 3>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I do like,</v>

773
00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I like that there's a comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can look at the strike force,</v>

774
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.000
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what happens with them.</v>

775
00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:07.130
<v Speaker 3>With the punches on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we've already done that with pride.</v>

776
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.280
<v Speaker 3>The old pride days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to be able to do whatever they</v>

777
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:10.850
<v Speaker 3>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

778
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:12.680
<v Speaker 3>they could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soccer kick dudes while their heads were</v>

779
00:35:12.681 --> 00:35:17.681
<v Speaker 3>on the ground and stomp on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't think they allowed headbutts </v>

780
00:35:17.681 --> 00:35:19.100
<v Speaker 3>and they don't think they allow growing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing kicks.</v>

781
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the allowed fish hooking </v>

782
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:24.100
<v Speaker 3>or any of this stuff that's always </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>

783
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.940
<v Speaker 3>They didn't allow it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they added the stomps and the soccer</v>

784
00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:30.941
<v Speaker 3>kicks and the knees to the head to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>downed opponent and it's all really </v>

785
00:35:30.941 --> 00:35:31.280
<v Speaker 3>fucking violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous shit.</v>

786
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 3>You know when you see a guy get soccer </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked in the head,</v>

787
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:34.520
<v Speaker 3>that's when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

788
00:35:34.521 --> 00:35:36.170
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like shit,</v>

789
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not fucking playing around.</v>

790
00:35:39.091 --> 00:35:44.091
<v Speaker 3>This is a real fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy just soccer kicked that </v>

791
00:35:44.091 --> 00:35:45.690
<v Speaker 3>guy in the face when he's down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the best thing to have an MMA,</v>

792
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:47.820
<v Speaker 3>but pocket adds this crazy element to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

793
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:50.580
<v Speaker 3>You know when a guy goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other guys trying to stomp them,</v>

794
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.710
<v Speaker 3>like literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

795
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Vandelay silva knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was tomorrow.</v>

796
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't Tamora.</v>

797
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot who it was.</v>

798
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Yuki Kondo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

799
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:03.981
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knocked him out and then he started </v>

800
00:36:03.981 --> 00:36:04.230
<v Speaker 3>stomping his fucking head while he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

801
00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.200
<v Speaker 3>but then early UFC is like biting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

802
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it wasn't usually condo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should.</v>

803
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 3>I should find out exactly who it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>with vandelay do that before I said it,</v>

804
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:16.521
<v Speaker 3>but whoever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was holding onto the ropes with one </v>

805
00:36:16.521 --> 00:36:17.610
<v Speaker 3>hand than kicking the guy in the face </v>
<v Speaker 3>stomping on his head while he was down.</v>

806
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:19.710
<v Speaker 3>It was so violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

807
00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:21.630
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

808
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Took it to another level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the rep's fault though.</v>

809
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:25.680
<v Speaker 3>For now it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal.</v>

810
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.370
<v Speaker 3>In Japan it's legal will pan and pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was legal.</v>

811
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I think you can still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you can definitely still kick or </v>

812
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:34.710
<v Speaker 3>nea down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Deponent,</v>

813
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:39.770
<v Speaker 3>I think you could soccer kick him still </v>
<v Speaker 3>to and you can stomp them still to I </v>

814
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.770
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

815
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:40.350
<v Speaker 3>I think dream the way they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's.</v>

816
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:45.380
<v Speaker 3>There's different organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things that the UFC has </v>

817
00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:45.380
<v Speaker 3>always been pushing for is a unified </v>
<v Speaker 3>system of rules.</v>

818
00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.941
<v Speaker 3>So the rules we use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody uses so that we all practice </v>

819
00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:50.850
<v Speaker 3>the same sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes complete sense.</v>

820
00:36:50.851 --> 00:36:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Totally complete sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally the right way to go.</v>

821
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:57.390
<v Speaker 3>But Japan was either fuck don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>five minute,</v>

822
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.280
<v Speaker 3>10 minute round and they have crazy shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>with her coming in and they'll take your</v>

823
00:37:02.281 --> 00:37:04.020
<v Speaker 3>money away if they don't think you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting hard enough.</v>

824
00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah Dude,</v>

825
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 3>they get crazy laws over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like say if a and sometimes man dudes</v>

826
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:12.240
<v Speaker 3>are just taking a fucking breather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's a war,</v>

827
00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they neutralize each other.</v>

828
00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:15.840
<v Speaker 3>They can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody can get anything done.</v>

829
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.130
<v Speaker 3>And I go stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

830
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 3>And they pull out a yellow card.</v>

831
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.960
<v Speaker 3>And what a yellow card is is they take </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 percent of your fucking purse.</v>

832
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 3>So if you're getting paid 100 grand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just lost $10,000</v>

833
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.790
<v Speaker 3>because some fucking douchebag referee </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided you needed a yellow card because</v>

834
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:34.791
<v Speaker 3>you're not fighting hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least it's just that in Japan a </v>

835
00:37:34.791 --> 00:37:37.311
<v Speaker 3>yellow card can mean a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be get the use and the women </v>

836
00:37:37.311 --> 00:37:40.920
<v Speaker 3>that cut your finger off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could mean that's a p card.</v>

837
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:45.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the craziest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Yakuza where they chopped his </v>

838
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.950
<v Speaker 3>fingers off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck up.</v>

839
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.550
<v Speaker 3>You do something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to cut your finger off.</v>

840
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.400
<v Speaker 3>That's your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your punishment.</v>

841
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

842
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.910
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the pumps because you hear</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the Saudis trying to paralyze some</v>

843
00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:55.680
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they go through with it?</v>

844
00:37:55.681 --> 00:38:00.681
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they've gone through </v>

845
00:38:00.681 --> 00:38:01.941
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know they're inquiring on whether or </v>

846
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:01.941
<v Speaker 3>not it can be done.</v>

847
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:01.941
<v Speaker 3>One hospital said they wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

848
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:02.100
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>

849
00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.060
<v Speaker 3>A guy hit a guy with a shovel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when he hit him with,</v>

850
00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:10.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know any details,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he assaulted this guy in some way and </v>

851
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.740
<v Speaker 3>and paralyzed him and under Islamic law </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

852
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:16.760
<v Speaker 3>I foreign high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They literally want to impose the exact </v>

853
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.030
<v Speaker 3>same injury to this guy and do it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital.</v>

854
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.970
<v Speaker 3>One hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't paralyze somebody.</v>

855
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Like we can't just do that in another </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital said it was possible,</v>

856
00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:26.100
<v Speaker 3>but they did not have the conditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>

857
00:38:26.101 --> 00:38:27.810
<v Speaker 3>They would have to go to a much larger </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital,</v>

858
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:32.960
<v Speaker 3>so they probably went to some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>goat and donkey infested the hospital </v>

859
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.450
<v Speaker 3>with chickens running through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bobby.</v>

860
00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:38.740
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you be willing to paralyze </v>

861
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:38.740
<v Speaker 3>someone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

862
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.730
<v Speaker 3>well maybe we can do it here though.</v>

863
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.720
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy in south central,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll do it for $100.</v>

864
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Would you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys agree with that though?</v>

865
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:46.060
<v Speaker 3>Eye for an eye judgments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

866
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:47.950
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's just a certain amount of</v>

867
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 3>cruelty to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessary.</v>

868
00:38:49.931 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 3>I think if you want to show people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's wrong,</v>

869
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.760
<v Speaker 3>killed a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

870
00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I say death penalty is a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I mean?</v>

871
00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.780
<v Speaker 3>You have to know the circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

872
00:38:58.781 --> 00:39:03.781
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the other guy is a dickhead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the other guy threw a rock first </v>

873
00:39:03.781 --> 00:39:03.781
<v Speaker 3>and then he hit him with a shovel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>paralyzed him.</v>

874
00:39:03.781 --> 00:39:08.340
<v Speaker 3>We don't have enough information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that guy was fucking tormenting </v>

875
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:08.340
<v Speaker 3>him and he wouldn't leave his kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>alone.</v>

876
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.880
<v Speaker 3>It was an asshole kicked his dog and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

877
00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:14.881
<v Speaker 3>it was building up over 10 fucking years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and finally homeboy had enough and he </v>

878
00:39:14.881 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 3>just did what he supposed to have done a</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago.</v>

879
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 3>Crack that motherfucker over the head </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a shovel.</v>

880
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:22.740
<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately his little faggot ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to go and get paralyzed and now my </v>

881
00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.280
<v Speaker 3>mans in the pokey and they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about paralyzing him too.</v>

882
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile all he was dealing with just </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to hold his ground,</v>

883
00:39:28.121 --> 00:39:30.190
<v Speaker 3>just trying to get by in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

884
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.450
<v Speaker 3>just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should have the three strike rule.</v>

885
00:39:32.451 --> 00:39:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Like the first time you do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

886
00:39:33.941 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 3>really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cut it.</v>

887
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.360
<v Speaker 3>They take away your hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the second time they take away your</v>

888
00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:39.640
<v Speaker 3>eyesight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Third time to chop off your tongue.</v>

889
00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might've just invented that.</v>

890
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:43.860
<v Speaker 3>And there's people in Iran right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

891
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before the ideas,</v>

892
00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:54.050
<v Speaker 1>get that back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up solutions.</v>

893
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.170
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cheaper.</v>

894
00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Codeine goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a car account.</v>

895
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:02.490

<v Speaker 3>I don't know what action we were there </v>

897
00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:07.760
<v Speaker 3>at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went Japanese and we started off.</v>

898
00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.940
<v Speaker 3>We have the worst fake Iranian accent </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

899
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm an insult to any impersonator out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

915
00:40:44.121 --> 00:40:44.121
<v Speaker 3>it's like to have children until you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have children and you know,</v>

916
00:40:44.121 --> 00:40:46.500

<v Speaker 3>I thought was really interesting.</v>

917
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.330
<v Speaker 3>He said just let it change you.</v>

918
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.690
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had already like kind of let it change</v>

919
00:40:51.691 --> 00:40:52.950
<v Speaker 3>me before I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

920
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:54.780
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like the best way to describe it.</v>

921
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.520
<v Speaker 3>Let it change you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

922
00:40:56.521 --> 00:40:57.820
<v Speaker 3>And when you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

923
00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.850
<v Speaker 3>That really is what happens like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

924
00:40:59.851 --> 00:41:01.560
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

925
00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.400
<v Speaker 3>the immediately when I started doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at people as babies.</v>

926
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I looked at everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to just see a guy who's 30 and I </v>

927
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:10.760
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

928
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:10.760
<v Speaker 3>here's a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Buddy,</v>

929
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.730
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

930
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:12.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal.</v>

931
00:41:12.481 --> 00:41:17.481
<v Speaker 3>But now you said like the inner child it</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I didn't see the inner child to see </v>

932
00:41:17.481 --> 00:41:20.931
<v Speaker 3>how he developed to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have much more compassion for </v>

933
00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:20.931
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

934
00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:21.510
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to.</v>

935
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:26.600
<v Speaker 3>I try to keep as much compassion as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible while still avoiding Douche </v>

936
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.420
<v Speaker 3>bags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my ethic.</v>

937
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.610
<v Speaker 3>But there's a certain point in time </v>
<v Speaker 3>where sometimes you have to go,</v>

938
00:41:29.611 --> 00:41:30.810
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up.</v>

939
00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 3>Please leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you were a baby once.</v>

940
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:39.790
<v Speaker 4>No one point in time you were an </v>
<v Speaker 4>innocent little child and somebody </v>

941
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 4>fucked your programming up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand this.</v>

942
00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 4>You got to let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got shit.</v>

943
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:44.110
<v Speaker 4>I gotta do you know it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

944
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.320
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

945
00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:47.570
<v Speaker 4>you have changed at time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think everybody does.</v>

946
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:49.700
<v Speaker 4>If you don't change when you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were full,</v>

947
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.880
<v Speaker 4>you'd be crazy to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The worst thing in the world that you </v>

948
00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 4>could ever feel is that you didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>your best when you were raising a kid.</v>

949
00:41:56.150 --> 00:42:01.150
<v Speaker 4>That's got to be the worst thing because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think your childhood was fucking </v>

950
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.970
<v Speaker 4>completely bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

951
00:42:01.971 --> 00:42:06.971
<v Speaker 4>my childhood was bizarre on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't bizarre in front of the </v>

952
00:42:06.971 --> 00:42:08.190
<v Speaker 4>whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

953
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 4>And you became a fucking superstar when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were a little kid.</v>

954
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.110
<v Speaker 4>You're 40 now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

955
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.270
<v Speaker 4>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

956
00:42:14.271 --> 00:42:17.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm 43.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I saw the champ,</v>

957
00:42:17.241 --> 00:42:18.320
<v Speaker 4>I think I was seven.</v>

958
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.480
<v Speaker 4>What were you like for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

959
00:42:19.481 --> 00:42:20.660
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was seven.</v>

960
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 4>So you were 10 and the champ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

961
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.460
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

962
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my time rotten.</v>

963
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 4>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either way,</v>

964
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.550
<v Speaker 4>whatever I was seven or 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was fucking crying like a baby.</v>

965
00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:35.600
<v Speaker 4>And you were even younger than me then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I was a little kid,</v>

966
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.540
<v Speaker 4>when I was like going through life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out,</v>

967
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:39.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what my parents were breaking,</v>

968
00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try and figure out like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

969
00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:46.481
<v Speaker 4>what is life all about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were fucking famous in front of the </v>

970
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I couldn't imagine that point in my</v>

971
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:54.281
<v Speaker 4>life being famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That must've been so strange to develop </v>

972
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.450
<v Speaker 4>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you're so normal.</v>

973
00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing that's I think </v>

974
00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:02.740
<v Speaker 4>interesting about like growing up famous</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I became famous when I was </v>

975
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't have any memory of life </v>

976
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 4>before fame.</v>

977
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:10.120
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when that happens and you're forming </v>

978
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 4>and you're getting programmed and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting created as a child,</v>

979
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it becomes normal for you.</v>

980
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:19.630
<v Speaker 4>And so I don't have any frame of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reference like I wasn't 30 and all of a </v>

981
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:23.540
<v Speaker 4>sudden Bam became famous and I had 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years of history of normal life.</v>

982
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:28.040
<v Speaker 4>So fame is normal for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because it's normal,</v>

983
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:33.190
<v Speaker 4>that means kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not special because what's normal </v>

984
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.680
<v Speaker 4>is normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

985
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:39.340
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think at different unique thing about </v>

986
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:39.340
<v Speaker 4>being a child actor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I wasn't.</v>

987
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I started bag barrymore last night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to never heard anybody put it </v>

988
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:43.930
<v Speaker 4>that way before I went to her premier </v>
<v Speaker 4>last night and she,</v>

989
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.360
<v Speaker 4>she's kind of done the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>her new movie and uh,</v>

990
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.720
<v Speaker 4>gave her a big hug and kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen her in 20 years.</v>

991
00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.400
<v Speaker 4>Do you grab her ass and not just cheat </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl though?</v>

992
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.580
<v Speaker 4>Get rid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get rid of a case.</v>

993
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 4>I've known her since I felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt good.</v>

994
00:43:57.621 --> 00:44:00.800
<v Speaker 4>She was eight as drew barrymore dance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Tom Green.</v>

995
00:44:00.801 --> 00:44:02.720
<v Speaker 4>That God that you could get that poor </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

996
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.500
<v Speaker 4>She picks the weirdest guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

997
00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:07.900
<v Speaker 4>I love Tom Green.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He doesn't show like Canadian far more </v>

1000
00:44:13.871 --> 00:44:13.871
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

00:44:13.871 --> 00:44:13.871
<v Speaker 4>he's Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can trust him.</v>

1002
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:19.100
<v Speaker 4>I trust him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the good news to see the </v>

1003
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.390
<v Speaker 4>show where he took animals into his </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents house at a zoo.</v>

1004
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.980
<v Speaker 4>He fucked a moose on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>

1005
00:44:21.981 --> 00:44:23.050
<v Speaker 4>He's a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>His.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a,</v>

1009
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.360
<v Speaker 4>like a show that he's been doing out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his house.</v>

1010
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.970
<v Speaker 4>He turned his living room into a studio </v>
<v Speaker 4>where</v>

1011
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.480
<v Speaker 2>he like broadcast a live talk show from </v>
<v Speaker 2>his living room and it's super popular.</v>

1012
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:37.980
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

1013
00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 2>You get to see him changing and trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

1014
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.600
<v Speaker 2>When I got to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was into the secret who's like,</v>

1015
00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like head of a copy of it right </v>

1016
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1017
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if he was telling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

1018
00:44:49.651 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seemed like almost it was like,</v>

1019
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:54.880
<v Speaker 2>it was like it was trolling you was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking around pretending to be into the</v>

1020
00:44:54.881 --> 00:44:57.140
<v Speaker 2>secret thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1021
00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:02.240
<v Speaker 2>so drew the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a few of us that have gone </v>

1022
00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:02.510
<v Speaker 2>through that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not many very,</v>

1023
00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:07.590
<v Speaker 2>very few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could count on a hand the percentage </v>

1024
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.800
<v Speaker 2>of people who go through that and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay Lohan or like,</v>

1025
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.170
<v Speaker 2>it's like 95.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1026
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:15.570
<v Speaker 2>More more than it's gotta be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think was the difference </v>

1027
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.740
<v Speaker 2>with you or what's the difference?</v>

1028
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:21.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit the partying thing when I was </v>

1029
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:24.290
<v Speaker 2>young and I didn't continue it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think some people do and you </v>

1030
00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my few wildly years between 16 and</v>

1031
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.060
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1032

<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really kiss on the lips.</v>

1185
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:09.240
<v Speaker 2>but I think it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might have been some inappropriate stuff</v>

1186
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:12.350
<v Speaker 2>if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some hand jobs and I was like,</v>

1187
00:52:12.351 --> 00:52:15.830
<v Speaker 2>don't go over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1188
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I heard so many rumors about Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson and why he's,</v>

1189
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:19.970
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1190
00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:22.880
<v Speaker 2>why he was the way he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you were actually there.</v>

1191
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.120
<v Speaker 2>What was he like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wanted to.</v>

1192
00:52:26.121 --> 00:52:26.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll funds that,</v>

1193
00:52:26.921 --> 00:52:29.360
<v Speaker 2>went to the universal amphitheater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to see him play,</v>

1194
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:32.780
<v Speaker 2>and we went into his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was Billie Jean Times.</v>

1195
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the time.</v>

1196
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.410
<v Speaker 2>So she of complaint it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thrillers,</v>

1197
00:52:36.411 --> 00:52:39.230
<v Speaker 2>planet starting the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1198
00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:41.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're hanging out in his trailer and um,</v>

1199
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hanging out really nice quiet,</v>

1200
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 2>shy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like 16,</v>

1201
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:47.000
<v Speaker 2>17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1202
00:52:47.001 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's you,</v>

1203
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:51.540
<v Speaker 2>how did you make it from a kid actor to </v>
<v Speaker 2>an adult like this,</v>

1204
00:52:51.541 --> 00:52:52.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you survive?</v>

1205
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Because I was kind of in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>transitioning from a kid to an adult.</v>

1206
00:52:56.391 --> 00:53:01.391
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what the trick was being </v>

1207
00:53:01.391 --> 00:53:03.970
<v Speaker 2>inspired ricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had to be inspired to keep it </v>

1208
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had to find stuff that I wanted to</v>

1209
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:07.010
<v Speaker 2>work on and wanting to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1210
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of took that advice to heart,</v>

1211
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:10.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1212
00:53:10.461 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 2>nothing ever inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he started kissing her nipples.</v>

1213
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Nothing inappropriate happened with me </v>
<v Speaker 2>or that I know of.</v>

1214
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.070
<v Speaker 2>He's such an odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was such an odd guy,</v>

1215
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.410
<v Speaker 2>just even the way his voice was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was very strange.</v>

1216
00:53:22.411 --> 00:53:23.740
<v Speaker 2>It that's a man's voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1217
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 2>it's such an odd character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1218
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.880
<v Speaker 4>but never been a guy who was so much to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get out.</v>

1219
00:53:29.881 --> 00:53:34.881
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked about it last week and the </v>

1220
00:53:34.881 --> 00:53:36.291
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how crazy it was watching them </v>

1221
00:53:36.291 --> 00:53:38.121
<v Speaker 4>dance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like nobody ever did anything like </v>

1222
00:53:38.121 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 4>that before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even though this Elvis did,</v>

1223
00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 4>but he did in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

1224
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 4>he had a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a weird thing of Sammy Davis.</v>

1225
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:45.690
<v Speaker 4>He took some from Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim Brown,</v>

1226
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 4>James Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>James Brown.</v>

1227
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:52.011
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would watch that on the podcast a </v>

1228
00:53:52.011 --> 00:53:52.011
<v Speaker 4>couple weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The opening and Zaire.</v>

1229
00:53:52.011 --> 00:53:53.930
<v Speaker 4>James Brown was like manly the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>James.</v>

1230
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:58.940
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was more like a Michael Jackson did </v>

1231
00:53:58.981 --> 00:54:01.020
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more like gliding,</v>

1232
00:54:01.021 --> 00:54:06.021
<v Speaker 4>almost like alien type character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's moving around in perfect </v>

1233
00:54:06.021 --> 00:54:06.240
<v Speaker 4>synchronicity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the more of a,</v>

1234
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.880
<v Speaker 4>more of a perfection to Michael </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jackson's movements.</v>

1235
00:54:08.881 --> 00:54:13.881
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like James Brown was more of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like raw sexuality that had the jet </v>

1236
00:54:13.881 --> 00:54:15.050
<v Speaker 4>Michael Jackson Jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember it?</v>

1237
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Totally generic one though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can enter my family couldn't afford </v>

1238
00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:23.571
<v Speaker 4>the real ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got the generic one at this store </v>

1239
00:54:23.571 --> 00:54:23.571
<v Speaker 4>called Gold Circle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked exactly the same,</v>

1240
00:54:23.571 --> 00:54:27.621
<v Speaker 4>but there was some kind of tag the real </v>
<v Speaker 4>one had and immediately everyone's like </v>

1241
00:54:27.621 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 4>fake people had fake things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fake members only.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like something else or a flux.</v>

1243
00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Lizards have never crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird thing with kids,</v>

1244
00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:38.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1245
00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.360

<v Speaker 4>general and it's going to end.</v>

1263
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's going to end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm telling you.</v>

1264
00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:33.591
<v Speaker 4>This has been around since I was in high</v>
<v Speaker 4>school and it was one of those things </v>

1265
00:55:33.591 --> 00:55:33.591
<v Speaker 4>where I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1266
00:55:33.591 --> 00:55:35.820
<v Speaker 4>this is bell bottom jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking wearing a visor.</v>

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:37.470
<v Speaker 4>This shit is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go away.</v>

1268
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.040
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was back like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it was still.</v>

1271
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:51.940
<v Speaker 4>It came from prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing comes from when you go </v>

1272
00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:55.071
<v Speaker 4>to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they take away your belt so you can't </v>

1273
00:55:55.071 --> 00:55:55.071
<v Speaker 4>choke yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Death.</v>

1274
00:55:55.071 --> 00:55:55.920
<v Speaker 4>We don't have a weapon either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your pants are sagging off and you're</v>

1275
00:55:55.921 --> 00:56:00.921
<v Speaker 4>losing weight because you're not eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>as much as you were when you first got </v>

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:43.210
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could write your own thing that's</v>

1376
01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.720
<v Speaker 4>really good about a guy who was in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>

1377
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:46.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you could come up with some sort of</v>

1378
01:00:46.551 --> 01:00:47.960
<v Speaker 4>a show as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1379
01:00:47.961 --> 01:00:48.830
<v Speaker 4>it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1380
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:49.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1381
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:49.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1382
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.810
<v Speaker 4>but you got to adapt and morph and </v>
<v Speaker 4>change and grow with the times.</v>

1383
01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:58.811
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what happens to a lot of child </v>

1384
01:00:58.811 --> 01:00:58.811
<v Speaker 4>actresses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they kind of don't.</v>

1385
01:00:58.811 --> 01:00:58.811
<v Speaker 4>They also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1386
01:00:58.811 --> 01:01:03.610
<v Speaker 4>they're used to being treated a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>way and getting certain big paydays and </v>

1387
01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:07.300
<v Speaker 4>certain big checks and when they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's time to humble yourself and </v>

1388
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.280
<v Speaker 4>sort of start working again for less or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1389
01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.660
<v Speaker 4>start doing things that you may not </v>
<v Speaker 4>really like,</v>

1390
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:12.980
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their egos are too big,</v>

1391
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:18.430
<v Speaker 4>so you got to stay humble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the one of the biggest </v>

1392
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:19.450
<v Speaker 4>heart and Aaron Aaron Gray helps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't see Aaron Graves.</v>

1393
01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.700
<v Speaker 4>How hard is it useful?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it to stay humble?</v>

1394
01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 4>That is the most hard thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1395
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:28.910
<v Speaker 4>It's the most confusing thing is when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that you're just a normal </v>

1396
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:32.621
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody treats you like you're </v>

1397
01:01:32.621 --> 01:01:32.930
<v Speaker 4>special because you're a star,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you're on a set,</v>

1398
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.960
<v Speaker 4>if you're on a set like a sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so easy to lose your head because </v>

1399
01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.681
<v Speaker 4>everyone's kissing your ass and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>network people are all walking on </v>

1400
01:01:41.681 --> 01:01:41.681
<v Speaker 4>eggshells around you.</v>

1401
01:01:41.681 --> 01:01:43.100
<v Speaker 4>They want to be really friendly with you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody wants to be nice to you.</v>

1402
01:01:43.101 --> 01:01:45.890
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's got a big smile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The show's doing well.</v>

1403
01:01:45.891 --> 01:01:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's got a big smile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone kisses your ass.</v>

1404
01:01:47.991 --> 01:01:52.991
<v Speaker 4>It's like you live in some weird and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you had an accountant and you got </v>

1405
01:01:52.991 --> 01:01:52.991
<v Speaker 4>an a lawyer that kisses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're asking a publicist,</v>

1406
01:01:52.991 --> 01:01:57.581
<v Speaker 4>the kisses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your asset manager and all these people </v>

1407
01:01:57.581 --> 01:01:57.581
<v Speaker 4>that you're employing that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>kissing your ass.</v>

1408
01:01:57.581 --> 01:01:59.900
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's important just to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>real people.</v>

1409
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to pull off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For some people,</v>

1410
01:02:02.541 --> 01:02:07.250
<v Speaker 4>it's very hard to get yourself out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that spiral of confusion,</v>

1411
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.510
<v Speaker 4>your identity confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1412
01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:09.380
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck am I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>hollywood.</v>

1414
01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:12.260
<v Speaker 4>That was important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the most.</v>

1415
01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:16.160
<v Speaker 4>My friends are always just guys that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were farmers or ranchers or hunters,</v>

1416
01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:19.500

<v Speaker 4>I'm schroeder and I'm for somebody.</v>

1568
01:08:43.391 --> 01:08:43.580
<v Speaker 3>without coming into contact with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>years ago with incredible hulk on it </v>

1726
01:14:59.371 --> 01:14:59.371

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adderall is supposed to be really </v>

1729
01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:08.491
<v Speaker 3>powerful shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert told me he took it accidentally </v>

<v Speaker 3>once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extra say.</v>

1731
01:15:08.491 --> 01:15:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really a fan of that.</v>

1732
01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:11.200
<v Speaker 3>I've never tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've learned a lot.</v>

1733
01:15:11.201 --> 01:15:16.201
<v Speaker 3>When I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually I had a very powerful positive </v>

1734
01:15:16.201 --> 01:15:16.201
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned a lot from it,</v>

1735
01:15:16.201 --> 01:15:20.910
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not like the way me and my brain </v>

1736
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.910
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next day.</v>

1737
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:23.690
<v Speaker 3>My brain was very dull and it felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the way I described it,</v>

1738
01:15:23.691 --> 01:15:26.740
<v Speaker 3>it felt like a sponge where like most of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water had been wrung out of it.</v>

1739
01:15:26.741 --> 01:15:29.400
<v Speaker 3>It just wasn't working right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't make five.</v>

1740
01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Mike couldn't make connections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1741
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:31.570
<v Speaker 3>I was in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1742
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:37.110
<v Speaker 3>like a starbucks and I was reading a </v>
<v Speaker 3>magazine the next day I was reading a </v>

1743
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.480
<v Speaker 3>boxing magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't read the magazine.</v>

1744
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:38.200
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't read it.</v>

1745
01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.620
<v Speaker 3>It was a story I wanted to hear about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1746
01:15:39.621 --> 01:15:40.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always,</v>

1747
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:45.570
<v Speaker 3>always been a boxing fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading this matchup and I couldn't </v>

1748
01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:48.631
<v Speaker 3>read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't put the words together and I </v>

1749
01:15:48.631 --> 01:15:48.631
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1750
01:15:48.631 --> 01:15:48.631
<v Speaker 3>I can't read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1751
01:15:48.631 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever I did laSt night to have this,</v>

1752
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:51.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking loving,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's cool.</v>

1754
01:15:54.041 --> 01:15:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Let's all be friends in this beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>

1755
01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 3>enlightening experience the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you paying for that shit for it.</v>

1756
01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:01.990
<v Speaker 3>I paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1757
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:03.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I paid once.</v>

1758
01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:05.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm not paying again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's some shit that doesn't do</v>

1759
01:16:05.171 --> 01:16:06.450
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that as a positive.</v>

1760
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.480
<v Speaker 3>It was a positive experience for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized like you realize when you do </v>

1761
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.940
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of what is possible.</v>

1762
01:16:12.941 --> 01:16:17.941
<v Speaker 3>If everybody dropped the bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize like how beautiful life </v>

1763
01:16:17.941 --> 01:16:19.930
<v Speaker 3>would be if everybody was like super </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly and happy to see each other.</v>

1764
01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Like it would be way more fun and way </v>
<v Speaker 3>more enjoyable than it is right now.</v>

1765
01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1766
01:16:25.391 --> 01:16:30.391
<v Speaker 3>you realize that you can do your part to</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinda like make it lean in that </v>

1767
01:16:30.391 --> 01:16:33.631
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think in that way it was very </v>

1768
01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:33.631
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think those,</v>

1769
01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:35.710
<v Speaker 3>the elevated levels of brain hormones </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you give yourself,</v>

1770
01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:37.980
<v Speaker 3>when you take that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a deficit like you,</v>

1771
01:16:37.981 --> 01:16:42.981
<v Speaker 3>you go up so then it crashes and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any left and then your </v>

1772
01:16:42.981 --> 01:16:42.981
<v Speaker 3>brain is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1773
01:16:42.981 --> 01:16:45.190
<v Speaker 3>shitty and fucked up until it </v>
<v Speaker 3>replenishes everything on its own.</v>

1774
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:48.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that'S smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should fuck with that.</v>

1775
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:50.500
<v Speaker 3>There's other stuff that doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1776
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared to take terms again.</v>

1777
01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:58.651
<v Speaker 3>I want to so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the last time I ship for like six </v>

1778
01:16:58.651 --> 01:16:58.990
<v Speaker 3>hours straight on shrooms and it was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most craziest,</v>

1779
01:16:59.110 --> 01:17:00.120
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse,</v>

1780
01:17:00.121 --> 01:17:01.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out in the bathroom,</v>

1781
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:02.250
<v Speaker 3>shitty shit.</v>

1782
01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:07.970
<v Speaker 3>ANd sometimes they make you shit because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're eating mushrooms are </v>

1783
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:07.970
<v Speaker 3>getting poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poisoned,</v>

1784
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:09.620
<v Speaker 3>but they do have bacteria on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>

1785
01:17:09.621 --> 01:17:11.670
<v Speaker 3>They do have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them have fungus on them.</v>

1786
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:14.940
<v Speaker 3>They have to throw it up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not diarrhea.</v>

1787
01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:17.860
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people throw up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people's repeat,</v>

1788
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.940
<v Speaker 3>some people throw up and that's when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>really kicks in.</v>

1789
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Just really kind of strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were shitting on trips or anything?</v>

1790
01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.020
<v Speaker 3>I remember looking at the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember looking at the ground,</v>

1791
01:17:25.021 --> 01:17:26.270
<v Speaker 3>it was what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a checkered pattern.</v>

1792
01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:27.950
<v Speaker 3>I remember the checkers are goiNg up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

1793
01:17:27.951 --> 01:17:29.990
<v Speaker 3>kinD of like texts tetris or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1794
01:17:29.991 --> 01:17:34.991
<v Speaker 3>Like I saw like the heartbeat in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>floor and it was while I'm shitting my </v>

1795
01:17:34.991 --> 01:17:35.000
<v Speaker 3>brains out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1796
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.210
<v Speaker 3>the crazy thing about the mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences individuals,</v>

1797
01:17:38.211 --> 01:17:40.700
<v Speaker 3>the crazy thing is that the feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get,</v>

1798
01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:44.150
<v Speaker 3>lIke you kind of get it now and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just fleeting feeling.</v>

1799
01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:46.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like while you're on the mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 3>you like,</v>

1800
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:48.170
<v Speaker 3>you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all seems to make sense.</v>

1801
01:17:48.171 --> 01:17:51.180
<v Speaker 3>It all seems to fall into place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a failure.</v>

1802
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>familiar with.</v>

1803
01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:57.420
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like this in an enhanced level </v>

1804
01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:00.670
<v Speaker 3>of understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all the bullshit that's going </v>

1805
01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:00.670
<v Speaker 3>on in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the insecurities,</v>

1806
01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:05.621
<v Speaker 3>all the false assumptions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the things that are just like </v>

1807
01:18:05.621 --> 01:18:07.751
<v Speaker 3>tripping up the Way you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all get pushed to the side and the </v>

1808
01:18:07.751 --> 01:18:08.000
<v Speaker 3>lights all get turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1809
01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:10.430
<v Speaker 3>That's what my experiences have been on </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>

1810
01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:12.110
<v Speaker 3>but no paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1811
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:16.520
<v Speaker 3>my son had it all the time and every six</v>
<v Speaker 3>times maybe machines are annoyed.</v>

1812
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Any anxiety and fucking bad trips and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitting myself.</v>

1813
01:18:20.091 --> 01:18:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1814
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:23.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it's when you try to control it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very humbling.</v>

1815
01:18:23.391 --> 01:18:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I think that it's just too </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong or too,</v>

1816
01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.860
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different molds and stuff,</v>

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.281
<v Speaker 3>climax where the cia owned a brothel in </v>
<v Speaker 3>san francisco and in New York and they </v>

1829
01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:02.890
<v Speaker 3>got these guys are going to get laid and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dosed them up with acid and ran </v>

1830
01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:04.010
<v Speaker 3>tests on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how the cia.</v>

1831
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we make that into a movie on here?</v>

1832
01:19:09.321 --> 01:19:11.690
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentleman?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the beginning.</v>

1833
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.900
<v Speaker 3>What research do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A rookie joey productions.</v>

1834
01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Really real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true with operation midnight </v>

1835
01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:20.040
<v Speaker 3>climax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the freedom of information act.</v>

1836
01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.590
<v Speaker 3>They released these documents via </v>
<v Speaker 3>random.</v>

1837
01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>

1838
01:19:23.610 --> 01:19:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Real shit is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1839
01:19:25.071 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But someone needs to do a documentary on</v>

1840
01:19:27.351 --> 01:19:30.170
<v Speaker 3>acid because people don't realize it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was squashed out.</v>

1841
01:19:30.171 --> 01:19:33.800
<v Speaker 3>They threw so much water on the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't and all died out so quickly.</v>

1842
01:19:33.801 --> 01:19:36.890
<v Speaker 3>We'd all don't realize people live today</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2010.</v>

1843
01:19:36.891 --> 01:19:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't impact acid had on the culture </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the 19 sixties.</v>

1844
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean people really were convinced that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all one.</v>

1845
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:45.740
<v Speaker 3>The flower movement of san francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flower power movement.</v>

1846
01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.140
<v Speaker 3>Those people were all on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about disney,</v>

1847
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:49.700
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1848
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.370
<v Speaker 3>What about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about disney did that stuff?</v>

1849
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:55.250
<v Speaker 3>All lot of people have done acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he probably did it.</v>

1850
01:19:55.251 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck do you come with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouse?</v>

1851
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Unless you do an acid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible.</v>

1852
01:19:59.120 --> 01:19:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1853
01:19:59.751 --> 01:20:04.751
<v Speaker 3>it might not have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think a lot of people did it </v>

1854
01:20:04.751 --> 01:20:04.751
<v Speaker 3>because there was so many people doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1855
01:20:04.751 --> 01:20:07.961
<v Speaker 3>So many people reporting all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive experiences on it that all </v>

1856
01:20:07.961 --> 01:20:07.961
<v Speaker 3>these rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful people,</v>

1857
01:20:07.961 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 3>anyone</v>

1858
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.700
<v Speaker 4>in a position that would get in contact </v>
<v Speaker 4>with these people that are doing it,</v>

1859
01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 4>these artists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would want to try it.</v>

1860
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:17.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kEn keasy and timothy leary and all </v>

<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1864
01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:23.610
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all wanted other people to do it </v>

1865
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:23.760
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms and acid and mushrooms.</v>

1866

<v Speaker 4>It exists actually in um,</v>

1869

1870
01:20:32.731 --> 01:20:36.000

<v Speaker 4>Woodrow I think has it in it or it has a</v>

1871
01:20:36.001 --> 01:20:38.820
<v Speaker 4>similar compound in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's another one in morning glory</v>

1872
01:20:38.821 --> 01:20:43.821
<v Speaker 4>seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Morning glory seeds has like a natural </v>

<v Speaker 4>trip your fucking balls off.</v>

1877
01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:58.350
<v Speaker 4>Terence mckenna said that his first </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experience was morning glory</v>

1878
01:20:58.351 --> 01:21:03.351
<v Speaker 4>seeds and then he had all this aztec </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagery like he was looking at like </v>

<v Speaker 4>actually going to buy one just to </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment with.</v>

01:21:23.361 --> 01:21:24.810
<v Speaker 4>They say what you have to do.</v>

1893
01:21:30.170 --> 01:21:33.610
<v Speaker 4>What I heard is that you have to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>make you rub them on glass and then </v>

1894
01:21:33.610 --> 01:21:36.450
<v Speaker 4>their excretions or on the glass and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you drive excretions in the sun and</v>

1895
01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:37.660
<v Speaker 4>then you scrape it off and smoke it.</v>

1896
01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:38.750
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you guys would play?</v>

1897
01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.380
<v Speaker 4>Something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't actually do it.</v>

1898
01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1899
01:21:41.071 --> 01:21:46.071

<v Speaker 4>I talked to the breeder and he was just </v>

<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have a new batch soon.</v>

01:21:46.071 --> 01:21:47.100
<v Speaker 4>I was going to buy like three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then I was like,</v>

01:21:47.101 --> 01:21:48.270
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so stoned.</v>

1903
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Locked frogs to trip the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That five meo experience is a five.</v>

1904
01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Meo is still legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the weird things.</v>

1905
01:21:57.421 --> 01:22:00.060
<v Speaker 4>When I first did five mil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we ordered it online.</v>

1906
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:02.420

<v Speaker 4>one of the most potent,</v>

1907
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:05.340
<v Speaker 4>more potent than regular dmt psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's way more powerful than mushrooms.</v>

1910
01:22:11.971 --> 01:22:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Way more powerful than pot and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>order it online.</v>

1911
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:19.390
<v Speaker 4>If a candy flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where they take ecstasy and put </v>

1912
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.390
<v Speaker 4>on one site is ecstasy on the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>

1913
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:20.370
<v Speaker 4>lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Candy flipping.</v>

1915

<v Speaker 4>I can't handle it.</v>

1916
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:27.960

<v Speaker 4>That goes into those.</v>

1917
01:22:27.961 --> 01:22:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Those weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lose your mind forever.</v>

1918
01:22:30.370 --> 01:22:31.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trips.</v>

1919
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I blamed the grateful dead and all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1920
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.620
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you lost some brain cells </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly,</v>

1921
01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:37.440
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I lost the most brain cells with</v>

1922
01:22:37.441 --> 01:22:42.441
<v Speaker 4>that one story I told you about where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>rented this apartment and then my heat </v>

1923
01:22:42.441 --> 01:22:46.010
<v Speaker 4>ended up being carbon dioxide from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gas furnace blowing on me for two years </v>

1924
01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:49.671
<v Speaker 4>or a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Found out that day and moving out in my </v>

1925
01:22:49.671 --> 01:22:49.671
<v Speaker 4>guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1926
01:22:49.671 --> 01:22:50.990
<v Speaker 4>checking over my room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made sure I didn't destroy it.</v>

1927
01:22:50.991 --> 01:22:51.870
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1928
01:22:51.871 --> 01:22:52.830
<v Speaker 4>Why is that done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Covered?</v>

1929
01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:57.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's my heat and the gas outtake </v>

1930
01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.950
<v Speaker 4>for the gas furnace and is carbon </v>
<v Speaker 4>dioxide easily.</v>

1931
01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:00.670
<v Speaker 4>There's many nights where me and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl would be like,</v>

1932
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:05.320
<v Speaker 4>am I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Luckily it was such an old house.</v>

1933
01:23:05.321 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 4>It was drafty</v>

1934
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:07.910
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't like air tight or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1935
01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:11.680
<v Speaker 2>You were getting points right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that did the most damage I was.</v>

1936
01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that long.</v>

1937
01:23:12.491 --> 01:23:14.410
<v Speaker 2>It was actually like eight months or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

1938
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:16.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's a different person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1939
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking back at that,</v>

1940
01:23:19.151 --> 01:23:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I think I definitely got some brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>

1941
01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Mostly with your speech stuttery since </v>

<v Speaker 3>an ice skating rink.</v>

1963
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:20.440
<v Speaker 3>That's happened to me many times in </v>
<v Speaker 3>boston.</v>

1964
01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Fucking hates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I grew up in boston.</v>

1965
01:24:22.541 --> 01:24:27.541
<v Speaker 3>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drove every day because I delivered </v>

1966
01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 3>newspapers when I was a fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing taekwondo to make money.</v>

1967
01:24:28.361 --> 01:24:29.770
<v Speaker 3>I would deliver newspapers during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1968
01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Then I would teach classes and train and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I would go and compete,</v>

1969
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.530
<v Speaker 3>so when I would get up in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 3>every morning at 5:00</v>

1970
01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:37.510
<v Speaker 3>AM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times nobody had plowed,</v>

1971
01:24:37.511 --> 01:24:41.230
<v Speaker 3>nobody had done shit and I would just be</v>
<v Speaker 3>on just how to drive.</v>

1972
01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Unlike skating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a rink,</v>

1973
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:49.070
<v Speaker 3>like I would slide around corners </v>
<v Speaker 3>sideways on purpose because nobody was </v>

1974
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.990
<v Speaker 3>around like I knew how to handle it </v>
<v Speaker 3>after awhile.</v>

1975
01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.670
<v Speaker 3>But boston bruins fan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1976
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't really like sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sports.</v>

1977
01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:58.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get bored with sports when I was </v>

1978
01:24:58.381 --> 01:24:58.381
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment I started doing martial arts,</v>

1979
01:24:58.381 --> 01:24:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I thought sports was stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taekwondo,</v>

1980
01:24:59.801 --> 01:25:01.540
<v Speaker 3>what's the dIfference between that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu?</v>

1981
01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1982
01:25:02.151 --> 01:25:04.840
<v Speaker 3>it was a striking art kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly kicking,</v>

1983
01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:06.430
<v Speaker 3>kicking and punching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mostly kicking.</v>

1984
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:09.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was thrilled when I left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judo is throwing.</v>

1985
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about that last night.</v>

1986
01:25:10.901 --> 01:25:12.490
<v Speaker 3>I told rick he had to kill somebody with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a low jack.</v>

1987
01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling them that if a dude</v>

1988
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:21.110
<v Speaker 3>not understand jujitsu and he's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole and he has a jacket on,</v>

1989
01:25:21.111 --> 01:25:26.111
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's good to learn the gete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn how to use the game jujitsu </v>

1990
01:25:26.111 --> 01:25:29.140
<v Speaker 3>because you know a lot of times people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were in close and if some guy is </v>

1991
01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:29.140
<v Speaker 3>attacking you and he's got a leather </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacket on,</v>

1992
01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:32.180
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is get your hand up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there under that collar,</v>

1993
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:34.790
<v Speaker 3>deepen that collar on its neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's a dead man</v>

1994
01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.090
<v Speaker 2>dead because I'm going to connect on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>

1995
01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:45.580
<v Speaker 2>IT's nice to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just need to know that environments </v>

1996
01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.530
<v Speaker 2>teach you that room and then you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck with skiers all day.</v>

1997
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:51.620
<v Speaker 2>She'd come up here with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big shoes on pitch,</v>

<v Speaker 2>snow,</v>

1999
01:25:53.970 --> 01:25:56.250
<v Speaker 3>but judo was the scariest thIng.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a guy's got clothes on,</v>

2000
01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:59.880
<v Speaker 3>if you get in there with like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking jimmy pedro type character,</v>

<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd gone sailing through the air and </v>

2003
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:07.730
<v Speaker 3>coming down on your fucking head on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>concrete.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2006
01:26:11.121 --> 01:26:16.121
<v Speaker 3>Karate is definitely not useless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of times if you have a </v>

2007
01:26:16.121 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 3>black belt in karate though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on who you're getting it from</v>

2008
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:21.670
<v Speaker 3>and there's a ton of different styles of</v>
<v Speaker 3>karate and even within those styles </v>

2009
01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:23.150
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's instructors that are much more,</v>

2010
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2011
01:26:23.801 --> 01:26:28.801
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're much more pure with their </v>

2012
01:26:28.801 --> 01:26:28.801
<v Speaker 3>technique there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're better.</v>

2013
01:26:28.801 --> 01:26:28.801
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>

2014
01:26:28.801 --> 01:26:32.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've competed in like international </v>

2015
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.450
<v Speaker 3>and world tournament's and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're always going to get levels.</v>

2016
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:37.510
<v Speaker 3>There's karate guys like machida that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are machIda's a bad mother fucker and </v>

2017
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:41.141
<v Speaker 3>his base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his karate and he does the best things </v>

2018
01:26:41.141 --> 01:26:41.141
<v Speaker 3>about karate.</v>

2019
01:26:41.141 --> 01:26:41.141
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a wide stance.</v>

2020
01:26:41.141 --> 01:26:43.160
<v Speaker 3>He stays back on the outside counter </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks.</v>

2021
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:48.310
<v Speaker 3>he knows how to leap in and leap out </v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to time because of that </v>

2022
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:49.820
<v Speaker 3>and very good at like leaping it almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fencer and tagging people.</v>

2023
01:26:49.821 --> 01:26:50.930
<v Speaker 3>he fucks people up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2024
01:26:50.931 --> 01:26:52.880
<v Speaker 3>And that's karate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's used it for real,</v>

2025
01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:55.550
<v Speaker 3>but he's excellent at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

2026
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:57.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like karate is not the best martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>art,</v>

2027
01:26:57.831 --> 01:27:01.100
<v Speaker 3>but if you get really good at karate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then learn the other shit,</v>

2028
01:27:01.101 --> 01:27:03.040
<v Speaker 3>you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy tie how to check kicks at it,</v>

2029
01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:04.340
<v Speaker 3>throw knees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to,</v>

2030
01:27:04.341 --> 01:27:05.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a guy down and choke him.</v>

2031
01:27:05.751 --> 01:27:07.800
<v Speaker 3>You learned some jujitsu techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fireballs,</v>

2032
01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.000
<v Speaker 3>fireballs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fate.</v>

2033
01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.430
<v Speaker 3>If you learn all that stuff you can add </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>

2034
01:27:13.431 --> 01:27:18.431
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about like karate that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it interesting is that not that </v>

2035
01:27:18.431 --> 01:27:20.420
<v Speaker 3>many people are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you get a guy who's a really good,</v>

2036
01:27:20.421 --> 01:27:22.040
<v Speaker 3>like really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lIke a,</v>

2037
01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:24.260
<v Speaker 3>like there's a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>styles,</v>

2038
01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:26.390
<v Speaker 3>but kyoko shin is one that's a real good</v>
<v Speaker 3>one to show to cons.</v>

2039
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shogun guys tend to be more like </v>

2040
01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:31.710
<v Speaker 3>leap in and I like the drunken drunken </v>
<v Speaker 3>monkey style.</v>

2041
01:27:33.630 --> 01:27:34.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drunken monkey costume.</v>

2042
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit.</v>

2043
01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:38.230
<v Speaker 3>One of the chinese tried everything man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2044
01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.280
<v Speaker 3>they tried all kinds of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking animal forms and grasshopper and</v>

2045
01:27:42.281 --> 01:27:45.440
<v Speaker 3>tackle like a praying mantis and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>poke you with your fingers and shit.</v>

2046
01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Chinese were like the most innovative </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up with different techniques for </v>

2047
01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:53.621
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about this old school wrestling </v>

2048
01:27:53.621 --> 01:27:53.621
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roman greco,</v>

2049
01:27:53.621 --> 01:27:53.940
<v Speaker 3>greco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>greco,</v>

2050
01:27:53.941 --> 01:27:57.290
<v Speaker 3>roman wrestling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2051
01:27:57.291 --> 01:27:59.230
<v Speaker 3>it is in the fact that it's grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2052
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.980
<v Speaker 3>it isn't the fact that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2053
01:28:00.981 --> 01:28:02.660
<v Speaker 3>you're still controlling a person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

2054
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:05.540
<v Speaker 3>but the intent is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is no end point?</v>

2055

<v Speaker 3>Wants to hold you down.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they get on top of you and </v>

<v Speaker 3>they're punching you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're holding you down and they're </v>

2064
01:28:23.351 --> 01:28:24.881
<v Speaker 3>punching you and they're beating the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck out of you or some of the most </v>

2065
01:28:24.881 --> 01:28:24.980
<v Speaker 3>dangerous fighters in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestlers because the fact they have the</v>

2066
01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:28.010
<v Speaker 3>ability to dictate where the fight is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take where the fight takes place.</v>

2067
01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.040
<v Speaker 3>If they decide to take you down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take you down and if you want to </v>

2068
01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:33.040
<v Speaker 3>take them down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

2069
01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:33.740
<v Speaker 3>They're better at wrestling than you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're fucked.</v>

2070
01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:36.770
<v Speaker 3>So you have to do what they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he wants to fight on the ground,</v>

2071
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:38.120
<v Speaker 3>you have to find the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he wants to stand up,</v>

2072
01:28:38.121 --> 01:28:40.460
<v Speaker 3>you have to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge advantage.</v>

2073
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:42.400
<v Speaker 3>So shoot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Bread recipe is a big part of mma.</v>

2076
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:50.420

<v Speaker 3>so it's his number one skill.</v>

2077
01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Brock is learning submissions was </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting better with submissions.</v>

2078
01:28:52.971 --> 01:28:54.950

<v Speaker 3>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful fucking athletic guy who's got </v>

2083
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:06.030

<v Speaker 3>He's learning all the other stuff.</v>

2084
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Wrestling's number one thing it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

2085
01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just gotta understand jujitsu so you</v>

2086
01:29:10.561 --> 01:29:15.561
<v Speaker 3>don't get trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get caught into certain </v>

2087
01:29:15.561 --> 01:29:15.561
<v Speaker 3>techniques because some guys were </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking dangerous off their back.</v>

2088
01:29:15.561 --> 01:29:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Like eddie eddie's very dangerous off </v>
<v Speaker 3>back whenever I wrote with eddie.</v>

2089
01:29:18.301 --> 01:29:19.440
<v Speaker 3>I only rode with them like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2090
01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:24.670
<v Speaker 3>not that often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every time I think I'm safe when </v>

2091
01:29:24.670 --> 01:29:25.130
<v Speaker 3>he's on his back and he catches me with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2092
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:30.270
<v Speaker 3>So like his legs are so dexterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really knows the insides and outsides</v>

2093
01:29:30.271 --> 01:29:33.540
<v Speaker 3>of each and every position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of guys don't have that.</v>

2094
01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:38.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only a few for breaching </v>

2095
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:38.570
<v Speaker 3>overdoing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy just tapped out.</v>

2096
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:39.030
<v Speaker 3>Fader or he's got that to even higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

2097
01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:41.520
<v Speaker 3>His guard is nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's guys that you just,</v>

2098
01:29:41.521 --> 01:29:44.310
<v Speaker 3>you can't get comfortable with you if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on top of them.</v>

2099
01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:46.140
<v Speaker 3>You can't get comfortable with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2100
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:51.390
<v Speaker 3>they're always attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always setting you up and </v>

2101
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.390
<v Speaker 3>they're always moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One step ahead of you.</v>

2102
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:52.390
<v Speaker 3>Use zig when you should have zagged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden,</v>

2103
01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:54.270
<v Speaker 3>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a triangle locked on,</v>

2104
01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:55.380
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked.</v>

2105
01:29:55.700 --> 01:30:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Then you're trying to battle out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he knows which way you're going to </v>

2106
01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:02.781
<v Speaker 3>go because if you go that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to counter you by holding </v>

2107
01:30:02.781 --> 01:30:02.781
<v Speaker 3>your leg and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pulling that up.</v>

2108
01:30:02.781 --> 01:30:04.060
<v Speaker 3>And now he aTtacks your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he attacks the triangle.</v>

2109
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:09.110
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know you're fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's just got this high level </v>

2110
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.540
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But unless you're fighting those guys,</v>

2111
01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:13.500
<v Speaker 3>the most wrestlers are going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pin a guy down and hold them down.</v>

2112
01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:16.920
<v Speaker 3>So huGe skill to hAve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you must outweigh eddie by 40</v>

2113
01:30:16.921 --> 01:30:17.700
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2114
01:30:17.701 --> 01:30:19.810
<v Speaker 3>not that much money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like one seventY,</v>

2115
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.740
<v Speaker 3>85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think eddie's like one 65.</v>

2116
01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I bet you he's one 65.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you want one 85?</v>

2117
01:30:25.441 --> 01:30:27.030
<v Speaker 3>One 90 2:25</v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>

2118
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:32.420
<v Speaker 3>And I'm a lot stronger than him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's big and man I can't tap 'em I've </v>

2119
01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:32.760
<v Speaker 3>never tapped him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever even come close.</v>

2120
01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:38.300
<v Speaker 3>well I've only made him struggling of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never made them like real one day.</v>

2121
01:30:38.491 --> 01:30:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Will you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

2122
01:30:40.110 --> 01:30:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Is it ticklish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most likely he'll tap me again.</v>

2123
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it nearly as much time into </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as he does.</v>

2124
01:30:44.101 --> 01:30:46.320
<v Speaker 3>He teaches classes everyday and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>trains everyday.</v>

2125
01:30:46.710 --> 01:30:51.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's training when he teaches classes </v>

2126
01:30:51.710 --> 01:30:51.710
<v Speaker 3>four nights a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a knee injury right now.</v>

2127
01:30:51.710 --> 01:30:51.920
<v Speaker 3>So he's not training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2128
01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:53.400
<v Speaker 3>when he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's always rolling.</v>

2129
01:30:53.401 --> 01:30:54.770
<v Speaker 3>He rolls constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2130
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:59.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky I'll get three days a weekend </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm lucky and teaching to teaching a </v>

2132
01:31:03.951 --> 01:31:05.601
<v Speaker 3>school who was really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then he started teaching and he </v>

2133
01:31:05.601 --> 01:31:07.791
<v Speaker 3>became great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about teaching people </v>

2134
01:31:07.791 --> 01:31:10.251
<v Speaker 3>when you really dissect the techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they say that one of the best ways </v>

2135
01:31:10.251 --> 01:31:11.540
<v Speaker 3>to improve your jujitsu game is to teach</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to somebody else that,</v>

2136
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:13.910
<v Speaker 3>that tall light skinned black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2137
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.260
<v Speaker 3>Brent is a heavyset white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's a high level brown belt.</v>

2140
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.300
<v Speaker 3>When he first started out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just a regular guy,</v>

2141
01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:25.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just another dude who,</v>

2142
01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:26.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always good.</v>

2143
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:31.810
<v Speaker 3>He was talented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when he started teaching also need </v>

2144
01:31:31.810 --> 01:31:31.810
<v Speaker 3>to start taking off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2145
01:31:31.810 --> 01:31:33.990
<v Speaker 3>he's a handful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous guy and every time I roll</v>

2146
01:31:33.991 --> 01:31:34.680
<v Speaker 3>with them I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2147
01:31:34.710 --> 01:31:36.160
<v Speaker 3>there's this certain guys that you roll </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

2148
01:31:36.161 --> 01:31:39.570
<v Speaker 3>You just gotta watch your p's and q's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's trying to kill you.</v>

2149
01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.840
<v Speaker 3>One thing I learned real quick was </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're either all in or all out,</v>

2150
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:45.660
<v Speaker 3>two hands in or two ends out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you got one hand in,</v>

2151
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.110
<v Speaker 3>you know if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if if you're on top and you put one hand</v>

2152
01:31:49.111 --> 01:31:50.860
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can somehow try.</v>

2153
01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:52.350
<v Speaker 3>They can show that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2154
01:31:52.351 --> 01:31:54.840
<v Speaker 3>you can grab your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab your arm and trap it.</v>

2155
01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.880
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be all in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2156
01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2157
01:31:58.711 --> 01:31:59.920
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even all in,</v>

2158
01:31:59.921 --> 01:32:00.730
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be careful.</v>

2159
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:03.920
<v Speaker 3>If you get a guy like for overdoing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he controls both your wrists,</v>

2160
01:32:03.921 --> 01:32:08.921
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a lot of problems because he's </v>

2161
01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:09.100
<v Speaker 3>going to attack both ways and as you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you defend one way,</v>

2162
01:32:09.101 --> 01:32:14.101
<v Speaker 3>He's going attack the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know as If you control your risk at </v>

2163
01:32:14.101 --> 01:32:14.101
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

2164
01:32:14.101 --> 01:32:14.770

<v Speaker 3>You get risk control.</v>

2165
01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is a such a tactical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun thing to do because as you do it,</v>

2166
01:32:19.541 --> 01:32:24.541
<v Speaker 3>it's very frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like you remember when you </v>

2167
01:32:24.541 --> 01:32:24.760
<v Speaker 3>started doing standup comedy and he said</v>
<v Speaker 3>the frustrating thing is that there's no</v>

2168
01:32:24.761 --> 01:32:25.600
<v Speaker 3>end to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2169
01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.210
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's going to go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take forever to get good at</v>

2170
01:32:28.211 --> 01:32:33.211
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know it's just a lot of devotion to </v>

2171
01:32:33.211 --> 01:32:34.510
<v Speaker 3>something that you know you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go on forever.</v>

2172
01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:38.190
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see a guy like joey doc,</v>

2173
01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:39.610
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck am I ever going to get that</v>
<v Speaker 3>going?</v>

2174
01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.100
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take 15 years for me to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

2175
01:32:42.101 --> 01:32:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Now that's the same feeling with </v>
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu.</v>

2176
01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:48.960
<v Speaker 3>When you first start out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to enjoy each little miniature </v>

2177
01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:49.960
<v Speaker 3>battle that you win every every new </v>
<v Speaker 3>lesson that you learned,</v>

2178
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.360
<v Speaker 3>but the most humbling thing about it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you do it,</v>

2179
01:32:52.361 --> 01:32:57.361
<v Speaker 3>you realize how little you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many guys that are so much </v>

2180
01:32:57.361 --> 01:32:57.361
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just,</v>

2181
01:32:57.361 --> 01:33:02.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm like decent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's so many guys that were all </v>

2182
01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:02.020
<v Speaker 3>talking about marcella garcia last </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

2183
01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:04.720

<v Speaker 3>probably the best grappler in the world.</v>

2184
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Really technical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like this broodish powerful guy,</v>

2185
01:33:08.471 --> 01:33:11.290
<v Speaker 3>but just all technique and he says </v>

<v Speaker 3>There's vIdeos of him online.</v>

<v Speaker 3>just taking these really high level </v>

2189

<v Speaker 3>choking jujitsu that okay.</v>

2191

<v Speaker 3>Over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2192
01:33:27.881 --> 01:33:30.100
<v Speaker 3>and watch this guy just running through </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>got me when I'm above someone and </v>

2195
01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:38.320
<v Speaker 3>They've got me in full guard when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got you in the garden,</v>

2196
01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.500
<v Speaker 3>in the garden trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even have a good movie.</v>

2197
01:33:40.501 --> 01:33:42.820
<v Speaker 3>You had to break out of the guard to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>onsite control.</v>

2198
01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:44.040
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2199
01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I can show you some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different techniques </v>

2200
01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:49.620
<v Speaker 3>and you have a few go to moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2201
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:54.260
<v Speaker 3>gun by gun man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a game.</v>

2202
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:55.750
<v Speaker 3>If you treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked.</v>

2203
01:33:55.780 --> 01:34:00.780
<v Speaker 3>If you treat it like penn and teller did</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing on martial arts where they </v>

2204
01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:01.930
<v Speaker 3>said that you're better off saving your </v>
<v Speaker 3>money and then giving it to the mugger.</v>

2205
01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.740
<v Speaker 3>SavIng the money that you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not about not getting mugged,</v>

2206
01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:07.930
<v Speaker 3>but martial arts are about is like it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a very,</v>

2207
01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.500
<v Speaker 3>very difficult thing that makes your </v>
<v Speaker 3>character stronger.</v>

2208
01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:14.050
<v Speaker 3>When you learn martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing,</v>

2209
01:34:14.051 --> 01:34:16.900
<v Speaker 3>as you're doing this incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult thing and when you do that you</v>

2210
01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:19.780
<v Speaker 3>learn about yourself and other things </v>
<v Speaker 3>become easier.</v>

2211
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:21.760
<v Speaker 3>It's humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very humbling.</v>

2212
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:23.920
<v Speaker 3>It's humbling when some guys that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2213
01:34:23.921 --> 01:34:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at him,</v>

2214
01:34:24.761 --> 01:34:26.130
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

2215
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:29.530
<v Speaker 3>you're tapping now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's humbling too.</v>

2216
01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.060
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a freaky feeling.</v>

2217
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:33.220
<v Speaker 3>so freaky feeling to have guys dominate </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2218
01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:35.090
<v Speaker 3>And iT's a freaky feeling to dominate </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys too.</v>

2219
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is better,</v>

2220
01:34:37.481 --> 01:34:42.481
<v Speaker 3>but it's weird to feel people nervous </v>
<v Speaker 3>and freaking out and like when they </v>

2221
01:34:42.481 --> 01:34:42.481
<v Speaker 3>first start doing it and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>

2222
01:34:42.481 --> 01:34:47.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think they're tough guys and then </v>

2223
01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:47.320
<v Speaker 3>they realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're closing in like,</v>

2224
01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:47.710
<v Speaker 3>this is getting to a position where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2225
01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:48.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not getting out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2226
01:34:48.941 --> 01:34:53.941
<v Speaker 3>you've got the dude mountain and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>bucking and just trying to explode all </v>

2227
01:34:53.941 --> 01:34:53.941
<v Speaker 3>his energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every time you do it,</v>

2228
01:34:53.941 --> 01:34:54.100
<v Speaker 3>you counter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

2229
01:34:54.150 --> 01:34:56.370
<v Speaker 3>not going anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going anywhere,</v>

2230
01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.760
<v Speaker 3>stay squash,</v>

2231
01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:04.230
<v Speaker 4>and you start slowly squishing them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>squash them and you feel them panicking </v>

2232
01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:04.230
<v Speaker 4>is feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start to freak out when they like,</v>

2233
01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:05.960
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to admit that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to kill them,</v>

2234
01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:11.230
<v Speaker 4>but that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to tap out and you have to </v>

2235
01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:11.230
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2236
01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:11.230
<v Speaker 4>you're going to give you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just going to kill me.</v>

2237
01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:12.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for not killing me.</v>

2238
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.830
<v Speaker 4>And then you go again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the craziest game ever and as you</v>

2239
01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:17.450
<v Speaker 4>get better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you get better at it,</v>

2240
01:35:17.451 --> 01:35:20.300
<v Speaker 4>you understand that it's really all </v>
<v Speaker 4>about focus,</v>

2241
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:24.050
<v Speaker 4>focus and energy and trying to put all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the techniques together,</v>

2242
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.780
<v Speaker 4>but then once you get them all together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like once you drill them all and you get</v>

2243
01:35:26.781 --> 01:35:31.781
<v Speaker 4>them as a part of your repertoire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it just becomes this crazy zen </v>

2244
01:35:31.781 --> 01:35:31.781
<v Speaker 4>thing where you don't even know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing.</v>

2245
01:35:31.781 --> 01:35:32.110
<v Speaker 4>When you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're.</v>

2246
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:34.280
<v Speaker 4>While you're countering and attacking </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything.</v>

2247
01:35:34.281 --> 01:35:36.920
<v Speaker 4>It's like at all like it all plays </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself out,</v>

2248
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:42.370
<v Speaker 4>so it's like you drill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you drill techniques to a certain point </v>

2249
01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:42.370
<v Speaker 4>or when you're rolling they all just </v>
<v Speaker 4>come out and natural.</v>

2250
01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:47.201
<v Speaker 4>Then it's crazy fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really fun and especially when </v>

2251
01:35:47.201 --> 01:35:50.531
<v Speaker 4>you go with another guy who was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good too because you're just battling </v>

2252
01:35:50.531 --> 01:35:53.080
<v Speaker 4>back and forth and countering back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>forth and you don't even have time to </v>

2253
01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.080
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not thinking about your bills,</v>

2254
01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.020
<v Speaker 4>you're not thinking about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2255
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:57.510
<v Speaker 4>thinking about you know your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not thinking about your tire that</v>

2256
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:59.720
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're there in that moment,</v>

2257
01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:05.020
<v Speaker 4>but like in a zen way where you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>even thinking about yourself isn't so </v>

2258
01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:08.951
<v Speaker 4>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the time to wander on </v>

2259
01:36:08.951 --> 01:36:09.020
<v Speaker 4>your bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to keep your eye on.</v>

2260
01:36:09.021 --> 01:36:12.090
<v Speaker 4>This guy's trying to choke the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of you again.</v>

2261
01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.960
<v Speaker 4>Have you been brian?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2262

<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2263
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:18.500
<v Speaker 4>I like croquet and it's not for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He likes cats,</v>

2264
01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:22.520
<v Speaker 4>cats and croquet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not for everybody,</v>

2265
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:25.040
<v Speaker 4>but I knew it would be for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad you're doing it.</v>

2266
01:36:25.041 --> 01:36:26.890
<v Speaker 4>I knew it would be for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally loving them.</v>

2267
01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Loving it because especially when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell me stories,</v>

2268
01:36:29.630 --> 01:36:34.630
<v Speaker 4>we went to dinner over his house and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>tells me stories about trying to jack </v>

2269
01:36:34.630 --> 01:36:37.421
<v Speaker 4>dudes and fucking backing up into him on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the highway and getting crazy on venice </v>

2270

<v Speaker 4>kids driving down venice beach and I'm </v>

2272
01:36:42.701 --> 01:36:44.870
<v Speaker 4>on a bike and this other kid on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>skateboard,</v>

2273
01:36:44.871 --> 01:36:49.871
<v Speaker 4>20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we kind of bumped into each other by </v>

2274
01:36:49.871 --> 01:36:49.871
<v Speaker 4>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>NoboDy's fault.</v>

2275
01:36:49.871 --> 01:36:51.680
<v Speaker 4>And so we kind of untangled each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>from each other and I just decided to go</v>

2276
01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:56.681

<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2280
01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:07.190
<v Speaker 4>I challenged him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess by saying that.</v>

2281
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:12.610
<v Speaker 4>And immediately he turns around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's got like four friends With him </v>

2282
01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:13.550

<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2284
01:37:14.091 --> 01:37:16.820
<v Speaker 4>You're such a dick for responding to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2285
01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.130
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how can I not?</v>

2286
01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kids 20 years old,</v>

2287
01:37:20.391 --> 01:37:22.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm 40.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't treat people like that,</v>

2288
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:24.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in the world,</v>

2289
01:37:24.411 --> 01:37:27.080
<v Speaker 4>but you gotta you gotta I understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2290
01:37:27.081 --> 01:37:29.000
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to recognize that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>

2291
01:37:29.001 --> 01:37:32.360
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them have nothing to lose and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their reputation means too much.</v>

2292
01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.930
<v Speaker 4>The reputation means anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're not around kids like that,</v>

2293
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:37.640
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you challenge the kid like that,</v>

2294
01:37:37.641 --> 01:37:42.641
<v Speaker 4>like he was in la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't consciously though do it </v>

2295
01:37:42.641 --> 01:37:44.210
<v Speaker 4>instinctual just to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correspond on the worst.</v>

2296
01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:47.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm captain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>caveman when any issue like that.</v>

2297
01:37:47.241 --> 01:37:49.490
<v Speaker 4>I have to fight off every.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my biggest.</v>

2298
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:52.060
<v Speaker 4>That's my biggest weakness actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's essential.</v>

2299
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 4>It's natural reacting instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>responding</v>

2300
01:37:57.150 --> 01:37:58.500
<v Speaker 3>legally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an issue,</v>

2301
01:37:58.501 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't think because he's fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2302
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:01.710
<v Speaker 3>You know he starting with you and fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2303
01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:03.170
<v Speaker 3>That'S not the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the issue is your,</v>

2304
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:08.210
<v Speaker 3>your health and safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could just ask you or got you </v>

2305
01:38:08.210 --> 01:38:08.220
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2306
01:38:08.221 --> 01:38:13.221
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter for sure for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really not even jujitsu because you </v>

2307
01:38:13.221 --> 01:38:14.980
<v Speaker 3>don't want to grapple with the garlic </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you want to fucking one tomb.</v>

2308
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 3>You want to put them to sleep and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>charge it the next guy and just let them</v>

2309
01:38:18.781 --> 01:38:23.781
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how quick I can put this due to </v>

2310
01:38:23.781 --> 01:38:23.781
<v Speaker 3>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get you next because that's</v>

2311
01:38:23.781 --> 01:38:26.190
<v Speaker 3>the last thing anybody wants is one dude</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocking out everybody,</v>

2312
01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:27.540
<v Speaker 3>so when the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When.</v>

2313
01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 3>If you have to attack somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're better off.</v>

2314
01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Way better off learning how to strike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to let go.</v>

2315
01:38:32.221 --> 01:38:33.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch me pull guard,</v>

2316
01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking soccer,</v>

2317
01:38:37.681 --> 01:38:38.240
<v Speaker 3>kicking you in.</v>

2318
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Not the best thing to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's a bunch of people,</v>

2319
01:38:42.241 --> 01:38:44.520
<v Speaker 3>the best thing to have is fast fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>

2320
01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:48.470
<v Speaker 3>You'd be able to just light somebody up </v>
<v Speaker 3>just cause you want to somebody,</v>

2321
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:53.720
<v Speaker 3>especially in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they don't know how to </v>

2322
01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:53.720
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When that punch actually lands pop,</v>

2323
01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.530
<v Speaker 3>bam and their eyes roll back in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

2324
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:57.720
<v Speaker 3>They're not even going to expect a that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna.</v>

2325
01:38:57.721 --> 01:38:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Be able to hit him that hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be they're gonna.</v>

2326
01:38:59.131 --> 01:39:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Be able to do it that quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most dudes have never really.</v>

2327
01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Boxing never really been punched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2328
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:06.030
<v Speaker 3>so if you can just find one dude and pop</v>
<v Speaker 3>bank,</v>

2329
01:39:06.330 --> 01:39:08.070
<v Speaker 3>just put that to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other guy was going to go,</v>

2330
01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:10.890
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can get them to scatter,</v>

2331
01:39:10.891 --> 01:39:15.891
<v Speaker 3>but if you try to do some jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should have a movie like like the </v>

2332
01:39:15.891 --> 01:39:15.891
<v Speaker 3>credit card.</v>

2333
01:39:15.891 --> 01:39:19.460
<v Speaker 3>But for jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jujitsu kid where the guy says </v>

2334
01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.891
<v Speaker 3>really good at jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got like this little kid could make it </v>

2335
01:39:21.891 --> 01:39:24.291
<v Speaker 3>more like a judge into art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of weird and the jujitsu is a </v>

2336
01:39:27.271 --> 01:39:31.470
<v Speaker 3>real martial art in the sense that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can defeat a much bigger,</v>

2337
01:39:31.471 --> 01:39:33.060
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more athletic person.</v>

2338
01:39:33.061 --> 01:39:35.700
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to do that with striking </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can.</v>

2339
01:39:35.701 --> 01:39:38.490
<v Speaker 3>It can be done if a guy's an elite </v>
<v Speaker 3>striker and he's facing goes.</v>

2340
01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Not elite stryker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's much dan henderson,</v>

2341
01:39:40.261 --> 01:39:41.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lead striker.</v>

2342
01:39:41.311 --> 01:39:44.170
<v Speaker 3>Dan henderson is really a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a very powerful striker,</v>

2343
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:46.650
<v Speaker 3>but he's not in the line of st anderson </v>
<v Speaker 3>silva.</v>

2344
01:39:46.651 --> 01:39:48.560
<v Speaker 3>Anderson silva is like an elite striker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

2345
01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:53.630
<v Speaker 3>He's a guy who really knows the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intricacies of the standup game dan </v>

2346
01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:54.660
<v Speaker 3>henderson does as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2347
01:39:54.661 --> 01:39:59.661
<v Speaker 3>he's more known as a wrestler because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw him take out that british guy with </v>

2348
01:39:59.661 --> 01:39:59.661
<v Speaker 3>one punch.</v>

2349
01:39:59.661 --> 01:40:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can knock anybody's best paint.</v>

2350
01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got super power in his hands.</v>

2351
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:08.390
<v Speaker 3>He can knock anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knocked out vandelay silva with one </v>

2352
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:10.461
<v Speaker 3>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's knocked out a lot of guys with one </v>

2353
01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:10.461
<v Speaker 3>punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2354
01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:10.461
<v Speaker 3>but then he's not known as a striker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2355
01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:12.870
<v Speaker 3>He's not known as like a technical </v>
<v Speaker 3>strike.</v>

2356
01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:14.420
<v Speaker 3>What about chuck ladell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2357
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:15.960
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a striker.</v>

2358
01:40:16.230 --> 01:40:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Is he fighting again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2359
01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:21.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he has made you think so.</v>

2360
01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you know,</v>

2361
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:28.230
<v Speaker 3>it's your time becomes up when it's up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's up.</v>

2362
01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:30.990
<v Speaker 3>He had one of the greatest careers of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all time.</v>

2363
01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:32.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's,</v>

2364
01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:35.100
<v Speaker 3>think at a certain point in time you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be concerned about your health.</v>

2365
01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:36.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be concerned about,</v>

2366
01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:41.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many knockouts you take and you </v>

2367
01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:41.980

<v Speaker 3>amazing career.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you have that kind of a fire </v>

2370
01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.151
<v Speaker 3>burning inside you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to turn that shit </v>

<v Speaker 3>off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Those guys like you,</v>

2375
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>

2376
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:57.820
<v Speaker 3>Their whole fucking system is wired for </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>

2377
01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Host system is wired for combat for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment,</v>

2378
01:41:00.701 --> 01:41:03.280
<v Speaker 3>for getting to that cage under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bright lights and performing,</v>

2379
01:41:03.570 --> 01:41:08.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their whole self esteem is based on </v>

2380
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:08.570
<v Speaker 3>their ability to rise to a place that </v>
<v Speaker 3>most men can ever get to.</v>

2381
01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they could transfer that </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily?</v>

<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

2384
01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:20.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we as civilians could ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>Possibly understand the highs that it </v>

2385
01:41:20.981 --> 01:41:25.981

<v Speaker 3>arm backs and it's pushing his chest out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and screams after he knocks people out </v>

2387
01:41:28.111 --> 01:41:29.050
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After he knocked randy coture out,</v>

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2447
01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:48.660

<v Speaker 3>Because it's not healthy because I must,</v>

2448
01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.920
<v Speaker 3>I must want to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must to fight to do it.</v>

2449
01:43:51.921 --> 01:43:55.460
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martial arts competition was young where</v>

2450
01:43:55.461 --> 01:44:00.461
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I got out of it without any </v>

2451
01:44:00.461 --> 01:44:03.220
<v Speaker 3>complications physically because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries are knockouts or anything like </v>

2452
01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:03.220
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I knew people who did.</v>

2453
01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I know people had complications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew people who had brain damage for </v>

2454
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:11.411
<v Speaker 3>sure from boxing and it's compromised to</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they talk and it's compromised how </v>

2455
01:44:11.411 --> 01:44:13.820
<v Speaker 3>they can think and make reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable decisions.</v>

2456
01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:15.080
<v Speaker 3>I've met people like that.</v>

2457
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with fighting.</v>

2458
01:44:16.971 --> 01:44:21.971
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to live forever and I </v>

2459
01:44:21.971 --> 01:44:23.891
<v Speaker 3>think every man should be allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make his own decisions as to what he </v>

2460
01:44:23.891 --> 01:44:23.891
<v Speaker 3>wants to do and how long he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>compete.</v>

2461
01:44:23.891 --> 01:44:28.691
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many knockouts he wants to take and </v>

2462
01:44:28.691 --> 01:44:28.691
<v Speaker 3>how much risk he wants to put his body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's up to you.</v>

2463
01:44:28.691 --> 01:44:29.150
<v Speaker 3>It's your choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it,</v>

2464
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:31.820
<v Speaker 3>why is it that you can go and do </v>
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle riding?</v>

2465
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:35.060
<v Speaker 3>You can run betWeen the fucking lanes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and traffic and that's okay.</v>

2466
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:36.380
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

2467
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:38.600
<v Speaker 3>you a guy can't get knocked out more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than three times.</v>

2468
01:44:38.601 --> 01:44:41.570
<v Speaker 3>He can do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for me,</v>

2469
01:44:41.690 --> 01:44:46.690
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you were going to put </v>

2470
01:44:46.690 --> 01:44:48.500
<v Speaker 3>yourself at risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be an end point to it.</v>

2471
01:44:48.710 --> 01:44:53.710
<v Speaker 3>And to me it's like what are we gonna do</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it and be the best guy in the </v>

2472
01:44:53.710 --> 01:44:53.710
<v Speaker 3>world?</v>

2473
01:44:53.710 --> 01:44:53.710
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to win a couple of fights?</v>

2474
01:44:53.710 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 3>What's it going to prove?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2475
01:44:54.591 --> 01:44:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2476
01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.690
<v Speaker 3>the thrill of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2477
01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.080
<v Speaker 3>And maybe getting your fucking face </v>
<v Speaker 3>broken again.</v>

2478
01:45:00.330 --> 01:45:01.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe getting.</v>

2479
01:45:01.191 --> 01:45:03.890
<v Speaker 3>I've had my nose fixed recently and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking awesome.</v>

2480
01:45:03.891 --> 01:45:05.490
<v Speaker 3>I love having my nose again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

2481
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:08.180
<v Speaker 3>My whole life I'd have fucked up jammed </v>
<v Speaker 3>up nose.</v>

2482
01:45:08.181 --> 01:45:13.181
<v Speaker 3>I broke my nose falling down a flight of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stairs when I was five and then I've </v>

2483
01:45:13.181 --> 01:45:16.780
<v Speaker 3>been kicked and punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many times my whole </v>

2484
01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:16.780
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was all fucked.</v>

2485
01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:17.420
<v Speaker 3>But what's cool is you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything to prove.</v>

2486
01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:20.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't need because you are tough,</v>

2487
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:25.300
<v Speaker 3>but that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people out there that </v>

2488
01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:25.300
<v Speaker 3>can kick my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The needing to prove thing.</v>

2489
01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:25.630
<v Speaker 3>It should all be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2490
01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.680
<v Speaker 3>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one should need to prove anything.</v>

2491
01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:29.020
<v Speaker 3>And if you do need to prove something to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2492
01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:30.920
<v Speaker 3>you can just find out more about </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

2493
01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:32.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you need to prove something.</v>

2494
01:45:32.630 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy's out there that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to start fights or guys that are,</v>

2495
01:45:34.851 --> 01:45:39.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have a chip on their </v>

2496
01:45:39.851 --> 01:45:41.471
<v Speaker 3>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they need to do is get more </v>

2497
01:45:41.471 --> 01:45:44.350
<v Speaker 3>positive experiences in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get more things would they have </v>

2498
01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:44.870
<v Speaker 3>accomplished their emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've conquered their emotions and</v>

2499
01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:47.090
<v Speaker 3>accomplish the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seemed really difficult to do.</v>

2500
01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:48.620
<v Speaker 3>And they understand more about </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

2501
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:51.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>mma fighters,</v>

2502
01:45:51.021 --> 01:45:53.540
<v Speaker 3>like some of the best guys in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're super friendly.</v>

2503
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:58.930
<v Speaker 3>George st pierre is one of the nicest </v>
<v Speaker 3>people I have ever met in my life and </v>

2504
01:45:58.930 --> 01:46:01.880
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the baddest motherfucker is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pound for pound on the planet and saying</v>

2505
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:05.150
<v Speaker 3>he's so kind and so friendly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>genuine.</v>

2506
01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.370
<v Speaker 3>And the reason is he doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything to prove to anybody.</v>

2507
01:46:07.371 --> 01:46:11.390
<v Speaker 3>He proves it to himself in competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He proves it to himself in training.</v>

2508
01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.850
<v Speaker 3>He proved it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proves it to himself with discipline,</v>

2509
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:16.610
<v Speaker 3>forcing himself to do the hard work to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become great.</v>

2510
01:46:16.611 --> 01:46:19.340
<v Speaker 3>And he is great and recognize as great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because of that,</v>

2511
01:46:19.341 --> 01:46:21.770
<v Speaker 3>he's balanced and he's like super </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>

2512
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:26.950
<v Speaker 3>super calm person to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple of years ago I watched him </v>

2513
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:28.070
<v Speaker 3>fight against that brazilian guy and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a great fight.</v>

2514
01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Thiago silva and I think elvis rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>

2515
01:46:31.530 --> 01:46:33.290
<v Speaker 3>It was a tie striker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2516
01:46:33.291 --> 01:46:35.030
<v Speaker 3>That guy was strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2517
01:46:35.150 --> 01:46:37.070
<v Speaker 3>And he couldn't sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a monster.</v>

2518
01:46:37.071 --> 01:46:42.071
<v Speaker 3>St pierre couldn't submit them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the distance I hope has is he's a </v>

2519
01:46:42.071 --> 01:46:43.280
<v Speaker 3>beast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has a problem making weight,</v>

2520
01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:44.810
<v Speaker 3>didn't make weight for his last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2521
01:46:45.110 --> 01:46:48.230
<v Speaker 3>rematch with john fitch and he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>look that good physical.</v>

2522
01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:53.230
<v Speaker 3>He looked like he looked like he was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little hurt by the weight cut because </v>

2523
01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:55.500
<v Speaker 3>he's so big in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's supposed to fight at one 70,</v>

2524
01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:58.860
<v Speaker 3>but he walks around over 200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's cutting.</v>

2525
01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:03.340
<v Speaker 3>He's dehydrating himself like 30 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then try to replenish himself and it</v>

2526
01:47:03.341 --> 01:47:08.341
<v Speaker 3>just you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be a point of a point </v>

2527
01:47:08.341 --> 01:47:11.481
<v Speaker 3>of diminishing returns where you cut so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much weight and you dehydrate yourself </v>

2528
01:47:11.481 --> 01:47:13.320
<v Speaker 3>so much that your performance is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to suffer.</v>

2529
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just so big.</v>

2530
01:47:15.450 --> 01:47:18.480

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:25.740
<v Speaker 3>It's got to lose some muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had too much.</v>

2534
01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.830

2541
01:47:38.890 --> 01:47:41.080
<v Speaker 3>I saw this picture of a chimp carrying </v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit.</v>

2542
01:47:41.110 --> 01:47:46.110
<v Speaker 3>It was an old female chimp and she had </v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit in her hands and fruit and her </v>

<v Speaker 3>things and she's like flexing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>beat the fuck out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that one time?</v>

2554
01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:23.120

<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2557
01:48:25.730 --> 01:48:30.730
<v Speaker 5>I think like four or five people died </v>
<v Speaker 5>and within like two days and the guys </v>

2558
01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:31.460

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2559
01:48:31.461 --> 01:48:34.520
<v Speaker 5>this happens every year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People die like almost every day.</v>

2560
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 5>And the last day she Was there,</v>

<v Speaker 5>where they rub up the engines really </v>

2562
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.960
<v Speaker 5>fast or whatever it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it's called,</v>

2563
01:48:41.961 --> 01:48:43.730
<v Speaker 5>but it's like they're just revving of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their engines with us.</v>

2564
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:47.020
<v Speaker 5>Something happened in his motorcycle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blew up and he got decapitated.</v>

01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:48.100

<v Speaker 3>capital shit son.</v>

2567
01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:53.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking this is how dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>motorcycles are.</v>

2568
01:48:53.001 --> 01:48:55.580
<v Speaker 5>Fucking how many people die at this </v>
<v Speaker 5>motorcycle thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>everyday,</v>

2570
01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.220
<v Speaker 5>for the last 50 years in burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And no one's ever done it.</v>

2571
01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:03.710
<v Speaker 3>The thing about those motorcycle shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a lot of those dudes,</v>

2572
01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:05.650
<v Speaker 3>they get crazy and they want to show off</v>
<v Speaker 3>for each other.</v>

2573
01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:07.880
<v Speaker 3>Start they start standing on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>bikes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Ever seen guys surf with their </v>
