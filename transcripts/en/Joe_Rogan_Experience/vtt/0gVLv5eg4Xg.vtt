00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.801
<v Speaker 1>The dude who,</v>

20
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.840

22
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>a power commercial,</v>

23
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:38.814
<v Speaker 1>the power lifter.</v>

24
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.301
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

25
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>very cool dude with his also very cool girlfriend.</v>

26
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>And it was hilarious because they were so happy that we should all over the part</v>

27
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>of the commercial where he hangs out with the girls.</v>

28
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>She was so mad about that because at the end of the commercial,</v>

29
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

30
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.081
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

31
00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

32
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>a commercial for a testosterone supplement called t plus.</v>

33
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And what t plus does is it naturally stimulates your body to produce more</v>

34
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Speaker 1>testosterone than this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A commercial with this power lifter dude.</v>

36

<v Speaker 1>in the beginning of it,</v>

38
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>it's just him lifting weights.</v>

39
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>All of it makes sense.</v>

40
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.491
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

41
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:09.324
<v Speaker 1>But then the end of it,</v>

42
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 1>it was him with two girls at a bar and it was like being Mr Sexy.</v>

43

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 4>And that was where it got shocking.</v>

150
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.091
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

151
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:46.751
<v Speaker 4>agreed with you.</v>

152
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 4>That was where it got shocking because that was the first time we'd ever seen</v>

153
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 4>like high ranking military officers,</v>

154
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 4>one after another,</v>

155
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.220
<v Speaker 4>testify that they had personal encounters with things that are not of this</v>

156
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

157
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 4>People who would know the difference between black ops technology,</v>

158
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:04.221
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

159
00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:05.054
<v Speaker 4>the current,</v>

160
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

161
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 4>military defense projects that might be secret and people that would know also</v>

162
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 4>who to talk to about these things if they did think it was a black ops,</v>

163
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 4>but they knew they,</v>

164
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:18.544
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>

165
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

166
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 4>that video is probably one of the most important videos ever when it comes to</v>

167
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 4>extra terrestrial life or the idea of extraterrestrial life visiting earth.</v>

168
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Because the conversations that I've ever had that I've always had with rational</v>

169
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.190
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

170
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.510
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

171
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 4>especially rational people who are not obsessed by aliens like I've been my</v>

172
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 4>whole life,</v>

173
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 4>but rational people who just,</v>

174
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:41.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

175
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:42.131
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

176
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

177
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's real or not,</v>

178
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.191
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

179
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

180
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

181
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.630
<v Speaker 4>where's the evidence?</v>

182
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's alien life out there.</v>

183
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 4>Has it visited us?</v>

184
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

185
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

186
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 4>I probably not.</v>

187
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

188
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 4>When you see that video and you see those high ranking military guys,</v>

189
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 4>one after another,</v>

190
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 4>give these very,</v>

191
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 4>not just believable,</v>

192
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 4>but they're kind of,</v>

193
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.040
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

194
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.691
<v Speaker 4>they're spooky.</v>

195
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 4>These are spooky stories because the way they're talking about him,</v>

196
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 4>you could see in their face the emotions as they're recounting the,</v>

197
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 4>just the sheer,</v>

198
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 4>to use a word alien,</v>

199
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 4>this of their experience,</v>

200
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.713
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

201
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 4>We had never really seen anything like that before.</v>

202
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 4>It had always been,</v>

203
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.411
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

204
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 4>I guess they probably could be out there,</v>

205
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 4>but who knows.</v>

206
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 4>When I watched that video,</v>

207
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:27.604
<v Speaker 4>it was a real,</v>

208
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

209
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 4>it was a real shift because it was one of the first things that I ever saw that</v>

210
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 4>made me really stop and think.</v>

211
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 4>There's a part of everybody that doesn't want to get duped.</v>

212
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 4>And when it comes to a subject,</v>

213
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 4>especially an important subject like Ufos,</v>

214
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 4>there's a part of everybody who goes there.</v>

215
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 4>You want to call bullshit right away because you don't want to be the last guy</v>

216
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:48.604
<v Speaker 4>to call bullshit.</v>

217
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to be the guy who believes,</v>

218
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:51.191
<v Speaker 4>believes,</v>

219
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:51.761
<v Speaker 4>believes,</v>

220
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 4>and it turns into bullshit.</v>

221
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.051
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

222
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:53.651
<v Speaker 4>you dummy,</v>

223
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 4>you believed that you were the first guy.</v>

224
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 4>I believe in it man.</v>

225
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.780
<v Speaker 4>You want to be the first guy to call bullshit.</v>

226
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 4>It's always a way cooler position.</v>

227
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

228
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

229
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 4>if there was alien life,</v>

230
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 4>if there was an life that had visited the earth,</v>

231
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:08.084
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

232
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

233
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 4>what evidence would they leave behind?</v>

234
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

235
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 4>what would you know in your day to day existence?</v>

236
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 4>How much of it would you know?</v>

237
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Almost nothing</v>

238
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 5>like when it's getting hoovered up by a very well organized and well funded</v>

239
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.013
<v Speaker 5>intelligence.</v>

240
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 4>The project blue book,</v>

241
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 4>which was run by Jay,</v>

242
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 4>Dr Jay Allen Heineken,</v>

243
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

244
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 5>That was a cover story project.</v>

245
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 5>Blue Book was really a little office where they were putting things in there and</v>

246
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 5>making it sound like they were really investigating.</v>

247
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:39.111
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>

248
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 5>there was a uh,</v>

249
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 5>unacknowledged project,</v>

250
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 5>what we call it black project,</v>

251
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 5>but the proper name is an unacknowledged special access project.</v>

252
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:50.020
<v Speaker 5>Are you SAP and the use saps running this had been around since the 40</v>

253
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] very well funded working on these issues,</v>

254
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:54.250
<v Speaker 5>working on the technology,</v>

255
00:06:54.251 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 5>studying how these things are going from one star system to another.</v>

256
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 5>And that's the sort of thing that,</v>

257
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 5>that we've been drilling down on for about 22 years.</v>

258
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.880
<v Speaker 4>So the project Blue Book that was run by Dr Heinik,</v>

259
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.121
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

260
00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:06.954
<v Speaker 4>what's his name,</v>

261
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 5>it Dr J.</v>

262
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.701
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

263
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:08.590
<v Speaker 5>Allen Hynek right.</v>

264
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.850
<v Speaker 5>He was an air force guy,</v>

265
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:12.510
<v Speaker 5>a astronomer that the air force engaged to do that.</v>

266
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.900
<v Speaker 5>Later he came out and admitted that that was all just sort of a,</v>

267
00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:17.290
<v Speaker 5>a dog and pony show.</v>

268
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.250
<v Speaker 4>And he also became a huge UFO believer,</v>

269
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.060
<v Speaker 4>which is really fascinating because most of the stories that they investigated</v>

270
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:25.140
<v Speaker 4>in project blue book,</v>

271
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.490
<v Speaker 4>he sorted debunked.</v>

272
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.030
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

273
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.840
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

274
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.780
<v Speaker 4>instead of being open about the possibilities,</v>

275
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.970
<v Speaker 4>they always steered towards debunking</v>

276
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.600
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>

277
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.050
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

278
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 5>And actually the big problem became when he put his foot in his mouth when a,</v>

279
00:07:39.421 --> 00:07:41.820
<v Speaker 5>in Gerald Ford's a home district in Michigan,</v>

280
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 5>there was a whole,</v>

281
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

282
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.560
<v Speaker 5>dozens of people who saw an extraterrestrial vehicle,</v>

283
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.251
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

284
00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:48.510
<v Speaker 5>that was some maneuvering,</v>

285
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.050
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

286
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.070
<v Speaker 5>at close range.</v>

287
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:54.180
<v Speaker 5>And he went up and investigate it and made some reference to it being swamp gas.</v>

288
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.971
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

289
00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:55.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

290
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.590
<v Speaker 5>Gerald Ford went ballistic because his constituents went ballistic.</v>

291
00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:03.591
<v Speaker 5>And Gerald Ford actually had an inquiry into it while he was a member of the</v>

292
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.130
<v Speaker 5>House of Representatives course later as president,</v>

293
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.240
<v Speaker 5>he never dealt with this issue because basically the presidential intelligence</v>

294
00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:11.250
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have access to those projects.</v>

295
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.540
<v Speaker 4>When you say that,</v>

296
00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:12.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

297
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.690
<v Speaker 4>he said it was swamp gas that Jay on Hynix said it was swamp cast.</v>

298
00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 4>So you were saying that Ford objected because he knew it was an extraterrestrial</v>

299
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.790
<v Speaker 4>vehicle.</v>

300
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

301
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 5>he knew that his,</v>

302
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:26.050
<v Speaker 5>some of his constituents who were very credible knew it was something real.</v>

303
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 5>What was his position then?</v>

304
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:28.024
<v Speaker 5>What was he,</v>

305
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.050
<v Speaker 5>he was actually a believed it was real as the,</v>

306
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:31.330
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

307
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:31.481
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

308
00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:31.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

309
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:32.021
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

310
00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:32.800
<v Speaker 4>in government,</v>

311
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.910
<v Speaker 4>what is prepared</v>

312
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.570
<v Speaker 5>precedent?</v>

313
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:34.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

314
00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:34.861
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

315
00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:35.200
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

316
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.150
<v Speaker 5>he was in the House of Representatives in the congress.</v>

317
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.750
<v Speaker 5>He was a congressman before he was a vice president and then president.</v>

318
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.040
<v Speaker 4>And so he was upset that they were saying that it wasn't a real vehicle.</v>

319
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 4>So he clamped down on it.</v>

320
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.421
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

321
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:47.050
<v Speaker 5>And actually hold,</v>

322
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.440
<v Speaker 5>held a hearing where a lot of people came and gave evidence and information,</v>

323
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.990
<v Speaker 5>but it didn't go anywhere because it's Washington.</v>

324
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Nothing ever goes anywhere in Washington.</v>

325
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

326
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

327
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.050
<v Speaker 5>so you know,</v>

328
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.510
<v Speaker 5>I started as founder of disclosure project.org and now serious disclosure.</v>

329
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

330
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 5>Calm.</v>

331
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.390
<v Speaker 5>We began investigating this in,</v>

332
00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 5>in uh,</v>

333
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.550
<v Speaker 5>1990 and you know,</v>

334
00:09:07.551 --> 00:09:08.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm a trauma doctor,</v>

335
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 5>emergency doctor who was running a very busy er and raising four kids.</v>

336
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 5>And I got involved with this because,</v>

337
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:15.740
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

338
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 5>I knew about it since childhood.</v>

339
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.061
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

340
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:18.391
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

341
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

342
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

343
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.981
<v Speaker 5>I have family,</v>

344
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:20.290
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

345
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 5>my mom's brother,</v>

346
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 5>uncle was a engineer that worked on the lunar module and I had an interest in</v>

347
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 5>this and so I was a little child.</v>

348
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

349
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.160
<v Speaker 5>so the thing that put knew learning strong on the,</v>

350
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:29.641
<v Speaker 5>on the moon,</v>

351
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 5>my family had a hand in that.</v>

352
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 5>So I think that what most people don't realize is that inside the intelligence</v>

353
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:36.061
<v Speaker 5>community,</v>

354
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 5>the aerospace community,</v>

355
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.160
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

356
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.850
<v Speaker 5>there are a lot of people who are very knowledgeable about this,</v>

357
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 5>but they're not allowed to talk about it.</v>

358
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 5>It's a career ender for most of them.</v>

359
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 5>And that was what we did for disclosure project,</v>

360
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 5>was to put all those folks together,</v>

361
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.671
<v Speaker 5>identify them.</v>

362
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 5>So I spent about 10 years identifying who these people were in.</v>

363
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Speaker 5>First I had maybe half a dozen of them.</v>

364
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 5>Now we have over 500,</v>

365
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 5>about 550.</v>

366
00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 5>Who was the most credible people?</v>

367
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 5>Just so folks listening to this that haven't watched that video,</v>

368
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 5>who are the most credible people?</v>

369
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:03.961
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

370
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:05.280
<v Speaker 5>we're going to have some of them in the film.</v>

371
00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 5>Serious.</v>

372
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:06.560
<v Speaker 5>You know this,</v>

373
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

374
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.731
<v Speaker 5>sir,</v>

375
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 5>I us,</v>

376
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm serious.</v>

377
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.831
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

378
00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:11.730
<v Speaker 5>is going to,</v>

379
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

380
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 5>have a lot of this information at it and some stuff is going to blow your mind,</v>

381
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.510
<v Speaker 5>including the possibility of an actual body,</v>

382
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:19.820
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

383
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.140
<v Speaker 5>a humanoid body that we're investigating.</v>

384
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.570
<v Speaker 5>And we'll get into this in a moment.</v>

385
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.201
<v Speaker 5>And when you see it,</v>

386
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:27.270
<v Speaker 5>you're going to go really my God.</v>

387
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

388
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:34.010
<v Speaker 5>these witnesses that we have who are military go from the head of investigations</v>

389
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 5>for the FAA,</v>

390
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Speaker 5>John Callahan to people like Gordon Cooper,</v>

391
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.980
<v Speaker 5>who was one of the early Mercury astronauts who,</v>

392
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

393
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 5>his crew actually filmed one of these extra tests,</v>

394
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 5>will vehicles landing on a dry lake bed out here near Edwards.</v>

395
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.850
<v Speaker 5>And he looked at the film and send it on a Pentagon plane.</v>

396
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 5>And now the backstory to this,</v>

397
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.480
<v Speaker 5>now this is the go give,</v>

398
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:57.450
<v Speaker 5>giving you an idea of how labyrinthine and screwed up Washington's become and</v>

399
00:10:57.451 --> 00:10:58.310
<v Speaker 5>what Eisenhower said,</v>

400
00:10:58.311 --> 00:10:58.681
<v Speaker 5>what he said,</v>

401
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 5>but where are the military industrial complex because it's going to get out of</v>

402
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:03.270
<v Speaker 5>control and be a threat to our democracy.</v>

403
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 5>Gordon Cooper,</v>

404
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

405
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.550
<v Speaker 5>very heroic early astronauts had detailed information what we call actionable</v>

406
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 5>intelligence on that event,</v>

407
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 5>this landing of a vehicle in broad daylight near Edwards air force base in 1956.</v>

408
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.000
<v Speaker 5>Now when Clinton was president,</v>

409
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 5>Gordon Cooper asked,</v>

410
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:24.751
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

411
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 5>was asked by the Secretary of Defense,</v>

412
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.340
<v Speaker 5>William Cohen about this issue.</v>

413
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:29.731
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>

414
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:29.941
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

415
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 5>I absolutely will verify this and I'll give you the information when and where</v>

416
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:34.194
<v Speaker 5>and how it happened.</v>

417
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:39.350
<v Speaker 5>So the secretary of Defense of the United States of America had this</v>

418
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:40.081
<v Speaker 5>information,</v>

419
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 5>made an inquiry through channels and came up with a dry hole.</v>

420
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 5>Basically this stuff,</v>

421
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 5>it's all been put into a parallel universe that,</v>

422
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 5>that senior people in our government have for the most part,</v>

423
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:52.764
<v Speaker 5>no access to.</v>

424
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.411
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

425
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 5>I would not</v>

426
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 6>have believed that if I hadn't been the guy who was brought to Washington during</v>

427
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 6>the Clinton years to do the briefing for the CIA director.</v>

428
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 6>And I was asked to go up there,</v>

429
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

430
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.871
<v Speaker 6>as a service.</v>

431
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:05.381
<v Speaker 6>And I did it,</v>

432
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:10.381
<v Speaker 6>left my er and I put together a whole lot of these early witnesses' testimony,</v>

433
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 6>photographs,</v>

434
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.620
<v Speaker 6>some really amazing government documents that we acquired,</v>

435
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 6>some through channels I don't want to talk about.</v>

436
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 6>And I put this briefing together.</v>

437
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 6>And so I go up there and here's the city CIA director,</v>

438
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.063
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

439
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

440
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 6>our James Woolsey.</v>

441
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.010
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

442
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.511
<v Speaker 6>his wife was there,</v>

443
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:29.321
<v Speaker 6>who was at the time,</v>

444
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 6>the chief operating officer of the National Academy of Sciences.</v>

445
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 6>And when I was first invited to go up there and brief the CIA director,</v>

446
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.670
<v Speaker 6>I was told,</v>

447
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 6>they want you to come up here because President Clinton and he have inquired</v>

448
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:42.190
<v Speaker 6>about this subject and they're being denied access.</v>

449
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 6>Now I have a letter proving this.</v>

450
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 6>President Clinton has been denied access.</v>

451
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:51.691
<v Speaker 6>So they want you a doctor in who had a family connection to these programs and,</v>

452
00:12:51.951 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 6>and also to information they know about you.</v>

453
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:57.521
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

454
00:12:57.521 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 6>let me finish this other thread and I'll get to that.</v>

455
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:00.843
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

456
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.160
<v Speaker 6>because that's they're blowing your mind even more.</v>

457
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 6>But what happened is that,</v>

458
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:05.200
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

459
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:05.391
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

460
00:13:05.391 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 6>I really thought this was crap.</v>

461
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

462
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 6>because when his handler,</v>

463
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.270
<v Speaker 6>the CIA director,</v>

464
00:13:11.271 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 6>his handler who contacted me said,</v>

465
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:13.690
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

466
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

467
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 6>they need you to come up here because they can't find out anything.</v>

468
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:19.450
<v Speaker 6>But they know stuff's going on.</v>

469
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 6>I felt they just wanted to pick,</v>

470
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 6>my brain is sort of spooks,</v>

471
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:22.571
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

472
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:23.910
<v Speaker 6>how spooks will spies.</v>

473
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 6>We'll try to just get information.</v>

474
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.480
<v Speaker 6>I went up there and the CIA director was honestly completely in the dark and I</v>

475
00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:31.720
<v Speaker 6>was mortified.</v>

476
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 6>And towards the end of this almost three hour briefing that I did for the CIA</v>

477
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:36.784
<v Speaker 6>director,</v>

478
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.390
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

479
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 6>my wife was with me and I gave him this white paper,</v>

480
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:40.750
<v Speaker 6>this position paper that,</v>

481
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 6>a summary of action that the president needed to take and he needed to take.</v>

482
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

483
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:45.911
<v Speaker 6>and he,</v>

484
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:46.744
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

485
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.210
<v Speaker 6>my hands were shaking cause hang on,</v>

486
00:13:48.211 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 6>I'm like this 35 year old guy briefing the sitting CIO director was very</v>

487
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:53.980
<v Speaker 6>intimidating frankly.</v>

488
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.873
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

489
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.871
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

490
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:57.010
<v Speaker 6>at the end of it I said,</v>

491
00:13:57.011 --> 00:13:57.191
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

492
00:13:57.191 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 6>we really need you to help disclose this information because the people need to</v>

493
00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:01.931
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

494
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 6>but also the technologies that we've studied and have mastered for 50 years</v>

495
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 6>could get us all full hill.</v>

496
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 6>We could fix this environment,</v>

497
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:10.180
<v Speaker 6>we could fix the world's,</v>

498
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:10.750
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

499
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 6>poverty problems and the geopolitical problems in the Middle East.</v>

500
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.861
<v Speaker 6>And he looked at me,</v>

501
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:15.161
<v Speaker 6>he says,</v>

502
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 6>how do we disclose that which we have no access to?</v>

503
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 6>And I just thought,</v>

504
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 6>I thought I'd pass out.</v>

505
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.281
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

506
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:22.540
<v Speaker 6>what do you mean you have new way?</v>

507
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 6>And this was from his mouth to my ears.</v>

508
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.160
<v Speaker 6>And so I learned the hard way,</v>

509
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:27.521
<v Speaker 6>the very,</v>

510
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:30.610
<v Speaker 6>very hard way that when you're dealing with things that are,</v>

511
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.560
<v Speaker 6>some people say above top secret,</v>

512
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:35.950
<v Speaker 6>but the proper name is an unacknowledged special access project.</v>

513
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 6>And we have about a hundred to $200 billion a year and our treasury going into</v>

514
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:42.010
<v Speaker 6>these rogue operations.</v>

515
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:42.841
<v Speaker 6>And it's a,</v>

516
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 6>it's a criminal.</v>

517
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.493
<v Speaker 6>It's outrageous,</v>

518
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:45.050
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

519
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.550
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

520
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.941
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

521
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 6>just because you're the CIA director,</v>

522
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:50.440
<v Speaker 6>just because you're secretary of defense or on the Senate intelligence committee</v>

523
00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:51.274
<v Speaker 6>means nothing.</v>

524
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

525
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 6>and even the president.</v>

526
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.050
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

527
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 6>so the reason he,</v>

528
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 6>those folks invited me to come up there is that,</v>

529
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

530
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 6>the year before I had taken a team of people out on a beach using some</v>

531
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:08.261
<v Speaker 6>experimental protocols to contact these vehicles and the occupants and four of</v>

532
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 6>these UFOs pop into the sky.</v>

533
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.140
<v Speaker 6>Just boom,</v>

534
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.400
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

535
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

536
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:13.940
<v Speaker 6>which we have on videotape,</v>

537
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 6>not great videotape cause we didn't have good cameras back then.</v>

538
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.601
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

539
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:21.650
<v Speaker 6>there were a couple of air force officers and pilots there and this went up</v>

540
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 6>through the chain of command.</v>

541
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.050
<v Speaker 6>Few months later,</v>

542
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 6>the former head of army intelligence invites me to a meeting and then some</v>

543
00:15:26.991 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 6>national security agency people do and one thing leads to another.</v>

544
00:15:30.321 --> 00:15:34.480
<v Speaker 6>And I'm being invited to brief the city of CIA director so that you know,</v>

545
00:15:34.481 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 6>that you contacted these spaceships.</v>

546
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Speaker 6>Well this gets into a discussion when,</v>

547
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:40.611
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

548
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:42.650
<v Speaker 6>that's complex.</v>

549
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.543
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

550
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.020
<v Speaker 6>but yes,</v>

551
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 6>and you can do that at any time.</v>

552
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.770
<v Speaker 6>Well mad at anytime,</v>

553
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.990
<v Speaker 6>but I think that under the right you can do that.</v>

554
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.570
<v Speaker 6>There are protocols and we developed something called the close encounters or</v>

555
00:15:54.571 --> 00:15:55.820
<v Speaker 6>the fifth kind initiative,</v>

556
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 6>which is when you use a set of very,</v>

557
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.720
<v Speaker 6>they're very controversial protocols,</v>

558
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

559
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.740
<v Speaker 6>that deal with nonlocality the fact that the universe has various dimensions</v>

560
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 6>that you can move through to go from one star system to another.</v>

561
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.970
<v Speaker 6>But those dimensions that are at higher resonant fields than say linear space</v>

562
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:16.830
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

563
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.220
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

564
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 6>or electromagnetism also interface with what I call coherent thought.</v>

565
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 6>So the Moody Blues were right when they said,</v>

566
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking is the best way to travel.</v>

567
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

568
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 6>and there's a component to where,</v>

569
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:32.590
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

570
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 6>I'm pregnant,</v>

571
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.160
<v Speaker 6>lose half your listeners,</v>

572
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:34.980
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

573
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:35.813
<v Speaker 6>I've got,</v>

574
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:36.660
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

575
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 6>well pay all you freaks,</v>

576
00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:39.310
<v Speaker 6>listen up and listen apart.</v>

577
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:40.280
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

578
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 6>you can develop technologies and we have these in classified projects now where</v>

579
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:45.381
<v Speaker 6>you can have a,</v>

580
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:50.210
<v Speaker 6>what's called a switch that will interface with very intent thought.</v>

581
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 6>So it's beyond,</v>

582
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 6>forget your iPhone now,</v>

583
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.880
<v Speaker 6>if you're traveling from one star system to another,</v>

584
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 6>that's what you're going to be using.</v>

585
00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:01.190
<v Speaker 6>You're going to be using technologies that are phasing at multiples of the speed</v>

586
00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:02.024
<v Speaker 6>of light.</v>

587
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.360
<v Speaker 6>And those dimensions also intersect at a certain point with coherent thought,</v>

588
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:08.210
<v Speaker 6>just like lightest,</v>

589
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.890
<v Speaker 6>coherent a laser is coherent light.</v>

590
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 6>And so this gets into the whole question of how over the history of humanity</v>

591
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:17.180
<v Speaker 6>have there been so many reports of contact.</v>

592
00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 6>And there are,</v>

593
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean going all the way back to the [inaudible] and the Betas to uh,</v>

594
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:22.791
<v Speaker 6>accounts that,</v>

595
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:22.941
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

596
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:25.150
<v Speaker 6>there's a wonderful painting and um,</v>

597
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:26.270
<v Speaker 6>the Middle Ages of,</v>

598
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:27.530
<v Speaker 6>of this exactly.</v>

599
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:30.200
<v Speaker 6>It looks like a modern Ufo over the shoulder of,</v>

600
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 6>of Mary holding Jesus.</v>

601
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Speaker 6>And a picture that's been from the 14 hundreds.</v>

602
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.820
<v Speaker 6>I've actually seen the original of this.</v>

603
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.830
<v Speaker 6>So I think the question becomes,</v>

604
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:40.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

605
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 6>we probably have always had extraterrestrial civilizations observing our little</v>

606
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.164
<v Speaker 6>planet.</v>

607
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:45.980
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

608
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.490
<v Speaker 6>the question is what happened in the last 50 to a hundred years that really got</v>

609
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:51.324
<v Speaker 6>their attention.</v>

610
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 6>And I'm quite convinced it was when we started detonating thermonuclear weapons.</v>

611
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 6>But my,</v>

612
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 6>one of the projects we're involved with is disclosure project.</v>

613
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:02.600
<v Speaker 6>And another one is sort of a citizen's diplomacy efforts.</v>

614
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.180
<v Speaker 6>Saying,</v>

615
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.630
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

616
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.170
<v Speaker 6>since our government is dead in the water on this in terms of the secretary of</v>

617
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 6>state and folks like that,</v>

618
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:09.211
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

619
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 6>and I know I went up to the UN and met with um,</v>

620
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.100
<v Speaker 6>back when boots was boots with Scalia,</v>

621
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:17.830
<v Speaker 6>was UN secretary general and brief these guys and hit her lay layer.</v>

622
00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:18.770
<v Speaker 6>Golly though the wife,</v>

623
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.880
<v Speaker 6>the secretary general and I talked about this in depth and he,</v>

624
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:23.490
<v Speaker 6>she said they're not going to let us deal with something like this.</v>

625
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.580
<v Speaker 6>So I started a citizens diplomacy effort back in 1990 but this is actually,</v>

626
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.270
<v Speaker 6>and this is the part that I get ridiculed the most for,</v>

627
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 6>but it's the reason why the intelligence community took it most seriously.</v>

628
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.670
<v Speaker 6>It's that they knew that we had discovered the Rosette of stone of contact and</v>

629
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 6>they were very concerned.</v>

630
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 6>Now concern from the covert end,</v>

631
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 6>from the end of a lot of these Washington operatives,</v>

632
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 6>they were just fascinated.</v>

633
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:52.380
<v Speaker 6>They didn't understand it because it was sort of pass there,</v>

634
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.850
<v Speaker 6>their scientific understanding,</v>

635
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.580
<v Speaker 6>but they should.</v>

636
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.413
<v Speaker 4>Very interesting,</v>

637
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.110
<v Speaker 4>this is something,</v>

638
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.270
<v Speaker 4>I hate it or interrupt you.</v>

639
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:57.421
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

640
00:18:57.421 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 4>please come in and we can't really just gloss over,</v>

641
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

642
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.230
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

643
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.100
<v Speaker 4>the idea that coherent thought as you say,</v>

644
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.590
<v Speaker 4>intersects with these,</v>

645
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:07.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

646
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.180
<v Speaker 4>other levels,</v>

647
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.120
<v Speaker 4>these other dimensions that we can't normally access.</v>

648
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:12.530
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

649
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.363
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

650
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.920
<v Speaker 4>how did you find out about this and how did you develop the ability on a hot</v>

651
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:21.300
<v Speaker 4>seat early man?</v>

652
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:21.481
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

653
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 4>I need to be need.</v>

654
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.071
<v Speaker 4>You have to,</v>

655
00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:24.210
<v Speaker 4>when you say that you can do that,</v>

656
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean somehow or another you have to without getting anybody killed.</v>

657
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.873
<v Speaker 4>You have to explain.</v>

658
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.820
<v Speaker 6>How'd you figure that out?</v>

659
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.510
<v Speaker 6>I figured it out when I was a teenager and,</v>

660
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.373
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

661
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.810
<v Speaker 6>through a series of experiences I had,</v>

662
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

663
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.150
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

664
00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:41.421
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>

665
00:19:41.421 --> 00:19:45.170
<v Speaker 6>I was talking to Thomas Jane who's an actor here in town about this and I had a</v>

666
00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:46.880
<v Speaker 6>near death experience when I was 17.</v>

667
00:19:46.881 --> 00:19:48.980
<v Speaker 6>It was very sick and,</v>

668
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.490
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

669
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.541
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

670
00:19:49.541 --> 00:19:50.361
<v Speaker 6>hand experienced.</v>

671
00:19:50.361 --> 00:19:54.860
<v Speaker 6>That took me into some awareness about the nature of consciousness and the</v>

672
00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:59.360
<v Speaker 6>nonlocality of mind and the fact that the mind is actually a singularity,</v>

673
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.960
<v Speaker 6>that there's really only one mind and it's just shining through various</v>

674
00:20:02.961 --> 00:20:05.060
<v Speaker 6>individuals appearing as many.</v>

675
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.890
<v Speaker 6>And this experience,</v>

676
00:20:06.891 --> 00:20:10.700
<v Speaker 6>although it sounds very spiritual and religious was very palpable.</v>

677
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.490
<v Speaker 6>And I was raised a very devout atheist,</v>

678
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.960
<v Speaker 6>so we didn't believe in anything.</v>

679
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.920
<v Speaker 6>And so when I realized that this was real,</v>

680
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.720
<v Speaker 6>I began to study meditation.</v>

681
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.380
<v Speaker 6>And through that began to have some experiences where I realize this could</v>

682
00:20:24.381 --> 00:20:24.830
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>

683
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.450
<v Speaker 6>And I had a contact experience.</v>

684
00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.790
<v Speaker 6>I was 18,</v>

685
00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:32.791
<v Speaker 6>it was a few months later in the fall of 1973 and I was doing this,</v>

686
00:20:33.411 --> 00:20:38.300
<v Speaker 6>I was meditating and then I was doing what's now called Srv scientific remove</v>

687
00:20:38.301 --> 00:20:41.570
<v Speaker 6>viewing where you use consciousness to see remote places.</v>

688
00:20:41.571 --> 00:20:42.080
<v Speaker 6>And of course,</v>

689
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.930
<v Speaker 6>army intelligence and the CIA have experiment with this for years.</v>

690
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.273
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

691
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.300
<v Speaker 6>which you may or may not know about.</v>

692
00:20:48.301 --> 00:20:49.134
<v Speaker 6>We can get into that.</v>

693
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.591
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

694
00:20:49.591 --> 00:20:50.340
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

695
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.330
<v Speaker 6>I know all those guys.</v>

696
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.580
<v Speaker 6>I know all this RV people and,</v>

697
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.840
<v Speaker 6>but I was as a kid,</v>

698
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.351
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

699
00:20:55.351 --> 00:20:56.490
<v Speaker 6>and I just turned 18.</v>

700
00:20:56.491 --> 00:20:59.460
<v Speaker 6>I was doing this and suddenly I had this experience where I thought,</v>

701
00:20:59.461 --> 00:21:00.294
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

702
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.220
<v Speaker 6>what if I tried to go into that state of one mind that I experienced when I was</v>

703
00:21:05.221 --> 00:21:06.054
<v Speaker 6>a kid,</v>

704
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:06.930
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

705
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:07.261
<v Speaker 6>six,</v>

706
00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:09.390
<v Speaker 6>six months earlier when I had this near death experience.</v>

707
00:21:09.391 --> 00:21:10.224
<v Speaker 6>So I did.</v>

708
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:15.140
<v Speaker 6>And then I had an experience where I remote viewed and salt eat space and um,</v>

709
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.160
<v Speaker 6>could see that there was an eet spacecraft out there and I made contact and it</v>

710
00:21:21.511 --> 00:21:24.030
<v Speaker 6>appeared and it literally materialized,</v>

711
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:24.660
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

712
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.130
<v Speaker 6>right near the mountain where I was</v>

713
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:28.710
<v Speaker 6>18.</v>

714
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.490
<v Speaker 6>No drugs?</v>

715
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:29.850
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

716
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:30.001
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

717
00:21:30.001 --> 00:21:30.834
<v Speaker 6>I've never done any drawer.</v>

718
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.773
<v Speaker 4>Never done engines.</v>

719
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.450
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

720
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.631
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

721
00:21:32.631 --> 00:21:33.261
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelics.</v>

722
00:21:33.261 --> 00:21:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Nothing ever.</v>

723
00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

724
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.940
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

725
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Are you aware,</v>

726
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.520
<v Speaker 4>aware of dimethyltryptamine?</v>

727
00:21:37.521 --> 00:21:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what can I do?</v>

728
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.051
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

729
00:21:39.051 --> 00:21:39.884
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

730
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.210
<v Speaker 4>supposedly your brain produces it when you're in periods of extreme stress or</v>

731
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.350
<v Speaker 4>near death experiences.</v>

732
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:46.701
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

733
00:21:46.701 --> 00:21:47.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

734
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.910
<v Speaker 4>also the same chemical that's in Iowasca,</v>

735
00:21:49.911 --> 00:21:52.320
<v Speaker 4>which has been used by indigenous tribes too.</v>

736
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:53.331
<v Speaker 6>Right now.</v>

737
00:21:53.331 --> 00:21:54.164
<v Speaker 6>This was just,</v>

738
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.660
<v Speaker 6>this was a very natural sort of thing that happened.</v>

739
00:21:56.661 --> 00:21:56.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

740
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

741
00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:56.901
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

742
00:21:56.901 --> 00:21:57.130
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

743
00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.770
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm saying is that these people that are having these experiences that</v>

744
00:22:01.771 --> 00:22:04.740
<v Speaker 4>are having a lot of people that are having alien contact experiences,</v>

745
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.230
<v Speaker 4>they are all having them in the middle of the night,</v>

746
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.030
<v Speaker 4>like most of them or having them at night.</v>

747
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.770
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not discounting this in any way.</v>

748
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:11.581
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

749
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:13.470
<v Speaker 4>I maybe possibly enhancing the,</v>

750
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

751
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.120
<v Speaker 4>the possibility of people understanding this or the,</v>

752
00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:17.954
<v Speaker 4>the vehicle.</v>

753
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.133
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

754
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:19.591
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

755
00:22:19.591 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 4>the mind produces this dimethyltryptamine during rem sleep and uh,</v>

756
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.450
<v Speaker 4>it's believed it.</v>

757
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:26.880
<v Speaker 4>So it's still a very sketchy thing.</v>

758
00:22:26.881 --> 00:22:28.350
<v Speaker 4>We know that the body produces it.</v>

759
00:22:28.351 --> 00:22:28.810
<v Speaker 4>We know we,</v>

760
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.450
<v Speaker 4>they believe the pineal gland,</v>

761
00:22:30.451 --> 00:22:34.310
<v Speaker 4>which is literally your third eye and reptiles it as a retina and the cornea in</v>

762
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.160
<v Speaker 4>Atlanta,</v>

763
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.070
<v Speaker 4>they believe that's what the evidence on an apparently,</v>

764
00:22:38.071 --> 00:22:39.150
<v Speaker 4>it's like really kind of,</v>

765
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.550
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to figure out exactly.</v>

766
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.870
<v Speaker 4>But they know the body has it.</v>

767
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.180
<v Speaker 4>They know it's produced by the liver and the lungs for sure.</v>

768
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.980
<v Speaker 4>And this chemical,</v>

769
00:22:46.981 --> 00:22:50.160
<v Speaker 4>when you get it and you give it to people that have had UFO abduction</v>

770
00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:50.994
<v Speaker 4>experiences,</v>

771
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.370
<v Speaker 4>it gives them the exact same experience.</v>

772
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

773
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:54.171
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

774
00:22:54.171 --> 00:22:57.150
<v Speaker 4>it brings them into contact with other beings.</v>

775
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.220
<v Speaker 4>The idea that this is just a hallucination because you are,</v>

776
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.580
<v Speaker 4>your body has some,</v>

777
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:02.851
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

778
00:23:02.851 --> 00:23:03.181
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

779
00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:08.181
<v Speaker 4>in dodginess chemical in it and its spikes and stimulates the visual cortex and</v>

780
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:10.680
<v Speaker 4>what have you and you have this,</v>

781
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.830
<v Speaker 4>that is what everyone has always assumed.</v>

782
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.341
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

783
00:23:14.341 --> 00:23:17.110
<v Speaker 4>whenever you talk about anything hallucinatory or Psychedelic,</v>

784
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.450
<v Speaker 4>but what they're not,</v>

785
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:23.510
<v Speaker 4>what a lot of people haven't taken into consideration is that you're basically a</v>

786
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.770
<v Speaker 4>conglomeration of chemicals,</v>

787
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.660
<v Speaker 4>your neurotransmitters,</v>

788
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:28.441
<v Speaker 4>dopamine,</v>

789
00:23:28.441 --> 00:23:29.041
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin,</v>

790
00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:34.041
<v Speaker 4>and there's a million different chemicals which w as their levels vary up and</v>

791
00:23:34.381 --> 00:23:34.951
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

792
00:23:34.951 --> 00:23:37.710
<v Speaker 4>it drastically changes your reality,</v>

793
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.510
<v Speaker 4>your happiness level,</v>

794
00:23:39.511 --> 00:23:40.560
<v Speaker 4>your appreciation,</v>

795
00:23:40.561 --> 00:23:41.040
<v Speaker 4>love,</v>

796
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.940
<v Speaker 4>oxytocin,</v>

797
00:23:41.941 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 4>all of these things proven 100% change your reality.</v>

798
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.550
<v Speaker 4>You change the physical meet vehicle reality that you have.</v>

799
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 4>And I think for whatever reason,</v>

800
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:54.740
<v Speaker 4>when we think of something in the mind,</v>

801
00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:55.850
<v Speaker 4>when we think of the mind,</v>

802
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:56.241
<v Speaker 4>like you're,</v>

803
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:59.960
<v Speaker 4>you're saying that coherent thought can contact other entities from other</v>

804
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.501
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

805
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:00.651
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

806
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:02.330
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

807
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:02.511
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

808
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:04.850
<v Speaker 4>that's like the initial immediate reaction,</v>

809
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:05.684
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

810
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.030
<v Speaker 6>Misunder miss,</v>

811
00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.460
<v Speaker 6>educate about the nature of it.</v>

812
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.140
<v Speaker 4>Well of consciousness,</v>

813
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:10.861
<v Speaker 4>conscious for you.</v>

814
00:24:10.861 --> 00:24:13.920
<v Speaker 4>I've always tried to get people to try to understand how bizarre.</v>

815
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Just just imagination is.</v>

816
00:24:15.901 --> 00:24:19.260
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean imagination by you're imagining things that aren't there,</v>

817
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:20.161
<v Speaker 4>that's not real.</v>

818
00:24:20.161 --> 00:24:20.400
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

819
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.420
<v Speaker 4>you're playing games with your mind.</v>

820
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.600
<v Speaker 4>What I mean by imagination is everything,</v>

821
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:29.310
<v Speaker 4>including the language that we're speaking with right now,</v>

822
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.510
<v Speaker 4>the vehicle in which this language is getting delivered through the Internet.</v>

823
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.210
<v Speaker 4>All of this came from the imagination.</v>

824
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:36.990
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>

825
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.070
<v Speaker 4>This table came from.</v>

826
00:24:38.071 --> 00:24:40.890
<v Speaker 4>The imagination is the arm that holds this microphone.</v>

827
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Someone thought this shit up and then all of a sudden it manifested itself in a</v>

828
00:24:44.461 --> 00:24:46.860
<v Speaker 4>physical form when they actively created it.</v>

829
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.200
<v Speaker 4>That seems so normal to us.</v>

830
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.340
<v Speaker 4>It seems so normal,</v>

831
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.670
<v Speaker 4>but we're the only fucking animal in the world we know that can do that.</v>

832
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:54.231
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

833
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:54.301
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

834
00:24:54.301 --> 00:24:55.360
<v Speaker 6>and it goes beyond that because,</v>

835
00:24:55.361 --> 00:24:55.541
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

836
00:24:55.541 --> 00:24:59.800
<v Speaker 6>Doctor John at Princeton University had the Princeton engineering anomalies</v>

837
00:24:59.801 --> 00:25:02.050
<v Speaker 6>research lab and I knew Dr John and,</v>

838
00:25:02.051 --> 00:25:02.710
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

839
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:06.850
<v Speaker 6>they had proven that you could set up a random number generator machine and put</v>

840
00:25:06.851 --> 00:25:09.280
<v Speaker 6>your thought towards it and begin to move,</v>

841
00:25:09.281 --> 00:25:11.140
<v Speaker 6>whether it's spitting out zeros or ones.</v>

842
00:25:11.141 --> 00:25:13.210
<v Speaker 6>And that there is in fact,</v>

843
00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:14.623
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

844
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.840
<v Speaker 6>been proven scientifically that the mind is actually operating non-locally</v>

845
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.530
<v Speaker 6>meaning that it's not limited to the space and time in a linear way.</v>

846
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.860
<v Speaker 6>And these studies that have been done by Dean Raden and Dr John and many other</v>

847
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.670
<v Speaker 6>scientists,</v>

848
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.250
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

849
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.420
<v Speaker 6>with very good credentials.</v>

850
00:25:31.421 --> 00:25:31.631
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

851
00:25:31.631 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 6>Doctor John was a engineer and,</v>

852
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:34.780
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

853
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.620
<v Speaker 6>at Princeton,</v>

854
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.990
<v Speaker 6>what they found is that in fact the mind itself is what urban Trojans</v>

855
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.520
<v Speaker 6>Schrodinger said.</v>

856
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.310
<v Speaker 6>And Urban Schroders or of course was the father of four a particle wave theory</v>

857
00:25:45.311 --> 00:25:46.210
<v Speaker 6>and quantum mechanics.</v>

858
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.310
<v Speaker 6>And I think it was in 1910 or so.</v>

859
00:25:48.311 --> 00:25:51.580
<v Speaker 6>He said the total number of mines in the universe is one that is,</v>

860
00:25:51.581 --> 00:25:52.870
<v Speaker 6>it's a singularity.</v>

861
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.020
<v Speaker 6>And so that understanding is,</v>

862
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.550
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

863
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:56.801
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

864
00:25:56.801 --> 00:25:59.950
<v Speaker 6>I know it sounds sort of 'em out there,</v>

865
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.850
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

866
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:01.361
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

867
00:26:01.361 --> 00:26:02.140
<v Speaker 6>I mean it,</v>

868
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.520
<v Speaker 6>it actually sounds very vedic,</v>

869
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:03.990
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

870
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.900
<v Speaker 6>in the sense of,</v>

871
00:26:04.901 --> 00:26:05.231
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

872
00:26:05.231 --> 00:26:05.591
<v Speaker 6>of the,</v>

873
00:26:05.591 --> 00:26:07.210
<v Speaker 6>of Buddhist or of Vedanta.</v>

874
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.630
<v Speaker 6>But it'd be too,</v>

875
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:10.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

876
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.650
<v Speaker 6>I guess to maybe Sarah Palin,</v>

877
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:12.320
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

878
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.100
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

879
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.631
<v Speaker 6>I say that,</v>

880
00:26:13.631 --> 00:26:14.021
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry,</v>

881
00:26:14.021 --> 00:26:14.854
<v Speaker 6>I apologize.</v>

882
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.580
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

883
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.150
<v Speaker 6>but the reason I'm late is the world isn't flat.</v>

884
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.140
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

885
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.890
<v Speaker 6>and there's a whole area of physics and science that has been drilled down on</v>

886
00:26:23.891 --> 00:26:26.380
<v Speaker 6>for years that establish all these things is true.</v>

887
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:30.910
<v Speaker 6>It isn't talked about because I'm the high priests of religion and the high</v>

888
00:26:30.911 --> 00:26:34.570
<v Speaker 6>priests of science are all opposed to this information coming out.</v>

889
00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.880
<v Speaker 6>So the idea though,</v>

890
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:40.540
<v Speaker 6>part of the secrecy around this whole Ufo issue isn't just the physical energy</v>

891
00:26:40.541 --> 00:26:41.770
<v Speaker 6>and propulsion systems.</v>

892
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.090
<v Speaker 6>It's the paradigm.</v>

893
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.290
<v Speaker 6>Because if you be,</v>

894
00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:45.760
<v Speaker 6>if you asked the question,</v>

895
00:26:45.761 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm back.</v>

896
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:46.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

897
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.840
<v Speaker 6>Going back to this dinner with the CIA director and his wife,</v>

898
00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.640
<v Speaker 6>very smart lady,</v>

899
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.860
<v Speaker 6>and she turns in,</v>

900
00:26:53.861 --> 00:26:55.450
<v Speaker 6>we're sitting across the table having dinner.</v>

901
00:26:55.451 --> 00:26:55.601
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

902
00:26:55.601 --> 00:26:58.960
<v Speaker 6>that was the cover story was it was a dinner and she says,</v>

903
00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:03.190
<v Speaker 6>how are they communicating across the vastness of space?</v>

904
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.040
<v Speaker 6>And of course I had the,</v>

905
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.851
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

906
00:27:06.851 --> 00:27:09.280
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know whether to tell her something that sounded scientific,</v>

907
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.820
<v Speaker 6>so I maintain my credibility or to tell her the truth and risk losing all my</v>

908
00:27:15.221 --> 00:27:16.054
<v Speaker 6>credibility.</v>

909
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.800
<v Speaker 6>But I decided then in the early days of this project that if someone smart</v>

910
00:27:20.801 --> 00:27:22.060
<v Speaker 6>enough to ask the question,</v>

911
00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.010
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to answer it honestly,</v>

912
00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.840
<v Speaker 6>even though it's going to blow their mind.</v>

913
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.710
<v Speaker 6>And so I looked at her and her husband,</v>

914
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.950
<v Speaker 6>the CIA director sitting next to it,</v>

915
00:27:29.951 --> 00:27:30.090
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

916
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:31.630
<v Speaker 6>It didn't really understand where she was going.</v>

917
00:27:31.631 --> 00:27:31.931
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

918
00:27:31.931 --> 00:27:32.764
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

919
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.240
<v Speaker 6>take her Milky Way.</v>

920
00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.670
<v Speaker 6>It's a hundred thousand light years across.</v>

921
00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:37.900
<v Speaker 6>All right?</v>

922
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.120
<v Speaker 6>So that in a hundred thousand light years as a distance,</v>

923
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.360
<v Speaker 6>that's how far you would go at 186,000 miles a second for a hundred thousand</v>

924
00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.390
<v Speaker 6>years going at that speed.</v>

925
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.920
<v Speaker 6>Then that's just our own galaxy.</v>

926
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.800
<v Speaker 6>Now you take 1% of that,</v>

927
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 6>say a thousand light years at the speed of your cell phone or radio wave or TV</v>

928
00:27:59.231 --> 00:27:59.531
<v Speaker 6>waiver.</v>

929
00:27:59.531 --> 00:28:04.180
<v Speaker 6>This system we're using right here for someone from a star system 1% of the way</v>

930
00:28:04.181 --> 00:28:06.430
<v Speaker 6>through our galaxy for them to say,</v>

931
00:28:06.431 --> 00:28:06.791
<v Speaker 6>hello,</v>

932
00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:07.624
<v Speaker 6>how are you?</v>

933
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.600
<v Speaker 6>And for a spacecraft that's at another star system,</v>

934
00:28:10.601 --> 00:28:11.560
<v Speaker 6>a thousand light years away,</v>

935
00:28:11.561 --> 00:28:13.000
<v Speaker 6>see here earth to say fine,</v>

936
00:28:13.001 --> 00:28:13.834
<v Speaker 6>how are you doing?</v>

937
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.490
<v Speaker 6>That just took how long?</v>

938
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:16.390
<v Speaker 6>4,000 years.</v>

939
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.260
<v Speaker 6>2000 years.</v>

940
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.210
<v Speaker 6>1001 way in 1000 and other.</v>

941
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.980
<v Speaker 6>So at the time since the birth of Christ,</v>

942
00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:22.990
<v Speaker 6>so the speed of light is too damn slow.</v>

943
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.340
<v Speaker 6>And so when you,</v>

944
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.660
<v Speaker 6>when you begin to go through what I call the crossing point of light,</v>

945
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.150
<v Speaker 6>it's like the sound barrier was a big deal.</v>

946
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.580
<v Speaker 6>The biggest deal is the light barrier.</v>

947
00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.620
<v Speaker 6>And when you go past the light barrier,</v>

948
00:28:35.621 --> 00:28:39.400
<v Speaker 6>you're going to cross into these and kind of multifaceted resonant dimensions,</v>

949
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:43.450
<v Speaker 6>part of which hook into the singularity of mind and thought.</v>

950
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.180
<v Speaker 6>And actually this film that we're working on,</v>

951
00:28:46.181 --> 00:28:49.300
<v Speaker 6>which is the largest crowd funded documentary in history,</v>

952
00:28:49.301 --> 00:28:50.020
<v Speaker 6>to my knowledge,</v>

953
00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.853
<v Speaker 6>a serious,</v>

954
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.260
<v Speaker 6>and you can find out about it,</v>

955
00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.390
<v Speaker 6>serious disclosure.com it's been crowdfunded by the public.</v>

956
00:28:55.391 --> 00:28:57.190
<v Speaker 6>It's all been funded by people out there,</v>

957
00:28:57.191 --> 00:28:58.120
<v Speaker 6>thousands of people.</v>

958
00:28:58.650 --> 00:28:58.901
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

959
00:28:58.901 --> 00:28:59.650
<v Speaker 6>we're gonna do a,</v>

960
00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.040
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

961
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.161
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

962
00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:00.731
<v Speaker 6>we're going to do a,</v>

963
00:29:00.731 --> 00:29:01.564
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

964
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:05.320
<v Speaker 6>premiere here in La on April 22nd if you want to come.</v>

965
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:06.483
<v Speaker 6>But I would love to,</v>

966
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:06.791
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

967
00:29:06.791 --> 00:29:07.350
<v Speaker 6>come.</v>

968
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.940
<v Speaker 4>We can't send things to the speed of light.</v>

969
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:09.121
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

970
00:29:09.121 --> 00:29:09.490
<v Speaker 4>And even,</v>

971
00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.140
<v Speaker 4>even that,</v>

972
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 4>even saying that beyond the speed of light,</v>

973
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:13.560
<v Speaker 4>but they can't do that,</v>

974
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

975
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

976
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.180
<v Speaker 4>you can't send information in,</v>

977
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.250
<v Speaker 4>in a form of light yet,</v>

978
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.113
<v Speaker 4>can you</v>

979
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:18.891
<v Speaker 6>not?</v>

980
00:29:18.891 --> 00:29:19.280
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

981
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:19.641
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

982
00:29:19.641 --> 00:29:20.391
<v Speaker 6>but I'm well,</v>

983
00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:22.100
<v Speaker 6>fiber optics and things of this sort.</v>

984
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.420
<v Speaker 6>But does that move at the speed of light?</v>

985
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.990
<v Speaker 6>Pretty much.</v>

986
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.250
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

987
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:24.520
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

988
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:24.830
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

989
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.350
<v Speaker 6>but what I'm saying is that if you go beyond the speed of light,</v>

990
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:27.680
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

991
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.210
<v Speaker 6>it's a whole new physics of course.</v>

992
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:29.720
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

993
00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.770
<v Speaker 6>So that's what if,</v>

994
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.990
<v Speaker 6>if these craft are here and now we have,</v>

995
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.510
<v Speaker 6>I have over 4,000 cases where they've landed.</v>

996
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.380
<v Speaker 6>And we have evidence.</v>

997
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.530
<v Speaker 6>I have 3,500 pilot cases.</v>

998
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.180
<v Speaker 6>We have over 500 whistle blowers,</v>

999
00:29:42.181 --> 00:29:44.100
<v Speaker 6>top secret military corporate people.</v>

1000
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.530
<v Speaker 6>And I have 110 of them on digital video tape,</v>

1001
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.030
<v Speaker 6>although nobody wants to see it.</v>

1002
00:29:48.031 --> 00:29:48.630
<v Speaker 6>But I have it.</v>

1003
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.560
<v Speaker 6>So the question is,</v>

1004
00:29:49.561 --> 00:29:50.400
<v Speaker 6>if they're here,</v>

1005
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.810
<v Speaker 6>how the hell they get here,</v>

1006
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:56.190
<v Speaker 6>or they're not using an Exxon jet a fuel and they're not using a solid rocket</v>

1007
00:29:56.191 --> 00:29:59.430
<v Speaker 6>booster and the not using an eye on drive or anything linear.</v>

1008
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.530
<v Speaker 6>So you have to begin to have this question.</v>

1009
00:30:01.531 --> 00:30:03.720
<v Speaker 6>So when the CIA director's wife asked me this,</v>

1010
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.700
<v Speaker 6>I told her about that they had technologies that interface with thought and</v>

1011
00:30:08.701 --> 00:30:09.534
<v Speaker 6>consciousness.</v>

1012
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.590
<v Speaker 6>And that sounded,</v>

1013
00:30:10.591 --> 00:30:12.600
<v Speaker 6>it's Biz may sound as bizarre to people now,</v>

1014
00:30:12.601 --> 00:30:15.120
<v Speaker 6>but if you took your cell phone and show Thomas Jefferson,</v>

1015
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.860
<v Speaker 6>your smartphone,</v>

1016
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.790
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1017
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:18.780
<v Speaker 6>they would think it was magic.</v>

1018
00:30:18.781 --> 00:30:19.650
<v Speaker 6>If you went to Salem,</v>

1019
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.180
<v Speaker 6>Massachusetts couple hundred years ago,</v>

1020
00:30:21.181 --> 00:30:22.590
<v Speaker 6>you'd be burned at the stake as a witch.</v>

1021
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.880
<v Speaker 6>So the point is,</v>

1022
00:30:23.881 --> 00:30:27.810
<v Speaker 6>is that people have to have some humility about the fact that humans are one</v>

1023
00:30:27.811 --> 00:30:29.490
<v Speaker 6>half of one step out of the jungle.</v>

1024
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.510
<v Speaker 6>Technologically.</v>

1025
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.230
<v Speaker 6>And we're only a hundred or so years into anything resembling real technology.</v>

1026
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.490
<v Speaker 6>So when we're dealing with civilizations that are attended the six to 10 to the</v>

1027
00:30:38.491 --> 00:30:41.040
<v Speaker 6>seventh 100,000 to a million years ahead of us,</v>

1028
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.550
<v Speaker 6>we have to have some humility about what that might look like.</v>

1029
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.910
<v Speaker 6>And so when I explained this to the wife to say I director,</v>

1030
00:30:47.911 --> 00:30:49.140
<v Speaker 6>she just looked at me and said,</v>

1031
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.630
<v Speaker 6>I thought it had to be something like that.</v>

1032
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.171
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1033
00:30:52.171 --> 00:30:54.150
<v Speaker 6>people are ready to actually understand this.</v>

1034
00:30:54.151 --> 00:30:56.850
<v Speaker 6>Not everyone has to be retarded on this.</v>

1035
00:30:56.851 --> 00:30:58.290
<v Speaker 6>And I tell folks that it's,</v>

1036
00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:03.830
<v Speaker 6>what's a shame in my mind is that our civilization has been exploring these sort</v>

1037
00:31:04.201 --> 00:31:07.710
<v Speaker 6>of what they called border land sciences for a hundred years.</v>

1038
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.220
<v Speaker 6>And it's all been kept very secret or debunked or ridiculed.</v>

1039
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.270
<v Speaker 6>And it's actually holding us back not only socially and spiritually,</v>

1040
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.730
<v Speaker 6>but environmentally and in every other way.</v>

1041
00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:22.560
<v Speaker 6>Because this nexus of where you have these advanced trans dimensional physics</v>

1042
00:31:22.561 --> 00:31:23.394
<v Speaker 6>come together.</v>

1043
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.300
<v Speaker 6>That's how you're propelling through one point in space to another across</v>

1044
00:31:27.301 --> 00:31:28.134
<v Speaker 6>galaxies.</v>

1045
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.830
<v Speaker 6>It's also how we're going to be able to run this planet's energy grid.</v>

1046
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.551
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1047
00:31:32.551 --> 00:31:36.450
<v Speaker 6>without a grid where every home business and car can pull energy out of the</v>

1048
00:31:36.451 --> 00:31:39.420
<v Speaker 6>fabric of space time through this kind of physics.</v>

1049
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.550
<v Speaker 6>And so there's this nexus where electromagnetism and trans dimensional physics</v>

1050
00:31:44.551 --> 00:31:47.550
<v Speaker 6>comes together and then you cross it a little deeper and that's where you get</v>

1051
00:31:47.551 --> 00:31:48.990
<v Speaker 6>into the science of consciousness.</v>

1052
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.910
<v Speaker 6>And this becomes a very,</v>

1053
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.510
<v Speaker 6>very complex issue for most people because it's new to them.</v>

1054
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.480
<v Speaker 6>But once you understand the fundamental science behind it,</v>

1055
00:31:57.481 --> 00:31:58.770
<v Speaker 6>it's really very simple.</v>

1056
00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 4>What we need to understand is that no one 200 years ago even thought of a</v>

1057
00:32:05.361 --> 00:32:06.194
<v Speaker 4>camera,</v>

1058
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1059
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.150
<v Speaker 4>200 years ago,</v>

1060
00:32:08.151 --> 00:32:09.290
<v Speaker 4>when you want to picture something,</v>

1061
00:32:09.291 --> 00:32:11.000
<v Speaker 4>you had to draw it and there was,</v>

1062
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1063
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:12.980
<v Speaker 4>the idea of a camera was,</v>

1064
00:32:12.981 --> 00:32:14.600
<v Speaker 4>so the idea of a movie,</v>

1065
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.740
<v Speaker 4>the idea of sending a video on your phone to your friend,</v>

1066
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.220
<v Speaker 4>you could take a video of you here right now and send it to a friend and they</v>

1067
00:32:22.221 --> 00:32:23.480
<v Speaker 4>would get it almost instantly.</v>

1068
00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.780
<v Speaker 4>That's just a tiny blip in,</v>

1069
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.320
<v Speaker 4>in human history,</v>

1070
00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:31.820
<v Speaker 4>a 200 year blip in human history from riding horses to sending video through the</v>

1071
00:32:31.821 --> 00:32:32.260
<v Speaker 4>Internet.</v>

1072
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:32.991
<v Speaker 4>Or a hundred years.</v>

1073
00:32:32.991 --> 00:32:33.824
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1074
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.760
<v Speaker 4>And the people that existed back then would have never seen a calming.</v>

1075
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.720
<v Speaker 4>And if technology,</v>

1076
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.651
<v Speaker 4>and we know it does,</v>

1077
00:32:40.651 --> 00:32:43.920
<v Speaker 4>accelerates exponentially what we're dealing with a thousand years from now,</v>

1078
00:32:43.921 --> 00:32:45.060
<v Speaker 4>10,000 years from now,</v>

1079
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.100
<v Speaker 4>it's completely unrecognizable.</v>

1080
00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.390
<v Speaker 4>We live in an area where our solar system is kind of scary.</v>

1081
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.780
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of rocks out there and they fly around and occasionally slamming</v>

1082
00:32:54.781 --> 00:32:55.650
<v Speaker 4>the shit and they can,</v>

1083
00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.080
<v Speaker 4>they can ruin civilization for a little bit.</v>

1084
00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.120
<v Speaker 4>But there might be solar systems out there would,</v>

1085
00:33:00.121 --> 00:33:01.140
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't take place.</v>

1086
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:05.700
<v Speaker 4>There could be a civilization that develops to 3 billion years ago.</v>

1087
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:05.941
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1088
00:33:05.941 --> 00:33:06.840
<v Speaker 4>we really don't know.</v>

1089
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:07.703
<v Speaker 4>We have no idea.</v>

1090
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:08.151
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1091
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:11.330
<v Speaker 5>the earth has had life or 700 million years and all scientists recognize,</v>

1092
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.740
<v Speaker 5>recognize that except people who think that the world was made 6,000 years ago.</v>

1093
00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.130
<v Speaker 5>And I have nothing to say to those folks except to say get over it.</v>

1094
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.970
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1095
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:20.980
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

1096
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.033
<v Speaker 5>I know I'm just,</v>

1097
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm an outrageous person.</v>

1098
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:24.480
<v Speaker 5>You are a little outdated.</v>

1099
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:24.951
<v Speaker 5>A little bit,</v>

1100
00:33:24.951 --> 00:33:25.880
<v Speaker 5>a little bit outrageous.</v>

1101
00:33:25.881 --> 00:33:26.714
<v Speaker 5>Haven't heard anything yet.</v>

1102
00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:27.771
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1103
00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm ready.</v>

1104
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm already strapped in,</v>

1105
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.021
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1106
00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:30.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1107
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.781
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>

1108
00:33:30.781 --> 00:33:33.840
<v Speaker 5>but if you really look at our,</v>

1109
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 5>our technological development,</v>

1110
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:35.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1111
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:40.280
<v Speaker 5>my grandmother was born in post reconstruction south in the late 18 hundreds her</v>

1112
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:42.560
<v Speaker 5>son worked on the lunar module,</v>

1113
00:33:42.561 --> 00:33:43.670
<v Speaker 5>put the first man on the moon.</v>

1114
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.800
<v Speaker 5>But by the time we landed on the moon in 1969 we were 15 years into having</v>

1115
00:33:48.801 --> 00:33:51.350
<v Speaker 5>classified antigravity propulsion devices.</v>

1116
00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:55.830
<v Speaker 4>The biggest mind fuck that I was trying to drop on people with time is between</v>

1117
00:33:55.831 --> 00:33:57.600
<v Speaker 4>the invention of the airplane.</v>

1118
00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.460
<v Speaker 4>It was less than 50 years.</v>

1119
00:33:59.461 --> 00:34:01.980
<v Speaker 4>It's someone used that airplane to drop a nuclear weapon.</v>

1120
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.050
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1121
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:03.800
<v Speaker 5>And see this is,</v>

1122
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.670
<v Speaker 5>this is pretty crazy.</v>

1123
00:34:04.671 --> 00:34:07.250
<v Speaker 5>It gets into the whole question I've had a lot of people ask me.</v>

1124
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:08.084
<v Speaker 5>We have a,</v>

1125
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.460
<v Speaker 5>if you go to our sites,</v>

1126
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:13.940
<v Speaker 5>serious disclosure.com there's a section that has all these top secret military</v>

1127
00:34:13.941 --> 00:34:14.774
<v Speaker 5>guys on it.</v>

1128
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 5>And part of it is that we,</v>

1129
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.730
<v Speaker 5>there's a whole grouping of them.</v>

1130
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:22.010
<v Speaker 5>Have a dozen of them or so who were at strategic air command facilities and</v>

1131
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:25.940
<v Speaker 5>nuclear weapons storage areas and processing areas and all this stuff.</v>

1132
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:30.350
<v Speaker 5>And every one of them were overflown by 80 spacecraft back in the forties</v>

1133
00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:34.160
<v Speaker 5>fifties sixties because they were very concerned about what we were doing</v>

1134
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:39.370
<v Speaker 5>because we were going from having these technologies to weaponizing them.</v>

1135
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:44.960
<v Speaker 5>And our technological development had gotten ahead of our social and spiritual</v>

1136
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:46.340
<v Speaker 5>development way ahead.</v>

1137
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:46.821
<v Speaker 5>And this,</v>

1138
00:34:46.821 --> 00:34:48.440
<v Speaker 5>this is an existential threat,</v>

1139
00:34:48.441 --> 00:34:49.131
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1140
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:50.240
<v Speaker 5>as an emergency doctor,</v>

1141
00:34:50.241 --> 00:34:50.720
<v Speaker 5>I used to have,</v>

1142
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1143
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.200
<v Speaker 5>crazy people come into the er and I'd have to commit them.</v>

1144
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:54.801
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1145
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:56.720
<v Speaker 5>it's dangerous to yourself or others.</v>

1146
00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:57.740
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1147
00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.670
<v Speaker 5>and what I've found is that if you just take a step back and look at humanity</v>

1148
00:35:01.671 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 5>through the eyes of extraterrestrial civilizations,</v>

1149
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.900
<v Speaker 5>we've become dangerous to ourselves,</v>

1150
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.460
<v Speaker 5>but we're also dangerous to others.</v>

1151
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:12.380
<v Speaker 5>And moreover we become a existential threat to the biosphere of the earth where</v>

1152
00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 5>we're killing the oceans,</v>

1153
00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:14.510
<v Speaker 5>the atmosphere and everything else.</v>

1154
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 5>All this is unnecessary.</v>

1155
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.050
<v Speaker 5>So the question is,</v>

1156
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.460
<v Speaker 5>the misanthropic sociopaths that are running the planet into the ground are</v>

1157
00:35:22.461 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 5>going to have to be stood down by the people getting behind disclosure,</v>

1158
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 5>getting behind the technologies and basically saying,</v>

1159
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.111
<v Speaker 5>we're not,</v>

1160
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:32.090
<v Speaker 5>we're fed up and we're not going to put up with this anymore.</v>

1161
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:33.110
<v Speaker 5>It's like the movie network.</v>

1162
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:34.130
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1163
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 5>and we're mad as hell and I think people,</v>

1164
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:37.890
<v Speaker 5>and it isn't about doing anything violent,</v>

1165
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 5>it's</v>

1166
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 2>about saying we need to just move forward because Washington isn't going to do</v>

1167
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:42.390
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1168
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.230
<v Speaker 2>My uncle's company,</v>

1169
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Northrop Grumman isn't Lockheed Martin isn't going to do it.</v>

1170
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 2>It's you and me and the other people out there who get the situation we're in</v>

1171
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:50.910
<v Speaker 2>and wanting to fix it.</v>

1172
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.400
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that might have also got their attention was a operation</v>

1173
00:35:54.401 --> 00:35:55.530
<v Speaker 2>starfish prime.</v>

1174
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.460
<v Speaker 2>You aware of that from 1962 where they launched a nuclear bomb in a space,</v>

1175
00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.320
<v Speaker 2>blew up a nuclear bomb and space.</v>

1176
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1177
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 2>actually one of our witnesses,</v>

1178
00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Colonel Diedricksen,</v>

1179
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.860
<v Speaker 6>was with the atomic energy commission,</v>

1180
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:13.660
<v Speaker 6>which became the doe and he was a air force colonel and his responsibility was</v>

1181
00:36:13.661 --> 00:36:14.890
<v Speaker 6>overall the nuclear facilities.</v>

1182
00:36:14.891 --> 00:36:19.750
<v Speaker 6>But he knew of a program where we were going to lob a thermonuclear weapon and</v>

1183
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.930
<v Speaker 6>detonate it on the moon and when that,</v>

1184
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:22.391
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1185
00:36:22.391 --> 00:36:25.930
<v Speaker 6>And they actually worked on this and when it went XO atmospheric,</v>

1186
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.510
<v Speaker 6>when it left our atmosphere and,</v>

1187
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.500
<v Speaker 6>and it was intercepted by an expert trestle vehicle and basically the</v>

1188
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:35.340
<v Speaker 6>materialized was taken out and he knew had personal knowledge of this so,</v>

1189
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:37.390
<v Speaker 6>so they can actually tried to do this.</v>

1190
00:36:37.391 --> 00:36:39.910
<v Speaker 6>They actually launched it and it was on its way to the moon.</v>

1191
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.421
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1192
00:36:40.421 --> 00:36:41.254
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

1201
00:36:53.171 --> 00:36:57.290
<v Speaker 6>and there's a term at the naval research labs and CIA for,</v>

1202
00:36:57.291 --> 00:36:58.870
<v Speaker 6>for this whole area of science.</v>

1203
00:36:58.871 --> 00:37:00.700
<v Speaker 6>And it's called W s f.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's not a radio station by the way.</v>

1206
00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.980
<v Speaker 6>It stands for weird science and fricking magic.</v>

1207
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:07.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they call it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They need to be stopped.</v>

1215
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.030
<v Speaker 2>And they have that access to technology and they're using the word frickin that</v>

1216
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:16.930
<v Speaker 2>you can be trusted them.</v>

1225
00:37:26.081 --> 00:37:27.910
<v Speaker 2>compartmentalized sort of a system.</v>

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:08.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1297
00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:08.630

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:09.110
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1299
00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:09.501
<v Speaker 2>when he,</v>

1300
00:39:09.501 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 2>this admiral looked at</v>

1301
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 6>this document and it's gonna blow people's mind when they see this,</v>

1302
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.180
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1303
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:19.840
<v Speaker 6>it's a national reconnaissance office document in our OE does all the top secret</v>

1304
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.660
<v Speaker 6>spy satellites and over their headquarters,</v>

1305
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:24.010
<v Speaker 6>it says we own the night</v>

1306
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.740
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1307
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:26.821
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1308
00:39:26.821 --> 00:39:27.690
<v Speaker 2>that's their motto.</v>

1309
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.560
<v Speaker 2>We own the night.</v>

1310
00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.473
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty,</v>

1311
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:30.071
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1312
00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:30.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty spooky.</v>

1313
00:39:30.961 --> 00:39:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1314
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:32.131

1316
00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:34.110
<v Speaker 2>these are the kind of dudes I work with all the time.</v>

1317
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.250
<v Speaker 2>What happened is that the one of these compartments,</v>

1318
00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:39.080
<v Speaker 2>it has a whole district</v>

1319
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.721
<v Speaker 6>Bhushan lists,</v>

1320
00:39:39.721 --> 00:39:40.790
<v Speaker 6>cosmic ops,</v>

1321
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.050
<v Speaker 6>magic ops,</v>

1322
00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:42.771
<v Speaker 6>Dadadadada,</v>

1323
00:39:42.771 --> 00:39:43.050
<v Speaker 6>Dah,</v>

1324
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:43.610
<v Speaker 6>Dah,</v>

1325
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:44.180
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1326
00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:44.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1327
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.553
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1328
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.510
<v Speaker 6>all kinds of insights about 20 of them.</v>

1329
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.790
<v Speaker 6>And this is a document that was not declassified,</v>

1330
00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:54.410
<v Speaker 6>that was given to me by a source that I won't talk about.</v>

1331
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.830
<v Speaker 6>And this admiral recognize one of those compartments.</v>

1332
00:39:57.831 --> 00:40:02.260
<v Speaker 6>So he contacted them and on the other end of the phone they said,</v>

1333
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:02.631
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

1334
00:40:02.631 --> 00:40:03.090
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1336
00:40:04.641 --> 00:40:04.971
<v Speaker 6>And they said,</v>

1337
00:40:04.971 --> 00:40:05.151
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

1338

1340
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.311
<v Speaker 6>And he says,</v>

1341
00:40:07.311 --> 00:40:07.431
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1342

1344
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:13.071
<v Speaker 6>And they said,</v>

1345
00:40:13.071 --> 00:40:13.490
<v Speaker 6>sir,</v>

1346

1347
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:16.100
<v Speaker 6>You don't have a need to know.</v>

1348
00:40:16.101 --> 00:40:16.401
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

1349
00:40:16.401 --> 00:40:19.910
<v Speaker 6>what do you mean I'm the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</v>

1350
00:40:19.911 --> 00:40:21.320
<v Speaker 6>How can I not have a need to know?</v>

1351
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.401
<v Speaker 6>And they said,</v>

1352
00:40:22.401 --> 00:40:22.641
<v Speaker 6>sir,</v>

1353
00:40:22.641 --> 00:40:24.350

1354
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.820
<v Speaker 6>Blocked him.</v>

1355
00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.660
<v Speaker 2>So who the fuck knows who's who's like how many people are there?</v>

1356
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:30.020
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1357
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.250
<v Speaker 2>have you determined that the,</v>

1358
00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:31.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1359
00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.160
<v Speaker 6>I have,</v>

1360
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:32.550
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1361
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:33.870
<v Speaker 6>I know some of the members of,</v>

1362
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 6>of the,</v>

1363
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:34.721
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

1364
00:40:34.721 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 6>there's a committee and it's transnational.</v>

1365
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:38.960
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1366
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.300
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1367
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:44.080
<v Speaker 6>it started out much smaller and less opaque back in the forties when Truman was</v>

1368
00:40:44.081 --> 00:40:45.220
<v Speaker 6>around have a name.</v>

1369
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.990
<v Speaker 6>It did have the name majestic.</v>

1370
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:47.471
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1371
00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:48.520
<v Speaker 6>and that is not a myth.</v>

1372
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.383
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1373
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.280
<v Speaker 6>and so even just 12,</v>

1374
00:40:51.281 --> 00:40:51.521
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1375
00:40:51.521 --> 00:40:52.031
<v Speaker 6>Is that what it was?</v>

1376
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:52.300
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1377
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:52.631
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

1378
00:40:52.631 --> 00:40:52.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1379
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:53.061
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1380
00:40:53.061 --> 00:40:55.210
<v Speaker 6>the document as of the nineties that I got,</v>

1381
00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.940
<v Speaker 6>it's still had magic Maj I see on it.</v>

1382
00:40:58.690 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1383
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.240
<v Speaker 6>and so a lot of these programs,</v>

1384
00:41:01.241 --> 00:41:01.481
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1385
00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:04.330
<v Speaker 6>they've gone through multiple generations of,</v>

1386
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:05.350
<v Speaker 6>of evolution.</v>

1387
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.560
<v Speaker 6>And now I understand it's a committee of two or 300 folks,</v>

1388
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:09.490
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1389
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:10.180
<v Speaker 6>who are,</v>

1390
00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:10.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1391
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:11.223
<v Speaker 6>corporate,</v>

1392
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.290
<v Speaker 6>very deep kind of shadow government operations.</v>

1393
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:17.680
<v Speaker 6>And the mistake the public makes is that they think that just because you're the</v>

1394
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:20.980
<v Speaker 6>president or the CIA director or member of the Senate intelligence committee,</v>

1395
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.450
<v Speaker 6>you're going to have access to those.</v>

1396
00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:27.370
<v Speaker 6>And that's because they do not understand what Rumsfeld said is true on the day</v>

1397
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 6>before nine 11.</v>

1398
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 6>And there's going to be in the film where he said there's two point $3 trillion,</v>

1399
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 6>basically missing that we can</v>

1400
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 5>account for how the Department of Defense budget over the last few years,</v>

1401
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 5>two point 3 trillion,</v>

1402
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.733
<v Speaker 5>not billion.</v>

1403
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.780
<v Speaker 5>Now we found out,</v>

1404
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1405
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.450
<v Speaker 5>and I discovered this in the early nineties,</v>

1406
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:47.240
<v Speaker 5>that there's somewhere between a hundred and 200 billion a year,</v>

1407
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.710
<v Speaker 5>basically just being stolen,</v>

1408
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.480
<v Speaker 5>going into these illegal projects.</v>

1409
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.190
<v Speaker 5>And so when she had an,</v>

1410
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:52.971
<v Speaker 5>I looked at this,</v>

1411
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:53.804
<v Speaker 5>this attorney,</v>

1412
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.141
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1413
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:54.710
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1414
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:58.640
<v Speaker 5>if all these people who have a need to know in the constitutional chain of</v>

1415
00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:01.850
<v Speaker 5>command or being lied to to see and what have you,</v>

1416
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to declare all those projects,</v>

1417
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.690
<v Speaker 5>rogue op,</v>

1418
00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:07.040
<v Speaker 5>priori illegal.</v>

1419
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:09.560
<v Speaker 5>Therefore anyone who signed a security,</v>

1420
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:10.394
<v Speaker 5>as for them,</v>

1421
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to unilaterally announced that they're released from them.</v>

1422
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.750
<v Speaker 5>So all of you listening,</v>

1423
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 5>if you've been in any of these projects with Lockheed,</v>

1424
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.430
<v Speaker 5>Northrup sic,</v>

1425
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 5>the CIA,</v>

1426
00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.220
<v Speaker 5>you do not have to go by the secrecy because if they are denying access to the</v>

1427
00:42:25.221 --> 00:42:27.530
<v Speaker 5>people who are in the constitutional chain of command,</v>

1428
00:42:27.531 --> 00:42:29.720
<v Speaker 5>which I can prove they have in a court of law,</v>

1429
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.040
<v Speaker 5>those projects are rogue and therefore those security owes have no</v>

1430
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 5>enforceability.</v>

1431
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.541
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1432
00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 5>whether or not you have the courage to come forward is another question,</v>

1433
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 5>but what,</v>

1434
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:44.930
<v Speaker 5>what I was very glad to be able to do between the early nineties and 2001 with</v>

1435
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:49.220
<v Speaker 5>the disclosure project is to pull together the people who did have the courage</v>

1436
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.480
<v Speaker 5>and they're still coming forward.</v>

1437
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.960
<v Speaker 5>When we have people contact me all the time who are in these projects,</v>

1438
00:42:53.961 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 5>who give us information intelligence,</v>

1439
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.043
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1440
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.150
<v Speaker 5>and it's really a citizen's effort.</v>

1441
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:01.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've never been in the government in my entire life,</v>

1442
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.140
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

1443
00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 5>I think this is what you have an idea and if the idea to picks up steam and</v>

1444
00:43:06.771 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 5>people see the reason for it.</v>

1445
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.610
<v Speaker 5>But the other thing is to do it in a,</v>

1446
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:12.740
<v Speaker 5>in a way where people feel supported.</v>

1447
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:15.890
<v Speaker 5>And that's why we did this in a way where there were dozens.</v>

1448
00:43:15.891 --> 00:43:16.850
<v Speaker 5>It came out at once.</v>

1449
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1450
00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 5>I think in the initial batch of people came forward,</v>

1451
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:21.880
<v Speaker 5>it was about 71</v>

1452
00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.020
<v Speaker 4>of the things I always want to get into people's heads when they start talking</v>

1453
00:43:26.021 --> 00:43:30.670
<v Speaker 4>about the government or the people in charge or you know,</v>

1454
00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.930
<v Speaker 4>those in the know,</v>

1455
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.740
<v Speaker 4>the idea that they're exchanging information is,</v>

1456
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.050
<v Speaker 4>is been proven false time and time again.</v>

1457
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:39.370
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

1458
00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.550
<v Speaker 4>what's really blown me away lately is finding out that,</v>

1459
00:43:42.551 --> 00:43:44.200
<v Speaker 4>especially in this,</v>

1460
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.270
<v Speaker 4>suppose that patriotic time of war,</v>

1461
00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.620
<v Speaker 4>we have government factions that don't like other government factions.</v>

1462
00:43:50.621 --> 00:43:51.460
<v Speaker 4>It's always been that way.</v>

1463
00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:56.550
<v Speaker 4>I was blown away when Petraeus was outed by the FBI.</v>

1464
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:57.161
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

1465
00:43:57.161 --> 00:43:58.750
<v Speaker 4>are you fucking crazy?</v>

1466
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.520
<v Speaker 4>That is nuts.</v>

1467
00:44:00.521 --> 00:44:00.820
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

1468
00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.820
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about the head of the CIA and the FBI spying on him over in a</v>

1469
00:44:07.181 --> 00:44:11.860
<v Speaker 4>fair and you're going to bring down this beloved national hero,</v>

1470
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:12.993
<v Speaker 4>stupid,</v>

1471
00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.620
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably stupid,</v>

1472
00:44:14.621 --> 00:44:19.621
<v Speaker 4>but also unbelievably revealing about how partitioned our government truly is</v>

1473
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:27.120
<v Speaker 4>and how difficult it would be to get access to some critical information if this</v>

1474
00:44:28.451 --> 00:44:32.580
<v Speaker 4>information is in any way deemed too sensitive</v>

1475
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:37.580
<v Speaker 2>or too controversial or two to whatever to paradigm shifting for average eyes.</v>

1476
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.181
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1477
00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:40.620
<v Speaker 2>let's make this very simple.</v>

1478
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 2>If you acknowledge that the UFOS are there and they're real,</v>

1479
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1480
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.780
<v Speaker 2>and anyone with an Iq over mud,</v>

1481
00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 2>it's going to ask the question,</v>

1482
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 2>then how did they get here?</v>

1483
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 2>If you asked that question,</v>

1484
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.180
<v Speaker 2>we have the answers for it and if the public knows that,</v>

1485
00:44:57.181 --> 00:44:59.280
<v Speaker 2>then they know we don't need Exxon mobile.</v>

1486
00:44:59.281 --> 00:45:00.270
<v Speaker 2>We don't need oil,</v>

1487
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:00.781
<v Speaker 2>gas,</v>

1488
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 2>coal,</v>

1489
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.450
<v Speaker 2>nuclear power or centralized utility grid.</v>

1490
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 2>That's assuming though that most people believe that the Ufos are real because I</v>

1491
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.760
<v Speaker 2>know 50 to 60% do now.</v>

1492
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:10.590
<v Speaker 2>I think they say that.</v>

1493
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 2>I think they say,</v>

1494
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.440
<v Speaker 2>but I think the most of the time we'll look for terrestrial explanations.</v>

1495
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Most rational people,</v>

1496
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.091
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

1497
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:19.670
<v Speaker 2>actually what I'm now this,</v>

1498
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.880
<v Speaker 2>there was just a poll that came out a month ago and there's actually 43% of the</v>

1499
00:45:23.881 --> 00:45:28.470
<v Speaker 2>public believe that extra terrestrial life has been on the planet and it's here</v>

1500
00:45:28.471 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1501
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 2>51% believed that the earth is less than 10,000 years old.</v>

1502
00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Just don't have that yet.</v>

1503
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Well there,</v>

1504
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.060
<v Speaker 2>well I don't know if it's that high.</v>

1505
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I heard it was about a quarter of the population.</v>

1506
00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.480
<v Speaker 2>So Gallup poll I think 2010 2010 they got 51% of the flat Earth Society still</v>

1507
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 2>has a lot of members I guess.</v>

1508
00:45:49.231 --> 00:45:49.891
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1509
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:50.130
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1510
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:50.610
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>

1511
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:54.420
<v Speaker 2>here's the bigger issue is that if you bring this information out,</v>

1512
00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:54.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1513
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 2>and let's,</v>

1514
00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:00.420
<v Speaker 2>let's say that one of the objectives of what I'm working on now,</v>

1515
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.500
<v Speaker 2>let me just clear that up.</v>

1516
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:02.910
<v Speaker 2>46% okay.</v>

1517
00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Creationist view of human origins 40 46 well,</v>

1518
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.560
<v Speaker 2>but of the creationist view,</v>

1519
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.590
<v Speaker 2>not all those people think that world is 10,000 years old and I think that</v>

1520
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:12.480
<v Speaker 2>number is only about 15 years though.</v>

1521
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:13.620
<v Speaker 2>They're saying 10,000 years.</v>

1522
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 2>This is what in this study,</v>

1523
00:46:14.611 --> 00:46:15.660
<v Speaker 2>the Gal study,</v>

1524
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:16.640
<v Speaker 2>these very specifically,</v>

1525
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.810
<v Speaker 2>46% of Americans believe the creations for you,</v>

1526
00:46:18.811 --> 00:46:23.010
<v Speaker 2>that God created humans in their present form at a time within the last 10,000</v>

1527
00:46:23.011 --> 00:46:23.220
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1528
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:23.791
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1529
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:25.200
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna make me move to Norway.</v>

1530
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1531
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.950
<v Speaker 2>that was a good choice to count is right there and they're bad ass.</v>

1532
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Just to throw some salt on your idea that you want me to look,</v>

1533
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.441
<v Speaker 2>I told you that I'm,</v>

1534
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:37.651
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1535
00:46:37.651 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of the UFO experience.</v>

1536
00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:39.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1537
00:46:39.661 --> 00:46:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I really want it to be real,</v>

1538
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:46.131
<v Speaker 2>but just because 47% of whatever the fuck think 46% think that the earth is less</v>

1539
00:46:46.581 --> 00:46:46.671
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

1540
00:46:46.671 --> 00:46:47.850
<v Speaker 2>or you're writing and,</v>

1541
00:46:47.851 --> 00:46:48.211
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1542
00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:50.670
<v Speaker 2>the evidence speaks for itself and I told someone once,</v>

1543
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.960
<v Speaker 2>but does it,</v>

1544
00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.190
<v Speaker 2>what percentage?</v>

1545
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1546
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:53.881
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1547
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:54.900
<v Speaker 2>let's just be honest.</v>

1548
00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

1549
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.573
<v Speaker 2>or rather,</v>

1550
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 2>let's open this.</v>

1551
00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:00.810
<v Speaker 2>What percentage of Ufo sightings are real,</v>

1552
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:01.231
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1553
00:47:01.231 --> 00:47:01.500
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1554
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:06.300
<v Speaker 2>what percentage are totally made up and what percentage are a confusion.</v>

1555
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:08.610
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the metric we're using.</v>

1556
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.780
<v Speaker 2>We're going by,</v>

1557
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:10.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1558
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 2>government release documents were going by people who are insiders who have</v>

1559
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 2>actually handled extra trust.</v>

1560
00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:16.443
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1561
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.450
<v Speaker 2>So when you're talking about experiences,</v>

1562
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.840
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about experiences from people who are 100% credible.</v>

1563
00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.010
<v Speaker 2>The bulletproof,</v>

1564
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:24.571
<v Speaker 2>only that,</v>

1565
00:47:24.571 --> 00:47:25.720
<v Speaker 2>but if you have the,</v>

1566
00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.170
<v Speaker 2>the former minister defense,</v>

1567
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:30.080
<v Speaker 2>a candidate say that he checked out with a u</v>

1568
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 5>s air force general that in fact there was an accident that happened in New</v>

1569
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.200
<v Speaker 5>Mexico in 1947 which people call Roswell.</v>

1570
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.830
<v Speaker 5>And that what Phillip Corso Colonel Course of wrote in his book the day after co</v>

1571
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:44.590
<v Speaker 5>Roscoe was substantially correct.</v>

1572
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:45.151
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1573
00:47:45.151 --> 00:47:45.490
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1574
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:45.731
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1575
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 5>and this is,</v>

1576
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:46.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1577
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 5>the honorable Paul Hellyer and he and I did a press conference in Toronto a</v>

1578
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:51.723
<v Speaker 5>couple of years ago and,</v>

1579
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:51.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1580
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.650
<v Speaker 5>he is completely verified this.</v>

1581
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:54.161
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

1582
00:47:54.161 --> 00:47:54.891
<v Speaker 5>the question is,</v>

1583
00:47:54.891 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 5>and then the same thing happened with five star Admiral Lord Heal Norton.</v>

1584
00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean here he was the minister of defense and he found out after the fact that</v>

1585
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:04.960
<v Speaker 5>in fact an extra trust will vehicle had landed at the bent waters,</v>

1586
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1587
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 5>earlier for space at Rendlesham forest in England.</v>

1588
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:13.570
<v Speaker 5>And we have multiple disclosure project witnesses who were there.</v>

1589
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:17.050
<v Speaker 5>And it came out recently that uh,</v>

1590
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.920
<v Speaker 5>the Ministry of Defense in Great Britain released the documents on that where</v>

1591
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:23.980
<v Speaker 5>they had physical evidence that this thing actually did land,</v>

1592
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.571
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1593
00:48:24.571 --> 00:48:26.050
<v Speaker 5>and left physical traces,</v>

1594
00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:27.070
<v Speaker 5>et cetera and so on.</v>

1595
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:28.330
<v Speaker 5>So I tell people,</v>

1596
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1597
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:29.320
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1598
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.490
<v Speaker 5>usually in the New York Times say,</v>

1599
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:30.641
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1600
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:33.490
<v Speaker 5>we need two or three corroborating witnesses to something,</v>

1601
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 5>particularly in three,</v>

1602
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:36.610
<v Speaker 5>if it's a very controversial story.</v>

1603
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:37.121
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1604
00:48:37.121 --> 00:48:37.301
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1605
00:48:37.301 --> 00:48:40.330
<v Speaker 5>but the disclosure project has hundreds of these sort of people,</v>

1606
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 5>thousands of cases like this.</v>

1607
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:44.730
<v Speaker 5>And we're not talking about just people seeing something in the sky.</v>

1608
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 5>This is per event.</v>

1609
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.500
<v Speaker 5>They don't mean like,</v>

1610
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:47.810
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1611
00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:48.341
<v Speaker 5>but we have,</v>

1612
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 5>we have an,</v>

1613
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:49.780
<v Speaker 5>we have event,</v>

1614
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 5>we have multiple ones for this landing.</v>

1615
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:52.480
<v Speaker 5>It knows from Fort,</v>

1616
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.820
<v Speaker 5>we have multiple ones from the might not North Dakota.</v>

1617
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.420
<v Speaker 5>It had like how many do you have a where there'll be some of them,</v>

1618
00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:58.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1619
00:48:58.811 --> 00:48:59.411
<v Speaker 5>four or five,</v>

1620
00:48:59.411 --> 00:49:00.890
<v Speaker 5>six at one event.</v>

1621
00:49:00.891 --> 00:49:03.100
<v Speaker 5>And they are very credible military people.</v>

1622
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.740
<v Speaker 5>And so why isn't,</v>

1623
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:05.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1624
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:05.851
<v Speaker 5>why isn't the,</v>

1625
00:49:05.851 --> 00:49:06.041
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1626
00:49:06.041 --> 00:49:08.140
<v Speaker 5>the lame stream news,</v>

1627
00:49:08.141 --> 00:49:10.900
<v Speaker 5>the mainstream news reporting this,</v>

1628
00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:15.580
<v Speaker 5>if you put together this amount of information and then the question becomes how</v>

1629
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:19.960
<v Speaker 5>free is our media and how free is our market and how free is our country?</v>

1630
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.810
<v Speaker 5>Because I think there's more corruption than people can imagine.</v>

1631
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:23.561
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1632
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:25.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a conspiracy theory person.</v>

1633
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:26.201
<v Speaker 5>I deal,</v>

1634
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>

1635
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.430
<v Speaker 5>Yes you are.</v>

1636
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.551
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1637
00:49:27.551 --> 00:49:28.211
<v Speaker 5>I'm not there.</v>

1638
00:49:28.211 --> 00:49:28.750
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1639
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1640
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:29.290
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1641
00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:29.681
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

1642
00:49:29.681 --> 00:49:30.431
<v Speaker 5>but just be honest,</v>

1643
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:31.970
<v Speaker 5>I just don't like the [inaudible]</v>

1644
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 5>island about Ufo conspiracy.</v>

1645
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.360
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

1646
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.830
<v Speaker 5>it was the mafia conspiracy of a criminal enterprise.</v>

1647
00:49:38.831 --> 00:49:39.101
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1648
00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:39.970
<v Speaker 5>But it's not a theory,</v>

1649
00:49:39.971 --> 00:49:40.804
<v Speaker 5>it's a fact.</v>

1650
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.780
<v Speaker 5>So there's a big difference between,</v>

1651
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:44.990
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1652
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:48.490
<v Speaker 5>there obviously you're talking about a Ufo conspiracy and energy conspiracy.</v>

1653
00:49:48.491 --> 00:49:51.280
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about suppressing information.</v>

1654
00:49:51.281 --> 00:49:53.360
<v Speaker 5>He pulled conspire and their own interests.</v>

1655
00:49:53.361 --> 00:49:54.250
<v Speaker 5>And if you're in Canada,</v>

1656
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:54.971
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1657
00:49:54.971 --> 00:49:56.770
<v Speaker 5>I know you don't like conspiracy theorist,</v>

1658
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 5>but okay.</v>

1659
00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:58.121
<v Speaker 5>When no,</v>

1660
00:49:58.121 --> 00:49:59.840
<v Speaker 5>I just don't see the term is used.</v>

1661
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:01.660
<v Speaker 5>I think it's misused,</v>

1662
00:50:01.661 --> 00:50:02.494
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

1663
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.311
<v Speaker 5>And I think that,</v>

1664
00:50:03.311 --> 00:50:03.551
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1665
00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:04.330
<v Speaker 5>just waited.</v>

1666
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:04.781
<v Speaker 5>It's loaded.</v>

1667
00:50:04.781 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 5>It's a loaded thing.</v>

1668
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:06.791
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

1669
00:50:06.791 --> 00:50:07.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1670
00:50:07.031 --> 00:50:08.260
<v Speaker 5>it's like when Larry King asked me,</v>

1671
00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:09.130
<v Speaker 5>do you believe I said,</v>

1672
00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:09.311
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1673
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:09.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1674
00:50:09.581 --> 00:50:11.950
<v Speaker 5>I believe in a lot of things that you can't see improve.</v>

1675
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.950
<v Speaker 5>But if I have 4,000 cases where these things have landed,</v>

1676
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 5>if I have hundreds of photographs and videotapes,</v>

1677
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:20.740
<v Speaker 5>if I have dozens of top secret guys who can corroborate this,</v>

1678
00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.100
<v Speaker 5>why is that a belief?</v>

1679
00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:22.261
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1680
00:50:22.261 --> 00:50:23.200
<v Speaker 5>you believe in God,</v>

1681
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:24.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1682
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.420
<v Speaker 5>and some other things,</v>

1683
00:50:25.421 --> 00:50:25.961
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

1684
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 5>this is not a matter of belief.</v>

1685
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.030
<v Speaker 5>Most people believe that.</v>

1686
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:33.110
<v Speaker 5>I'll quote Neil degrasse Tyson who says that eyewitness testimony is the least</v>

1687
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:35.250
<v Speaker 5>reliable of all pieces of evidence.</v>

1688
00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 5>It's right.</v>

1689
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1690
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.960
<v Speaker 5>but what physical evidence do you have that goes along with eye witness</v>

1691
00:50:40.961 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 5>testimony that you believe is the most compelling?</v>

1692
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:44.780
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1693
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 5>I think the most compelling that I've ever,</v>

1694
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.983
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1695
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:52.350
<v Speaker 6>it's something we're working on right now.</v>

1696
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.640
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1697
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.260
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1698
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.170
<v Speaker 6>it remains to be seen if it's going to be what we think it is.</v>

1699
00:50:58.171 --> 00:50:59.730
<v Speaker 6>And we're going to know fairly soon,</v>

1700
00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.890
<v Speaker 6>and I don't want to get ahead of myself,</v>

1701
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:06.780
<v Speaker 6>but I was introduced to an institute that acquired,</v>

1702
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:07.440
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1703
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.850
<v Speaker 6>a small humanoid being about six inches in length.</v>

1704
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:13.683
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1705
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.620
<v Speaker 5>this is in the trailer for serious,</v>

1706
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:16.341
<v Speaker 5>I've seen this,</v>

1707
00:51:16.341 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 5>this little skeleton that's x rayed and cat scanned and we're now doing the</v>

1708
00:51:20.691 --> 00:51:24.200
<v Speaker 5>genetic workup at the top university in the world that's doing this,</v>

1709
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.660
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1710
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:24.890
<v Speaker 5>hope.</v>

1711
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:25.431
<v Speaker 5>Pull that up,</v>

1712
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:25.770
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1713
00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:29.390
<v Speaker 5>because it's a very freaky people on Ustream and Vimeo can see this.</v>

1714
00:51:29.391 --> 00:51:29.780
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1715
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 5>we'll just,</v>

1716
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.441
<v Speaker 5>we'll,</v>

1717
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:30.950
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

1718
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:33.740
<v Speaker 5>let's just play the entire trailer for you and,</v>

1719
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1720
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.390
<v Speaker 5>get people excited about this movie.</v>

1721
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.961
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1722
00:51:35.961 --> 00:51:37.130
<v Speaker 5>who found this,</v>

1723
00:51:37.131 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1724
00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:40.130
<v Speaker 5>this alien being and where did they acquire this thing?</v>

1725
00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:41.690
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

1726
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:41.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1727
00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:43.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm not at liberty to,</v>

1728
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm still waiting to see if this person,</v>

1729
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:45.801
<v Speaker 5>but it's an as,</v>

1730
00:51:45.801 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 5>it might be Horse Shit,</v>

1731
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.120
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1732
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 5>It's a possibility.</v>

1733
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:49.623
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1734
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:50.480
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1735
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.250
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1736
00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:54.920
<v Speaker 5>All I'm saying is that it isn't organic beam.</v>

1737
00:51:55.010 --> 00:52:00.010
<v Speaker 5>It is an organic paid is the cat scan shows the lungs on the inside it has 10</v>

1738
00:52:00.021 --> 00:52:01.310
<v Speaker 5>ribs and not 12.</v>

1739
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1740
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:07.180
<v Speaker 5>we have now proven from bone density that it's at least several years old and</v>

1741
00:52:07.911 --> 00:52:09.080
<v Speaker 5>it's only six inches long.</v>

1742
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:10.250
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1743
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:11.440
<v Speaker 5>so the,</v>

1744
00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:11.710
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1745
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:12.020
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1746
00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.030
<v Speaker 5>the tiny approved that from bone density.</v>

1747
00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:17.570
<v Speaker 5>That's medically we look at the epiphyseal plates and the cow much calcium in</v>

1748
00:52:17.571 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 5>other words.</v>

1749
00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:18.310
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1750
00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:21.440
<v Speaker 5>But isn't it why you're dealing with a completely alien species?</v>

1751
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:21.621
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1752
00:52:21.621 --> 00:52:21.741
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1753
00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:21.861
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1754
00:52:21.861 --> 00:52:23.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying if you were to go back,</v>

1755
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to assume that it's not easy,</v>

1756
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 5>then you look at it,</v>

1757
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:27.531
<v Speaker 5>what would this be?</v>

1758
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:28.364
<v Speaker 5>If it were human?</v>

1759
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:28.961
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're saying.</v>

1760
00:52:28.961 --> 00:52:29.071
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1761
00:52:29.071 --> 00:52:31.180
<v Speaker 5>So you have to go through an algorithm of an,</v>

1762
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:36.200
<v Speaker 5>and it's a diagnosis of exclusion we could say in medicine because if it's not a</v>

1763
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:37.970
<v Speaker 5>miscarried or aborted fetus,</v>

1764
00:52:37.971 --> 00:52:40.850
<v Speaker 5>which is the size of what this would be about 22 weeks,</v>

1765
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:41.900
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1766
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.490
<v Speaker 5>if it's not any known primate,</v>

1767
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:44.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1768
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:47.570
<v Speaker 5>it's not a fossil cause it has organic material in DNA material.</v>

1769
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.850
<v Speaker 5>We've already extracted,</v>

1770
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:49.680
<v Speaker 5>we clip the,</v>

1771
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1772
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.021
<v Speaker 5>one of the ribs,</v>

1773
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:55.310
<v Speaker 5>two of the ribs and I have gotten to DNA material out of the rib of internal</v>

1774
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:56.203
<v Speaker 5>Miro.</v>

1775
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 5>And so this is being processed right now as we speak,</v>

1776
00:52:58.701 --> 00:52:59.200
<v Speaker 5>literally.</v>

1777
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.350
<v Speaker 5>So if it was a human,</v>

1778
00:53:00.351 --> 00:53:01.700
<v Speaker 5>it would be several years old.</v>

1779
00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:03.410
<v Speaker 5>So that proves that it's not a human.</v>

1780
00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1781
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:04.903
<v Speaker 5>there is no,</v>

1782
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:10.630
<v Speaker 5>there's no form of dwarfism or any other genetic anomaly known in the</v>

1783
00:53:11.691 --> 00:53:12.524
<v Speaker 5>literature,</v>

1784
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.101
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1785
00:53:13.101 --> 00:53:18.020
<v Speaker 5>according to the world's expert in this area that would explain something of</v>

1786
00:53:18.021 --> 00:53:21.590
<v Speaker 5>this age that it's this and also that has these abnormalities.</v>

1787
00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.580
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the skull,</v>

1788
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:23.750
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the,</v>

1789
00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.440
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1790
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.600
<v Speaker 5>the fact that has ribs,</v>

1791
00:53:25.601 --> 00:53:27.600
<v Speaker 5>there are new genetic syndromes where you have 10 ribs.</v>

1792
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 5>If you see this thing in person,</v>

1793
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.740
<v Speaker 5>I was the third person to hold it and handle it.</v>

1794
00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:32.600
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1795
00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.361
<v Speaker 5>and I did the,</v>

1796
00:53:33.361 --> 00:53:34.740
<v Speaker 5>I didn't say autopsy on it,</v>

1797
00:53:34.741 --> 00:53:35.480
<v Speaker 5>but I did the,</v>

1798
00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.270
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1799
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:37.050
<v Speaker 5>the tests on it.</v>

1800
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.710
<v Speaker 5>And how long had it been dead for you?</v>

1801
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:39.850
<v Speaker 5>Had no idea that,</v>

1802
00:53:39.851 --> 00:53:41.900
<v Speaker 5>that we didn't get enough material from,</v>

1803
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:44.010
<v Speaker 5>we didn't want to damage this little thing too much.</v>

1804
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:48.090
<v Speaker 5>So the carbon dating on it will be the next step.</v>

1805
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 5>We wanted to be sure we had enough genetic material and if we had to go back and</v>

1806
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:54.600
<v Speaker 5>we didn't want to destroy,</v>

1807
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1808
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:56.221
<v Speaker 5>in any way.</v>

1809
00:53:56.221 --> 00:53:56.680
<v Speaker 5>So we're,</v>

1810
00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.420
<v Speaker 5>we're working a scientific algorithm on there.</v>

1811
00:53:58.421 --> 00:53:59.520
<v Speaker 5>This is actually the people,</v>

1812
00:53:59.521 --> 00:54:03.270
<v Speaker 5>the public who were supporting the film serious or the reason why we were able</v>

1813
00:54:03.271 --> 00:54:04.260
<v Speaker 5>to do all these studies.</v>

1814
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.160
<v Speaker 5>How is this,</v>

1815
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:05.520
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1816
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.720
<v Speaker 5>how this thing preserved,</v>

1817
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:07.951
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1818
00:54:07.951 --> 00:54:09.360
<v Speaker 5>but it was found in a very,</v>

1819
00:54:09.361 --> 00:54:11.250
<v Speaker 5>very dry desert area.</v>

1820
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:12.323
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1821
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:13.920
<v Speaker 5>and it's just very desiccated.</v>

1822
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 5>It's very dry it out.</v>

1823
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1824
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1825
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:19.350
<v Speaker 5>it was not in any sort of preservative.</v>

1826
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.273
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1827
00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 5>and now it died a traumatic death.</v>

1828
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.130
<v Speaker 5>We know that behind the right mastoid air cells behind your ear here,</v>

1829
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:31.080
<v Speaker 5>that skull is crashed in and it's a little asymmetrical on the jaw.</v>

1830
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:34.530
<v Speaker 5>And the right humerus is fractured through and through.</v>

1831
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:35.640
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1832
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.390
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1833
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.661
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1834
00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:38.910
<v Speaker 5>and it happened at Mortimer shortly.</v>

1835
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:43.320
<v Speaker 5>Purpose more than we think it was the fatal blow to this particular being.</v>

1836
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:43.861
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1837
00:54:43.861 --> 00:54:44.850
<v Speaker 5>what is this beam?</v>

1838
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.360
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1839
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.193
<v Speaker 5>when you look at it,</v>

1840
00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:46.530
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1841
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.990
<v Speaker 5>almost every scientist that has seen it goes,</v>

1842
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.410
<v Speaker 5>it looks like an EDT.</v>

1843
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1844
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:52.290
<v Speaker 5>but we don't know.</v>

1845
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:54.440
<v Speaker 5>All I'm going to say is that we're not gonna be able to sit cause they're,</v>

1846
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:54.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1847
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 5>even the genetics,</v>

1848
00:54:55.891 --> 00:54:57.690
<v Speaker 5>there's no database to compare it to.</v>

1849
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 5>Now we have the whole human genome to compare it to,</v>

1850
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.500
<v Speaker 5>which is what we're doing right now.</v>

1851
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.720
<v Speaker 5>And we have all the literature that the world's expert in skeletal</v>

1852
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:07.740
<v Speaker 5>abnormalities.</v>

1853
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:08.530
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1854
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:08.730
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1855
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.001
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1856
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:12.900
<v Speaker 5>the expert in the world looked at this thing is that this is nothing that I know</v>

1857
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:15.330
<v Speaker 5>of and that has ever been seen on this planet.</v>

1858
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:16.733
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1859
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:19.110
<v Speaker 5>and so the question then becomes,</v>

1860
00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:20.460
<v Speaker 5>what is it now?</v>

1861
00:55:20.461 --> 00:55:22.920
<v Speaker 5>It turns out it was found in an area of a,</v>

1862
00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:24.420
<v Speaker 5>the Atacama desert in Chile</v>

1863
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:26.760
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1864
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.570
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1865
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:30.000
<v Speaker 5>native peoples have reports of these objects,</v>

1866
00:55:30.001 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 5>luminous objects going in and out of the foothills of the Andes,</v>

1867
00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:34.950
<v Speaker 5>the famous famous for very famous,</v>

1868
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 5>very famous.</v>

1869
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.050
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1870
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1871
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 5>also in these remote,</v>

1872
00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:39.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1873
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:40.950
<v Speaker 5>native villages,</v>

1874
00:55:40.951 --> 00:55:43.260
<v Speaker 5>there are reports of these very small beans,</v>

1875
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:44.810
<v Speaker 5>upright humanoid type beans.</v>

1876
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.900
<v Speaker 5>Said that also the area where the constructed the VLT telescopic array,</v>

1877
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.990
<v Speaker 5>one of the very large telescope I believe.</v>

1878
00:55:51.991 --> 00:55:52.531
<v Speaker 5>I think there are,</v>

1879
00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:52.651
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1880
00:55:52.651 --> 00:55:55.350
<v Speaker 5>cause it's very dark area and there have been a lot of astronomy.</v>

1881
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:56.041
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1882
00:55:56.041 --> 00:55:57.180
<v Speaker 5>and we also know a,</v>

1883
00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:02.220
<v Speaker 5>one of our witnesses who was manning a facility on the Peruvian Bolivian border</v>

1884
00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:05.310
<v Speaker 5>that's not too far from this area,</v>

1885
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:08.250
<v Speaker 5>was there in the early nineties when we were using a,</v>

1886
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:08.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1887
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:13.730
<v Speaker 5>Sdi star wars system to track Iti craft and hit them with electromagnetic pulse</v>

1888
00:56:13.861 --> 00:56:14.310
<v Speaker 5>weapons.</v>

1889
00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:19.310
<v Speaker 5>And one was downed and crashed on the Peruvian Bolivian border with</v>

1890
00:56:20.191 --> 00:56:22.290
<v Speaker 5>electromagnetic pulse weapons.</v>

1891
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:22.621
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1892
00:56:22.621 --> 00:56:23.800
<v Speaker 5>This is who did this.</v>

1893
00:56:23.801 --> 00:56:25.060
<v Speaker 5>I did the air force,</v>

1894
00:56:25.061 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 5>the army,</v>

1895
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:26.470
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1896
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:27.303
<v Speaker 5>do we know?</v>

1897
00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:27.851
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1898
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:28.301
<v Speaker 5>we know,</v>

1899
00:56:28.301 --> 00:56:29.770
<v Speaker 5>but I mean it's this group majestic,</v>

1900
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1901
00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:33.580
<v Speaker 5>if you were to talk to the general,</v>

1902
00:56:33.581 --> 00:56:35.800
<v Speaker 5>I briefed who's head of the defense intelligence agency,</v>

1903
00:56:35.801 --> 00:56:37.990
<v Speaker 5>which is almost as big as the CIA that's in the Pentagon.</v>

1904
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 5>He know anything about this.</v>

1905
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 5>So you say who's doing it?</v>

1906
00:56:41.891 --> 00:56:41.981
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1907
00:56:41.981 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

1908
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.510
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of almost not the correct even way of framing it is to say,</v>

1909
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1910
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1911
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:48.400
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

1912
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 5>when senator annually that he just passed away.</v>

1913
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 5>Wonderful senator from Hawaii,</v>

1914
00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1915
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:57.720
<v Speaker 5>he said there exists a secret government with its own air force,</v>

1916
00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.650
<v Speaker 5>its own funding mechanism,</v>

1917
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:01.210
<v Speaker 5>its own navy.</v>

1918
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:03.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm quoting almost exactly.</v>

1919
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.710
<v Speaker 5>And at the end actually is a great,</v>

1920
00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:06.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1921
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.940
<v Speaker 5>speech by the senator and it's because he had run across that there that this</v>

1922
00:57:12.101 --> 00:57:12.934
<v Speaker 5>was going on.</v>

1923
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:13.751
<v Speaker 5>So the question is,</v>

1924
00:57:13.751 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 5>who's running this?</v>

1925
00:57:15.101 --> 00:57:15.281
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1926
00:57:15.281 --> 00:57:16.720
<v Speaker 5>they've gone off the reservation.</v>

1927
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:20.470
<v Speaker 5>There's certainly no congressional oversight or presidential oversight over</v>

1928
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:21.460
<v Speaker 5>these rogue elements.</v>

1929
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.740
<v Speaker 5>And I think that is a threat to our democracy,</v>

1930
00:57:23.741 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 5>but it's also a threat to our security in the world.</v>

1931
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:30.640
<v Speaker 5>If what we've learned is true for multiple military insiders,</v>

1932
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.530
<v Speaker 5>that we have been attempting to target these extraterrestrial vehicles and down</v>

1933
00:57:35.531 --> 00:57:35.980
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1934
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 5>How stupid is that?</v>

1935
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.960
<v Speaker 5>And you're dealing with civilizations that could turn the earth into a pink mist</v>

1936
00:57:40.961 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 5>floating through space in a nanosecond and we're,</v>

1937
00:57:43.511 --> 00:57:44.890
<v Speaker 5>they're firing at them.</v>

1938
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:45.730
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>

1939
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:46.031
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1940
00:57:46.031 --> 00:57:46.691
<v Speaker 5>I mean does that,</v>

1941
00:57:46.691 --> 00:57:46.950
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>

1942
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:48.460
<v Speaker 5>you convinced that this happened.</v>

1943
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:49.090
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1944
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.200
<v Speaker 5>I absolutely know it is.</v>

1945
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 5>Cause I have too many insiders who,</v>

1946
00:57:51.821 --> 00:57:54.100
<v Speaker 5>who've been present when we've done this sort of,</v>

1947
00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:54.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1948
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 5>the weaponization of electromagnetic signals.</v>

1949
00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.870
<v Speaker 5>What about disinformation?</v>

1950
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.170
<v Speaker 5>D You have most of the information out there is disinformation.</v>

1951
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:05.500
<v Speaker 5>I would say ever hit you like any this might be,</v>

1952
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:06.670
<v Speaker 5>I have no,</v>

1953
00:58:06.671 --> 00:58:06.850
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1954
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:07.840
<v Speaker 5>not when I'm telling you,</v>

1955
00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.440
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

1956
00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:11.560
<v Speaker 5>have I ever been caught flat footed?</v>

1957
00:58:11.561 --> 00:58:12.580
<v Speaker 5>You almost.</v>

1958
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1959
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.080
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1960
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:14.950
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1961
00:58:14.951 --> 00:58:16.630
<v Speaker 5>we're very careful and I have to say,</v>

1962
00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:17.464
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1963
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:21.010
<v Speaker 5>as a doctor who got into this sort of accidentally,</v>

1964
00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:26.550
<v Speaker 5>and then I was tutored and mentored by some really good people in the military</v>

1965
00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.890
<v Speaker 5>and the intelligence community who wanted me to do this.</v>

1966
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.320
<v Speaker 5>And one of them is still to CIA,</v>

1967
00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.460
<v Speaker 5>Phd guy.</v>

1968
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:34.331
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>

1969
00:58:34.331 --> 00:58:34.601
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1970
00:58:34.601 --> 00:58:37.570
<v Speaker 5>someone needs to do this because the politicians are never going to do it within</v>

1971
00:58:37.571 --> 00:58:40.180
<v Speaker 5>these big corporations are absolutely not going to let it out.</v>

1972
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.910
<v Speaker 5>And this was back in the 90s.</v>

1973
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.511
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

1974
00:58:43.511 --> 00:58:44.170
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1975
00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:45.310
<v Speaker 5>what am I supposed to do?</v>

1976
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:46.811
<v Speaker 5>And Yeah,</v>

1977
00:58:46.811 --> 00:58:47.840
<v Speaker 5>one of the interesting thing we,</v>

1978
00:58:47.841 --> 00:58:50.470
<v Speaker 5>after we put this briefing together for Clinton and,</v>

1979
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:50.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1980
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:50.881
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1981
00:58:50.881 --> 00:58:52.000
<v Speaker 5>Lawrence Rockefeller,</v>

1982
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:52.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1983
00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:52.710
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1984
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:55.450
<v Speaker 5>I put the concept together,</v>

1985
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.210
<v Speaker 5>the best available evidence and all these cases,</v>

1986
00:58:58.380 --> 00:58:58.601
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1987
00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:01.780
<v Speaker 5>and then Lawrence Rockefeller hosted a bill and Hillary Clinton at the</v>

1988
00:59:01.781 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 5>Rockefeller ranch and that it had me out there shortly before that.</v>

1989
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:10.030
<v Speaker 5>And Mr Rockefeller was the white hat in the family who wanted to end the</v>

1990
00:59:10.031 --> 00:59:10.864
<v Speaker 5>secrecy,</v>

1991
00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:12.340
<v Speaker 5>unlike some of his,</v>

1992
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.510
<v Speaker 5>his family.</v>

1993
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:14.381
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1994
00:59:14.381 --> 00:59:14.721
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1995
00:59:14.721 --> 00:59:15.161
<v Speaker 5>and he,</v>

1996
00:59:15.161 --> 00:59:16.390
<v Speaker 5>so he said to me,</v>

1997
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:17.080
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1998
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.130
<v Speaker 5>one night I was at on his porch on a deck in the grand Tetons,</v>

1999
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:22.063
<v Speaker 5>the [inaudible]</v>

2000
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.521
<v Speaker 6>ranch,</v>

2001
00:59:22.521 --> 00:59:22.881
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2002
00:59:22.881 --> 00:59:23.714
<v Speaker 6>and he said,</v>

2003
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:24.620
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2004
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.440
<v Speaker 6>we really need you to hurry up and do this.</v>

2005
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

2006
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:28.791
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2007
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:29.211
<v Speaker 6>Lawrence,</v>

2008
00:59:29.211 --> 00:59:30.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm just a doctor in North Carolina.</v>

2009
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm working in an er,</v>

2010
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2011
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.200
<v Speaker 6>he says,</v>

2012
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2013
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.711
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2014
00:59:33.711 --> 00:59:34.311
<v Speaker 6>you have to do it.</v>

2015
00:59:34.311 --> 00:59:34.521
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2016
00:59:34.521 --> 00:59:34.731
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2017
00:59:34.731 --> 00:59:35.160
<v Speaker 6>I Lawrence,</v>

2018
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 6>you have to get these guys to do.</v>

2019
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:37.730
<v Speaker 6>He says they will never do it.</v>

2020
00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:38.721
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

2021
00:59:38.721 --> 00:59:39.021
<v Speaker 6>Lawrence,</v>

2022
00:59:39.021 --> 00:59:39.621
<v Speaker 6>for God sakes,</v>

2023
00:59:39.621 --> 00:59:40.071
<v Speaker 6>you're old,</v>

2024
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:41.480
<v Speaker 6>you're rich and you're Rockefeller.</v>

2025
00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:42.711
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

2026
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:42.921
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2027
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:43.281
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

2028
00:59:43.281 --> 00:59:48.281
<v Speaker 6>the implications of this are so vast and so profound that no aspect of life will</v>

2029
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:49.730
<v Speaker 6>be unchanged when it comes out.</v>

2030
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.271
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2031
00:59:50.271 --> 00:59:50.541
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

2032
00:59:50.541 --> 00:59:50.901
<v Speaker 6>Lawrence,</v>

2033
00:59:50.901 --> 00:59:51.734
<v Speaker 6>that's why it's secret.</v>

2034
00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:53.450
<v Speaker 6>And then he said to me,</v>

2035
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.810
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2036
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:56.120
<v Speaker 6>that means those folks aren't going to do it.</v>

2037
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.810
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

2038
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:57.643
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2039
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.880
<v Speaker 6>before that,</v>

2040
00:59:58.881 --> 01:00:00.080
<v Speaker 6>as shortly after that,</v>

2041
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.250
<v Speaker 6>and I had this,</v>

2042
01:00:01.251 --> 01:00:01.730
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2043
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:03.620
<v Speaker 6>meeting with the CIA director and,</v>

2044
01:00:03.621 --> 01:00:04.454
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2045
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 6>and one of the president's friends came to my house and this was a very</v>

2046
01:00:08.061 --> 01:00:09.110
<v Speaker 6>disturbing story.</v>

2047
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.660
<v Speaker 6>I'm sitting at the table with my four kids,</v>

2048
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:13.123
<v Speaker 6>four daughters,</v>

2049
01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:17.060
<v Speaker 6>and this man who is very close friends with the president,</v>

2050
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.050
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2051
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:19.520
<v Speaker 6>Clinton says to me,</v>

2052
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:20.403
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2053
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2054
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.051
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2055
01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:23.450
<v Speaker 6>they're very supportive of what you've recommended in this white paper.</v>

2056
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:23.751
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2057
01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:24.584
<v Speaker 6>great.</v>

2058
01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:25.520
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

2059
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.720
<v Speaker 6>but they're not going to do it.</v>

2060
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:27.621
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2061
01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:28.454
<v Speaker 6>why not?</v>

2062
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.360
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

2063
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.420
<v Speaker 6>they're convinced that if the president steps into this too hard,</v>

2064
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:33.920
<v Speaker 6>he'll end up like Jack Kennedy.</v>

2065
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 6>And I started laughing,</v>

2066
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:35.841
<v Speaker 6>thinking,</v>

2067
01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 6>what a load of nonsense.</v>

2068
01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.310
<v Speaker 6>And he stopped me.</v>

2069
01:00:40.311 --> 01:00:40.551
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

2070
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:40.641
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2071
01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:41.271
<v Speaker 6>they're serious.</v>

2072
01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:41.481
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2073
01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:41.571
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2074
01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:42.890
<v Speaker 6>don't say this in front of the kids.</v>

2075
01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 6>So we went to the library in my house,</v>

2076
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.070
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2077
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:46.903
<v Speaker 6>after dinner,</v>

2078
01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.321
<v Speaker 6>and I said,</v>

2079
01:00:48.321 --> 01:00:49.700
<v Speaker 6>what are you talking about Kevin?</v>

2080
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.690
<v Speaker 6>And he said,</v>

2081
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:52.700
<v Speaker 6>they really think this is too dangerous.</v>

2082
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:52.911
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2083
01:00:52.911 --> 01:00:53.031
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2084
01:00:53.031 --> 01:00:54.020
<v Speaker 6>what am I supposed to do?</v>

2085
01:00:54.021 --> 01:00:54.920
<v Speaker 6>What am I chop liver?</v>

2086
01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.450
<v Speaker 6>And he looked at me and he says,</v>

2087
01:00:56.451 --> 01:00:56.601
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2088
01:00:56.601 --> 01:00:57.500
<v Speaker 6>you're expendable.</v>

2089
01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:02.870
<v Speaker 6>So I've always viewed myself as the kind of the throwaway guy and all of this.</v>

2090
01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:05.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm in a sense that these guys,</v>

2091
01:01:05.211 --> 01:01:05.481
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2092
01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:05.660
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2093
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.720
<v Speaker 6>the folks who have enormous political power and corporate power,</v>

2094
01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:09.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2095
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.360
<v Speaker 6>even the ones who support this very avidly,</v>

2096
01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:12.290
<v Speaker 6>and there's a lot of them,</v>

2097
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:13.663
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2098
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.110
<v Speaker 6>they don't want to stick their necks out,</v>

2099
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:15.921
<v Speaker 6>but I'm confused.</v>

2100
01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:16.250
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2101
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:21.250
<v Speaker 6>Why would they kill Bill Clinton if Bill Clinton came out and said that we may</v>

2102
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.830
<v Speaker 6>have evidence that there might be some intelligent life out there in the world</v>

2103
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:25.620
<v Speaker 6>or the universe.</v>

2104
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.001
<v Speaker 6>She goes,</v>

2105
01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:26.301
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2106
01:01:26.301 --> 01:01:27.440
<v Speaker 6>it's like the rem song.</v>

2107
01:01:27.441 --> 01:01:29.060
<v Speaker 6>It's the end of the world as we know it.</v>

2108
01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.321
<v Speaker 6>Because if that,</v>

2109
01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:32.570
<v Speaker 6>if that happens when that happens,</v>

2110
01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:33.643
<v Speaker 6>people would panic.</v>

2111
01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:34.270
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2112
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.411
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2113
01:01:34.411 --> 01:01:34.520
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2114
01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:34.671
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2115
01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:34.791
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2116
01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:34.941
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2117
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:38.090
<v Speaker 6>The public isn't going to panic over this unless it's couched in a stupid way.</v>

2118
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:38.211
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2119
01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:41.570
<v Speaker 6>the public definitely will panic if the president comes out and says there's Ufo</v>

2120
01:01:41.571 --> 01:01:42.560
<v Speaker 6>is and then it gets whacked.</v>

2121
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:43.520
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

2122
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.720
<v Speaker 6>That would lead to panic.</v>

2123
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2124
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.610
<v Speaker 6>but there's a bigger problem if the president doesn't have control access over</v>

2125
01:01:49.611 --> 01:01:50.480
<v Speaker 6>these projects.</v>

2126
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 6>He didn't want to talk about it because then it shows the fact that our</v>

2127
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:58.070
<v Speaker 6>democracy has been side lined as Eisenhower warned us.</v>

2128
01:01:58.071 --> 01:01:58.251
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2129
01:01:58.251 --> 01:01:59.020
<v Speaker 6>the reason I said,</v>

2130
01:01:59.020 --> 01:01:59.450
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2131
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.640
<v Speaker 6>I mean Eisenhower was not military.</v>

2132
01:02:01.641 --> 01:02:02.900
<v Speaker 6>It was a five star general.</v>

2133
01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.350
<v Speaker 6>I have a phone.</v>

2134
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:04.310
<v Speaker 6>You don't know the story.</v>

2135
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.830
<v Speaker 6>Just fill people in on the speech that he made.</v>

2136
01:02:06.831 --> 01:02:10.670
<v Speaker 6>Was he an active sitting president leaving the last day of his presidency?</v>

2137
01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:11.930
<v Speaker 6>He basically said,</v>

2138
01:02:11.931 --> 01:02:15.820
<v Speaker 6>but where the military industrial complex and this is the dangers.</v>

2139
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:16.050
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2140
01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:16.521
<v Speaker 6>and he said,</v>

2141
01:02:16.521 --> 01:02:20.340
<v Speaker 6>the dangers of this enormous power will be a threat to our democracy</v>

2142
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.173
<v Speaker 5>and our way of life.</v>

2143
01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:26.570
<v Speaker 5>Now the reason he said that is that between 1954 and 1960,</v>

2144
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:27.661
<v Speaker 5>61,</v>

2145
01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:28.830
<v Speaker 5>when he was leaving office,</v>

2146
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:34.190
<v Speaker 5>it was on his watch that the military industrial complex reorganized under the</v>

2147
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:36.900
<v Speaker 5>Rockefeller Commission of 1956.</v>

2148
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 5>And Eisenhower lost complete control over these projects.</v>

2149
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:43.980
<v Speaker 5>I have a lieutenant colonel who was on the plane with Jack Kennedy flying to</v>

2150
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Speaker 5>Berlin when he gave the I am a Berliner speech.</v>

2151
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.690
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

2152
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.090
<v Speaker 5>and Jack Kenny was talking about this Ufo issue,</v>

2153
01:02:51.091 --> 01:02:54.290
<v Speaker 5>but he turned to this guy who was kind of the chief steward for,</v>

2154
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.900
<v Speaker 5>for Air Force One who,</v>

2155
01:02:55.901 --> 01:02:56.430
<v Speaker 5>who I know.</v>

2156
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:57.263
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

2157
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:58.343
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2158
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.030
<v Speaker 5>I know about this,</v>

2159
01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.670
<v Speaker 5>but the whole matter does the President Kennedy saying this,</v>

2160
01:03:02.671 --> 01:03:04.110
<v Speaker 5>the whole matters out of my hands.</v>

2161
01:03:04.111 --> 01:03:05.100
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know why.</v>

2162
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.800
<v Speaker 5>And this guy was stunned.</v>

2163
01:03:07.801 --> 01:03:08.161
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2164
01:03:08.161 --> 01:03:08.821
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you,</v>

2165
01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:10.270
<v Speaker 5>there's a kind of a gruff colonel,</v>

2166
01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:15.890
<v Speaker 5>air force guy who was crying as he told the story because it hit him that there</v>

2167
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:17.940
<v Speaker 5>had been sort of a silent,</v>

2168
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:21.420
<v Speaker 5>silent coup d'etat on this issue.</v>

2169
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2170
01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:23.070
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2171
01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:26.700
<v Speaker 5>one of the problems in Washington when I meet with people who are part of a</v>

2172
01:03:26.701 --> 01:03:27.950
<v Speaker 5>powerful committees and,</v>

2173
01:03:27.951 --> 01:03:30.030
<v Speaker 5>and politicians is that,</v>

2174
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:30.480
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2175
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:30.701
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2176
01:03:30.701 --> 01:03:30.891
<v Speaker 5>kind of,</v>

2177
01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:33.000
<v Speaker 5>they're kind of viewed as place holders that come and go.</v>

2178
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.690
<v Speaker 5>The mainstream media is really bread and circus where they just keep wanting</v>

2179
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:37.790
<v Speaker 5>people to be entertained with shock,</v>

2180
01:03:37.791 --> 01:03:38.624
<v Speaker 5>can dribble.</v>

2181
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.700
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2182
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 5>the question becomes,</v>

2183
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:42.990
<v Speaker 5>how are you going to get this story out?</v>

2184
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:44.041
<v Speaker 5>And that's why,</v>

2185
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:45.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean a few years ago I left medicine,</v>

2186
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:46.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2187
01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:50.040
<v Speaker 5>which was a hard thing for me to do because I mean,</v>

2188
01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:51.240
<v Speaker 5>I really love taking care of,</v>

2189
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2190
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.950
<v Speaker 5>real emergencies.</v>

2191
01:03:52.951 --> 01:03:53.730
<v Speaker 5>And Trump,</v>

2192
01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:56.490
<v Speaker 5>did you do that for that was in that er 10 years.</v>

2193
01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.470
<v Speaker 5>I was chairman of emergency medicine and you know,</v>

2194
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.950
<v Speaker 5>the problem became for me,</v>

2195
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:02.820
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2196
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.230
<v Speaker 5>the world's in an emergency.</v>

2197
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:05.220
<v Speaker 5>So I said,</v>

2198
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:10.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm an emergency doctor and I know an emergency when I see one and we're in deep</v>

2199
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:12.660
<v Speaker 5>trouble and so someone has to do this.</v>

2200
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:13.080
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2201
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.520
<v Speaker 5>but before I did that,</v>

2202
01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:17.070
<v Speaker 5>what you have to understand is I went to everyone I could.</v>

2203
01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:17.701
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2204
01:04:17.701 --> 01:04:19.040
<v Speaker 5>I went to these powerful people.</v>

2205
01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:21.230
<v Speaker 5>I went to the UN and I went to the British government,</v>

2206
01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.260
<v Speaker 5>the Ministry of Defense.</v>

2207
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:23.250
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2208
01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.140
<v Speaker 5>and basically none of them doubted.</v>

2209
01:04:25.141 --> 01:04:26.040
<v Speaker 5>This was all true.</v>

2210
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.053
<v Speaker 5>Frankly.</v>

2211
01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.740
<v Speaker 5>This is what people need to understand.</v>

2212
01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:30.630
<v Speaker 5>There was no laughter in the room.</v>

2213
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.220
<v Speaker 5>They took it very seriously,</v>

2214
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.470
<v Speaker 5>but they didn't want to stick their necks out.</v>

2215
01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:35.191
<v Speaker 5>And a friend of mine,</v>

2216
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:36.270
<v Speaker 5>who's a big business guy,</v>

2217
01:04:36.271 --> 01:04:36.521
<v Speaker 5>he say,</v>

2218
01:04:36.521 --> 01:04:36.840
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2219
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.673
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2220
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:38.850
<v Speaker 5>the way the world works now,</v>

2221
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.720
<v Speaker 5>everyone wants to be first to be second when it's something tough.</v>

2222
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.180
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2223
01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:47.080
<v Speaker 4>I've always felt that something along the lines of alien contact,</v>

2224
01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.720
<v Speaker 4>if they did have information,</v>

2225
01:04:49.721 --> 01:04:54.430
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason to let people know unless it's unavoidable.</v>

2226
01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:58.870
<v Speaker 4>I always felt like unless they were just going to try to do some damage control</v>

2227
01:04:58.871 --> 01:05:01.840
<v Speaker 4>and redefine what's happening,</v>

2228
01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:02.680
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

2229
01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't think that they would ever come out about it.</v>

2230
01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:08.740
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't seem like it would be something that would be advantageous to</v>

2231
01:05:08.741 --> 01:05:10.370
<v Speaker 4>just start telling people about Ufos.</v>

2232
01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:13.810
<v Speaker 4>Th th the idea is always that the government is our daddy and then our</v>

2233
01:05:13.811 --> 01:05:14.920
<v Speaker 4>government's looking out for us.</v>

2234
01:05:14.921 --> 01:05:17.550
<v Speaker 4>But the evidence points time and time again to that,</v>

2235
01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.850
<v Speaker 4>that that's horse shit and that's not really what's going on.</v>

2236
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.421
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2237
01:05:20.421 --> 01:05:20.911
<v Speaker 4>my military,</v>

2238
01:05:20.911 --> 01:05:20.980
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2239
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:24.580
<v Speaker 5>Boys who made the point years ago that because so many people,</v>

2240
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean between five and 10% of the public have seen one of these objects,</v>

2241
01:05:27.941 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 5>many of them,</v>

2242
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.493
<v Speaker 5>very close range.</v>

2243
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:33.040
<v Speaker 4>Let's get back to that because this is what we had talked about before when we</v>

2244
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:33.760
<v Speaker 4>got onto this.</v>

2245
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.770
<v Speaker 4>People think the earth is 10,000 years old.</v>

2246
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:36.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2247
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.520
<v Speaker 4>I think most of what people see is bullshit.</v>

2248
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:40.720
<v Speaker 4>I think most,</v>

2249
01:05:40.790 --> 01:05:41.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2250
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:42.430
<v Speaker 4>no question about that.</v>

2251
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:43.151
<v Speaker 4>Most,</v>

2252
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:43.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2253
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:44.283
<v Speaker 4>sightings.</v>

2254
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.133
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2255
01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:48.430
<v Speaker 4>I did a show once for cvs called game show in my head,</v>

2256
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:49.443
<v Speaker 4>and it was a,</v>

2257
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:52.390
<v Speaker 4>a hidden camera game show.</v>

2258
01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.240
<v Speaker 4>We'd put it an earpiece in people's head and we were sending him out to the</v>

2259
01:05:55.241 --> 01:05:56.560
<v Speaker 4>street and a,</v>

2260
01:05:56.561 --> 01:05:58.360
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know what they had to do until they got there.</v>

2261
01:05:58.361 --> 01:05:59.140
<v Speaker 4>And one of them,</v>

2262
01:05:59.140 --> 01:05:59.591
<v Speaker 4>we said,</v>

2263
01:05:59.591 --> 01:06:00.320
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2264
01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.570
<v Speaker 4>see that camera over there?</v>

2265
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.890
<v Speaker 4>That's where that works for you.</v>

2266
01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:03.850
<v Speaker 4>There was a big news camera,</v>

2267
01:06:03.851 --> 01:06:08.851
<v Speaker 4>you're a news reporter and there was just a Ufo sighting right above Hollywood</v>

2268
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:10.510
<v Speaker 4>boulevard.</v>

2269
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:13.030
<v Speaker 4>The problem is the witness took off.</v>

2270
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 4>So you need to grab someone who wasn't there and have them become a witness.</v>

2271
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:21.670
<v Speaker 4>Tell them exactly what you need to tell them to get them to do this,</v>

2272
01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:22.990
<v Speaker 4>get them to lie on camera,</v>

2273
01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:26.800
<v Speaker 4>then you need to get them to tell you that they were abducted and probe.</v>

2274
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.250
<v Speaker 4>And I'm Sarah and we got people to do it like that.</v>

2275
01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:30.530
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2276
01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:30.700
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2277
01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:30.941
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2278
01:06:30.941 --> 01:06:31.560
<v Speaker 4>I have no doubt,</v>

2279
01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.250
<v Speaker 4>but he was full of shit.</v>

2280
01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:33.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2281
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:33.851
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

2282
01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:34.810
<v Speaker 4>you can always do that.</v>

2283
01:06:34.811 --> 01:06:37.980
<v Speaker 4>But I'm talking about high level military and the residual,</v>

2284
01:06:37.981 --> 01:06:38.070
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

2285
01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:38.251
<v Speaker 5>mean,</v>

2286
01:06:38.251 --> 01:06:39.084
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2287
01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.213
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2288
01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:41.820
<v Speaker 5>we have multiple,</v>

2289
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:42.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2290
01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:42.410
<v Speaker 5>air,</v>

2291
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:43.243
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2292
01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:45.960
<v Speaker 5>pilots for commercial airlines and the air force.</v>

2293
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.860
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2294
01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.380
<v Speaker 5>and this is one of the really great cases we have by the way,</v>

2295
01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:51.900
<v Speaker 5>the Japan Airlines case over Alaska,</v>

2296
01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:52.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2297
01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:53.340
<v Speaker 5>in the 80s.</v>

2298
01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:57.180
<v Speaker 5>And the guy who was in charge of investigations for the FAA,</v>

2299
01:06:57.181 --> 01:07:00.180
<v Speaker 5>he was third from the top during the Reagan era.</v>

2300
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:05.630
<v Speaker 5>He actually left that agency and brought the originals with him and gave them to</v>

2301
01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:10.940
<v Speaker 5>us of the radar tracings of this thing that was the size of like 10,</v>

2302
01:07:11.011 --> 01:07:11.341
<v Speaker 5>seven,</v>

2303
01:07:11.341 --> 01:07:11.991
<v Speaker 5>47.</v>

2304
01:07:11.991 --> 01:07:14.850
<v Speaker 5>It's moving in a nonlinear way over the skies.</v>

2305
01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.090
<v Speaker 5>It was on civilian radar,</v>

2306
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:20.250
<v Speaker 5>which way it was on military radar.</v>

2307
01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.110
<v Speaker 5>They scrambled f 16 jets.</v>

2308
01:07:22.111 --> 01:07:25.050
<v Speaker 5>It was on their radar and the Japan Airlines,</v>

2309
01:07:25.051 --> 01:07:28.140
<v Speaker 5>seven 47 pilot has testified to it.</v>

2310
01:07:28.141 --> 01:07:30.240
<v Speaker 5>And we have all of that in this case.</v>

2311
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:31.403
<v Speaker 5>Heard of this.</v>

2312
01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:31.861
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

2313
01:07:31.861 --> 01:07:32.071
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2314
01:07:32.071 --> 01:07:34.730
<v Speaker 5>so when we brought all that forward and this guy came for,</v>

2315
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:35.041
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

2316
01:07:35.041 --> 01:07:38.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of these high level government officials who actually has seen all of</v>

2317
01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:39.990
<v Speaker 5>this and has handled it,</v>

2318
01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:42.360
<v Speaker 5>but no one's asking the right questions.</v>

2319
01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:44.850
<v Speaker 5>So when you pull all that together,</v>

2320
01:07:44.851 --> 01:07:47.490
<v Speaker 5>and then of course there will be events like the,</v>

2321
01:07:47.491 --> 01:07:49.320
<v Speaker 5>this thing that happened in Phoenix where,</v>

2322
01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:49.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2323
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.890
<v Speaker 5>eventually the governor of Arizona,</v>

2324
01:07:52.891 --> 01:07:55.560
<v Speaker 5>five Simonton came out later and at the time he ridiculed it,</v>

2325
01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:57.570
<v Speaker 5>but he had actually seen it came out later,</v>

2326
01:07:57.571 --> 01:08:00.030
<v Speaker 5>10 years later in 2007 said,</v>

2327
01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:00.900
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2328
01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.670
<v Speaker 5>that was an EDT craft almost certainly.</v>

2329
01:08:02.671 --> 01:08:06.600
<v Speaker 5>And I saw it and tens of thousands of people in the Phoenix area saw it and it</v>

2330
01:08:06.601 --> 01:08:10.110
<v Speaker 5>was photographed and it was on radar and there were very trained people.</v>

2331
01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:10.501
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2332
01:08:10.501 --> 01:08:10.741
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2333
01:08:10.741 --> 01:08:13.650
<v Speaker 5>you have to ask the question how many things like that have to happen?</v>

2334
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.550
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2335
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:15.383
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2336
01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:15.691
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2337
01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:16.560
<v Speaker 5>on the other hand,</v>

2338
01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2339
01:08:17.191 --> 01:08:18.730
<v Speaker 5>the things that we have in physics,</v>

2340
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:19.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2341
01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:19.590
<v Speaker 5>that are,</v>

2342
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:21.960
<v Speaker 5>that are inferred through indirect measurements,</v>

2343
01:08:21.961 --> 01:08:25.920
<v Speaker 5>like black holes or articles that belief and faith or even the Big Bang theory.</v>

2344
01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:27.330
<v Speaker 5>But when you have all of this,</v>

2345
01:08:27.331 --> 01:08:29.340
<v Speaker 5>and this is not just someone on Hollywood boulevard,</v>

2346
01:08:29.341 --> 01:08:30.270
<v Speaker 5>he's making stuff up.</v>

2347
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.830
<v Speaker 5>We have dozens,</v>

2348
01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:32.191
<v Speaker 5>thousands of people,</v>

2349
01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.240
<v Speaker 5>we have radar cases,</v>

2350
01:08:33.241 --> 01:08:34.074
<v Speaker 5>you have all this.</v>

2351
01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.480
<v Speaker 5>And so a lot of this is what's going to be in the film serious.</v>

2352
01:08:36.481 --> 01:08:40.410
<v Speaker 5>And because what I said to people is that the fact that people haven't seen this</v>

2353
01:08:40.411 --> 01:08:40.850
<v Speaker 5>evidence,</v>

2354
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.810
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.</v>

2355
01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.710
<v Speaker 5>It does exist.</v>

2356
01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:44.011
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2357
01:08:44.011 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2358
01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.240
<v Speaker 5>and I agree with you.</v>

2359
01:08:45.241 --> 01:08:48.840
<v Speaker 5>There are a lot of people who will see things and it will be a planet rising or</v>

2360
01:08:48.841 --> 01:08:49.630
<v Speaker 5>it'll be a,</v>

2361
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:51.920
<v Speaker 5>a meteor or it'll be military aircraft,</v>

2362
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.520
<v Speaker 5>a satellite or it'll be a com.</v>

2363
01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.350
<v Speaker 5>Now this is the other part of this.</v>

2364
01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:00.000
<v Speaker 5>There are a lot of things that are Ufo sightings that are very legit.</v>

2365
01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.190
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I don't like the word Ufo.</v>

2366
01:09:02.191 --> 01:09:05.370
<v Speaker 5>There are two categories of Ufo shows that once you eliminate all the nonsense</v>

2367
01:09:05.371 --> 01:09:06.204
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about,</v>

2368
01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.270
<v Speaker 5>and they're the ones that are Etvs,</v>

2369
01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:10.021
<v Speaker 5>which is what they're called,</v>

2370
01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:12.060
<v Speaker 5>the NSA extraterrestrial vehicles.</v>

2371
01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.050
<v Speaker 5>And then there are the ones that are the electromagnetic devices we've been</v>

2372
01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:19.110
<v Speaker 5>building since the 50s and um,</v>

2373
01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:19.460
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2374
01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:24.240
<v Speaker 5>if people think that propulsion and energy systems stopped in the forties,</v>

2375
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:25.770
<v Speaker 5>they need to think about this,</v>

2376
01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:27.480
<v Speaker 5>list it back for a minute.</v>

2377
01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:31.050
<v Speaker 5>Your car is running on an internal combustion engine circa</v>

2378
01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.780
<v Speaker 4>mine is because I'm a man.</v>

2379
01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:33.081
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2380
01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:35.270
<v Speaker 4>And I don't drive a and sissy hybrid.</v>

2381
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:35.481
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2382
01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:36.290
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>

2383
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:37.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm not driving a Prius.</v>

2384
01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 4>It makes no noise.</v>

2385
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:38.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2386
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.020
<v Speaker 4>you should have a thousand words power,</v>

2387
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:41.121
<v Speaker 4>electric one.</v>

2388
01:09:41.121 --> 01:09:43.640
<v Speaker 4>And then you'd really have some powers is too futuristic,</v>

2389
01:09:43.641 --> 01:09:44.031
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2390
01:09:44.031 --> 01:09:45.740
<v Speaker 4>I need led Zeppelin on the radio.</v>

2391
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 4>I need a little seventies in my life.</v>

2392
01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:48.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2393
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:48.970
<v Speaker 5>well nobody,</v>

2394
01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:49.481
<v Speaker 5>I mean this,</v>

2395
01:09:49.481 --> 01:09:49.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2396
01:09:49.781 --> 01:09:52.570
<v Speaker 5>and the jet engine people think that we're flying around jet.</v>

2397
01:09:52.571 --> 01:09:53.770
<v Speaker 5>So I came out here from DC,</v>

2398
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:56.590
<v Speaker 5>that's 1930s rockets,</v>

2399
01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:58.920
<v Speaker 5>1940s for Navon Brown does,</v>

2400
01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.350
<v Speaker 5>do people really think there've been no breakthroughs in energy physics?</v>

2401
01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Well since the forties,</v>

2402
01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.060
<v Speaker 4>people absolutely know that we've been working on things like that.</v>

2403
01:10:07.061 --> 01:10:10.570
<v Speaker 4>But to bring up what you brought up earlier about the governor of Phoenix,</v>

2404
01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 4>just to point out that the governor of Alaska,</v>

2405
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.830
<v Speaker 4>Arizona rather the governor of Alaska,</v>

2406
01:10:14.831 --> 01:10:17.470
<v Speaker 4>Sarah Palin was one of those people that believe the earth is less than 10,000</v>

2407
01:10:17.471 --> 01:10:17.861
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>

2408
01:10:17.861 --> 01:10:20.800
<v Speaker 4>So just because you're a governor or something doesn't mean you're on the ball.</v>

2409
01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:21.880
<v Speaker 4>And second of all,</v>

2410
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:22.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2411
01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.140
<v Speaker 4>I had friends that were in Phoenix and uh,</v>

2412
01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:30.210
<v Speaker 4>one of them very credible guy told me he saw some giant black triangle flying</v>

2413
01:10:33.311 --> 01:10:34.780
<v Speaker 4>motionless over the sky.</v>

2414
01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:37.480
<v Speaker 4>He said it was bigger than several football fields.</v>

2415
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:42.520
<v Speaker 4>He said it made no noise and it blocked out the the stars and flew over and he</v>

2416
01:10:42.521 --> 01:10:44.620
<v Speaker 4>said everyone in his neighborhood was shitting their pants.</v>

2417
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:47.230
<v Speaker 4>It was enough to me that I would go,</v>

2418
01:10:47.231 --> 01:10:47.650
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2419
01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:48.610
<v Speaker 4>there's something.</v>

2420
01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.560
<v Speaker 4>There's too many people that saw something.</v>

2421
01:10:50.670 --> 01:10:51.210
<v Speaker 4>He cute,</v>

2422
01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:53.050
<v Speaker 4>get attribute certain things to mass hysteria.</v>

2423
01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.110
<v Speaker 4>But that was one of them that I've found to be very strange.</v>

2424
01:10:56.111 --> 01:10:57.910
<v Speaker 4>But I never heard any photographs.</v>

2425
01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:58.790
<v Speaker 4>You say photograph,</v>

2426
01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:00.410
<v Speaker 4>we have amazing photographs and video.</v>

2427
01:11:00.411 --> 01:11:01.330
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be in the film.</v>

2428
01:11:01.331 --> 01:11:01.781
<v Speaker 4>Serious.</v>

2429
01:11:01.781 --> 01:11:02.800
<v Speaker 4>You don't have them anywhere else.</v>

2430
01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:04.330
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't go to see online.</v>

2431
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:05.343
<v Speaker 5>You're holding them back.</v>

2432
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:05.721
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2433
01:11:05.721 --> 01:11:05.841
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2434
01:11:05.841 --> 01:11:05.991
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2435
01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:06.131
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2436
01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:06.341
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2437
01:11:06.341 --> 01:11:06.521
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2438
01:11:06.521 --> 01:11:06.731
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>

2439
01:11:06.731 --> 01:11:07.480
<v Speaker 5>they're out there.</v>

2440
01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.840
<v Speaker 5>A doctor [inaudible] who's a medical doctor also took some of them.</v>

2441
01:11:10.841 --> 01:11:11.680
<v Speaker 5>There's other video</v>

2442
01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.170
<v Speaker 4>photos of the crafts.</v>

2443
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:14.471
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2444
01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:15.550
<v Speaker 5>The actual one.</v>

2445
01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:15.960
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2446
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.610
<v Speaker 5>So what should we,</v>

2447
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:20.320
<v Speaker 5>if we want to look for one right now to put in this show right now we're online.</v>

2448
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:21.790
<v Speaker 5>Who Does he look for?</v>

2449
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:23.103
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2450
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:25.210
<v Speaker 5>I guess you'd go to a Dr. Lynn [inaudible] side.</v>

2451
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:25.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

2452
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:26.683
<v Speaker 5>I spell her name.</v>

2453
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>K.</v>

2454
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

2455
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>T.</v>

2456
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

2457
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

2458
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>N.</v>

2459
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>K.</v>

2460
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>K.</v>

2461
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

2462
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
<v Speaker 5>T.</v>

2463
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.001
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

2464
01:11:31.001 --> 01:11:34.710
<v Speaker 5>I pull that up Brian and see what image she has Google on there.</v>

2465
01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.030
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard that there's been photographs.</v>

2466
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:37.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2467
01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

2468
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.920
<v Speaker 5>what does the photo show?</v>

2469
01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 5>It shows exactly what people described,</v>

2470
01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 5>a formation of lights that were moving together in a massive sort of the</v>

2471
01:11:46.721 --> 01:11:47.470
<v Speaker 5>formation.</v>

2472
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.741
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2473
01:11:47.741 --> 01:11:51.460
<v Speaker 5>And the government said that those were flares cause a couple hours later when</v>

2474
01:11:51.461 --> 01:11:53.380
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't contain the news story on this,</v>

2475
01:11:53.381 --> 01:11:54.460
<v Speaker 5>I was there when this happened.</v>

2476
01:11:54.461 --> 01:11:54.850
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

2477
01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:55.683
<v Speaker 5>you were in Phoenix.</v>

2478
01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:56.870
<v Speaker 5>Did you see it?</v>

2479
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:57.180
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2480
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.013
<v Speaker 5>What'd you see?</v>

2481
01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:58.750
<v Speaker 5>What you,</v>

2482
01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:01.060
<v Speaker 5>what you just described now you when the,</v>

2483
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.903
<v Speaker 5>why was I there?</v>

2484
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:03.303
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:05.410
<v Speaker 4>Did you get your spider call to Batman?</v>

2486
01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:05.771
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>

2487
01:12:05.771 --> 01:12:06.530
<v Speaker 4>The fucking,</v>

2488
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:09.310
<v Speaker 4>the thing that Ufo just appears over your house,</v>

2489
01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.480
<v Speaker 4>like the bat sign.</v>

2490
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Remember when he's in trouble,</v>

2491
01:12:11.591 --> 01:12:12.670
<v Speaker 4>we need to send Batman.</v>

2492
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:13.251
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2493
01:12:13.251 --> 01:12:13.760
<v Speaker 5>they do?</v>

2494
01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.031
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2495
01:12:14.031 --> 01:12:14.570
<v Speaker 5>they don't.</v>

2496
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:15.620
<v Speaker 5>I was actually there,</v>

2497
01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:15.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2498
01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:19.130
<v Speaker 5>at a digital lab that was being loaned to us to put together,</v>

2499
01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.173
<v Speaker 5>coincidentally,</v>

2500
01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:24.710
<v Speaker 5>we're not coincidentally to put together the best photos and videos to give to</v>

2501
01:12:24.711 --> 01:12:27.470
<v Speaker 5>Congress that I was briefing in April of [inaudible] 97.</v>

2502
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:31.490
<v Speaker 5>So in March of [inaudible] 97 I had gone there and there was a guy who had a</v>

2503
01:12:31.491 --> 01:12:33.440
<v Speaker 5>digital laboratory who said,</v>

2504
01:12:33.441 --> 01:12:33.651
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2505
01:12:33.651 --> 01:12:36.410
<v Speaker 5>we'll let you use Harlow equipment and assemble this and we'll help you.</v>

2506
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:37.430
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2507
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:39.020
<v Speaker 5>and he'd worked a lot with the military.</v>

2508
01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:42.320
<v Speaker 5>And so I had collected photos and videos from all over the world and governments</v>

2509
01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:43.340
<v Speaker 5>from all over the world,</v>

2510
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:47.570
<v Speaker 5>which we call the best available evidence and put what I was putting it together</v>

2511
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:52.580
<v Speaker 5>because in April we were holding a closed briefing from members of Congress who</v>

2512
01:12:52.581 --> 01:12:53.414
<v Speaker 5>wanted to know,</v>

2513
01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.460
<v Speaker 5>and this when people like Congressman Dan Burton,</v>

2514
01:12:55.461 --> 01:12:57.860
<v Speaker 5>who was chairman of the House government reform and Oversight Committee,</v>

2515
01:12:57.861 --> 01:13:01.010
<v Speaker 5>came in a whole lot of other people from the Pentagon and vice president's</v>

2516
01:13:01.011 --> 01:13:01.970
<v Speaker 5>office and whatnot.</v>

2517
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:02.630
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2518
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.901
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2519
01:13:02.901 --> 01:13:03.291
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2520
01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:03.441
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2521
01:13:03.441 --> 01:13:07.880
<v Speaker 5>so I was there then when that happened and someone came running into the lab</v>

2522
01:13:07.881 --> 01:13:08.510
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

2523
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:09.141
<v Speaker 5>my God,</v>

2524
01:13:09.141 --> 01:13:09.950
<v Speaker 5>while we're here trying,</v>

2525
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:10.330
<v Speaker 5>there's all,</v>

2526
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:11.630
<v Speaker 5>there's this going on.</v>

2527
01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:14.930
<v Speaker 5>And it turned out it was on the news that night in Phoenix.</v>

2528
01:13:14.931 --> 01:13:15.051
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2529
01:13:15.051 --> 01:13:15.884
<v Speaker 5>interestingly,</v>

2530
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.820
<v Speaker 5>the national news,</v>

2531
01:13:16.821 --> 01:13:18.170
<v Speaker 5>they didn't pick up on it until June.</v>

2532
01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:19.220
<v Speaker 5>This happened in March,</v>

2533
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:20.480
<v Speaker 5>which is very interesting.</v>

2534
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:21.643
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2535
01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.420
<v Speaker 5>why did that get held back?</v>

2536
01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.321
<v Speaker 5>But it,</v>

2537
01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:24.711
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2538
01:13:24.711 --> 01:13:25.660
<v Speaker 5>and so there,</v>

2539
01:13:25.661 --> 01:13:28.280
<v Speaker 5>there are so many people who saw it and this,</v>

2540
01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.420
<v Speaker 5>this was huge.</v>

2541
01:13:29.421 --> 01:13:31.400
<v Speaker 5>Whatever this object was,</v>

2542
01:13:31.401 --> 01:13:33.920
<v Speaker 5>it was not the size of like a seven 47,</v>

2543
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:34.221
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2544
01:13:34.221 --> 01:13:35.150
<v Speaker 5>seven 47,</v>

2545
01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:35.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2546
01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:37.510
<v Speaker 5>you probably could put dozens of them inside the,</v>

2547
01:13:37.511 --> 01:13:39.050
<v Speaker 5>the volume of this thing.</v>

2548
01:13:39.051 --> 01:13:39.770
<v Speaker 5>It was huge.</v>

2549
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:42.560
<v Speaker 4>I found it interesting that the stories were very similar.</v>

2550
01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.300
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things that I found most interesting,</v>

2551
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:45.140
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>

2552
01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:48.290
<v Speaker 4>watched some stuff online and then when I spoke to my friend who lives in</v>

2553
01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:50.190
<v Speaker 4>Phoenix and he told me what he saw,</v>

2554
01:13:50.191 --> 01:13:50.421
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2555
01:13:50.421 --> 01:13:50.710
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2556
01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:54.320
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about like at least six or seven people that tell them the exact</v>

2557
01:13:54.321 --> 01:13:57.170
<v Speaker 4>same story of seeing this exact same sort of thing.</v>

2558
01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Now these are the images that you're talking about.</v>

2559
01:13:59.631 --> 01:14:00.620
<v Speaker 4>These are the,</v>

2560
01:14:00.621 --> 01:14:01.070
<v Speaker 4>just the,</v>

2561
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.731
<v Speaker 4>the whatever,</v>

2562
01:14:01.731 --> 01:14:03.200
<v Speaker 4>the red lights that are in the sky.</v>

2563
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:06.170
<v Speaker 4>I think the video is probably more impressive.</v>

2564
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2565
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:10.790
<v Speaker 4>being that the video shows these things essentially hover for a long period of</v>

2566
01:14:10.791 --> 01:14:15.791
<v Speaker 4>time and a much longer than really should be attributable to parachutes and</v>

2567
01:14:17.911 --> 01:14:18.744
<v Speaker 4>flares.</v>

2568
01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.600
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really make any sense cause parachutes and flares.</v>

2569
01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.040
<v Speaker 4>They don't really move that slow.</v>

2570
01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:23.371
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>

2571
01:14:23.371 --> 01:14:23.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2572
01:14:23.581 --> 01:14:24.750
<v Speaker 4>you watch a guy jumped out of a,</v>

2573
01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:25.310
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2574
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:26.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2575
01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.630
<v Speaker 4>a plane with a parachute,</v>

2576
01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:28.610
<v Speaker 4>the parachute.</v>

2577
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:29.111
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2578
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:29.291
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2579
01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:30.150
<v Speaker 4>they s drive,</v>

2580
01:14:30.151 --> 01:14:31.290
<v Speaker 4>they slow your fall down,</v>

2581
01:14:31.291 --> 01:14:32.610
<v Speaker 4>but they don't make you suspect.</v>

2582
01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:33.770
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2583
01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:34.720
<v Speaker 5>And we know,</v>

2584
01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:37.820
<v Speaker 5>we know how those kind of flares occur mean,</v>

2585
01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:40.430
<v Speaker 5>but the people who were directly under it,</v>

2586
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:42.590
<v Speaker 5>and it moved not just over this part of Phoenix,</v>

2587
01:14:42.591 --> 01:14:46.400
<v Speaker 5>it moved all the way from outside Flagstaff through the valley and then down</v>

2588
01:14:46.401 --> 01:14:47.420
<v Speaker 5>towards Tempe.</v>

2589
01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:48.570
<v Speaker 4>Now how did you do about it?</v>

2590
01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.620
<v Speaker 4>You were there working.</v>

2591
01:14:49.621 --> 01:14:50.470
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear about it?</v>

2592
01:14:50.471 --> 01:14:51.090
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>

2593
01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:55.170
<v Speaker 5>there was a guy that ran into the lab and who had actually been in the military</v>

2594
01:14:55.171 --> 01:14:56.880
<v Speaker 5>so you wouldn't believe what's going on.</v>

2595
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.810
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2596
01:14:57.810 --> 01:14:58.560
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2597
01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:58.861
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

2598
01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:02.550
<v Speaker 5>I was there that night and 1997,</v>

2599
01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:03.990
<v Speaker 5>March of [inaudible] 97.</v>

2600
01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:04.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2601
01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:04.660
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2602
01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:05.790
<v Speaker 5>what's equally interesting,</v>

2603
01:15:05.791 --> 01:15:06.690
<v Speaker 5>if you look at this now,</v>

2604
01:15:06.691 --> 01:15:09.090
<v Speaker 5>the Bill Jin Air Force cooperated with me very,</v>

2605
01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:13.110
<v Speaker 5>very nicely back in the early nineties and late eighties.</v>

2606
01:15:13.111 --> 01:15:17.370
<v Speaker 5>You may have remembered there was this a wave of things that happened in eastern</v>

2607
01:15:17.371 --> 01:15:20.430
<v Speaker 5>Belgium where there were these massive triangles that were about,</v>

2608
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2609
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:26.270
<v Speaker 5>800 feet on each side that were photographed radar traced chase by f sixteens</v>

2610
01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:30.031
<v Speaker 5>and on the,</v>

2611
01:15:30.031 --> 01:15:34.350
<v Speaker 5>and we have all this and the head of the Belgian air force actually showed the</v>

2612
01:15:34.351 --> 01:15:39.351
<v Speaker 5>radar of one of these objects going from hover to several thousand miles per</v>

2613
01:15:39.361 --> 01:15:39.721
<v Speaker 5>hour,</v>

2614
01:15:39.721 --> 01:15:41.310
<v Speaker 5>straight up into space,</v>

2615
01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:45.190
<v Speaker 5>way outside the envelope of any normal conventional propulsion system,</v>

2616
01:15:45.191 --> 01:15:45.640
<v Speaker 5>the video,</v>

2617
01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.230
<v Speaker 5>this radar radar radar of it.</v>

2618
01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:48.481
<v Speaker 5>And we,</v>

2619
01:15:48.481 --> 01:15:49.051
<v Speaker 5>and we have that.</v>

2620
01:15:49.051 --> 01:15:49.620
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

2621
01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:53.460
<v Speaker 5>the question becomes how many of these cases do you need to have before you say</v>

2622
01:15:53.461 --> 01:15:54.480
<v Speaker 5>there's something out there.</v>

2623
01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.461
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2624
01:15:55.461 --> 01:15:57.130
<v Speaker 5>and I think this is what I,</v>

2625
01:15:57.670 --> 01:15:59.940
<v Speaker 5>the problem is that on this subject,</v>

2626
01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:05.580
<v Speaker 5>the ridicule around it and that the disinformation and the crazy stories that</v>

2627
01:16:05.581 --> 01:16:09.780
<v Speaker 5>are out there is what dominates the serious pun intended.</v>

2628
01:16:09.781 --> 01:16:14.520
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps the serious stuff really gets left on the cutting room floor by most</v>

2629
01:16:14.521 --> 01:16:17.850
<v Speaker 5>movie directors and media and even on the Internet.</v>

2630
01:16:17.851 --> 01:16:18.684
<v Speaker 5>It's very hard.</v>

2631
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.340
<v Speaker 5>And I think the pick your way through.</v>

2632
01:16:20.341 --> 01:16:22.710
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult what I've tried to do.</v>

2633
01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.570
<v Speaker 5>And then it's not that I've done a perfect job of it.</v>

2634
01:16:24.571 --> 01:16:26.250
<v Speaker 5>I've done the best I can with a lot of help.</v>

2635
01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:27.001
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2636
01:16:27.001 --> 01:16:27.511
<v Speaker 5>but remember,</v>

2637
01:16:27.511 --> 01:16:28.440
<v Speaker 5>we've never been funded.</v>

2638
01:16:28.441 --> 01:16:29.880
<v Speaker 5>We're all volunteer effort.</v>

2639
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:30.883
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2640
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:36.120
<v Speaker 5>and so what we've tried to do is get people who have the really good stuff from</v>

2641
01:16:36.121 --> 01:16:38.250
<v Speaker 5>governments come forward and share it.</v>

2642
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:39.001
<v Speaker 5>And this is why,</v>

2643
01:16:39.001 --> 01:16:39.271
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2644
01:16:39.271 --> 01:16:43.830
<v Speaker 5>when the Space Agency of France released a lot of their documents,</v>

2645
01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:43.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2646
01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:44.850
<v Speaker 5>after I,</v>

2647
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:49.790
<v Speaker 5>I was having some meetings in France and with some of the seniors,</v>

2648
01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:52.570
<v Speaker 5>can't say it both ways to the France of France.</v>

2649
01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:55.710
<v Speaker 5>It was France when I was there.</v>

2650
01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.341
<v Speaker 5>And when it's here,</v>

2651
01:16:56.341 --> 01:16:57.040
<v Speaker 5>it's France.</v>

2652
01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:57.421
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>

2653
01:16:57.421 --> 01:16:57.790
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2654
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:59.010
<v Speaker 5>there's an admiral that,</v>

2655
01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:03.660
<v Speaker 5>that works with us in France who's a wonderful guy.</v>

2656
01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:04.620
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2657
01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.100
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2658
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.710
<v Speaker 5>he's an MD and a phd in an Amaryl and,</v>

2659
01:17:07.711 --> 01:17:08.550
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2660
01:17:08.551 --> 01:17:10.640
<v Speaker 5>he knows all this is very real.</v>

2661
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:11.050
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2662
01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:13.190
<v Speaker 5>and so eventually the French government really,</v>

2663
01:17:13.191 --> 01:17:15.890
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was about a hundred thousand pages of documents.</v>

2664
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm on all of this.</v>

2665
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:17.651
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2666
01:17:17.651 --> 01:17:17.951
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2667
01:17:17.951 --> 01:17:18.441
<v Speaker 5>and now,</v>

2668
01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:18.531
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2669
01:17:18.531 --> 01:17:21.560
<v Speaker 5>since the disclosure project launched it 10 or 12 years ago,</v>

2670
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:24.560
<v Speaker 5>there are 14 countries who've opened up their files.</v>

2671
01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:24.801
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2672
01:17:24.801 --> 01:17:24.981
<v Speaker 5>Chris,</v>

2673
01:17:24.981 --> 01:17:28.310
<v Speaker 5>the United States isn't because the United States is managed differently.</v>

2674
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:29.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2675
01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 5>on this issue.</v>

2676
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:31.110
<v Speaker 5>It's a compartment.</v>

2677
01:17:31.111 --> 01:17:34.900
<v Speaker 5>It unacknowledged for Soviet Union has actually been pretty open more,</v>

2678
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:38.600
<v Speaker 5>more recently in more recent times about the first fell apart.</v>

2679
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:39.590
<v Speaker 5>Not so much now,</v>

2680
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:41.150
<v Speaker 5>but when it first fell apart.</v>

2681
01:17:41.151 --> 01:17:41.610
<v Speaker 5>We have a,</v>

2682
01:17:41.610 --> 01:17:46.610
<v Speaker 5>have a great dossier of KGB cases and files and also military.</v>

2683
01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:47.721
<v Speaker 5>And in fact,</v>

2684
01:17:47.721 --> 01:17:48.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2685
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:48.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2686
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:51.950
<v Speaker 5>some of the cosmonauts that had had encounters with these,</v>

2687
01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:56.951
<v Speaker 5>I pulled together in 1995 for a meeting with some of our astronauts like Edgar</v>

2688
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.620
<v Speaker 5>Mitchell,</v>

2689
01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.040
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2690
01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.930
<v Speaker 5>to have a meeting out here in California.</v>

2691
01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:00.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2692
01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:01.101
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2693
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:01.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2694
01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:02.120
<v Speaker 5>there were some,</v>

2695
01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:07.120
<v Speaker 5>some really solid cases out of the Soviet Union or Mitchell claim to have had a</v>

2696
01:18:07.491 --> 01:18:08.360
<v Speaker 5>personal experience.</v>

2697
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.780
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2698
01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:08.991
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2699
01:18:08.991 --> 01:18:13.370
<v Speaker 5>he's just investigated it and has concluded that this is all very real.</v>

2700
01:18:13.371 --> 01:18:13.681
<v Speaker 5>And he,</v>

2701
01:18:13.681 --> 01:18:14.150
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2702
01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:15.080
<v Speaker 5>he did come with me.</v>

2703
01:18:15.081 --> 01:18:16.220
<v Speaker 5>I invited him to the briefing.</v>

2704
01:18:16.221 --> 01:18:19.150
<v Speaker 5>We set up for the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,</v>

2705
01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:20.003
<v Speaker 5>the Pentagon.</v>

2706
01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:20.930
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2707
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:24.440
<v Speaker 5>and I think it was a very interesting for him to have learned that the people at</v>

2708
01:18:24.441 --> 01:18:29.330
<v Speaker 5>that level were shaken to their foundations because they concluded this was all</v>

2709
01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:29.960
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>

2710
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.130
<v Speaker 5>But when they made inquiries,</v>

2711
01:18:31.131 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 5>they were being lied to and denied access.</v>

2712
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:33.891
<v Speaker 5>And so this,</v>

2713
01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:35.210
<v Speaker 5>this brings up this question,</v>

2714
01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:36.950
<v Speaker 5>how to,</v>

2715
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:38.060
<v Speaker 5>who's running this show?</v>

2716
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.560
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2717
01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.430
<v Speaker 5>and who's over who the Fox is a garden,</v>

2718
01:18:40.431 --> 01:18:41.264
<v Speaker 5>the hen house,</v>

2719
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.751
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

2720
01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:42.810
<v Speaker 5>and this is exactly,</v>

2721
01:18:42.811 --> 01:18:44.480
<v Speaker 5>it goes back to Eisenhower's warning,</v>

2722
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:45.660
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2723
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.990
<v Speaker 5>we're 50 years into that era now.</v>

2724
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.850
<v Speaker 5>And so half a century later,</v>

2725
01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:55.040
<v Speaker 5>as big of a screw up as it was in 1961 when Eisenhower warned us about it,</v>

2726
01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.050
<v Speaker 5>it's 10 times worse than that now.</v>

2727
01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:57.490
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2728
01:18:57.490 --> 01:19:02.490
<v Speaker 5>and so much so that I have concluded that the way we change the dynamic on this</v>

2729
01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 5>is that the people lead,</v>

2730
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:05.240
<v Speaker 5>the leaders will have to follow.</v>

2731
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:06.770
<v Speaker 5>We do the disclosure,</v>

2732
01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.570
<v Speaker 5>we bring out these technologies,</v>

2733
01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.580
<v Speaker 5>we set up teams to make contact,</v>

2734
01:19:10.581 --> 01:19:12.230
<v Speaker 5>and we just bypass the government.</v>

2735
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:15.500
<v Speaker 5>The evidence that you have this,</v>

2736
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:15.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2737
01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.480
<v Speaker 5>or possible evidence of this,</v>

2738
01:19:17.481 --> 01:19:17.680
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2739
01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.820
<v Speaker 5>alien life before that,</v>

2740
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:21.150
<v Speaker 5>this is a more recent thing.</v>

2741
01:19:21.151 --> 01:19:22.130
<v Speaker 5>This is fairly recent,</v>

2742
01:19:22.131 --> 01:19:22.520
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2743
01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.271
<v Speaker 5>Before that,</v>

2744
01:19:23.271 --> 01:19:25.700
<v Speaker 5>what was the most compelling piece of physical evidence that you've ever</v>

2745
01:19:25.701 --> 01:19:26.534
<v Speaker 5>encountered?</v>

2746
01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.350
<v Speaker 5>I would have to say that it's the,</v>

2747
01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:33.680
<v Speaker 5>it's these really well documented complex cases that involve,</v>

2748
01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:34.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2749
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.390
<v Speaker 5>documents,</v>

2750
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:40.450
<v Speaker 5>radar cases with photographs and multiple corroborating credible witnesses such</v>

2751
01:19:40.461 --> 01:19:41.210
<v Speaker 5>as playlists,</v>

2752
01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.410
<v Speaker 5>landing sites.</v>

2753
01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:43.641
<v Speaker 5>We do,</v>

2754
01:19:43.641 --> 01:19:44.301
<v Speaker 5>and I actually,</v>

2755
01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:44.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2756
01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:48.200
<v Speaker 5>we have been given materials from where the sites of land in delivery anomalous.</v>

2757
01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:48.570
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2758
01:19:48.570 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 5>what a great case that's in the French files that they released in the Japan was</v>

2759
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:55.220
<v Speaker 5>a coach Japan this through space agency like NASA,</v>

2760
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2761
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:59.780
<v Speaker 5>release was the pro bono case of 1981,</v>

2762
01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:00.614
<v Speaker 5>I believe,</v>

2763
01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:05.220
<v Speaker 5>when a one of these objects landed in a lavender field of all places.</v>

2764
01:20:05.221 --> 01:20:06.470
<v Speaker 5>So we're blessed to smelled.</v>

2765
01:20:06.471 --> 01:20:06.960
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

2766
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:07.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2767
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 5>well everyone's a commercial lavender farm and I'm so cool.</v>

2768
01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:12.180
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2769
01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.430
<v Speaker 5>and it was wee hours in the morning and this thing lands,</v>

2770
01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:16.110
<v Speaker 5>the farmer comes out and,</v>

2771
01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:16.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2772
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:17.183
<v Speaker 5>is this,</v>

2773
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:17.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2774
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.170
<v Speaker 5>disc shaped craft hold?</v>

2775
01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.013
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2776
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2777
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.630
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2778
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:25.050
<v Speaker 5>I think it was in the 50 foot diameter range and there were these little beans</v>

2779
01:20:25.051 --> 01:20:26.520
<v Speaker 5>outside picking lavender.</v>

2780
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:27.810
<v Speaker 5>Now this sounds crazy,</v>

2781
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:28.570
<v Speaker 5>like a amount of science</v>

2782
01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:28.910
<v Speaker 7>fiction.</v>

2783
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:30.340
<v Speaker 7>How little like you're a little guy.</v>

2784
01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:30.980
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2785
01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:31.140
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

2786
01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:31.973
<v Speaker 7>These are</v>

2787
01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.100
<v Speaker 5>from what I remember like four feet,</v>

2788
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:36.390
<v Speaker 5>five feet in that range and then it,</v>

2789
01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:40.280
<v Speaker 5>but it left this spot where it hit landed and it,</v>

2790
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:41.390
<v Speaker 5>there were anomalies,</v>

2791
01:20:41.391 --> 01:20:42.290
<v Speaker 5>electromagnetic,</v>

2792
01:20:42.650 --> 01:20:42.741
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2793
01:20:42.741 --> 01:20:43.400
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

2794
01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:43.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2795
01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:45.140
<v Speaker 5>radiation into the soil.</v>

2796
01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.990
<v Speaker 5>And this was actually studied by the French government,</v>

2797
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:50.240
<v Speaker 5>occluded to be an absolutely real case,</v>

2798
01:20:50.241 --> 01:20:51.530
<v Speaker 5>just like the bent waters,</v>

2799
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:56.950
<v Speaker 5>Royal Air Force Base case in England was determined to be an authentic case of a</v>

2800
01:20:57.141 --> 01:20:57.950
<v Speaker 5>landing.</v>

2801
01:20:57.950 --> 01:21:02.950
<v Speaker 5>So these sort of landing cases that have also now at the time,</v>

2802
01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:04.160
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2803
01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.630
<v Speaker 5>there weren't many people coming forward.</v>

2804
01:21:05.631 --> 01:21:08.570
<v Speaker 5>Now we have all these military people coming forward corroborating.</v>

2805
01:21:08.571 --> 01:21:09.081
<v Speaker 5>They were there,</v>

2806
01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:12.800
<v Speaker 5>they saw this and now the documents are getting released from the UK and France.</v>

2807
01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.500
<v Speaker 5>But in the United States it's still a black hole.</v>

2808
01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.340
<v Speaker 7>Now we're going to play your,</v>

2809
01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.910
<v Speaker 7>your trailer for the upcoming film series.</v>

2810
01:21:20.911 --> 01:21:21.490
<v Speaker 7>You got to pull that.</v>

2811
01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:22.323
<v Speaker 7>Brian,</v>

2812
01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:23.310
<v Speaker 7>is it cute?</v>

2813
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:28.050
<v Speaker 7>All the way through because I know we said 2012 with the world still burning oil</v>

2814
01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:29.160
<v Speaker 7>and gas and coal.</v>

2815
01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:34.260
<v Speaker 7>When we have had all the information we need to have had a completely new</v>

2816
01:21:34.261 --> 01:21:35.094
<v Speaker 7>civilization.</v>

2817
01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:39.580
<v Speaker 7>Dr. Steven Greer is an absolutely hero</v>

2818
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:41.270
<v Speaker 3>and the councils of government.</v>

2819
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:46.810
<v Speaker 3>We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought by</v>

2820
01:21:48.171 --> 01:21:50.180
<v Speaker 3>the military industrial complex,</v>

2821
01:21:51.010 --> 01:21:51.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2822
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:55.120
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of billions of dollars public of the little noise.</v>

2823
01:21:55.570 --> 01:21:56.211
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2824
01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:57.230
<v Speaker 3>sit down and shut up.</v>

2825
01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:07.340
<v Speaker 3>I was told to talk not to listen.</v>

2826
01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm learning to listen.</v>

2827
01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:14.090
<v Speaker 7>The primary purpose is to train people to understand these other civilizations</v>

2828
01:22:14.381 --> 01:22:15.220
<v Speaker 7>and their cultures.</v>

2829
01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:17.980
<v Speaker 7>I don't give a God damn what anyone else says about it.</v>

2830
01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:22.480
<v Speaker 7>I saw that like who do you fel without them looking at you like you ain't</v>

2831
01:22:22.481 --> 01:22:26.600
<v Speaker 7>wrapped too tight and I was a part of the United States air force cover up for</v>

2832
01:22:26.601 --> 01:22:27.434
<v Speaker 7>18 years.</v>

2833
01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:33.610
<v Speaker 7>What we are attempting to achieve as a device which the foods the perpendicular</v>

2834
01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:34.810
<v Speaker 7>force of gravity,</v>

2835
01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.190
<v Speaker 7>when we look at our data,</v>

2836
01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:38.620
<v Speaker 7>we lost 7% the weight.</v>

2837
01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:42.130
<v Speaker 7>We now have the technology to take the t home.</v>

2838
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:45.730
<v Speaker 7>The consciousness is at once the most familiar thing to us and the most</v>

2839
01:22:45.731 --> 01:22:46.564
<v Speaker 7>mysterious.</v>

2840
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:48.010
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't take much effort.</v>

2841
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:49.330
<v Speaker 7>Did you just clear your mind?</v>

2842
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:52.030
<v Speaker 7>People are afraid of looking at technology.</v>

2843
01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:55.290
<v Speaker 7>All Brown stuff got basically suppressed for many years.</v>

2844
01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:56.293
<v Speaker 7>Can you got murdered?</v>

2845
01:22:57.430 --> 01:23:02.140
<v Speaker 7>Problem is not proving that you oppose exists is when you begin to expose the</v>

2846
01:23:02.141 --> 01:23:05.880
<v Speaker 7>energy and propulsion system behind how they're getting here.</v>

2847
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:23.733
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2848
01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:31.320
<v Speaker 6>That little thing freaked me out.</v>

2849
01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.193
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2850
01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:33.451
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2851
01:23:33.451 --> 01:23:34.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2852
01:23:34.190 --> 01:23:35.520
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean to sound callous,</v>

2853
01:23:35.521 --> 01:23:36.090
<v Speaker 6>but being a,</v>

2854
01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:36.330
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2855
01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:36.781
<v Speaker 6>doctor,</v>

2856
01:23:36.781 --> 01:23:37.950
<v Speaker 6>I've seen so many worse things,</v>

2857
01:23:37.951 --> 01:23:39.040
<v Speaker 6>but it's actually fascinating.</v>

2858
01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:39.751
<v Speaker 6>Fascinating.</v>

2859
01:23:39.751 --> 01:23:41.880
<v Speaker 6>I mean freak me out and not that it's a dead body.</v>

2860
01:23:41.890 --> 01:23:42.980
<v Speaker 6>I've seen things.</v>

2861
01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.980
<v Speaker 6>It freaked me out that that might be a life form by the way.</v>

2862
01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.010
<v Speaker 6>He was a life form.</v>

2863
01:23:47.011 --> 01:23:49.200
<v Speaker 6>We know for a fact it was a life form what it was,</v>

2864
01:23:49.201 --> 01:23:50.040
<v Speaker 6>what we're investigating.</v>

2865
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:50.910
<v Speaker 6>And I think that,</v>

2866
01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:51.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2867
01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:51.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2868
01:23:51.930 --> 01:23:54.330
<v Speaker 6>one of our witnesses who was on a retrieval team,</v>

2869
01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.193
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2870
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:56.310
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2871
01:23:56.310 --> 01:24:00.630
<v Speaker 6>of retrieving extra terrestrial bodies from craft that we had targeted,</v>

2872
01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:01.493
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2873
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:02.250
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2874
01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:02.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2875
01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.160
<v Speaker 6>was talking about the fact that there are many different species that had been</v>

2876
01:24:05.161 --> 01:24:06.420
<v Speaker 6>cataloged over the years.</v>

2877
01:24:06.421 --> 01:24:06.600
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2878
01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.440
<v Speaker 6>and at one point,</v>

2879
01:24:07.441 --> 01:24:08.640
<v Speaker 6>I think it was in the late sixties,</v>

2880
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:12.600
<v Speaker 6>there were like 68 or 69 or something in that range.</v>

2881
01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:13.380
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2882
01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:13.970
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2883
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:14.190
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2884
01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:16.290
<v Speaker 6>if you look at space and look at the stars,</v>

2885
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:19.590
<v Speaker 6>probably every stable star system has planets around it.</v>

2886
01:24:19.591 --> 01:24:19.791
<v Speaker 6>They're,</v>

2887
01:24:19.791 --> 01:24:20.610
<v Speaker 6>they're discovering.</v>

2888
01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:24.870
<v Speaker 6>And there's the likelihood that there's an enormous diversity of life out there</v>

2889
01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:25.391
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

2890
01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:27.240
<v Speaker 6>it's a statistical certainty,</v>

2891
01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:27.810
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2892
01:24:27.810 --> 01:24:29.680
<v Speaker 6>even the conventional astronomers and,</v>

2893
01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:30.051
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2894
01:24:30.051 --> 01:24:30.460
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2895
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:30.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2896
01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:31.470
<v Speaker 6>the Drake formula.</v>

2897
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.313
<v Speaker 6>What support that?</v>

2898
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:34.050
<v Speaker 6>The question is,</v>

2899
01:24:34.051 --> 01:24:34.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2900
01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.071
<v Speaker 6>have they gotten here?</v>

2901
01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:35.251
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2902
01:24:35.251 --> 01:24:36.740
<v Speaker 6>your most probably wouldn't be able to.</v>

2903
01:24:36.741 --> 01:24:39.420
<v Speaker 6>It's just like we weren't for thousands and thousands of years,</v>

2904
01:24:39.810 --> 01:24:40.360
<v Speaker 6>but is there,</v>

2905
01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.240
<v Speaker 6>there's such Hubris to think that,</v>

2906
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.721
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2907
01:24:42.721 --> 01:24:47.260
<v Speaker 6>we're at the pinnacle of the technology on earth in 2013 and we're not.</v>

2908
01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:48.590
<v Speaker 6>And I think that the,</v>

2909
01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.291
<v Speaker 6>and I think that,</v>

2910
01:24:49.291 --> 01:24:49.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2911
01:24:49.530 --> 01:24:52.710
<v Speaker 6>when you begin to look at the progression of technology once you reach him or</v>

2912
01:24:52.711 --> 01:24:55.440
<v Speaker 6>breakout point as we have in the last century here,</v>

2913
01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:56.723
<v Speaker 6>in fact,</v>

2914
01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:59.160
<v Speaker 6>most of the big breakthroughs in technologies,</v>

2915
01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.390
<v Speaker 6>no one knows about.</v>

2916
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.890
<v Speaker 6>They exist,</v>

2917
01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.420
<v Speaker 6>but they're in a classified project.</v>

2918
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:04.350
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>

2919
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:08.610
<v Speaker 6>I think as big or a bigger story than the [inaudible] story is the fact that</v>

2920
01:25:08.611 --> 01:25:09.910
<v Speaker 6>there is a cabal of,</v>

2921
01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:10.170
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2922
01:25:10.170 --> 01:25:10.711
<v Speaker 6>as I said,</v>

2923
01:25:10.711 --> 01:25:15.711
<v Speaker 6>sociopathic misanthropic folks who have decided they're macro economic grip on</v>

2924
01:25:16.081 --> 01:25:21.081
<v Speaker 6>power needs to be maintained through this sort of ruthless secrecy and where</v>

2925
01:25:21.541 --> 01:25:24.570
<v Speaker 6>they keep from the public this information,</v>

2926
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:27.750
<v Speaker 6>not because they think people are going to hurl themselves off the Brooklyn</v>

2927
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:29.370
<v Speaker 6>Bridge because we're not alone in the universe.</v>

2928
01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:32.730
<v Speaker 6>But because when this comes out and this information comes out,</v>

2929
01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:37.410
<v Speaker 6>it means that the sciences already exist so that we can get off oil and gas and</v>

2930
01:25:37.411 --> 01:25:37.920
<v Speaker 6>coal.</v>

2931
01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.070
<v Speaker 6>And you know what a Goldman Sachs guy said,</v>

2932
01:25:40.071 --> 01:25:44.490
<v Speaker 6>that's a $600 trillion not you're cracking right there trillion.</v>

2933
01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:47.250
<v Speaker 6>And because if you look at all the oil in the ground,</v>

2934
01:25:47.251 --> 01:25:48.120
<v Speaker 6>the coal in the ground,</v>

2935
01:25:48.121 --> 01:25:49.110
<v Speaker 6>the commodities trading,</v>

2936
01:25:49.111 --> 01:25:50.430
<v Speaker 6>the petrodollar system,</v>

2937
01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:51.511
<v Speaker 6>the utilities,</v>

2938
01:25:51.511 --> 01:25:52.830
<v Speaker 6>the internal combustion engines,</v>

2939
01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.510
<v Speaker 6>all of that is defunct,</v>

2940
01:25:54.570 --> 01:25:56.460
<v Speaker 6>extinct stuff or should be.</v>

2941
01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:59.520
<v Speaker 6>And so here we are cannibalizing this planet,</v>

2942
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.863
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2943
01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:05.130
<v Speaker 6>for no good reason except that there's a of folks and you look at the,</v>

2944
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.690
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2945
01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:08.600
<v Speaker 6>the sort of centralization of wealth and power there is in the world now.</v>

2946
01:26:08.601 --> 01:26:11.600
<v Speaker 6>It's the most extreme it's ever been in human history right now,</v>

2947
01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:12.613
<v Speaker 6>right this minute,</v>

2948
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:13.453
<v Speaker 6>this incident.</v>

2949
01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:14.563
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2950
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.440
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2951
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.520
<v Speaker 6>there's 200 to 300 individuals and corporations that have over half the net</v>

2952
01:26:19.521 --> 01:26:20.354
<v Speaker 6>worth of the world.</v>

2953
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:24.150
<v Speaker 4>You know the guy in the beginning of your video that says that you're a genius,</v>

2954
01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.830
<v Speaker 4>David Wilcock.</v>

2955
01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:26.783
<v Speaker 4>Do you know who that guy is?</v>

2956
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:27.973
<v Speaker 4>I know who he is.</v>

2957
01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:32.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that he also thinks that he's Edgar Casey reincarnated and shows you</v>

2958
01:26:32.011 --> 01:26:32.660
<v Speaker 4>pictures of,</v>

2959
01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:33.630
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

2960
01:26:33.631 --> 01:26:34.470
<v Speaker 4>That's news to me.</v>

2961
01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:38.790
<v Speaker 4>You're Casey's friends and how his friends look like Edgar Casey's friends.</v>

2962
01:26:39.150 --> 01:26:40.530
<v Speaker 4>You ever watched any of that guy's lectures?</v>

2963
01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:40.951
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2964
01:26:40.951 --> 01:26:41.784
<v Speaker 4>I haven't.</v>

2965
01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:42.121
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2966
01:26:42.121 --> 01:26:43.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean some of the team interviewed him,</v>

2967
01:26:43.981 --> 01:26:45.540
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to do it a little louder.</v>

2968
01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:47.340
<v Speaker 4>They might want to do a little of,</v>

2969
01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.193
<v Speaker 4>and with that one,</v>

2970
01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:51.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that anything else in your documentary is bullshit,</v>

2971
01:26:51.061 --> 01:26:54.480
<v Speaker 4>but that guy makes my radar detector go off.</v>

2972
01:26:55.290 --> 01:26:56.123
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2973
01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:57.083
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2974
01:26:57.150 --> 01:26:59.760
<v Speaker 4>the evidence that this,</v>

2975
01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:00.031
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2976
01:27:00.031 --> 01:27:02.730
<v Speaker 4>this technology has been suppressed.</v>

2977
01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:03.630
<v Speaker 4>Is there,</v>

2978
01:27:03.630 --> 01:27:08.630
<v Speaker 4>is there evidence that that like this free energy technology has been,</v>

2979
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:13.380
<v Speaker 4>there's a huge amount of evidence and you reveal this in this documentary</v>

2980
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:14.750
<v Speaker 6>whole document trail.</v>

2981
01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:19.550
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things we got some years ago was a demand from the Department of</v>

2982
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:23.450
<v Speaker 6>Defense to the FBI that they turn over the secret papers of Nikola Tesla that</v>

2983
01:27:23.451 --> 01:27:24.284
<v Speaker 6>were stolen.</v>

2984
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:26.720
<v Speaker 6>And we have this document and um,</v>

2985
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:27.351
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2986
01:27:27.351 --> 01:27:29.870
<v Speaker 6>what happened to them and what were they trying to hide?</v>

2987
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:30.770
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2988
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:32.930
<v Speaker 6>the Federation of American scientists,</v>

2989
01:27:32.931 --> 01:27:37.931
<v Speaker 6>a very big mainstream organization in Washington that has a national security,</v>

2990
01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:38.360
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2991
01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:42.860
<v Speaker 6>research project associated with the Federation of American scientists came out</v>

2992
01:27:42.861 --> 01:27:46.040
<v Speaker 6>about two years ago with a report that there were 5,000,</v>

2993
01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:51.200
<v Speaker 6>135 patents that had been seized under the National Security Act.</v>

2994
01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.410
<v Speaker 6>And that some of these things were energy related.</v>

2995
01:27:54.411 --> 01:27:57.650
<v Speaker 6>One of them in 1971 was only a,</v>

2996
01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:58.010
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2997
01:27:58.010 --> 01:28:00.710
<v Speaker 6>a solar photo voltaic generator.</v>

2998
01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:00.921
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2999
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:02.330
<v Speaker 6>we're from sunlight to electricity,</v>

3000
01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.213
<v Speaker 6>photovoltaic,</v>

3001
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:03.920
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3002
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.630
<v Speaker 6>that was more than 20% efficient.</v>

3003
01:28:05.631 --> 01:28:06.740
<v Speaker 6>Now you can't even get that now.</v>

3004
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.680
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3005
01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.440
<v Speaker 6>but meaning there was probably like 40,</v>

3006
01:28:09.441 --> 01:28:14.441
<v Speaker 6>50% turning sunlight directly into electricity and it had a national security</v>

3007
01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:15.860
<v Speaker 6>order slapped on it.</v>

3008
01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.140
<v Speaker 6>And this mainstream scientific groups,</v>

3009
01:28:18.141 --> 01:28:18.261
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3010
01:28:18.261 --> 01:28:20.210
<v Speaker 6>how could that be a threat to national security?</v>

3011
01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:24.020
<v Speaker 6>It would have been a threat to the domination of oil and coal and the</v>

3012
01:28:24.021 --> 01:28:24.950
<v Speaker 6>petrodollar system.</v>

3013
01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:25.820
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3014
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:26.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3015
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:28.730
<v Speaker 6>this is not a conspiracy theory.</v>

3016
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:32.330
<v Speaker 6>There are entities that have conspired and you look at the wealth and power</v>

3017
01:28:32.331 --> 01:28:33.410
<v Speaker 6>behind these entities.</v>

3018
01:28:33.411 --> 01:28:33.561
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3019
01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:35.270
<v Speaker 6>people have been killed for a lot less than this.</v>

3020
01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.181
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

3021
01:28:36.181 --> 01:28:37.630
<v Speaker 4>That is such a loaded word,</v>

3022
01:28:37.631 --> 01:28:38.560
<v Speaker 4>that conspiracy,</v>

3023
01:28:38.561 --> 01:28:41.040
<v Speaker 4>it's unfortunate that it's necessary to use a,</v>

3024
01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.730
<v Speaker 4>because it's been so co-opted.</v>

3025
01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:43.661
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3026
01:28:43.661 --> 01:28:43.801
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3027
01:28:43.801 --> 01:28:48.801
<v Speaker 6>I think it's really more about special interests in cartels always acting in</v>

3028
01:28:49.001 --> 01:28:49.451
<v Speaker 6>their interests.</v>

3029
01:28:49.451 --> 01:28:50.620
<v Speaker 6>And if you've got the power,</v>

3030
01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:52.320
<v Speaker 6>you're going to use it and you know,</v>

3031
01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:53.230
<v Speaker 6>here and here,</v>

3032
01:28:53.230 --> 01:28:56.530
<v Speaker 6>and here's the problem if the people allow it to happen.</v>

3033
01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:58.050
<v Speaker 6>And I was just reading an article in,</v>

3034
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3035
01:28:58.290 --> 01:28:59.800
<v Speaker 6>in the new republic about this,</v>

3036
01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:00.760
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3037
01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:01.630
<v Speaker 6>that you,</v>

3038
01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:02.800
<v Speaker 5>whether you're,</v>

3039
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3040
01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:04.680
<v Speaker 5>letting Saddam Hussein or,</v>

3041
01:29:04.681 --> 01:29:07.600
<v Speaker 5>or the Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi or whatever it is,</v>

3042
01:29:07.601 --> 01:29:11.200
<v Speaker 5>or you have to give them that power.</v>

3043
01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:15.250
<v Speaker 5>We give the power to the government ultimately by our pacivity.</v>

3044
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:16.690
<v Speaker 5>And so ultimately,</v>

3045
01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:16.901
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3046
01:29:16.901 --> 01:29:17.141
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3047
01:29:17.141 --> 01:29:18.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm not one of these people who runs around saying,</v>

3048
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:19.241
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3049
01:29:19.241 --> 01:29:19.541
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3050
01:29:19.541 --> 01:29:19.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3051
01:29:19.751 --> 01:29:22.600
<v Speaker 5>there are these boogie men that are doing everything and we're just hapless</v>

3052
01:29:22.601 --> 01:29:23.410
<v Speaker 5>creatures.</v>

3053
01:29:23.410 --> 01:29:24.310
<v Speaker 5>If we're allowing it,</v>

3054
01:29:24.311 --> 01:29:26.590
<v Speaker 5>if we're not part of the solution,</v>

3055
01:29:26.591 --> 01:29:27.424
<v Speaker 5>we're part of the problem.</v>

3056
01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.001
<v Speaker 5>If we're gonna,</v>

3057
01:29:28.001 --> 01:29:31.990
<v Speaker 5>if we're allowing it by our inaction and pacivity cause we're one of the bread</v>

3058
01:29:31.991 --> 01:29:33.670
<v Speaker 5>and circus people sitting around eating,</v>

3059
01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:34.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3060
01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.770
<v Speaker 5>Cheetos and watching Jay Leno,</v>

3061
01:29:35.771 --> 01:29:36.604
<v Speaker 5>which is fine,</v>

3062
01:29:36.670 --> 01:29:39.610
<v Speaker 5>but if that's all we're doing and we're not trying to fix this problem,</v>

3063
01:29:39.970 --> 01:29:40.631
<v Speaker 5>then you know,</v>

3064
01:29:40.631 --> 01:29:45.310
<v Speaker 5>obviously the passivity of the public and our politicians who don't want to risk</v>

3065
01:29:45.311 --> 01:29:50.080
<v Speaker 5>their career or danger in that power vacuum,</v>

3066
01:29:50.290 --> 01:29:52.360
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have these sorts of people step and,</v>

3067
01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:52.801
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3068
01:29:52.801 --> 01:29:54.520
<v Speaker 5>and I think there's a power vacuum,</v>

3069
01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:55.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3070
01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.700
<v Speaker 5>that existed for a little while after World War II.</v>

3071
01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.590
<v Speaker 5>They gave an entry to these folks.</v>

3072
01:29:59.650 --> 01:30:00.710
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

3073
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:04.210
<v Speaker 5>I think that it will continue for as long as we let them do it.</v>

3074
01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:08.220
<v Speaker 4>I think it's pretty obvious when you look at the fact that this is the age of</v>

3075
01:30:08.221 --> 01:30:12.030
<v Speaker 4>information where information is being distributed more freely and more easily</v>

3076
01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:12.810
<v Speaker 4>than ever before.</v>

3077
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3078
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.290
<v Speaker 4>Yet,</v>

3079
01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:17.580
<v Speaker 4>this is also the age where the government is continuing to attack the bill of</v>

3080
01:30:17.581 --> 01:30:18.180
<v Speaker 4>rights.</v>

3081
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:23.180
<v Speaker 4>Continuing to slowly but surely restrict our rights and civil liberties and make</v>

3082
01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:27.540
<v Speaker 4>it so that if they deem you a threat to the nation in any way,</v>

3083
01:30:27.541 --> 01:30:28.374
<v Speaker 4>shape or form,</v>

3084
01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:29.760
<v Speaker 4>they can essentially detain you.</v>

3085
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:31.560
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to do anything legal,</v>

3086
01:30:31.561 --> 01:30:33.030
<v Speaker 4>they don't have to contact your family.</v>

3087
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:35.610
<v Speaker 4>This is all stuff that's being passed now.</v>

3088
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:40.910
<v Speaker 4>And that seems to me to point to the fact that they're looking at this w w w</v>

3089
01:30:41.581 --> 01:30:42.181
<v Speaker 4>what is the,</v>

3090
01:30:42.181 --> 01:30:42.781
<v Speaker 4>what's where,</v>

3091
01:30:42.781 --> 01:30:43.441
<v Speaker 4>where's it going?</v>

3092
01:30:43.441 --> 01:30:43.711
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>

3093
01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:45.030
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it on a graph,</v>

3094
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:45.831
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it,</v>

3095
01:30:45.831 --> 01:30:47.490
<v Speaker 4>if you project the future,</v>

3096
01:30:47.670 --> 01:30:47.821
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3097
01:30:47.821 --> 01:30:51.660
<v Speaker 4>it's going towards some ultimate free information space.</v>

3098
01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.190
<v Speaker 4>And if it gets to that,</v>

3099
01:30:53.191 --> 01:30:56.790
<v Speaker 4>then it's going to be revealed exactly how much fucker he's been going on for</v>

3100
01:30:56.791 --> 01:31:00.840
<v Speaker 4>all these decades and how much craziness has been going on behind the scenes.</v>

3101
01:31:00.841 --> 01:31:02.730
<v Speaker 4>And it's going to come to a point in time,</v>

3102
01:31:02.731 --> 01:31:05.490
<v Speaker 4>or the government's gonna have to be accountable for where all the money goes</v>

3103
01:31:05.491 --> 01:31:06.840
<v Speaker 4>every year in tax dollars.</v>

3104
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:08.040
<v Speaker 4>And right now they're not.</v>

3105
01:31:08.041 --> 01:31:09.390
<v Speaker 4>You give them your tax dollars,</v>

3106
01:31:09.391 --> 01:31:10.320
<v Speaker 4>you don't get a receipt,</v>

3107
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:11.790
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what the fuck happens.</v>

3108
01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:14.420
<v Speaker 4>There's a con congressional budget meetings and they,</v>

3109
01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.120
<v Speaker 4>the Senate,</v>

3110
01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:15.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3111
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:20.010
<v Speaker 4>gets together and the president puts out his plan and the financial people get</v>

3112
01:31:20.011 --> 01:31:20.730
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>

3113
01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:21.301
<v Speaker 4>But what,</v>

3114
01:31:21.301 --> 01:31:25.800
<v Speaker 4>how much access do we actually have as to where your doctor,</v>

3115
01:31:25.801 --> 01:31:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Steven Greer's financial records are your tax dollars go?</v>

3116
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:30.090
<v Speaker 4>Almost nothing.</v>

3117
01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:30.241
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3118
01:31:30.241 --> 01:31:30.700
<v Speaker 5>we don't know.</v>

3119
01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:32.370
<v Speaker 5>And even the folks who,</v>

3120
01:31:32.371 --> 01:31:33.204
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3121
01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:36.870
<v Speaker 5>I know an auditor in it for the federal government who audits Northrop Grumman,</v>

3122
01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.311
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

3123
01:31:38.311 --> 01:31:42.060
<v Speaker 5>one of the problems is that once you get to a compartment compartment it project</v>

3124
01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:44.610
<v Speaker 5>that's eyes only and it's unacknowledged,</v>

3125
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:45.960
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to tell you anything.</v>

3126
01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.550
<v Speaker 5>They won't even acknowledge it exists.</v>

3127
01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.181
<v Speaker 5>So how,</v>

3128
01:31:48.181 --> 01:31:49.590
<v Speaker 5>is there any check and balance on that?</v>

3129
01:31:49.710 --> 01:31:51.020
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially a dictatorship.</v>

3130
01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3131
01:31:51.230 --> 01:31:51.951
<v Speaker 4>When it gets to that,</v>

3132
01:31:51.951 --> 01:31:52.161
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

3133
01:31:52.161 --> 01:31:52.341
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3134
01:31:52.341 --> 01:31:52.551
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3135
01:31:52.551 --> 01:31:54.230
<v Speaker 4>you're essentially dealing with a dictatorship.</v>

3136
01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:56.060
<v Speaker 4>It's just dressed up as a democracy.</v>

3137
01:31:56.061 --> 01:31:58.100
<v Speaker 4>But their ability to act as complete.</v>

3138
01:31:58.101 --> 01:31:58.910
<v Speaker 4>We there,</v>

3139
01:31:58.910 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 4>there they have total impunity.</v>

3140
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:01.360
<v Speaker 5>They can do whatever the fuck they want.</v>

3141
01:32:01.361 --> 01:32:01.661
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

3142
01:32:01.661 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>

3143
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:03.790
<v Speaker 5>they don't have to listen to me if we let them.</v>

3144
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:05.780
<v Speaker 5>Here's the other problem with that,</v>

3145
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:06.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3146
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:06.811
<v Speaker 5>is that the,</v>

3147
01:32:06.811 --> 01:32:08.170
<v Speaker 5>the macro economic system,</v>

3148
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:08.351
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3149
01:32:08.351 --> 01:32:10.360
<v Speaker 5>we're supposed to be a free market economy.</v>

3150
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:10.751
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3151
01:32:10.751 --> 01:32:15.340
<v Speaker 5>how free can the market be if there've been decades of confiscation and</v>

3152
01:32:15.341 --> 01:32:17.440
<v Speaker 5>suppression of these advanced,</v>

3153
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:18.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3154
01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:22.150
<v Speaker 5>trans dimensional energy devices in the so called over unity free energy</v>

3155
01:32:22.151 --> 01:32:22.984
<v Speaker 5>devices.</v>

3156
01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.160
<v Speaker 5>And if the,</v>

3157
01:32:24.161 --> 01:32:25.540
<v Speaker 5>if that's going on,</v>

3158
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 5>a can completely lays to waste the whole concept of a free market.</v>

3159
01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:30.701
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

3160
01:32:30.701 --> 01:32:34.000
<v Speaker 5>it's a free market if you want to tinker around the edges and come out with an</v>

3161
01:32:34.001 --> 01:32:37.000
<v Speaker 5>iPhone and five instead of an iPhone four or you know,</v>

3162
01:32:37.001 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 5>whatever version of this and that.</v>

3163
01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:42.160
<v Speaker 5>But let's not forget that your computer that you think is so cool,</v>

3164
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 5>you're charging it off a grid that's a 18 hundreds coal fired power grid for the</v>

3165
01:32:46.391 --> 01:32:47.224
<v Speaker 5>most part.</v>

3166
01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:47.860
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

3167
01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:48.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3168
01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:53.260
<v Speaker 5>we really have to wake up to the fact that our society has been held back</v>

3169
01:32:53.771 --> 01:32:54.604
<v Speaker 5>retarded.</v>

3170
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:59.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm really seriously by this kind of secrecy.</v>

3171
01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:03.190
<v Speaker 5>And so the secrecy is actually becoming a threat to our continued,</v>

3172
01:33:03.191 --> 01:33:04.210
<v Speaker 5>not just our liberty,</v>

3173
01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:06.550
<v Speaker 5>but it's an existential threat to the planet.</v>

3174
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:07.930
<v Speaker 5>And Moreover,</v>

3175
01:33:07.931 --> 01:33:11.380
<v Speaker 5>it keeps forcing all these unintended consequences where we stay,</v>

3176
01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:12.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3177
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:13.840
<v Speaker 5>encamped in the Middle East.</v>

3178
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.321
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3179
01:33:14.321 --> 01:33:18.340
<v Speaker 5>the buzzword in Washington because of our vital national security interests.</v>

3180
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.761
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3181
01:33:18.761 --> 01:33:19.960
<v Speaker 5>that's code for oil.</v>

3182
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:21.460
<v Speaker 5>Just forget the BS.</v>

3183
01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.020
<v Speaker 5>That means oil because you say,</v>

3184
01:33:23.021 --> 01:33:23.291
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3185
01:33:23.291 --> 01:33:24.130
<v Speaker 5>what about Israel?</v>

3186
01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:26.980
<v Speaker 5>Israel has two or 300 nuclear weapons and they might,</v>

3187
01:33:26.981 --> 01:33:28.060
<v Speaker 5>I live there for three years.</v>

3188
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.901
<v Speaker 5>Believe me,</v>

3189
01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:30.470
<v Speaker 5>when I tell you the thing,</v>

3190
01:33:30.490 --> 01:33:31.323
<v Speaker 5>they care of this.</v>

3191
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:31.631
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3192
01:33:31.631 --> 01:33:31.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3193
01:33:31.811 --> 01:33:31.961
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

3194
01:33:31.961 --> 01:33:32.271
<v Speaker 5>if they,</v>

3195
01:33:32.271 --> 01:33:34.330
<v Speaker 5>if there's an existential threat to Israel,</v>

3196
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3197
01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 5>they can handle it.</v>

3198
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:37.960
<v Speaker 5>They don't need big brother America there,</v>

3199
01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:39.070
<v Speaker 5>but don't they mean,</v>

3200
01:33:39.071 --> 01:33:39.490
<v Speaker 5>isn't it,</v>

3201
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 5>don't they get a tremendous amount of funding from us and weapon and they get</v>

3202
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:42.611
<v Speaker 5>funding.</v>

3203
01:33:42.611 --> 01:33:43.600
<v Speaker 5>But I'm just saying we don't,</v>

3204
01:33:43.601 --> 01:33:46.780
<v Speaker 5>that's not the reason we were an all those vast areas of the Middle East.</v>

3205
01:33:46.781 --> 01:33:48.640
<v Speaker 5>It's because of the oil intercourse.</v>

3206
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:49.070
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3207
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:49.901
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

3208
01:33:49.901 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 5>and this becomes a question of,</v>

3209
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.133
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3210
01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.093
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

3211
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:54.610
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3212
01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:57.790
<v Speaker 5>because if you have a device that would fit on the table here,</v>

3213
01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:01.620
<v Speaker 5>that run your house when you don't have to be on the grid or your car,</v>

3214
01:34:01.621 --> 01:34:04.540
<v Speaker 5>put it in the boot of your car and you have enormous amount of power,</v>

3215
01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:05.110
<v Speaker 5>electric,</v>

3216
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.943
<v Speaker 5>how would that work?</v>

3217
01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:07.600
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3218
01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.590
<v Speaker 5>those are called,</v>

3219
01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:09.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3220
01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.780
<v Speaker 5>zero point or quantum vacuum,</v>

3221
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:11.883
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3222
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.330
<v Speaker 5>electromagnetic generators.</v>

3223
01:34:13.331 --> 01:34:16.180
<v Speaker 5>And basically through very high voltage systems,</v>

3224
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:21.510
<v Speaker 5>you create a vector into this baseline energy field that it really holds the</v>

3225
01:34:22.421 --> 01:34:23.254
<v Speaker 5>universe together.</v>

3226
01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:23.891
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3227
01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:27.490
<v Speaker 5>they start talking about the Higgs field and the negative energy that matter of</v>

3228
01:34:27.491 --> 01:34:28.031
<v Speaker 5>the universe.</v>

3229
01:34:28.031 --> 01:34:32.650
<v Speaker 5>But for years it's been proven that the zero point energy field exists through</v>

3230
01:34:32.651 --> 01:34:32.830
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3231
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:34.210
<v Speaker 5>what's called the castle mirror effect.</v>

3232
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:36.460
<v Speaker 5>And don't get into the Arcana of the physics of it.</v>

3233
01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:38.290
<v Speaker 5>But this was published in mainstream journals.</v>

3234
01:34:38.410 --> 01:34:39.280
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>

3235
01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.500
<v Speaker 5>how do you tap it and can you,</v>

3236
01:34:41.501 --> 01:34:42.251
<v Speaker 5>and the answer is yes,</v>

3237
01:34:42.251 --> 01:34:43.084
<v Speaker 5>and it happened,</v>

3238
01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:46.420
<v Speaker 5>but they keep suppressing scientists and inventors who come up with it.</v>

3239
01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.840
<v Speaker 5>There was a man that I know who worked at Lawrence Berkeley labs and he was</v>

3240
01:34:49.841 --> 01:34:54.841
<v Speaker 5>using a coil to ray around a Barium titanate crystal and using very high</v>

3241
01:34:55.991 --> 01:34:56.824
<v Speaker 5>voltages,</v>

3242
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:57.380
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3243
01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 5>with a</v>

3244
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:59.630
<v Speaker 6>certain hertz,</v>

3245
01:34:59.631 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 6>certain pulses.</v>

3246
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:05.060
<v Speaker 6>He was able to get 10 times more energy out than was going in because the</v>

3247
01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:08.900
<v Speaker 6>Chrysalis structure was tapping into this zero point energy field that is in the</v>

3248
01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:10.340
<v Speaker 6>fabric of space and time.</v>

3249
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:12.350
<v Speaker 6>So there's an enormous amount of power.</v>

3250
01:35:12.351 --> 01:35:14.930
<v Speaker 6>It's been estimated that every cubic centimeter of space,</v>

3251
01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 6>not outer space of space in this room has enough energy to run the earth for a</v>

3252
01:35:18.501 --> 01:35:19.430
<v Speaker 6>day if you could tap it.</v>

3253
01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:20.810
<v Speaker 6>So the question becomes,</v>

3254
01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:21.890
<v Speaker 6>if you can do that,</v>

3255
01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.660
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to need to have your car filled up at a gas station or utility</v>

3256
01:35:26.661 --> 01:35:28.130
<v Speaker 6>to con ed or whoever it is.</v>

3257
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:29.450
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3258
01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.950
<v Speaker 6>those sort of interests at Trump,</v>

3259
01:35:30.951 --> 01:35:33.470
<v Speaker 6>the technical ones to technological issues.</v>

3260
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.753
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3261
01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.710
<v Speaker 6>I believe it can be fixed.</v>

3262
01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 6>It's the strategic issue.</v>

3263
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:39.400
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem.</v>

3264
01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to stop you because I need to know about this experiment.</v>

3265
01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.930
<v Speaker 4>Where was this taking place?</v>

3266
01:35:43.931 --> 01:35:45.610
<v Speaker 4>This is this pure reviewed?</v>

3267
01:35:45.611 --> 01:35:47.170
<v Speaker 4>Is this something that has been,</v>

3268
01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.640
<v Speaker 6>it was confiscated a,</v>

3269
01:35:48.641 --> 01:35:51.030
<v Speaker 6>the man that had this happen,</v>

3270
01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:51.750
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3271
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:53.730
<v Speaker 6>it's a physicist and a,</v>

3272
01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:56.190
<v Speaker 6>some goons broke into his lab,</v>

3273
01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.960
<v Speaker 6>broke it up at the experiment and then basically took him and put him in a</v>

3274
01:36:00.961 --> 01:36:03.240
<v Speaker 6>mental hospital in the hospital for awhile where this happened.</v>

3275
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:05.970
<v Speaker 6>Lawrence Berkeley labs in the eighties okay.</v>

3276
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:07.190
<v Speaker 6>So seventies or eighties.</v>

3277
01:36:07.210 --> 01:36:09.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't know exactly what he did.</v>

3278
01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.350
<v Speaker 6>And is it reproducible?</v>

3279
01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:10.840
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3280
01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:13.350
<v Speaker 6>I I think why has no one ever reproduce this?</v>

3281
01:36:13.410 --> 01:36:16.830
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't make any sense because you have to have a whole lot of specialized</v>

3282
01:36:16.831 --> 01:36:17.790
<v Speaker 6>equipment to do it right.</v>

3283
01:36:17.791 --> 01:36:21.920
<v Speaker 6>And people have tried what the hero now here to here is getting to the,</v>

3284
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:22.261
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>

3285
01:36:22.261 --> 01:36:27.261
<v Speaker 6>the reason I'm doing this film is that 100% of the proceeds from it are going to</v>

3286
01:36:27.331 --> 01:36:28.800
<v Speaker 6>go into build a new energy lab.</v>

3287
01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.230
<v Speaker 6>So all this stuff that we've collected can be done.</v>

3288
01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:34.980
<v Speaker 6>I think with the intelligence we've gathered in between one and two years,</v>

3289
01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.870
<v Speaker 6>we will come out with at least a generation 1.0 of these energy systems because</v>

3290
01:36:39.871 --> 01:36:43.530
<v Speaker 6>I have thousands of pages of documents on this and many,</v>

3291
01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:45.450
<v Speaker 6>many physicists who worked in these programs,</v>

3292
01:36:45.570 --> 01:36:47.760
<v Speaker 6>but you've got to have a properly equip lab.</v>

3293
01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:48.960
<v Speaker 6>You've got to have security,</v>

3294
01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:51.060
<v Speaker 6>you've got to have the whole world watching,</v>

3295
01:36:51.061 --> 01:36:53.910
<v Speaker 6>and this would not be a secret project like the skunk works at Lockheed.</v>

3296
01:36:54.150 --> 01:36:54.983
<v Speaker 6>This would be,</v>

3297
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:56.010
<v Speaker 6>I would in my,</v>

3298
01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:56.791
<v Speaker 6>it'd be like this,</v>

3299
01:36:56.791 --> 01:36:57.624
<v Speaker 6>it'd be streamed.</v>

3300
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:59.340
<v Speaker 6>So all the work going on in that lab,</v>

3301
01:36:59.341 --> 01:37:00.420
<v Speaker 6>the whole world's watching.</v>

3302
01:37:00.570 --> 01:37:00.811
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3303
01:37:00.811 --> 01:37:01.260
<v Speaker 6>Sorry,</v>

3304
01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:02.970
<v Speaker 6>because I don't think you can do this secretly.</v>

3305
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.780
<v Speaker 4>You know about this story.</v>

3306
01:37:04.781 --> 01:37:09.190
<v Speaker 4>How come you knew about this experiment tapping into zero point energy,</v>

3307
01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.130
<v Speaker 4>but this is not common knowledge amongst nuclear physicists.</v>

3308
01:37:12.131 --> 01:37:14.560
<v Speaker 4>This is not something that's discussed in the mainstream news.</v>

3309
01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:17.950
<v Speaker 4>This is not something that you can find information online and any credible</v>

3310
01:37:17.951 --> 01:37:18.580
<v Speaker 4>source.</v>

3311
01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:19.390
<v Speaker 4>No one has [inaudible].</v>

3312
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:22.960
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that if there was an experiment that tapped into such an</v>

3313
01:37:22.961 --> 01:37:25.360
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably unlimited supply of energy like that,</v>

3314
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.630
<v Speaker 4>it would be impossible to keep this under wraps,</v>

3315
01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 4>that you would keep the beak,</v>

3316
01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:32.080
<v Speaker 4>be able to keep the conversation under wraps.</v>

3317
01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:32.790
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3318
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:33.511
<v Speaker 6>that's not true.</v>

3319
01:37:33.511 --> 01:37:34.081
<v Speaker 6>And in fact,</v>

3320
01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:35.880
<v Speaker 6>if you go to the website,</v>

3321
01:37:35.881 --> 01:37:37.170
<v Speaker 6>serious disclosure.com,</v>

3322
01:37:37.171 --> 01:37:40.260
<v Speaker 6>there's a portal there to the energy research and there are thousands of</v>

3323
01:37:40.261 --> 01:37:42.030
<v Speaker 6>documents and pages of stuff,</v>

3324
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:44.880
<v Speaker 6>things that were reported in the media and then they got confiscated in</v>

3325
01:37:44.881 --> 01:37:45.714
<v Speaker 6>shutdown.</v>

3326
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:46.320
<v Speaker 6>But you're,</v>

3327
01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.610
<v Speaker 6>you're asking this question as if academia and the media are operating freely,</v>

3328
01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.140
<v Speaker 6>none under the suppressive,</v>

3329
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3330
01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.521
<v Speaker 6>behaviors.</v>

3331
01:37:53.521 --> 01:37:53.721
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3332
01:37:53.721 --> 01:37:54.160
<v Speaker 6>and I thought,</v>

3333
01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:54.330
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3334
01:37:54.330 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 6>I'm asking the actually because</v>

3335
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.550
<v Speaker 4>it just the nature of human curiosity and an incredibly brilliant,</v>

3336
01:37:59.650 --> 01:38:00.061
<v Speaker 4>brilliant,</v>

3337
01:38:00.061 --> 01:38:02.700
<v Speaker 4>intelligent men that are out there that study energy.</v>

3338
01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 4>I would think that someone would look into this and he examined it.</v>

3339
01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:05.681
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3340
01:38:05.681 --> 01:38:05.771
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

3341
01:38:05.771 --> 01:38:05.921
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3342
01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:06.271
<v Speaker 6>there is,</v>

3343
01:38:06.271 --> 01:38:06.750
<v Speaker 6>and in fact,</v>

3344
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:08.870
<v Speaker 6>one of the people that we had were funding for awhile,</v>

3345
01:38:08.890 --> 01:38:09.570
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3346
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 6>before he got threatened by a former CIA director who went down to his skiff.</v>

3347
01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:15.660
<v Speaker 6>It's secure communication intelligence facility.</v>

3348
01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:16.950
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3349
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:17.460
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

3350
01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:17.790
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3351
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:20.670
<v Speaker 6>an understudy of William Bender at the University of Washington.</v>

3352
01:38:20.671 --> 01:38:23.880
<v Speaker 6>He got threatened and what they say in 1974,</v>

3353
01:38:23.881 --> 01:38:24.930
<v Speaker 6>I think it was 74,</v>

3354
01:38:24.931 --> 01:38:26.250
<v Speaker 6>he formed a company,</v>

3355
01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:26.790
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3356
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:29.640
<v Speaker 6>and he's a brilliant to one of the most brilliant people I've ever met.</v>

3357
01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:30.750
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3358
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:31.201
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>

3359
01:38:31.201 --> 01:38:32.340
<v Speaker 6>and he had developed a,</v>

3360
01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:37.110
<v Speaker 6>these trans dimensional systems using electromagnetic energy.</v>

3361
01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:38.220
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3362
01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:38.580
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3363
01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.190
<v Speaker 6>some guys came in with a national security order,</v>

3364
01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:42.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3365
01:38:42.150 --> 01:38:44.880
<v Speaker 6>told him that they were confiscating his equipment,</v>

3366
01:38:44.881 --> 01:38:45.714
<v Speaker 6>his device,</v>

3367
01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:46.411
<v Speaker 6>his notes,</v>

3368
01:38:46.411 --> 01:38:48.210
<v Speaker 6>and they were all going into the vault.</v>

3369
01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.070
<v Speaker 6>And this man's,</v>

3370
01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:50.700
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3371
01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 6>who I knew very well,</v>

3372
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.550
<v Speaker 6>who stayed at my home and it still works for 'em under contract with the CIA and</v>

3373
01:38:56.551 --> 01:38:57.480
<v Speaker 6>various groups.</v>

3374
01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.440
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3375
01:38:58.440 --> 01:38:59.610
<v Speaker 6>he said that basically,</v>

3376
01:38:59.630 --> 01:38:59.940
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3377
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:04.940
<v Speaker 6>the intelligence community owns his soul and that he can only do only so much it</v>

3378
01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.520
<v Speaker 6>take it take to provide information and bring this out.</v>

3379
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:09.780
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3380
01:39:09.781 --> 01:39:09.991
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3381
01:39:09.991 --> 01:39:12.810
<v Speaker 6>people who think that doesn't happen or living in very naive world.</v>

3382
01:39:12.811 --> 01:39:13.980
<v Speaker 6>This is 40 years ago though,</v>

3383
01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:14.730
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about.</v>

3384
01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:15.070
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3385
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:15.903
<v Speaker 6>and it would happen.</v>

3386
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.320
<v Speaker 6>That was 40 years ago when hit when the thing he started.</v>

3387
01:39:19.321 --> 01:39:20.190
<v Speaker 6>Then when he,</v>

3388
01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:22.260
<v Speaker 6>after I developed a relationship with him,</v>

3389
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:24.930
<v Speaker 6>he checked with his intelligence and what they called the shepherds,</v>

3390
01:39:24.931 --> 01:39:27.120
<v Speaker 6>his in his handlers in the intelligence community.</v>

3391
01:39:27.330 --> 01:39:27.661
<v Speaker 6>They said,</v>

3392
01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:27.841
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

3393
01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:28.910
<v Speaker 6>you can work with Dr. Greer,</v>

3394
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:32.220
<v Speaker 6>not on the propulsion stuff that flies around like a Ufo,</v>

3395
01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.380
<v Speaker 6>but just when the energy generation part of this.</v>

3396
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:37.980
<v Speaker 6>And so we provided a grant to him through my project,</v>

3397
01:39:37.981 --> 01:39:38.940
<v Speaker 6>the Orion project,</v>

3398
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.840
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3399
01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.040
<v Speaker 6>which is government limits,</v>

3400
01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:43.920
<v Speaker 6>his ability to do research on specific topics.</v>

3401
01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:45.060
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3402
01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:48.420
<v Speaker 6>well he actually is on the payroll to government now cause he was basically told</v>

3403
01:39:48.421 --> 01:39:48.781
<v Speaker 6>us this,</v>

3404
01:39:48.781 --> 01:39:50.100
<v Speaker 6>so you have no career at all.</v>

3405
01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.640
<v Speaker 6>And if he had disclosed what he had been invented in 1974 under the national</v>

3406
01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:57.810
<v Speaker 6>security or he was hit with,</v>

3407
01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.220
<v Speaker 6>he would have been imprisoned.</v>

3408
01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:00.210
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3409
01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:00.780
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3410
01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.010
<v Speaker 6>and these exists,</v>

3411
01:40:02.011 --> 01:40:02.611
<v Speaker 6>you can look it up.</v>

3412
01:40:02.611 --> 01:40:05.850
<v Speaker 6>It's section one 81 81 of the patent law and the National Security Act.</v>

3413
01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:09.270
<v Speaker 6>These national security orders happen all the time.</v>

3414
01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:09.930
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3415
01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:10.810
<v Speaker 6>but who's authorized?</v>

3416
01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:11.161
<v Speaker 6>You think?</v>

3417
01:40:11.161 --> 01:40:11.251
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3418
01:40:11.251 --> 01:40:14.520
<v Speaker 6>President Obama or the or the Senate Intelligence Committee knows that these</v>

3419
01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:16.950
<v Speaker 6>goons are out there doing this stuff.</v>

3420
01:40:16.951 --> 01:40:17.520
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3421
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.230
<v Speaker 6>And so here's this brilliant guy,</v>

3422
01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.041
<v Speaker 6>but I mean,</v>

3423
01:40:20.041 --> 01:40:21.390
<v Speaker 6>he's not like he's Rambo.</v>

3424
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:22.091
<v Speaker 6>I mean he,</v>

3425
01:40:22.091 --> 01:40:23.790
<v Speaker 6>he's an engineer and a physicist.</v>

3426
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:25.380
<v Speaker 6>So he develops this stuff.</v>

3427
01:40:25.381 --> 01:40:28.380
<v Speaker 6>A bunch of guys come in who are bad ass folks.</v>

3428
01:40:28.381 --> 01:40:29.214
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3429
01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:30.840
<v Speaker 6>And he's terrified.</v>

3430
01:40:31.530 --> 01:40:34.800
<v Speaker 6>And so then all these years later it circles back around,</v>

3431
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:37.860
<v Speaker 6>we get hold of him and what we say,</v>

3432
01:40:37.861 --> 01:40:38.100
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

3433
01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:38.341
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3434
01:40:38.341 --> 01:40:39.120
<v Speaker 6>here's,</v>

3435
01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:39.511
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3436
01:40:39.511 --> 01:40:41.370
<v Speaker 6>some funds do this,</v>

3437
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3438
01:40:41.610 --> 01:40:43.410
<v Speaker 6>for us own a generation,</v>

3439
01:40:43.411 --> 01:40:44.970
<v Speaker 6>1.0 version of this something.</v>

3440
01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:45.631
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3441
01:40:45.631 --> 01:40:47.130
<v Speaker 6>and check with your intelligence folks.</v>

3442
01:40:47.131 --> 01:40:51.390
<v Speaker 6>And they cleared him about the time he was beginning to put this thing together.</v>

3443
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.980
<v Speaker 6>A former CIA director,</v>

3444
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.180
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of goons came down in 2010,</v>

3445
01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:55.841
<v Speaker 6>this is two years,</v>

3446
01:40:55.841 --> 01:40:56.674
<v Speaker 6>three years ago,</v>

3447
01:40:56.890 --> 01:40:57.723
<v Speaker 6>threatened him,</v>

3448
01:40:57.730 --> 01:40:58.690
<v Speaker 6>threatened his family.</v>

3449
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:00.810
<v Speaker 6>And so like,</v>

3450
01:41:00.811 --> 01:41:01.644
<v Speaker 6>how do I say,</v>

3451
01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.870
<v Speaker 6>you are not going to do this any further and made it very clear.</v>

3452
01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:05.680
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3453
01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:09.100
<v Speaker 6>one of the guides at the naval research labs I've worked with for years who has</v>

3454
01:41:09.101 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 6>some of this information,</v>

3455
01:41:09.941 --> 01:41:11.770
<v Speaker 6>he was till we will kill you,</v>

3456
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:12.783
<v Speaker 6>your wife,</v>

3457
01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:13.630
<v Speaker 6>your children,</v>

3458
01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:16.060
<v Speaker 6>and your grandchildren if you step out of line on this.</v>

3459
01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.710
<v Speaker 6>So I don't think that,</v>

3460
01:41:17.711 --> 01:41:17.861
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3461
01:41:17.861 --> 01:41:21.580
<v Speaker 6>in terms of dealing with this that you're going to be able to do it under any</v>

3462
01:41:21.581 --> 01:41:24.070
<v Speaker 6>kind of where someone's trying to do it quietly,</v>

3463
01:41:24.071 --> 01:41:24.910
<v Speaker 6>secretively,</v>

3464
01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.980
<v Speaker 6>it's going to have to be in plain sight.</v>

3465
01:41:27.010 --> 01:41:30.810
<v Speaker 6>So what you're saying is that several people have tried to do this in the past</v>

3466
01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:34.120
<v Speaker 6>hundred every time and every time they do it they're threatened and stopped from</v>

3467
01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:34.481
<v Speaker 6>doing it.</v>

3468
01:41:34.481 --> 01:41:34.990
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3469
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:39.990
<v Speaker 6>What specialized pieces of equipment would be necessary to produce this zero</v>

3470
01:41:40.001 --> 01:41:42.310
<v Speaker 6>point energy field thing?</v>

3471
01:41:42.670 --> 01:41:42.911
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3472
01:41:42.911 --> 01:41:43.720
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

3473
01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.290
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3474
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:44.831
<v Speaker 6>you know your,</v>

3475
01:41:44.831 --> 01:41:48.100
<v Speaker 6>your computer in lights who are running on one 10 or 2020,</v>

3476
01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:48.731
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

3477
01:41:48.731 --> 01:41:49.564
<v Speaker 6>voltage,</v>

3478
01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:53.830
<v Speaker 6>the voltage is involved in these trans dimensional physics is in the thousands</v>

3479
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:54.490
<v Speaker 6>to millions of volts,</v>

3480
01:41:54.490 --> 01:41:55.690
<v Speaker 6>but it very low current.</v>

3481
01:41:56.290 --> 01:41:59.980
<v Speaker 6>And so you have to have special analyzers and generators for that.</v>

3482
01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:00.760
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3483
01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:00.941
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3484
01:42:00.941 --> 01:42:03.280
<v Speaker 6>there is a science to this and we understand it very,</v>

3485
01:42:03.281 --> 01:42:04.210
<v Speaker 6>very well actually.</v>

3486
01:42:04.630 --> 01:42:05.110
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3487
01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:06.730
<v Speaker 6>but building up that lab,</v>

3488
01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:06.881
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3489
01:42:06.881 --> 01:42:08.230
<v Speaker 6>we looked into the equipment just,</v>

3490
01:42:08.231 --> 01:42:10.210
<v Speaker 6>is it like half $1 million just to do that?</v>

3491
01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:11.290
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3492
01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:14.110
<v Speaker 6>and so what you have to do is it seems like nothing,</v>

3493
01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:15.580
<v Speaker 6>if you're talking about half $1 billion,</v>

3494
01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:16.460
<v Speaker 6>they can bring newness.</v>

3495
01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:17.440
<v Speaker 6>That's just the equipment.</v>

3496
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:17.581
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3497
01:42:17.581 --> 01:42:17.680
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3498
01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:17.801
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3499
01:42:17.801 --> 01:42:18.340
<v Speaker 6>This no,</v>

3500
01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:18.971
<v Speaker 6>no building,</v>

3501
01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:19.721
<v Speaker 6>no personnel,</v>

3502
01:42:19.721 --> 01:42:20.291
<v Speaker 6>no staff,</v>

3503
01:42:20.291 --> 01:42:20.801
<v Speaker 6>no nothing.</v>

3504
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:21.321
<v Speaker 6>Just you know,</v>

3505
01:42:21.321 --> 01:42:22.090
<v Speaker 6>and the machine.</v>

3506
01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:22.780
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3507
01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:23.630
<v Speaker 6>but so I,</v>

3508
01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:24.700
<v Speaker 6>we estimate,</v>

3509
01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:25.160
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3510
01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:25.541
<v Speaker 6>we have,</v>

3511
01:42:25.541 --> 01:42:26.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3512
01:42:26.150 --> 01:42:28.510
<v Speaker 6>a budget for about a two year program,</v>

3513
01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:31.420
<v Speaker 6>around $6 million to put a lab together,</v>

3514
01:42:31.421 --> 01:42:33.160
<v Speaker 6>put these really brilliant people in it,</v>

3515
01:42:33.370 --> 01:42:37.420
<v Speaker 6>get the right equipment and built up these experiments and do real science.</v>

3516
01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:40.720
<v Speaker 6>But the problem is you have people off on their own doing this,</v>

3517
01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:45.460
<v Speaker 6>that stumble across this phenomenon and they get shut down or threatened or</v>

3518
01:42:45.461 --> 01:42:46.294
<v Speaker 6>bought out.</v>

3519
01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:47.230
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3520
01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:47.741
<v Speaker 6>then,</v>

3521
01:42:47.741 --> 01:42:48.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3522
01:42:48.131 --> 01:42:49.300
<v Speaker 6>you had the folks who,</v>

3523
01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:50.523
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3524
01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.513
<v Speaker 6>will be,</v>

3525
01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:52.540
<v Speaker 6>instead of threatened,</v>

3526
01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:53.920
<v Speaker 6>they'll just be offered money.</v>

3527
01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:54.491
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3528
01:42:54.491 --> 01:42:55.420
<v Speaker 6>so a lot of people,</v>

3529
01:42:55.570 --> 01:42:55.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3530
01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:56.101
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3531
01:42:56.101 --> 01:42:59.070
<v Speaker 6>Dr. Beard and tells this story of a man that had one of these generators and,</v>

3532
01:42:59.071 --> 01:43:02.410
<v Speaker 6>and he was testing it and it was a legitimate over unity system.</v>

3533
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:03.341
<v Speaker 6>And the,</v>

3534
01:43:03.341 --> 01:43:04.300
<v Speaker 6>then the guy disappeared.</v>

3535
01:43:04.301 --> 01:43:07.930
<v Speaker 6>And the next time you saw the guy who had a Ferrari in an Armani suit and the</v>

3536
01:43:07.931 --> 01:43:10.210
<v Speaker 6>guy never had a pot to pee in as it were.</v>

3537
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.841
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3538
01:43:10.841 --> 01:43:11.230
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3539
01:43:11.230 --> 01:43:12.520
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

3540
01:43:12.610 --> 01:43:15.970
<v Speaker 6>what we found with this is that a lot of times folks will just say,</v>

3541
01:43:15.971 --> 01:43:16.600
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

3542
01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:16.871
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3543
01:43:16.871 --> 01:43:17.770
<v Speaker 6>we're going to buy this.</v>

3544
01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:18.220
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3545
01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:19.053
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3546
01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:19.440
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3547
01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.720
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people don't believe that happens and they think that's a conspiracy</v>

3548
01:43:22.721 --> 01:43:23.170
<v Speaker 6>theory.</v>

3549
01:43:23.170 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 6>It isn't a conspiracy theory.</v>

3550
01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.770
<v Speaker 6>And this is why the Federation of American scientists,</v>

3551
01:43:26.771 --> 01:43:27.191
<v Speaker 6>when they said,</v>

3552
01:43:27.191 --> 01:43:27.371
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

3553
01:43:27.371 --> 01:43:28.181
<v Speaker 6>there are 5,000,</v>

3554
01:43:28.181 --> 01:43:29.830
<v Speaker 6>135 or something like that,</v>

3555
01:43:29.831 --> 01:43:31.660
<v Speaker 6>patents that had been seized.</v>

3556
01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:35.680
<v Speaker 6>Most people don't know that those national security orders can happen outside of</v>

3557
01:43:35.681 --> 01:43:36.700
<v Speaker 6>the patent process.</v>

3558
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.650
<v Speaker 6>So even if you're not going the patent route,</v>

3559
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.720
<v Speaker 6>they can go in there and just sees the damn thing.</v>

3560
01:43:41.290 --> 01:43:41.621
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3561
01:43:41.621 --> 01:43:42.550
<v Speaker 6>and what are you going to do?</v>

3562
01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:46.330
<v Speaker 6>They just seize it based on the idea that it somehow or another threat,</v>

3563
01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.380
<v Speaker 6>well there you,</v>

3564
01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:47.701
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

3565
01:43:47.701 --> 01:43:50.920
<v Speaker 6>it's Kinda like the flag in the Bible and that you'd be wrap yourself in these</v>

3566
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:51.381
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

3567
01:43:51.381 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 6>It to do all kinds</v>

3568
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:53.630
<v Speaker 5>of outrageous uh,</v>

3569
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:54.591
<v Speaker 5>behaviors.</v>

3570
01:43:54.591 --> 01:43:54.980
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3571
01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:57.410
<v Speaker 5>But I mean you can say it's national security,</v>

3572
01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:01.190
<v Speaker 5>but as this one document from the Federation of American scientists is how could</v>

3573
01:44:01.191 --> 01:44:04.130
<v Speaker 5>a solar voltaic system be a threat to the national security?</v>

3574
01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:07.820
<v Speaker 5>It would be a threat to the special interests that are calling the shots.</v>

3575
01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:11.150
<v Speaker 5>So the question becomes who's really calling the shots on these sorts of</v>

3576
01:44:11.151 --> 01:44:11.984
<v Speaker 5>decisions?</v>

3577
01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.910
<v Speaker 5>Is it in the interest of we the people?</v>

3578
01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:14.660
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3579
01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:17.140
<v Speaker 5>it's in the interest of folks who,</v>

3580
01:44:17.190 --> 01:44:18.830
<v Speaker 5>who want to protect their cartels.</v>

3581
01:44:19.690 --> 01:44:21.370
<v Speaker 1>What is your take on,</v>

3582
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3583
01:44:21.850 --> 01:44:24.340
<v Speaker 1>guys who have come clean before?</v>

3584
01:44:24.630 --> 01:44:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Guys like Dr Robert Lasar cause that guy full of shit.</v>

3585
01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:32.800
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy from area 51 that came back and said that he was a bright back</v>

3586
01:44:32.801 --> 01:44:33.640
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>

3587
01:44:33.641 --> 01:44:38.020
<v Speaker 1>some alien craft and very compelling to listen to.</v>

3588
01:44:38.021 --> 01:44:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting guy.</v>

3589
01:44:39.131 --> 01:44:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Before I understand,</v>

3590
01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:41.133
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3591
01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Stanton Freedman questioned him and in fact called him a fraud and said that</v>

3592
01:44:46.151 --> 01:44:48.800
<v Speaker 1>some of his educational background was kind of made up.</v>

3593
01:44:49.170 --> 01:44:49.530
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3594
01:44:49.530 --> 01:44:53.220
<v Speaker 5>But here's the problem with any case where you hang it on one person like that,</v>

3595
01:44:53.710 --> 01:44:54.330
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3596
01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:55.320
<v Speaker 5>is very risky.</v>

3597
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:57.240
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I've tried to resist that.</v>

3598
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.830
<v Speaker 5>And then when we,</v>

3599
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:58.090
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

3600
01:44:58.090 --> 01:44:59.400
<v Speaker 5>when we started putting together,</v>

3601
01:44:59.670 --> 01:44:59.911
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3602
01:44:59.911 --> 01:45:01.100
<v Speaker 5>the people who knew about the,</v>

3603
01:45:01.101 --> 01:45:04.350
<v Speaker 5>the nuclear facilities with aircraft Ufo was coming over.</v>

3604
01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.370
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want one or two.</v>

3605
01:45:05.371 --> 01:45:06.810
<v Speaker 5>I want it half a dozen or a dozen.</v>

3606
01:45:06.811 --> 01:45:07.644
<v Speaker 5>And that's what we have.</v>

3607
01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:10.620
<v Speaker 5>But the more spectacular the cases,</v>

3608
01:45:10.650 --> 01:45:12.030
<v Speaker 5>if it hangs on one person,</v>

3609
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.820
<v Speaker 5>the written,</v>

3610
01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:15.480
<v Speaker 5>and the other question is where's the corroboration?</v>

3611
01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:18.720
<v Speaker 5>So I think that that's why we try to focus on that.</v>

3612
01:45:18.930 --> 01:45:19.171
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3613
01:45:19.171 --> 01:45:24.030
<v Speaker 5>I will say that the areas out in the Nellis range and nobody by the way cause it</v>

3614
01:45:24.031 --> 01:45:24.811
<v Speaker 5>area 51,</v>

3615
01:45:24.811 --> 01:45:29.811
<v Speaker 5>but this is to say that because somebody's a poot Mesa s four s three s 12,</v>

3616
01:45:31.110 --> 01:45:36.110
<v Speaker 5>and actually this national reconnaissance office document from the 1990s lists</v>

3617
01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.040
<v Speaker 5>those facilities there,</v>

3618
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:39.383
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3619
01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:40.440
<v Speaker 5>properly,</v>

3620
01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:40.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3621
01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:41.500
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3622
01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:46.000
<v Speaker 1>well that's after blackjack control to a apply for additional land.</v>

3623
01:45:46.001 --> 01:45:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Before that they had denied it entire,</v>

3624
01:45:48.071 --> 01:45:48.370
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3625
01:45:48.370 --> 01:45:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3626
01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:51.600
<v Speaker 1>They had to apply for additional land because people were getting so close that</v>

3627
01:45:51.601 --> 01:45:55.540
<v Speaker 1>they could film a footage of some of these crafts that they were experimenting</v>

3628
01:45:55.541 --> 01:45:55.811
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3629
01:45:55.811 --> 01:45:56.240
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

3630
01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.120
<v Speaker 1>that's not bullshit if you've ever seen,</v>

3631
01:45:58.340 --> 01:45:58.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3632
01:45:58.540 --> 01:45:59.530
<v Speaker 1>the real one knows.</v>

3633
01:45:59.531 --> 01:45:59.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3634
01:45:59.681 --> 01:46:01.480
<v Speaker 1>no one knows what those things were,</v>

3635
01:46:01.630 --> 01:46:03.940
<v Speaker 1>but the way they were moving was extraordinary.</v>

3636
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:06.280
<v Speaker 1>They moved unlike any craft that we know.</v>

3637
01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3638
01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I would assume,</v>

3639
01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3640
01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:13.720
<v Speaker 1>that if you look at what we're doing today in all different parts of the world</v>

3641
01:46:13.721 --> 01:46:14.650
<v Speaker 1>with drones,</v>

3642
01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:17.990
<v Speaker 1>especially these drones that of Hellfire missiles that you know,</v>

3643
01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:23.050
<v Speaker 1>can be fairly accurate when you considering that they're being operated by</v>

3644
01:46:23.051 --> 01:46:24.430
<v Speaker 1>someone halfway across the world.</v>

3645
01:46:24.431 --> 01:46:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3646
01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3647
01:46:25.570 --> 01:46:29.140
<v Speaker 1>that this probably has something to do with what they were working on back then</v>

3648
01:46:29.141 --> 01:46:32.110
<v Speaker 1>when they're making these things fly around and do all these crazy turns right</v>

3649
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:33.100
<v Speaker 5>just in the sky.</v>

3650
01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:33.281
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3651
01:46:33.281 --> 01:46:36.700
<v Speaker 5>because of the drones that are being reported are conventional propulsion</v>

3652
01:46:36.701 --> 01:46:37.181
<v Speaker 5>systems,</v>

3653
01:46:37.181 --> 01:46:41.470
<v Speaker 5>either jets or what we're talking about are things that are moving in a way that</v>

3654
01:46:41.471 --> 01:46:44.860
<v Speaker 5>is outside the envelope of normal aerodynamic behavior.</v>

3655
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.431
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

3656
01:46:45.431 --> 01:46:47.950
<v Speaker 5>you cannot take something with a normal,</v>

3657
01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 5>a propeller or a jet</v>

3658
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:54.360
<v Speaker 2>engine and accelerated at 20,000 miles per hour and make a right hand turn.</v>

3659
01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.880
<v Speaker 2>And we have photos and images of these things doing this.</v>

3660
01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.320
<v Speaker 2>So when you're doing that,</v>

3661
01:46:58.321 --> 01:46:58.801
<v Speaker 2>that's going to,</v>

3662
01:46:58.801 --> 01:46:59.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3663
01:46:59.011 --> 01:46:59.221
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3664
01:46:59.221 --> 01:47:02.250
<v Speaker 2>your brains are going to come out of your nose if you're a pilot and even a</v>

3665
01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:06.600
<v Speaker 2>conventional object is going to be blown to smithereens by the inertial forces</v>

3666
01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:09.630
<v Speaker 2>of that kind of a turn and deceleration.</v>

3667
01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:10.081
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

3668
01:47:10.081 --> 01:47:11.400
<v Speaker 2>Are we talking about two different things though?</v>

3669
01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:11.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3670
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:12.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about the,</v>

3671
01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.553
<v Speaker 2>it's a thing saying,</v>

3672
01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.540
<v Speaker 2>but you're talking about things that had been seen.</v>

3673
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:16.530
<v Speaker 2>It's in space.</v>

3674
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:16.861
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3675
01:47:16.861 --> 01:47:20.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about things that had area 51 at area 51,</v>

3676
01:47:20.251 --> 01:47:23.970
<v Speaker 2>and also all over the world that had been documented moving in this way.</v>

3677
01:47:24.330 --> 01:47:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Those are moving.</v>

3678
01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:27.960
<v Speaker 2>And I'm quoting actually of General de Brouwer of the,</v>

3679
01:47:27.961 --> 01:47:28.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3680
01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:31.740
<v Speaker 2>the Belgian air force chief who said this is outside the envelope of any</v>

3681
01:47:31.741 --> 01:47:33.780
<v Speaker 2>conventional aerodynamic system.</v>

3682
01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not questioning that,</v>

3683
01:47:34.891 --> 01:47:39.030
<v Speaker 2>but what I am saying is that the things that I've seen as far as videos from</v>

3684
01:47:39.031 --> 01:47:40.710
<v Speaker 2>area 51 with these,</v>

3685
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:41.281
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3686
01:47:41.281 --> 01:47:41.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3687
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:42.600
<v Speaker 2>unidentified objects,</v>

3688
01:47:42.601 --> 01:47:42.841
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3689
01:47:42.841 --> 01:47:44.280
<v Speaker 2>they were moving across the sky,</v>

3690
01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:45.600
<v Speaker 2>they weren't moving that fast.</v>

3691
01:47:45.601 --> 01:47:46.230
<v Speaker 2>They were oil.</v>

3692
01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:48.630
<v Speaker 2>They were moving conventional speed.</v>

3693
01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:48.751
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3694
01:47:48.751 --> 01:47:49.261
<v Speaker 2>that's convinced.</v>

3695
01:47:49.261 --> 01:47:49.351
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3696
01:47:49.351 --> 01:47:49.921
<v Speaker 2>so that could be,</v>

3697
01:47:49.921 --> 01:47:52.980
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about the things that I know that have been imaged out there,</v>

3698
01:47:52.981 --> 01:47:55.170
<v Speaker 2>including a daytime object.</v>

3699
01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:57.330
<v Speaker 2>We have a great video.</v>

3700
01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:57.820
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

3701
01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:59.160
<v Speaker 2>what does this video that you're showing us,</v>

3702
01:47:59.161 --> 01:47:59.401
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

3703
01:47:59.401 --> 01:48:00.234
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>

3704
01:48:00.650 --> 01:48:05.650
<v Speaker 2>This is a low year 49 quad copters and an outdoor formation flight that,</v>

3705
01:48:07.410 --> 01:48:07.940
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3706
01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:08.750
<v Speaker 2>let me see that.</v>

3707
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:09.091
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty,</v>

3708
01:48:09.091 --> 01:48:10.110
<v Speaker 2>pretty bad as the video.</v>

3709
01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:11.161
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

3710
01:48:11.161 --> 01:48:11.581
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

3711
01:48:11.581 --> 01:48:12.180
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

3712
01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:12.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3713
01:48:12.630 --> 01:48:13.740
<v Speaker 2>conventional.</v>

3714
01:48:13.741 --> 01:48:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3715
01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:15.420
<v Speaker 2>you could actually buy these,</v>

3716
01:48:15.421 --> 01:48:15.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3717
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:16.080
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

3718
01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:16.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3719
01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:17.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3720
01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:17.461
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3721
01:48:17.461 --> 01:48:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

3722
01:48:18.190 --> 01:48:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3723
01:48:18.710 --> 01:48:18.871
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3724
01:48:18.871 --> 01:48:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Darpa was this Darpa Shit,</v>

3725
01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:23.070
<v Speaker 2>this is a ars electronica.</v>

3726
01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:24.563
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3727
01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:26.860
<v Speaker 2>you can buy little miniature.</v>

3728
01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:28.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3729
01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:29.670
<v Speaker 2>If you've never seen this,</v>

3730
01:48:29.671 --> 01:48:32.910
<v Speaker 2>what they can do now is really extraordinary.</v>

3731
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3732
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:34.703
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

3733
01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:37.950
<v Speaker 2>all these drones moving or what do you call them?</v>

3734
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.850
<v Speaker 2>What are the things are just like little toys almost.</v>

3735
01:48:39.851 --> 01:48:40.684
<v Speaker 2>So they are,</v>

3736
01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:42.260
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure it's,</v>

3737
01:48:42.261 --> 01:48:43.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people saw this in the sky and was like,</v>

3738
01:48:43.991 --> 01:48:44.281
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3739
01:48:44.281 --> 01:48:45.450
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck that and called it,</v>

3740
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:46.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3741
01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Ufo is how they move.</v>

3742
01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:48.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3743
01:48:48.061 --> 01:48:49.470
<v Speaker 2>this is really amazing stuff.</v>

3744
01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:50.261
<v Speaker 2>They move in a,</v>

3745
01:48:50.261 --> 01:48:53.860
<v Speaker 2>in a geometric pattern in the sky that mimics galaxies.</v>

3746
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.690
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

3747
01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:55.200
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

3748
01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:57.420
<v Speaker 2>So we know that there's some things that,</v>

3749
01:48:57.421 --> 01:48:57.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3750
01:48:57.601 --> 01:48:59.190
<v Speaker 2>these are obviously terrestrial crafts.</v>

3751
01:48:59.220 --> 01:48:59.791
<v Speaker 2>This is something,</v>

3752
01:48:59.791 --> 01:49:00.000
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3753
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:00.511
<v Speaker 2>look what they're doing.</v>

3754
01:49:00.511 --> 01:49:00.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3755
01:49:00.691 --> 01:49:01.524
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

3756
01:49:02.670 --> 01:49:06.030
<v Speaker 2>This is not ufs courses identified flying.</v>

3757
01:49:06.031 --> 01:49:06.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3758
01:49:06.211 --> 01:49:09.240
<v Speaker 2>not everything that people see that they don't know what it is is a Ufo.</v>

3759
01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:10.073
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's an,</v>

3760
01:49:10.290 --> 01:49:10.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3761
01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:12.720
<v Speaker 2>it's unidentified to them and it may be flying,</v>

3762
01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.180
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I'm talking about things that are really quite amazing.</v>

3763
01:49:16.181 --> 01:49:20.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like this one photograph we have of this triangle that's going like this</v>

3764
01:49:20.311 --> 01:49:23.160
<v Speaker 2>and it makes a right hand turn and go and it's going in more of a staff or a</v>

3765
01:49:23.161 --> 01:49:24.180
<v Speaker 2>video photo.</v>

3766
01:49:24.930 --> 01:49:25.591
<v Speaker 2>Can we see this?</v>

3767
01:49:25.591 --> 01:49:26.424
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

3768
01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:26.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3769
01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:27.773
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3770
01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where it's going to be in the film,</v>

3771
01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:31.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be in the film,</v>

3772
01:49:31.981 --> 01:49:32.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

3773
01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:33.600
<v Speaker 2>it's available online isn't it?</v>

3774
01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:34.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean it must,</v>

3775
01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:34.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3776
01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3777
01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I only so long as it's been around for,</v>

3778
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to look it up made,</v>

3779
01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to cut of the film in here,</v>

3780
01:49:41.161 --> 01:49:41.990
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3781
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.720
<v Speaker 2>this is one,</v>

3782
01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:42.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3783
01:49:42.991 --> 01:49:43.830
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of these,</v>

3784
01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:45.450
<v Speaker 2>but this is a very compelling piece of evidence.</v>

3785
01:49:46.110 --> 01:49:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

3786
01:49:46.590 --> 01:49:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you that online immediately</v>

3787
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.751
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

3788
01:49:48.751 --> 01:49:48.931
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3789
01:49:48.931 --> 01:49:49.770
<v Speaker 1>you got to look at this.</v>

3790
01:49:49.771 --> 01:49:50.970
<v Speaker 1>This is a compelling piece.</v>

3791
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:52.690
<v Speaker 5>I think it is online somewhere,</v>

3792
01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:53.231
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

3793
01:49:53.231 --> 01:49:54.400
<v Speaker 5>I just can't tell you where,</v>

3794
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:55.150
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3795
01:49:55.150 --> 01:49:55.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3796
01:49:55.511 --> 01:49:55.850
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

3797
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:57.790
<v Speaker 5>we have thousands of pages on our website.</v>

3798
01:49:57.791 --> 01:49:58.330
<v Speaker 5>You can go,</v>

3799
01:49:58.330 --> 01:50:01.300
<v Speaker 5>if you go to a serious disclosure.com you can click through and there's a whole</v>

3800
01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:02.980
<v Speaker 5>photo gallery and all kinds of stuff.</v>

3801
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:03.551
<v Speaker 5>Are we okay?</v>

3802
01:50:03.551 --> 01:50:03.981
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead and go.</v>

3803
01:50:03.981 --> 01:50:06.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if this particular one is in that photo gallery,</v>

3804
01:50:06.371 --> 01:50:07.240
<v Speaker 5>but for example,</v>

3805
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:08.161
<v Speaker 5>you look at the,</v>

3806
01:50:08.161 --> 01:50:10.690
<v Speaker 5>the Vancouver Island photograph of a few years ago,</v>

3807
01:50:10.691 --> 01:50:14.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think it was in the eighties daytime disc with a dome.</v>

3808
01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.600
<v Speaker 5>It is not Photoshop.</v>

3809
01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:18.940
<v Speaker 5>It was studied at Nasa Ames.</v>

3810
01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:19.600
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3811
01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:22.180
<v Speaker 5>it's probably the clearest photograph ever taken broad daylight.</v>

3812
01:50:22.890 --> 01:50:23.920
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3813
01:50:24.090 --> 01:50:24.910
<v Speaker 5>what is that?</v>

3814
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:25.181
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3815
01:50:25.181 --> 01:50:25.571
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3816
01:50:25.571 --> 01:50:25.661
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3817
01:50:25.661 --> 01:50:28.960
<v Speaker 5>it's just like these ones from Belgium where you have these photographs of these</v>

3818
01:50:28.961 --> 01:50:33.100
<v Speaker 5>big triangular objects and their photo and video of those matching up with radar</v>

3819
01:50:33.101 --> 01:50:34.870
<v Speaker 5>cases in jet pilots chasing them.</v>

3820
01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about those kinds of things.</v>

3821
01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:37.953
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3822
01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:38.750
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

3823
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:41.320
<v Speaker 5>there's actually more than people can imagine that's out there.</v>

3824
01:50:41.410 --> 01:50:41.651
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3825
01:50:41.651 --> 01:50:45.250
<v Speaker 1>So there's enough of these things where if you look at,</v>

3826
01:50:45.330 --> 01:50:46.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3827
01:50:46.090 --> 01:50:46.390
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

3828
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:51.390
<v Speaker 1>believe Michio Kaku said 5% of all Ufo sightings are completely unexplainable</v>

3829
01:50:52.421 --> 01:50:53.870
<v Speaker 1>defined laws of physics and,</v>

3830
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:56.440
<v Speaker 1>and may possibly be in his opinion,</v>

3831
01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:58.000
<v Speaker 1>something that we don't understand</v>

3832
01:50:58.490 --> 01:50:58.841
<v Speaker 5>possibly.</v>

3833
01:50:58.841 --> 01:50:59.870
<v Speaker 5>Cause that's the one I'm talking about.</v>

3834
01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:00.470
<v Speaker 5>The other stuff.</v>

3835
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3836
01:51:00.690 --> 01:51:01.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious,</v>

3837
01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:02.420
<v Speaker 5>what do you think they're doing here</v>

3838
01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:07.070
<v Speaker 5>since the $64 trillion question?</v>

3839
01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:07.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3840
01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:08.333
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

3841
01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.610
<v Speaker 5>I think there are a number of things.</v>

3842
01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:11.473
<v Speaker 5>Number one,</v>

3843
01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're new at all.</v>

3844
01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:14.620
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3845
01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:14.760
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3846
01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:16.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's a new phenomenon,</v>

3847
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:20.090
<v Speaker 5>there's enough material out there from ancient times that would indicate that</v>

3848
01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:23.360
<v Speaker 5>these objects have been around since recorded history.</v>

3849
01:51:23.361 --> 01:51:24.620
<v Speaker 5>I mentioned this earlier in the show,</v>

3850
01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:25.970
<v Speaker 5>but secondly,</v>

3851
01:51:25.971 --> 01:51:28.340
<v Speaker 5>I think this stage of our evolution,</v>

3852
01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:33.890
<v Speaker 5>the civilizations are rather concerned about our potential to destroy this</v>

3853
01:51:33.891 --> 01:51:35.620
<v Speaker 5>planet and ourselves,</v>

3854
01:51:35.630 --> 01:51:37.520
<v Speaker 5>but also the fact we're going into space.</v>

3855
01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:39.020
<v Speaker 5>We have not become peaceful.</v>

3856
01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:43.100
<v Speaker 5>And in the classified projects we have things way beyond the international space</v>

3857
01:51:43.101 --> 01:51:47.720
<v Speaker 5>station so that we could become an existential threat to other planets</v>

3858
01:51:47.721 --> 01:51:48.500
<v Speaker 5>potentially.</v>

3859
01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:51.140
<v Speaker 5>So I think that there is a concern about that.</v>

3860
01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:51.973
<v Speaker 5>And I think that,</v>

3861
01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:52.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3862
01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:52.611
<v Speaker 5>love your,</v>

3863
01:51:52.611 --> 01:51:53.480
<v Speaker 5>all these movies,</v>

3864
01:51:53.481 --> 01:51:53.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3865
01:51:53.721 --> 01:51:57.440
<v Speaker 5>battle Los Angeles and Independence Day and Blah Blah Blah avatar.</v>

3866
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.521
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3867
01:51:58.521 --> 01:51:58.900
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

3868
01:51:58.900 --> 01:51:59.240
<v Speaker 5>well yeah,</v>

3869
01:51:59.240 --> 01:51:59.840
<v Speaker 5>and it's such,</v>

3870
01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:00.471
<v Speaker 5>to me it's like,</v>

3871
01:52:00.471 --> 01:52:00.801
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3872
01:52:00.801 --> 01:52:01.634
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3873
01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:04.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like when I went to Wright Patterson air force base where they had the,</v>

3874
01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:05.020
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3875
01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:06.170
<v Speaker 5>the blue room that,</v>

3876
01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:08.030
<v Speaker 5>that Barry Goldwater tried center to go water,</v>

3877
01:52:08.031 --> 01:52:09.420
<v Speaker 5>tried to get in and uh,</v>

3878
01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:10.570
<v Speaker 5>you know the story.</v>

3879
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:11.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3880
01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:11.631
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3881
01:52:11.631 --> 01:52:12.261
<v Speaker 5>What wasn't that,</v>

3882
01:52:12.261 --> 01:52:12.740
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3883
01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:13.191
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

3884
01:52:13.191 --> 01:52:15.770
<v Speaker 5>the thing is is that I'm hangry teen Wright Patterson Air Force,</v>

3885
01:52:15.771 --> 01:52:16.040
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

3886
01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:17.700
<v Speaker 5>but this is a different thing.</v>

3887
01:52:17.701 --> 01:52:18.740
<v Speaker 5>At Wright Patterson Air Force base,</v>

3888
01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:19.850
<v Speaker 5>it was called the Blue Room.</v>

3889
01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:24.110
<v Speaker 5>Is that where supposedly the Roswell wreckage was the air material command.</v>

3890
01:52:24.111 --> 01:52:25.430
<v Speaker 5>And then when I was there,</v>

3891
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:26.230
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3892
01:52:26.230 --> 01:52:29.320
<v Speaker 1>very compelling piece of evidence and it might've been something serious going</v>

3893
01:52:29.321 --> 01:52:30.510
<v Speaker 1>on other than a weather balloon.</v>

3894
01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:34.630
<v Speaker 1>The fact that two separate planes we use to send this wreckage because the,</v>

3895
01:52:34.631 --> 01:52:36.130
<v Speaker 1>in case one of them went down,</v>

3896
01:52:36.131 --> 01:52:36.520
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3897
01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:38.530
<v Speaker 1>It was so historically significant.</v>

3898
01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I have that,</v>

3899
01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:39.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3900
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:41.020
<v Speaker 1>that newspaper,</v>

3901
01:52:41.050 --> 01:52:42.220
<v Speaker 1>the Roswell daily record,</v>

3902
01:52:42.221 --> 01:52:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I have that page on my wall in my house and I looked at it all the time.</v>

3903
01:52:46.461 --> 01:52:47.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating,</v>

3904
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

3905
01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:53.180
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially a press release by the military saying we've recovered a</v>

3906
01:52:53.181 --> 01:52:54.920
<v Speaker 1>crashed disk before they pulled it back.</v>

3907
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3908
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:57.050
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing because that's,</v>

3909
01:52:57.051 --> 01:52:57.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3910
01:52:57.620 --> 01:52:58.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a big statement,</v>

3911
01:52:59.060 --> 01:52:59.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3912
01:52:59.391 --> 01:52:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3913
01:52:59.810 --> 01:53:01.880
<v Speaker 1>you look at all the things that could've been,</v>

3914
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:03.230
<v Speaker 1>they could've been wrong about like,</v>

3915
01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:03.441
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3916
01:53:03.441 --> 01:53:04.880
<v Speaker 1>it could have been something else.</v>

3917
01:53:04.881 --> 01:53:05.270
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

3918
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.541
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

3919
01:53:05.541 --> 01:53:10.070
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they came out and said it's a crashed disk that had never been</v>

3920
01:53:10.071 --> 01:53:10.630
<v Speaker 1>done before,</v>

3921
01:53:10.630 --> 01:53:10.780
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3922
01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:12.540
<v Speaker 1>that really was one of the,</v>

3923
01:53:12.541 --> 01:53:12.801
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3924
01:53:12.801 --> 01:53:13.640
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

3925
01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I think some heads rolled over that press release.</v>

3926
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:16.783
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3927
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.300
<v Speaker 1>cause they had to pull it back and they did that ridiculous dog and pony show</v>

3928
01:53:20.301 --> 01:53:23.990
<v Speaker 1>where they brought out this shitty looking aluminum boy kind of looks like a</v>

3929
01:53:23.991 --> 01:53:24.801
<v Speaker 1>mylar thing.</v>

3930
01:53:24.801 --> 01:53:25.720
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious that,</v>

3931
01:53:25.721 --> 01:53:25.860
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3932
01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:26.720
<v Speaker 1>that's quite hilarious.</v>

3933
01:53:26.721 --> 01:53:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And the government.</v>

3934
01:53:27.591 --> 01:53:28.424
<v Speaker 1>I've always,</v>

3935
01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3936
01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:32.290
<v Speaker 1>if you just look at the history of deception that the government has in,</v>

3937
01:53:32.291 --> 01:53:35.380
<v Speaker 1>in dealing with the American public from the get go,</v>

3938
01:53:35.381 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 1>and whether it's with the Gulf of Tonkin incident or whether it's the,</v>

3939
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:40.070
<v Speaker 1>what happened with the,</v>

3940
01:53:40.071 --> 01:53:45.071
<v Speaker 1>the contrast and the Sandinistas using taxpayer dollars and black ops from</v>

3941
01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.250
<v Speaker 1>selling cocaine in the ghettos of Los Angeles to fund rebel armies.</v>

3942
01:53:49.450 --> 01:53:50.290
<v Speaker 1>If you just look,</v>

3943
01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:51.980
<v Speaker 1>you've got to know they're not telling the truth.</v>

3944
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Why would they tell the truth if it was just a weather balloon?</v>

3945
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:57.930
<v Speaker 1>What they really put on this fucking dog and pony show where they'd have a,</v>

3946
01:53:57.931 --> 01:53:59.750
<v Speaker 1>a general sit there and,</v>

3947
01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:00.561
<v Speaker 1>or was it colonel,</v>

3948
01:54:00.561 --> 01:54:03.740
<v Speaker 1>whoever it was on his knees pointing out all the retro look a list.</v>

3949
01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:05.050
<v Speaker 1>He is just record.</v>

3950
01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:05.341
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3951
01:54:05.341 --> 01:54:05.450
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3952
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.620
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3953
01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:06.760
<v Speaker 6>that's what colonel courses said.</v>

3954
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.970
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

3955
01:54:06.970 --> 01:54:07.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3956
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.930
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

3957
01:54:07.930 --> 01:54:10.150
<v Speaker 6>there's no question that this was something very legitimate.</v>

3958
01:54:10.151 --> 01:54:10.750
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3959
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:11.081
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3960
01:54:11.081 --> 01:54:11.261
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3961
01:54:11.261 --> 01:54:11.770
<v Speaker 6>in fact,</v>

3962
01:54:11.770 --> 01:54:11.861
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3963
01:54:11.861 --> 01:54:12.161
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3964
01:54:12.161 --> 01:54:13.090
<v Speaker 6>when Barry Goldwater,</v>

3965
01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:16.510
<v Speaker 6>senator Goldwater had McCain seat,</v>

3966
01:54:16.730 --> 01:54:17.320
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3967
01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.480
<v Speaker 6>before John Mccain took it in Arizona.</v>

3968
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:23.770
<v Speaker 6>I was at his home some years ago and he had left the Senate and he told me,</v>

3969
01:54:23.771 --> 01:54:24.041
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

3970
01:54:24.041 --> 01:54:24.820
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

3971
01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:26.920
<v Speaker 6>he says it was a God damn mistake.</v>

3972
01:54:26.921 --> 01:54:30.280
<v Speaker 6>Then it was like God damn mistake now that this was ever kept secret,</v>

3973
01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.530
<v Speaker 6>but he was an air force reserve general.</v>

3974
01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.390
<v Speaker 6>And he told me that Senator Goldwater said,</v>

3975
01:54:34.391 --> 01:54:34.660
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

3976
01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:35.920
<v Speaker 6>I asked Curtis Lemay,</v>

3977
01:54:35.921 --> 01:54:39.460
<v Speaker 6>General Lemay to get me into the blue room at Wright Patterson,</v>

3978
01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:40.271
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3979
01:54:40.271 --> 01:54:43.300
<v Speaker 6>because I wanted to see this stuff was he had heard reports from other pilots</v>

3980
01:54:43.301 --> 01:54:46.300
<v Speaker 6>about Ufo encounters and senator,</v>

3981
01:54:46.330 --> 01:54:46.600

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:52.840
<v Speaker 6>I can't even get into that area anymore.</v>

3988
01:54:52.930 --> 01:54:55.000
<v Speaker 6>And if you ever ask me about this again,</v>

3989
01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:59.020

3990
01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:04.410
<v Speaker 6>reserves this to a city sitting senator and a guy who had run for president of</v>

3991
01:55:04.421 --> 01:55:07.330
<v Speaker 6>course in 1964 and it actually happened.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3999
01:55:11.711 --> 01:55:15.370
<v Speaker 6>I was sitting there with the senator and I have a guy who was there with me.</v>

4000
01:55:15.371 --> 01:55:16.700
<v Speaker 6>And you know what I,</v>

4001
01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:17.920
<v Speaker 6>when I asked him was,</v>

4002
01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:20.440
<v Speaker 6>was Curtis Lemay serious?</v>

4003
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.831
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

4004
01:55:20.831 --> 01:55:21.370
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4005
01:55:21.370 --> 01:55:22.203
<v Speaker 6>like a heart attack.</v>

4006
01:55:22.210 --> 01:55:22.511
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

4007
01:55:22.511 --> 01:55:23.920
<v Speaker 6>I never brought it up again.</v>

4008
01:55:24.490 --> 01:55:26.980
<v Speaker 6>And so the question becomes,</v>

4009
01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:27.641
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4010
01:55:27.641 --> 01:55:31.900
<v Speaker 6>when you have someone like Curtis Lemay who admits and if you'll Google who he</v>

4011
01:55:31.901 --> 01:55:32.734
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

4012
01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:36.580
<v Speaker 6>who admits to the fact that at a certain point even he was being kind of</v>

4013
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:39.740
<v Speaker 6>sidelined in terms of access of it,</v>

4014
01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:43.320
<v Speaker 6>this information and then threatens and said something like that to a sitting</v>

4015
01:55:43.321 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 6>powerful US</v>

4016
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.090
<v Speaker 5>senator did.</v>

4017
01:55:45.091 --> 01:55:46.110
<v Speaker 5>They were good friends.</v>

4018
01:55:46.111 --> 01:55:46.321
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4019
01:55:46.321 --> 01:55:47.160
<v Speaker 5>they were buddies.</v>

4020
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:48.180
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4021
01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:48.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4022
01:55:48.511 --> 01:55:48.691
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

4023
01:55:48.691 --> 01:55:49.080
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

4024
01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.040
<v Speaker 5>there's something going on here and I've heard too many accounts like that from</v>

4025
01:55:53.041 --> 01:55:54.000
<v Speaker 5>these sorts of people.</v>

4026
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.630
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4027
01:55:54.630 --> 01:55:54.841
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4028
01:55:54.841 --> 01:55:55.674
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a,</v>

4029
01:55:56.730 --> 01:55:58.650
<v Speaker 5>it's a time for people to understand that,</v>

4030
01:55:59.160 --> 01:55:59.993
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4031
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.480
<v Speaker 5>ruthless people are out there and they do this sort of stuff.</v>

4032
01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:04.170
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4033
01:56:04.170 --> 01:56:04.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4034
01:56:04.710 --> 01:56:05.220
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

4035
01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:05.670
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

4036
01:56:05.670 --> 01:56:06.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4037
01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:11.100
<v Speaker 5>what happened for the last 60 years continues to go on and on and on.</v>

4038
01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

4039
01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:12.533
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4040
01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:13.030
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4041
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:16.020
<v Speaker 5>the people who try to move into this,</v>

4042
01:56:16.021 --> 01:56:18.170
<v Speaker 5>who were politicians and the,</v>

4043
01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:20.160
<v Speaker 5>the same boasts all the senator Goldwater did</v>

4044
01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:26.080
<v Speaker 1>these incredibly powerful technologically advanced beings that come here from</v>

4045
01:56:26.181 --> 01:56:30.110
<v Speaker 1>another planet and are concerned with the fact that we've developed the power to</v>

4046
01:56:30.111 --> 01:56:30.950
<v Speaker 1>blow ourselves up,</v>

4047
01:56:30.951 --> 01:56:33.230
<v Speaker 1>but yet lack the understanding,</v>

4048
01:56:33.231 --> 01:56:34.340
<v Speaker 1>the intellect or the,</v>

4049
01:56:34.341 --> 01:56:34.611
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4050
01:56:34.611 --> 01:56:38.480
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual capacity to recognize what the dangers and the repercussions of</v>

4051
01:56:38.481 --> 01:56:39.440
<v Speaker 1>those actions would be.</v>

4052
01:56:39.670 --> 01:56:39.980
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

4053
01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:40.520
<v Speaker 1>what are they,</v>

4054
01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:41.353
<v Speaker 1>are they,</v>

4055
01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:42.980
<v Speaker 1>is anybody communicating with them?</v>

4056
01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody have a message from them?</v>

4057
01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Does,</v>

4058
01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:47.600
<v Speaker 1>is there anything that they say,</v>

4059
01:56:47.601 --> 01:56:50.270
<v Speaker 1>we'll be done if we keep fucking around?</v>

4060
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4061
01:56:50.841 --> 01:56:51.560
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>

4062
01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:51.891
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4063
01:56:51.891 --> 01:56:52.290
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

4064
01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:52.630
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

4065
01:56:52.630 --> 01:56:53.463
<v Speaker 1>is there like</v>

4066
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:54.833
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>

4067
01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:55.910
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>

4068
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:59.450
<v Speaker 5>any doctrine that they're trying to push on us?</v>

4069
01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:00.201
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4070
01:57:00.201 --> 01:57:01.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if there's any doctor,</v>

4071
01:57:01.331 --> 01:57:03.770
<v Speaker 5>and I think they're waiting for us to reach,</v>

4072
01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:04.431
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4073
01:57:04.431 --> 01:57:05.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4074
01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:05.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4075
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:07.390
<v Speaker 5>you mentioned this physicist Mitch got,</v>

4076
01:57:07.630 --> 01:57:08.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4077
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.230
<v Speaker 5>a level one civilization or a level to where we began to behave in a halfway</v>

4078
01:57:12.231 --> 01:57:15.560
<v Speaker 5>civilized way so that we could be quite open and our contact.</v>

4079
01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:16.281
<v Speaker 5>But I think,</v>

4080
01:57:16.281 --> 01:57:16.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4081
01:57:16.461 --> 01:57:17.570
<v Speaker 5>I think everyone always says,</v>

4082
01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:17.811
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4083
01:57:17.811 --> 01:57:20.150
<v Speaker 5>why don't they just land on the White House lawn or so I said,</v>

4084
01:57:20.151 --> 01:57:20.361
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4085
01:57:20.361 --> 01:57:20.720
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

4086
01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:21.640
<v Speaker 5>who's White House?</v>

4087
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.860
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4088
01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:25.110
<v Speaker 5>Humans who says we rule it's American,</v>

4089
01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:25.380
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4090
01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:25.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4091
01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:26.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4092
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.991
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4093
01:57:26.991 --> 01:57:27.800
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4094
01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:29.060
<v Speaker 5>maybe the White House in Bogota,</v>

4095
01:57:29.061 --> 01:57:29.750
<v Speaker 5>Colombia,</v>

4096
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:32.360
<v Speaker 5>I think the question is,</v>

4097
01:57:32.590 --> 01:57:33.423
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

4098
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:34.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4099
01:57:34.610 --> 01:57:35.061
<v Speaker 5>it turns,</v>

4100
01:57:35.061 --> 01:57:35.200
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

4101
01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:35.720
<v Speaker 5>it the,</v>

4102
01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:37.190
<v Speaker 5>the whole issue upside down.</v>

4103
01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:41.000
<v Speaker 5>What do we have to do as a people and the civilization to,</v>

4104
01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:41.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4105
01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:46.900
<v Speaker 5>be able to go into space and have open contact with these civilizations quite an</v>

4106
01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:51.470
<v Speaker 5>in an overt way as opposed to episodic way.</v>

4107
01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:54.260
<v Speaker 5>And I think that requires us to begin,</v>

4108
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:55.610
<v Speaker 5>begin to behave peacefully.</v>

4109
01:57:55.730 --> 01:57:59.330
<v Speaker 5>It certainly requires that we not begin to weaponize space and that we stopped</v>

4110
01:57:59.331 --> 01:58:01.580
<v Speaker 5>doing things that are incredibly self destructive.</v>

4111
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.660
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4112
01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:03.171
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

4113
01:58:03.171 --> 01:58:03.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4114
01:58:03.441 --> 01:58:05.060
<v Speaker 5>the idea that they're going to land here in,</v>

4115
01:58:05.061 --> 01:58:05.541
<v Speaker 5>in four,</v>

4116
01:58:05.541 --> 01:58:08.480
<v Speaker 5>it's like us going to Afghanistan think we're going to impose Jeffersonian</v>

4117
01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:11.330
<v Speaker 5>democracy on a medieval feudal society.</v>

4118
01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:12.733
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

4119
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:14.060
<v Speaker 5>that never has worked.</v>

4120
01:58:14.061 --> 01:58:17.210
<v Speaker 5>So I think these civilizations are smart enough to know that that isn't the way</v>

4121
01:58:17.211 --> 01:58:18.200
<v Speaker 5>this is going to happen.</v>

4122
01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.100
<v Speaker 5>The humans.</v>

4123
01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:19.700
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

4124
01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:24.620
<v Speaker 5>the problem is that I kind of think we're running out of time to get some things</v>

4125
01:58:24.621 --> 01:58:25.220
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4126
01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:27.470
<v Speaker 5>Things that should have been fixed a hundred years ago,</v>

4127
01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:29.510
<v Speaker 5>like w living together peacefully,</v>

4128
01:58:29.511 --> 01:58:32.540
<v Speaker 5>bringing out these technologies that we don't destroy the biosphere,</v>

4129
01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:34.370
<v Speaker 5>eliminating poverty in the world.</v>

4130
01:58:34.371 --> 01:58:34.521
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4131
01:58:34.521 --> 01:58:35.360
<v Speaker 5>48% of the,</v>

4132
01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:35.560
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4133
01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:37.910
<v Speaker 5>the public doesn't have a pot to pee in.</v>

4134
01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:38.301
<v Speaker 5>Literally,</v>

4135
01:58:38.301 --> 01:58:40.880
<v Speaker 5>they don't have indoor plumbing on this planet.</v>

4136
01:58:40.881 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 5>40% of the 7 billion</v>

4137
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:43.120
<v Speaker 6>people that people don't know that.</v>

4138
01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:44.170
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4139
01:58:44.170 --> 01:58:45.003
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4140
01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:48.130
<v Speaker 6>I think that until we began to fix some of these larger problems,</v>

4141
01:58:48.131 --> 01:58:53.131
<v Speaker 6>and the good news about all of this is that it's fixable and the means the</v>

4142
01:58:53.561 --> 01:58:56.980
<v Speaker 6>technologies to do that or are already in existence.</v>

4143
01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:00.580
<v Speaker 6>So if they're already in existence and the science has been studied in</v>

4144
01:59:00.581 --> 01:59:02.890
<v Speaker 6>suppressed and studied in suppressed for decades,</v>

4145
01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:03.461
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

4146
01:59:03.461 --> 01:59:05.590
<v Speaker 6>it means that we as a people have to come together and say,</v>

4147
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:06.490
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

4148
01:59:06.490 --> 01:59:07.510
<v Speaker 6>we're going to do this.</v>

4149
01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:07.800
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4150
01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:08.081
<v Speaker 6>and the,</v>

4151
01:59:08.081 --> 01:59:08.351
<v Speaker 6>and the,</v>

4152
01:59:08.351 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 6>I think this is why the,</v>

4153
01:59:09.431 --> 01:59:09.581
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4154
01:59:09.581 --> 01:59:12.880
<v Speaker 6>the sort of hate to use the word activist advocacy,</v>

4155
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:17.560
<v Speaker 6>part of what we're doing is that people are always expecting someone else to do</v>

4156
01:59:17.561 --> 01:59:18.394
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

4157
01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:19.233
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4158
01:59:19.330 --> 01:59:20.163
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4159
01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:23.020
<v Speaker 6>and I think people have to say no,</v>

4160
01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:27.850
<v Speaker 6>each of us have to be responsible for the planet and for our future and kind of</v>

4161
01:59:27.851 --> 01:59:28.930
<v Speaker 6>creating a good future.</v>

4162
01:59:29.410 --> 01:59:31.180
<v Speaker 6>You can't look to big brother to do it.</v>

4163
01:59:31.181 --> 01:59:34.570
<v Speaker 6>And I don't think you should look to the ets to do it and not that they're not</v>

4164
01:59:34.571 --> 01:59:35.860
<v Speaker 6>going to help us if we,</v>

4165
01:59:35.861 --> 01:59:37.150
<v Speaker 6>at some point we reached a point of,</v>

4166
01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.980
<v Speaker 6>of heavily into functional.</v>

4167
01:59:39.070 --> 01:59:40.540
<v Speaker 6>It's opposed to dysfunctional.</v>

4168
01:59:41.050 --> 01:59:41.883
<v Speaker 6>But I,</v>

4169
01:59:41.950 --> 01:59:44.260
<v Speaker 6>I think the prime movers have to be the people.</v>

4170
01:59:44.290 --> 01:59:44.411
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

4171
01:59:44.411 --> 01:59:45.360
<v Speaker 6>the people and you know,</v>

4172
01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:46.490
<v Speaker 6>my mom's family were,</v>

4173
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:50.860
<v Speaker 6>were some of the original people in the American revolution with that terrible</v>

4174
01:59:50.861 --> 01:59:54.400
<v Speaker 6>to say we were in the front of the first prisoner of war with the British.</v>

4175
01:59:54.401 --> 01:59:54.641
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

4176
01:59:54.641 --> 01:59:55.420
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4177
01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:56.860
<v Speaker 6>but I think about the fact that,</v>

4178
01:59:56.861 --> 01:59:57.011
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4179
01:59:57.011 --> 02:00:00.850
<v Speaker 6>here you had this ragtag bunch of people in the American revolution taking on</v>

4180
02:00:00.851 --> 02:00:02.710
<v Speaker 6>the most powerful navy,</v>

4181
02:00:02.711 --> 02:00:04.810
<v Speaker 6>most powerful empire in the world at time,</v>

4182
02:00:04.811 --> 02:00:05.644
<v Speaker 6>the British empire.</v>

4183
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:07.143
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4184
02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:08.540
<v Speaker 6>I think people have to,</v>

4185
02:00:08.541 --> 02:00:11.920
<v Speaker 6>to see that within the human spirit we have the means to do this.</v>

4186
02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:15.880
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of people give too much power to where I don't think it should be</v>

4187
02:00:15.881 --> 02:00:16.714
<v Speaker 6>provided,</v>

4188
02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:17.620
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4189
02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:21.190
<v Speaker 6>to these covert groups and these sort of co cartels.</v>

4190
02:00:21.490 --> 02:00:22.060
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

4191
02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:22.421
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

4192
02:00:22.421 --> 02:00:27.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm getting back to this idea of empowerment where we have exactly the power</v>

4193
02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:28.990
<v Speaker 6>we're willing to manifest and no more.</v>

4194
02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:31.900
<v Speaker 6>But if we're going to sit on our hands and expect someone else to do it,</v>

4195
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:32.890
<v Speaker 6>we're in trouble.</v>

4196
02:00:32.890 --> 02:00:34.150
<v Speaker 6>And there's been too much of that.</v>

4197
02:00:34.210 --> 02:00:34.471
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4198
02:00:34.471 --> 02:00:34.930
<v Speaker 6>and there's,</v>

4199
02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:35.950
<v Speaker 6>there needs to be,</v>

4200
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:37.060
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4201
02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:38.530
<v Speaker 6>I guess a moral courage here.</v>

4202
02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:38.780
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

4203
02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:39.390
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4204
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:39.611
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4205
02:00:39.611 --> 02:00:40.690
<v Speaker 6>this is what sickened me about,</v>

4206
02:00:40.691 --> 02:00:40.871
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4207
02:00:40.871 --> 02:00:43.340
<v Speaker 6>the politics of the media and then all these scandals,</v>

4208
02:00:43.341 --> 02:00:43.571
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

4209
02:00:43.571 --> 02:00:46.120
<v Speaker 6>you were talking about the with betray us and you know,</v>

4210
02:00:46.121 --> 02:00:47.860
<v Speaker 6>during the Clinton era of the Monica Lewinsky thing,</v>

4211
02:00:47.861 --> 02:00:48.694
<v Speaker 6>I call it the,</v>

4212
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:50.230
<v Speaker 6>the blowjob heard round the world.</v>

4213
02:00:50.530 --> 02:00:51.363
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4214
02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:53.440
<v Speaker 6>that it's just so much nonsense.</v>

4215
02:00:53.970 --> 02:00:54.310
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4216
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:57.640
<v Speaker 6>whereas these big issues or the moral issues as I see it,</v>

4217
02:00:57.770 --> 02:00:58.603
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4218
02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:03.900
<v Speaker 4>I think if you look at us as a being as an entity and our progress in this,</v>

4219
02:01:05.081 --> 02:01:05.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4220
02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.340
<v Speaker 4>on this planet,</v>

4221
02:01:06.370 --> 02:01:11.370
<v Speaker 4>it's so staggering over such a short period of time that I think our minds,</v>

4222
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:16.480
<v Speaker 4>our ability to pass down information,</v>

4223
02:01:16.810 --> 02:01:18.700
<v Speaker 4>all of these things lag behind.</v>

4224
02:01:18.701 --> 02:01:18.911
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

4225
02:01:18.911 --> 02:01:22.540
<v Speaker 4>we're essentially waking up in the middle of history as a,</v>

4226
02:01:22.541 --> 02:01:22.931
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

4227
02:01:22.931 --> 02:01:23.441
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

4228
02:01:23.441 --> 02:01:25.660
<v Speaker 4>as a race of beings,</v>

4229
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:26.530
<v Speaker 4>humans,</v>

4230
02:01:26.530 --> 02:01:30.310
<v Speaker 4>we're waking up in the middle of a massive amount of momentum.</v>

4231
02:01:30.490 --> 02:01:31.450
<v Speaker 4>As you're born,</v>

4232
02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:36.540
<v Speaker 4>you are born into a race that is moving in an incredibly powerful direction that</v>

4233
02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:38.800
<v Speaker 4>it's very hard to stop.</v>

4234
02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:43.840
<v Speaker 4>And it's also the same animal that just twenty thousand thirty thousand go back</v>

4235
02:01:45.081 --> 02:01:45.831
<v Speaker 4>as far as you want,</v>

4236
02:01:45.831 --> 02:01:48.500
<v Speaker 4>where we were essentially tribal monkey people,</v>

4237
02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:48.770
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4238
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>

4239
02:01:49.641 --> 02:01:54.641
<v Speaker 4>that's all of those instincts that allowed us to get to 2013 are all encoded in</v>

4240
02:01:55.071 --> 02:01:55.850
<v Speaker 4>our genome.</v>

4241
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:57.380
<v Speaker 4>All of those instincts,</v>

4242
02:01:57.381 --> 02:02:01.400
<v Speaker 4>all of those reward systems are all encoded and all of those words reward</v>

4243
02:02:01.401 --> 02:02:01.920
<v Speaker 4>systems.</v>

4244
02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Whether you look back to Napoleon or Kingus Khan or you look at any war figure,</v>

4245
02:02:07.791 --> 02:02:11.150
<v Speaker 4>any dominator in throughout human history,</v>

4246
02:02:11.690 --> 02:02:16.690
<v Speaker 4>the people in power have always tried to keep in power and suppress others what</v>

4247
02:02:17.061 --> 02:02:18.110
<v Speaker 4>they do and they do.</v>

4248
02:02:18.150 --> 02:02:18.320
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4249
02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:23.320
<v Speaker 4>but I think also if you look at the power of technology to overwhelm everything,</v>

4250
02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:26.660
<v Speaker 4>including the head spook of the CIA,</v>

4251
02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was essentially overwhelmed by email.</v>

4252
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:30.200
<v Speaker 4>That's what took him over.</v>

4253
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:30.711
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4254
02:02:30.711 --> 02:02:31.341
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>

4255
02:02:31.341 --> 02:02:33.290
<v Speaker 4>it was the FBI looking into things,</v>

4256
02:02:33.291 --> 02:02:36.140
<v Speaker 4>but essentially it was all done through electronic means.</v>

4257
02:02:36.141 --> 02:02:37.160
<v Speaker 4>It was all done through.</v>

4258
02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:42.280
<v Speaker 4>He was revealed by the very powers that the CIA uses in the first place.</v>

4259
02:02:42.591 --> 02:02:44.870
<v Speaker 4>They're spies and the national security agency.</v>

4260
02:02:44.871 --> 02:02:47.270
<v Speaker 4>You can bet on top spy was spied on.</v>

4261
02:02:47.690 --> 02:02:49.760
<v Speaker 4>It's in my opinion,</v>

4262
02:02:49.761 --> 02:02:54.761
<v Speaker 4>when I look at human history and I look at where you just try to extrapolate,</v>

4263
02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:57.380
<v Speaker 4>when I try to extrapolate where we're going,</v>

4264
02:02:57.410 --> 02:03:01.550
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me that it's all symbiotically connected to technology and that</v>

4265
02:03:01.551 --> 02:03:03.230
<v Speaker 4>seems unavoidable.</v>

4266
02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:07.100
<v Speaker 4>That's why I have such a hard time with the idea of someone creating some zero</v>

4267
02:03:07.101 --> 02:03:08.060
<v Speaker 4>point energy thing.</v>

4268
02:03:08.061 --> 02:03:08.710
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>

4269
02:03:08.710 --> 02:03:10.250
<v Speaker 4>that people don't,</v>

4270
02:03:10.251 --> 02:03:14.390
<v Speaker 4>aren't looking into enough people know about what Tesla was working on.</v>

4271
02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:19.580
<v Speaker 4>Enough people are fascinated by the ideas of wormholes and I just would think</v>

4272
02:03:19.611 --> 02:03:23.210
<v Speaker 4>that more people would be involved in this and that the government with all it's</v>

4273
02:03:23.211 --> 02:03:23.691
<v Speaker 4>shady,</v>

4274
02:03:23.691 --> 02:03:27.920
<v Speaker 4>nefarious arms wouldn't be able to put out all of those fires.</v>

4275
02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:28.480
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of it,</v>

4276
02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:28.580
<v Speaker 4>if it's</v>

4277
02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:29.301
<v Speaker 6>self censoring,</v>

4278
02:03:29.301 --> 02:03:30.051
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

4279
02:03:30.051 --> 02:03:31.370
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you a really good example.</v>

4280
02:03:31.371 --> 02:03:33.170
<v Speaker 6>There was an academic guy that uh,</v>

4281
02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:34.490
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4282
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:38.600
<v Speaker 6>I was talking to recently and he was wanting to push into this issue and</v>

4283
02:03:38.601 --> 02:03:39.620
<v Speaker 6>basically he was told,</v>

4284
02:03:39.621 --> 02:03:39.711
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4285
02:03:39.711 --> 02:03:44.210
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to do it this university because this is violating the second</v>

4286
02:03:44.211 --> 02:03:45.680
<v Speaker 6>law of thermodynamics and blah,</v>

4287
02:03:45.681 --> 02:03:45.951
<v Speaker 6>blah,</v>

4288
02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:46.670
<v Speaker 6>blah.</v>

4289
02:03:46.670 --> 02:03:47.320
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4290
02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:48.950
<v Speaker 6>in a rational world,</v>

4291
02:03:48.951 --> 02:03:50.300
<v Speaker 6>which is what you're talking about,</v>

4292
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:51.290
<v Speaker 6>I would agree with you.</v>

4293
02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:53.330
<v Speaker 6>But we don't live in a rational world.</v>

4294
02:03:53.331 --> 02:03:57.440
<v Speaker 6>We live in a world where there are a lot of emotions and power hierarchies and</v>

4295
02:03:57.441 --> 02:03:59.270
<v Speaker 6>all kinds of dysfunctions.</v>

4296
02:03:59.450 --> 02:04:02.570
<v Speaker 6>And so you have to factor that into the equation.</v>

4297
02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:07.900
<v Speaker 6>And I don't think you can underestimate the reach of the national security</v>

4298
02:04:07.911 --> 02:04:08.300
<v Speaker 6>state,</v>

4299
02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:08.901
<v Speaker 6>not just here,</v>

4300
02:04:08.901 --> 02:04:10.850
<v Speaker 6>but around the world to,</v>

4301
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:11.510
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4302
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:12.680
<v Speaker 6>put out these fires,</v>

4303
02:04:12.681 --> 02:04:14.600
<v Speaker 6>no matter how many times they try to surface,</v>

4304
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:17.210
<v Speaker 6>unless it's done in a very large way.</v>

4305
02:04:17.210 --> 02:04:17.451
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

4306
02:04:17.451 --> 02:04:19.340
<v Speaker 6>and I didn't believe that.</v>

4307
02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:19.710
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4308
02:04:19.710 --> 02:04:24.710
<v Speaker 6>and I've learned the hard way trying to do it in a smaller fashion from this</v>

4309
02:04:25.361 --> 02:04:25.610
<v Speaker 6>sunlight.</v>

4310
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:26.750
<v Speaker 6>The story I told you about this,</v>

4311
02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:29.450
<v Speaker 6>the scientist who works in a skiff down near the Huntsville,</v>

4312
02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:30.410
<v Speaker 6>spaceflight center,</v>

4313
02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:31.310
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4314
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:32.960
<v Speaker 6>Marshall space flight center in Huntsville.</v>

4315
02:04:32.961 --> 02:04:33.440
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4316
02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:38.440
<v Speaker 6>and I think what we are going to have to do is organize an effort that is very</v>

4317
02:04:40.201 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 6>much outside of government and mainstream corporations and even academia because</v>

4318
02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:45.630
<v Speaker 6>academia,</v>

4319
02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:46.820
<v Speaker 6>if you have never been in it,</v>

4320
02:04:46.850 --> 02:04:47.910
<v Speaker 6>is so political.</v>

4321
02:04:48.090 --> 02:04:48.923
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4322
02:04:49.110 --> 02:04:49.561
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4323
02:04:49.561 --> 02:04:50.070
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4324
02:04:50.070 --> 02:04:50.350
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4325
02:04:50.350 --> 02:04:50.510
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4326
02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:50.761
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4327
02:04:50.761 --> 02:04:54.450
<v Speaker 6>you touch the sorts of issues and it's the end of your career.</v>

4328
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.750
<v Speaker 6>I'll,</v>

4329
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:57.510
<v Speaker 6>I'll give you a great story in terms of other institutions.</v>

4330
02:04:57.511 --> 02:04:57.721
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4331
02:04:57.721 --> 02:05:02.010
<v Speaker 6>the National Science Foundation is a very big player in global warming studies</v>

4332
02:05:02.011 --> 02:05:03.000
<v Speaker 6>and all this kind of stuff.</v>

4333
02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:08.570
<v Speaker 6>And the deputy director of that and then Dr Bob Correll and I had a long meeting</v>

4334
02:05:08.851 --> 02:05:09.120
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

4335
02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:13.110
<v Speaker 6>with another person who was one of the five directors of NASA back some years</v>

4336
02:05:13.110 --> 02:05:13.710
<v Speaker 6>ago.</v>

4337
02:05:13.710 --> 02:05:13.981
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

4338
02:05:13.981 --> 02:05:14.461
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

4339
02:05:14.461 --> 02:05:16.170
<v Speaker 6>he was very interested in exactly what we're talking about,</v>

4340
02:05:16.171 --> 02:05:17.160
<v Speaker 6>these sciences and studies.</v>

4341
02:05:17.161 --> 02:05:17.581
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

4342
02:05:17.581 --> 02:05:18.414
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

4343
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:21.120
<v Speaker 6>we need some people at the National Science Foundation,</v>

4344
02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:21.750
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4345
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.991
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

4346
02:05:21.991 --> 02:05:25.890
<v Speaker 6>to really take this on as an area of research and development,</v>

4347
02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:26.590
<v Speaker 6>funding,</v>

4348
02:05:26.590 --> 02:05:27.423
<v Speaker 6>et cetera.</v>

4349
02:05:27.570 --> 02:05:28.403
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

4350
02:05:28.530 --> 02:05:31.590
<v Speaker 6>it'd be the end of my career if I did this.</v>

4351
02:05:31.591 --> 02:05:31.831
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

4352
02:05:31.831 --> 02:05:32.310
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4353
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:32.671
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4354
02:05:32.671 --> 02:05:34.620
<v Speaker 6>here is the future of the earth or your career.</v>

4355
02:05:34.621 --> 02:05:35.520
<v Speaker 6>What are you going to choose?</v>

4356
02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:37.650
<v Speaker 6>Let's choose the earth and our future.</v>

4357
02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:40.800
<v Speaker 6>But the truth is everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time.</v>

4358
02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:44.610
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of folks are not going to jeopardize their careers and their income.</v>

4359
02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.980
<v Speaker 6>A very famous astronomer who worked with Carl Sagan,</v>

4360
02:05:47.370 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4361
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:48.450
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4362
02:05:48.450 --> 02:05:48.870
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

4363
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:49.051
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4364
02:05:49.051 --> 02:05:51.750
<v Speaker 6>at our meetings in 1997 that we did for Congress.</v>

4365
02:05:51.751 --> 02:05:54.060
<v Speaker 6>And after he did that with us,</v>

4366
02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:56.670
<v Speaker 6>he was told if he ever wanted to be published again,</v>

4367
02:05:56.671 --> 02:05:59.040
<v Speaker 6>right again or have a career in astronomy,</v>

4368
02:05:59.041 --> 02:06:00.780
<v Speaker 6>he'd have to leave this issue alone.</v>

4369
02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:04.790
<v Speaker 6>So he was directly threatened and he begged me to,</v>

4370
02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:05.280
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

4371
02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:05.431
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4372
02:06:05.431 --> 02:06:06.510
<v Speaker 6>keep going forward,</v>

4373
02:06:06.570 --> 02:06:07.980
<v Speaker 6>but that he couldn't be part of it.</v>

4374
02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:09.210
<v Speaker 6>And so I think that,</v>

4375
02:06:09.211 --> 02:06:09.571
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4376
02:06:09.571 --> 02:06:14.100
<v Speaker 6>most people don't realize that this happens every day and it's kind of a miracle</v>

4377
02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:14.671
<v Speaker 6>that this,</v>

4378
02:06:14.671 --> 02:06:19.671
<v Speaker 6>this many military and corporate intelligence people came together this far.</v>

4379
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:23.370
<v Speaker 6>But I won't even begin to tell you what we've gone through trying to get this</v>

4380
02:06:23.371 --> 02:06:23.551
<v Speaker 6>far.</v>

4381
02:06:23.551 --> 02:06:24.480
<v Speaker 6>It's been very difficult.</v>

4382
02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:24.770
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4383
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:29.510
<v Speaker 6>and so for every person you hear about it and that you see in this film serious</v>

4384
02:06:29.511 --> 02:06:29.691
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

4385
02:06:29.691 --> 02:06:31.140
<v Speaker 6>or in the disclosure project,</v>

4386
02:06:31.770 --> 02:06:36.770
<v Speaker 6>there are a hundred that wouldn't be that I have given me the information and</v>

4387
02:06:37.110 --> 02:06:38.790
<v Speaker 6>even documents in intelligence,</v>

4388
02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:40.590
<v Speaker 6>but they don't want to come out and be identified.</v>

4389
02:06:40.591 --> 02:06:42.360
<v Speaker 6>So there's a lot of fear of,</v>

4390
02:06:42.361 --> 02:06:46.200
<v Speaker 6>of either reprisals but also just the ridicule factor.</v>

4391
02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:46.501
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4392
02:06:46.501 --> 02:06:50.940
<v Speaker 6>I have a document from 1953 from the CIA that talked about engaging Disney</v>

4393
02:06:50.941 --> 02:06:55.941
<v Speaker 6>studios to make of cartoonish movies about this issue so that it would be the</v>

4394
02:06:56.311 --> 02:06:56.970
<v Speaker 6>butt of jokes.</v>

4395
02:06:56.970 --> 02:06:57.081
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4396
02:06:57.081 --> 02:06:57.251
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

4397
02:06:57.251 --> 02:06:57.431
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

4398
02:06:57.431 --> 02:07:02.040
<v Speaker 6>and this document talks about the psychological warfare value of the subject.</v>

4399
02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:03.000
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4400
02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:03.391
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4401
02:07:03.391 --> 02:07:04.560
<v Speaker 6>people are sort of like,</v>

4402
02:07:04.561 --> 02:07:04.920
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4403
02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:07.590
<v Speaker 6>in middle school where you're worried about what are people gonna think about me</v>

4404
02:07:07.591 --> 02:07:08.011
<v Speaker 6>if I say,</v>

4405
02:07:08.011 --> 02:07:08.970
<v Speaker 6>I think this is real,</v>

4406
02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:12.000
<v Speaker 6>are you going to lose credibility if you're a doctor or a physicist or an</v>

4407
02:07:12.001 --> 02:07:13.280
<v Speaker 6>engineer or a politician?</v>

4408
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:17.360
<v Speaker 6>Project Blue Book wasn't that this predated this,</v>

4409
02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:17.911
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

4410
02:07:17.911 --> 02:07:21.480
<v Speaker 6>this actually predated that when they were first coming together with how do we</v>

4411
02:07:21.481 --> 02:07:23.460
<v Speaker 6>manage this because it's hidden in plain sight.</v>

4412
02:07:23.461 --> 02:07:24.780
<v Speaker 6>People are going to see these objects.</v>

4413
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.440
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4414
02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:27.760
<v Speaker 6>there's no way to really sanitize it.</v>

4415
02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:28.171
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4416
02:07:28.171 --> 02:07:30.120
<v Speaker 6>people think you can really get rid of this.</v>

4417
02:07:30.121 --> 02:07:30.211
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4418
02:07:30.211 --> 02:07:30.541
<v Speaker 6>you can,</v>

4419
02:07:30.541 --> 02:07:33.540
<v Speaker 6>if there's certain number of people seeing this all the time,</v>

4420
02:07:33.541 --> 02:07:34.410
<v Speaker 6>we were highly credible.</v>

4421
02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:35.393
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4422
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:40.470
<v Speaker 6>but if you create an environment where it's ridiculous and you're considered a</v>

4423
02:07:42.071 --> 02:07:43.450
<v Speaker 6>kook or this or that,</v>

4424
02:07:43.810 --> 02:07:44.081
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4425
02:07:44.081 --> 02:07:46.060
<v Speaker 6>if you are identified with it or you'll be,</v>

4426
02:07:46.061 --> 02:07:46.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4427
02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:48.750
<v Speaker 6>governor Moonbeam or senator,</v>

4428
02:07:49.050 --> 02:07:50.800
<v Speaker 6>a space cadet or something.</v>

4429
02:07:51.190 --> 02:07:51.790
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4430
02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:56.680
<v Speaker 6>and this is one of the real problems is that the subject has been so ridiculed</v>

4431
02:07:56.681 --> 02:08:00.400
<v Speaker 6>and there's so much ridiculous stuff out there on the subject that's provably</v>

4432
02:08:00.401 --> 02:08:01.330
<v Speaker 6>nonsensical,</v>

4433
02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:02.380
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4434
02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:05.350
<v Speaker 6>that credible people really have to swallow hard.</v>

4435
02:08:05.351 --> 02:08:06.184
<v Speaker 6>I have to tell you,</v>

4436
02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:10.630
<v Speaker 6>the scientists that are at this Major Ivy League university doing the work on</v>

4437
02:08:10.631 --> 02:08:12.070
<v Speaker 6>this little body,</v>

4438
02:08:12.071 --> 02:08:13.660
<v Speaker 6>this humanoid type body,</v>

4439
02:08:14.230 --> 02:08:14.890
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4440
02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:15.723
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4441
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.630
<v Speaker 6>big,</v>

4442
02:08:16.630 --> 02:08:18.430
<v Speaker 6>big thing for them to be working on this.</v>

4443
02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:19.593
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4444
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:23.290
<v Speaker 6>and it's even a bigger thing that they're going to go on the record about their</v>

4445
02:08:23.291 --> 02:08:24.124
<v Speaker 6>findings.</v>

4446
02:08:24.230 --> 02:08:27.200
<v Speaker 6>When are they going to do this in the next,</v>

4447
02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:27.670
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4448
02:08:27.670 --> 02:08:29.740
<v Speaker 6>you'll see on April 22nd comes to the premiere.</v>

4449
02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:30.870
<v Speaker 4>I'll come to the premiere,</v>

4450
02:08:30.871 --> 02:08:34.880
<v Speaker 4>but on April 22nd what if no one has made some sort of a,</v>

4451
02:08:34.881 --> 02:08:35.820
<v Speaker 4>a public statement?</v>

4452
02:08:35.821 --> 02:08:36.150
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4453
02:08:36.150 --> 02:08:37.230
<v Speaker 4>Ivy League scientists,</v>

4454
02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:38.130
<v Speaker 4>they're going to,</v>

4455
02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:38.641
<v Speaker 4>so yes,</v>

4456
02:08:38.641 --> 02:08:40.710
<v Speaker 4>you're promising between now and April 22nd,</v>

4457
02:08:40.711 --> 02:08:42.180
<v Speaker 4>there'll be some sort of a reveal.</v>

4458
02:08:42.230 --> 02:08:42.361
<v Speaker 4>We'll,</v>

4459
02:08:42.361 --> 02:08:42.900
<v Speaker 4>we'll have some,</v>

4460
02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:43.681
<v Speaker 4>these releases,</v>

4461
02:08:43.681 --> 02:08:48.681
<v Speaker 4>major institution scientists of credible history will step forward and say,</v>

4462
02:08:50.190 --> 02:08:50.461
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

4463
02:08:50.461 --> 02:08:51.001
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

4464
02:08:51.001 --> 02:08:53.190
<v Speaker 4>this is something we don't know what they're going to say.</v>

4465
02:08:53.191 --> 02:08:54.900
<v Speaker 4>They're still doing the run on the genome.</v>

4466
02:08:54.930 --> 02:08:55.051
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4467
02:08:55.051 --> 02:08:55.831
<v Speaker 4>he's extraordinary.</v>

4468
02:08:55.831 --> 02:08:56.610
<v Speaker 4>If it's real,</v>

4469
02:08:56.610 --> 02:08:56.931
<v Speaker 4>if it's,</v>

4470
02:08:56.931 --> 02:08:57.300
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

4471
02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:57.841
<v Speaker 4>if it is,</v>

4472
02:08:57.841 --> 02:08:58.171
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4473
02:08:58.171 --> 02:08:59.440
<v Speaker 4>let me put that to rest right now.</v>

4474
02:08:59.550 --> 02:09:00.250
<v Speaker 4>You touched it.</v>

4475
02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:01.083
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4476
02:09:01.690 --> 02:09:02.523
<v Speaker 6>I've touched it.</v>

4477
02:09:02.530 --> 02:09:03.670
<v Speaker 6>We have the cat scans.</v>

4478
02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:05.680
<v Speaker 6>We have the reports from these top scientists.</v>

4479
02:09:05.681 --> 02:09:08.140
<v Speaker 6>The only thing left that we're doing is running the genome,</v>

4480
02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:09.640
<v Speaker 6>which is the whole genome.</v>

4481
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:13.780
<v Speaker 4>So that scientists have said that it's absolutely a biological origin that is</v>

4482
02:09:13.781 --> 02:09:14.110
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

4483
02:09:14.110 --> 02:09:15.430
<v Speaker 4>it's not like my werewolf.</v>

4484
02:09:15.610 --> 02:09:16.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4485
02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:16.500
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4486
02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:17.000
<v Speaker 4>Robert,</v>

4487
02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:17.230
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

4488
02:09:17.230 --> 02:09:17.951
<v Speaker 4>we know this,</v>

4489
02:09:17.951 --> 02:09:20.980
<v Speaker 4>we absolutely know and put that to rest.</v>

4490
02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:24.250
<v Speaker 4>Has this damaged your credibility in life?</v>

4491
02:09:24.251 --> 02:09:24.461
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4492
02:09:24.461 --> 02:09:24.821
<v Speaker 4>have you,</v>

4493
02:09:24.821 --> 02:09:27.040
<v Speaker 4>have you suffered because of this in any way,</v>

4494
02:09:27.041 --> 02:09:27.874
<v Speaker 4>shape or form?</v>

4495
02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:28.421
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

4496
02:09:28.421 --> 02:09:29.150
<v Speaker 4>In what way?</v>

4497
02:09:29.150 --> 02:09:29.983
<v Speaker 6>Every way.</v>

4498
02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:30.853
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4499
02:09:31.010 --> 02:09:31.250
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4500
02:09:31.250 --> 02:09:32.120
<v Speaker 6>It's been the hardest thing.</v>

4501
02:09:32.121 --> 02:09:32.301
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4502
02:09:32.301 --> 02:09:35.430
<v Speaker 6>I tell people the worst days in the Er or you know how old,</v>

4503
02:09:35.431 --> 02:09:36.920
<v Speaker 6>a three year old that died in my arms.</v>

4504
02:09:36.921 --> 02:09:37.754
<v Speaker 6>This has been harder.</v>

4505
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:39.050
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4506
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.590
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4507
02:09:39.590 --> 02:09:41.300
<v Speaker 6>it's harder than a death of a little baby.</v>

4508
02:09:41.301 --> 02:09:41.750
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

4509
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:42.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4510
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:43.610
<v Speaker 6>The stuff we've had to deal with,</v>

4511
02:09:44.150 --> 02:09:44.983
<v Speaker 6>like in what way?</v>

4512
02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:47.330
<v Speaker 6>Horrible stuff I don't really won't go into,</v>

4513
02:09:47.331 --> 02:09:47.571
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4514
02:09:47.571 --> 02:09:48.440
<v Speaker 6>we probably don't have time,</v>

4515
02:09:48.441 --> 02:09:49.160
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

4516
02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:49.730
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4517
02:09:49.730 --> 02:09:54.470
<v Speaker 6>every nasty thing that can be done has been done or attempted to be done.</v>

4518
02:09:55.700 --> 02:09:59.780
<v Speaker 6>Too many of us and particularly to to us,</v>

4519
02:09:59.810 --> 02:10:00.080
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4520
02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:00.290
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

4521
02:10:00.290 --> 02:10:01.160
<v Speaker 6>my family and</v>

4522
02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:03.750
<v Speaker 6>my family so much is,</v>

4523
02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:04.400
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

4524
02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:04.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4525
02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:06.860
<v Speaker 6>targeting me with</v>

4526
02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:11.400
<v Speaker 4>nastiness of it was just unbelievable and ridicule and always know that.</v>

4527
02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:13.473
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4528
02:10:13.530 --> 02:10:14.640
<v Speaker 4>People threaten you to what?</v>

4529
02:10:14.641 --> 02:10:16.140
<v Speaker 4>Stop talking about Ufos.</v>

4530
02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:17.150
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4531
02:10:17.150 --> 02:10:17.983
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4532
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:19.800
<v Speaker 6>problems that we've had with them.</v>

4533
02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:20.990
<v Speaker 6>A lot of security problems.</v>

4534
02:10:20.991 --> 02:10:24.860
<v Speaker 6>I mean there was an FBI file over open on this because of the death threats and</v>

4535
02:10:24.861 --> 02:10:26.030
<v Speaker 6>this stuff we've had.</v>

4536
02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:27.733
<v Speaker 4>And so you,</v>

4537
02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:30.810
<v Speaker 4>these death threats are from these people that you're exposing that are in the</v>

4538
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:31.940
<v Speaker 4>cabal of this.</v>

4539
02:10:32.490 --> 02:10:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Who knows where coming from.</v>

4540
02:10:33.771 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 4>You could</v>

4541
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:35.390
<v Speaker 6>just say it with some nut job,</v>

4542
02:10:35.550 --> 02:10:36.960
<v Speaker 6>like the people who shot up the,</v>

4543
02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:38.270
<v Speaker 6>the Sikh temple,</v>

4544
02:10:38.271 --> 02:10:40.250
<v Speaker 6>where are our directors family as you know,</v>

4545
02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:43.730
<v Speaker 6>his father was murdered horribly at this thing.</v>

4546
02:10:43.731 --> 02:10:44.450
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

4547
02:10:44.450 --> 02:10:45.231
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

4548
02:10:45.231 --> 02:10:49.610
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying that it's a lot easier being an emergency doctor than dealing</v>

4549
02:10:49.611 --> 02:10:52.640
<v Speaker 6>with this issue when you know it's real and you're dealing with this level of</v>

4550
02:10:52.641 --> 02:10:57.641
<v Speaker 6>intelligence in the CIA has affected your career.</v>

4551
02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:58.551
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4552
02:10:58.551 --> 02:11:00.170
<v Speaker 6>I've left medicine not cause I had to,</v>

4553
02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:00.501
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4554
02:11:00.501 --> 02:11:01.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4555
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:04.580
<v Speaker 6>but because I had to choose how I put this.</v>

4556
02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:07.070
<v Speaker 6>You only have 24 hours in a day.</v>

4557
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:08.323
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

4558
02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:13.540
<v Speaker 6>at a certain point I had to decide I'm either going to continue as a physician</v>

4559
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:17.420
<v Speaker 6>or I'm going to go full steam on this.</v>

4560
02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:21.680
<v Speaker 6>Now of course it was a big sacrifice for my family and I was given up hundreds</v>

4561
02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:23.690
<v Speaker 6>of thousands of dollars a year as a doctor to do this for nothing.</v>

4562
02:11:24.110 --> 02:11:24.943
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

4563
02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:25.640
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4564
02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:26.120
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4565
02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:27.050
<v Speaker 6>it's been difficult.</v>

4566
02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:27.581
<v Speaker 6>So I just,</v>

4567
02:11:27.581 --> 02:11:27.891
<v Speaker 6>what I'm saying,</v>

4568
02:11:27.891 --> 02:11:29.120
<v Speaker 6>it's been difficult in every way,</v>

4569
02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:29.810
<v Speaker 6>but that,</v>

4570
02:11:29.810 --> 02:11:30.471
<v Speaker 6>that's not important.</v>

4571
02:11:30.471 --> 02:11:31.060
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>

4572
02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:31.893
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4573
02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:33.640
<v Speaker 1>it is important and you're,</v>

4574
02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:34.310
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4575
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

4576
02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:35.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a tremendous sacrifice.</v>

4577
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:36.431
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4578
02:11:36.431 --> 02:11:38.810
<v Speaker 1>especially cause it's something that you would truly believe in.</v>

4579
02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:40.130
<v Speaker 1>How do you support yourself now?</v>

4580
02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:42.030
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4581
02:11:42.030 --> 02:11:42.863
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4582
02:11:43.590 --> 02:11:45.750
<v Speaker 6>I have enough resourcefulness.</v>

4583
02:11:45.751 --> 02:11:45.930
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4584
02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:45.991
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4585
02:11:45.991 --> 02:11:46.980
<v Speaker 6>before I left medicine,</v>

4586
02:11:46.981 --> 02:11:51.981
<v Speaker 6>I bought my home and I'd saved enough and invest enough that I'm okay.</v>

4587
02:11:53.050 --> 02:11:53.361
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4588
02:11:53.361 --> 02:11:56.610
<v Speaker 6>and then I have a little bit of income from some of the books and things,</v>

4589
02:11:56.611 --> 02:11:57.241
<v Speaker 6>but I mean,</v>

4590
02:11:57.241 --> 02:11:58.590
<v Speaker 6>it's very modest compared to,</v>

4591
02:11:58.620 --> 02:11:58.831
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4592
02:11:58.831 --> 02:11:59.730
<v Speaker 6>what I would have been making.</v>

4593
02:11:59.731 --> 02:12:00.070
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4594
02:12:00.070 --> 02:12:00.240
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4595
02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:00.571
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4596
02:12:00.571 --> 02:12:00.840
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4597
02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.400
<v Speaker 6>I'd probably in the aggregate of,</v>

4598
02:12:02.401 --> 02:12:07.401
<v Speaker 6>given up around somewhere in the neighborhood of five to $6 million in income</v>

4599
02:12:07.530 --> 02:12:08.363
<v Speaker 6>doing this,</v>

4600
02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:09.000
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4601
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.390
<v Speaker 6>w which I actually don't regret at all because I don't care about the money.</v>

4602
02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:13.410
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4603
02:12:13.410 --> 02:12:13.611
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4604
02:12:13.611 --> 02:12:16.080
<v Speaker 6>I care about people say that I hate when people say that.</v>

4605
02:12:16.110 --> 02:12:16.201
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4606
02:12:16.201 --> 02:12:16.891
<v Speaker 6>I really don't.</v>

4607
02:12:16.891 --> 02:12:17.101
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4608
02:12:17.101 --> 02:12:17.671
<v Speaker 6>this is why,</v>

4609
02:12:17.671 --> 02:12:18.330
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4610
02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:21.120
<v Speaker 6>and now this the deal probably string credulity here,</v>

4611
02:12:21.121 --> 02:12:26.121
<v Speaker 6>but a former head of army intelligence approached me in 1992 and,</v>

4612
02:12:26.490 --> 02:12:26.571
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4613
02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:27.404
<v Speaker 6>offered me,</v>

4614
02:12:27.630 --> 02:12:28.440
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4615
02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:32.310
<v Speaker 6>the kind of control over a $2 billion fund.</v>

4616
02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:36.630
<v Speaker 6>If I would shut up and close down the disclosure project and see Seti,</v>

4617
02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:36.981
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4618
02:12:36.981 --> 02:12:40.190
<v Speaker 1>could not control over a $2 billion fund with a,</v>

4619
02:12:40.191 --> 02:12:40.600
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

4620
02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>two g.</v>

4621
02:12:40.930 --> 02:12:41.763
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

4622
02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:42.950
<v Speaker 1>what did he want you to do?</v>

4623
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:43.783
<v Speaker 1>Just basically,</v>

4624
02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I could do anything with it.</v>

4625
02:12:45.170 --> 02:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>So long as I of shut,</v>

4626
02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:50.630
<v Speaker 1>you could just go big pimpin giant yacht Ferrari,</v>

4627
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:51.291
<v Speaker 1>who knows.</v>

4628
02:12:51.291 --> 02:12:51.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4629
02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:52.640
<v Speaker 1>no more Dr. Greer</v>

4630
02:12:52.710 --> 02:12:53.011
<v Speaker 6>and then,</v>

4631
02:12:53.011 --> 02:12:53.221
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4632
02:12:53.221 --> 02:12:53.641
<v Speaker 6>and I said,</v>

4633
02:12:53.641 --> 02:12:53.791
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4634
02:12:53.791 --> 02:12:57.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to do that because I really believe that this issue needs to be</v>

4635
02:12:57.331 --> 02:12:58.680
<v Speaker 6>dealt with it properly.</v>

4636
02:12:58.810 --> 02:13:02.130
<v Speaker 6>The Guy who went to my wife and tried to convince her to convince me,</v>

4637
02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:03.090
<v Speaker 6>and this,</v>

4638
02:13:03.090 --> 02:13:03.301
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4639
02:13:03.301 --> 02:13:04.134
<v Speaker 6>this is the kind of thing,</v>

4640
02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:06.840
<v Speaker 1>does he want you to work for him or he just wanted you to share them?</v>

4641
02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:10.750
<v Speaker 6>He wanted me to merge what we were doing with some operation he had,</v>

4642
02:13:10.751 --> 02:13:13.400
<v Speaker 6>which would have basically subsumed it and,</v>

4643
02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:14.690
<v Speaker 6>and cooperative and,</v>

4644
02:13:14.691 --> 02:13:15.191
<v Speaker 6>and I said,</v>

4645
02:13:15.191 --> 02:13:15.820
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

4646
02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:18.760
<v Speaker 6>And then he made another run and I said no.</v>

4647
02:13:19.090 --> 02:13:20.650
<v Speaker 6>And then about a month after that,</v>

4648
02:13:20.651 --> 02:13:21.520
<v Speaker 6>all over the Internet,</v>

4649
02:13:21.521 --> 02:13:22.930
<v Speaker 6>it came out that I wasn't even a doctor.</v>

4650
02:13:22.931 --> 02:13:26.770
<v Speaker 6>Here I am in this emergency department and it's a bunch of goons and put out</v>

4651
02:13:26.771 --> 02:13:29.860
<v Speaker 6>there that I'm not even an actual MD and I'm there,</v>

4652
02:13:29.861 --> 02:13:30.071
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4653
02:13:30.071 --> 02:13:33.960
<v Speaker 6>up to my eyeballs in blood and guts and in the Er and this thing breaks.</v>

4654
02:13:33.961 --> 02:13:34.320
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4655
02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:34.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4656
02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:39.210
<v Speaker 6>they do all kinds of disinformation in psychological warfare stuff on people.</v>

4657
02:13:39.530 --> 02:13:40.140
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4658
02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:43.020
<v Speaker 6>but I don't really mind that that's happened.</v>

4659
02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:43.591
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4660
02:13:43.591 --> 02:13:47.520
<v Speaker 6>what I'm more concerned about is the people who have the knowledge and</v>

4661
02:13:47.521 --> 02:13:48.540
<v Speaker 6>responsibility,</v>

4662
02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:53.010
<v Speaker 6>who don't do the right thing because there's no way that I can do this by</v>

4663
02:13:53.011 --> 02:13:53.560
<v Speaker 6>myself.</v>

4664
02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:55.830
<v Speaker 6>And what I was really gratified to see,</v>

4665
02:13:55.831 --> 02:13:58.020
<v Speaker 6>and I'm still gratified to see is,</v>

4666
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:59.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4667
02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:00.270
<v Speaker 6>are all these people,</v>

4668
02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:04.620
<v Speaker 6>the military men and women and others who have come forward a very courageously,</v>

4669
02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:05.400
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4670
02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.300
<v Speaker 6>academics like the ones doing the work on this potential little humanoid</v>

4671
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:10.171
<v Speaker 6>creature,</v>

4672
02:14:10.171 --> 02:14:11.280
<v Speaker 6>which is a real creature,</v>

4673
02:14:11.281 --> 02:14:11.760
<v Speaker 6>whether it,</v>

4674
02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.241
<v Speaker 6>what it is,</v>

4675
02:14:12.241 --> 02:14:13.074
<v Speaker 6>we don't know,</v>

4676
02:14:13.110 --> 02:14:14.070
<v Speaker 6>but they,</v>

4677
02:14:14.071 --> 02:14:16.590
<v Speaker 6>it's a really courageous thing for these people to be doing that.</v>

4678
02:14:16.890 --> 02:14:17.723
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4679
02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:22.020
<v Speaker 6>the people who led the charge and France to release all these documents.</v>

4680
02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:22.610
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4681
02:14:22.610 --> 02:14:23.820
<v Speaker 6>I know the backstory to that,</v>

4682
02:14:23.821 --> 02:14:24.930
<v Speaker 6>that the public doesn't know.</v>

4683
02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:26.010
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4684
02:14:26.010 --> 02:14:26.700
<v Speaker 6>and there were,</v>

4685
02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:27.930
<v Speaker 6>it was very controversial.</v>

4686
02:14:28.290 --> 02:14:29.150
<v Speaker 6>So I mean,</v>

4687
02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:31.440
<v Speaker 6>this is the kind of courage we need,</v>

4688
02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:32.010
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4689
02:14:32.010 --> 02:14:35.040
<v Speaker 6>to get the truth out and to go forward as a civilization.</v>

4690
02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:35.880
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4691
02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:36.420
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4692
02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:36.751
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

4693
02:14:36.751 --> 02:14:36.961
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4694
02:14:36.961 --> 02:14:37.794
<v Speaker 6>you can't buy it.</v>

4695
02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:38.610
<v Speaker 6>You got to have it.</v>

4696
02:14:38.610 --> 02:14:39.450
<v Speaker 6>You got to manifest it.</v>

4697
02:14:39.490 --> 02:14:40.200
<v Speaker 6>Him.</v>

4698
02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:42.270
<v Speaker 4>Are you getting income from this?</v>

4699
02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:43.050
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

4700
02:14:43.050 --> 02:14:43.560
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4701
02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:44.820
<v Speaker 4>You don't get any income from them?</v>

4702
02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:45.070
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4703
02:14:45.070 --> 02:14:45.940
<v Speaker 6>This is um,</v>

4704
02:14:46.150 --> 02:14:46.361
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4705
02:14:46.361 --> 02:14:48.240

4706
02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:51.010
<v Speaker 6>the movie is that it was all crowdfunded.</v>

4707
02:14:52.030 --> 02:14:52.480
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4708
02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:54.300
<v Speaker 6>no one on my team has taken any funds from,</v>

4709
02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:56.050
<v Speaker 6>it's all going into the production of the movie.</v>

4710
02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:57.230
<v Speaker 4>You don't even take a salary?</v>

4711
02:14:57.620 --> 02:14:58.010
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4712
02:14:58.010 --> 02:14:58.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

4713

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4786
02:16:38.410 --> 02:16:43.000
<v Speaker 1>what is this thing that you're doing where you leave people out into the desert</v>

4787
02:16:43.090 --> 02:16:48.090
<v Speaker 1>and you have them make contact with something if Uriel crafts and beings and</v>

4793
02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:56.810
<v Speaker 5>I was talking about close encounters of the fifth kind that we're using these</v>

4794
02:16:56.811 --> 02:16:57.531
<v Speaker 5>different protocols.</v>

4795
02:16:57.531 --> 02:16:57.921
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

4796
02:16:57.921 --> 02:16:58.460
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

4797
02:16:58.460 --> 02:16:59.300
<v Speaker 5>there's a smartphone,</v>

4798
02:16:59.301 --> 02:17:02.360
<v Speaker 5>an iPhone app for this that you can get it serious disclosure.com.</v>

4800
02:17:03.810 --> 02:17:07.190

<v Speaker 5>It has the tones that were recorded in this crop circle of this weird energy</v>

4802

4808
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:20.023
<v Speaker 5>it's at a,</v>

4809

<v Speaker 5>you can go to serious disclosure.com and there's a,</v>

4810
02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:23.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

02:17:23.710 --> 02:17:28.710
<v Speaker 5>an icon there and you can link and it goes to the either the iTunes store or the</v>

4812
02:17:29.481 --> 02:17:30.470
<v Speaker 5>android store.</v>

4813
02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4814
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:31.311

4818
02:17:34.311 --> 02:17:36.500
<v Speaker 5>Did they have to go through a screening process?</v>

4819
02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:37.180
<v Speaker 5>Like there's an APP.</v>

4820
02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:38.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's of course it's a,</v>

4821
02:17:38.361 --> 02:17:43.361
<v Speaker 5>if we do about a week training of people in remote viewing and the protocols of</v>

4822
02:17:43.881 --> 02:17:45.620
<v Speaker 5>contact and uh,</v>

4823
02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:47.870
<v Speaker 5>they're sort of the whole concept of it,</v>

4824
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:50.240
<v Speaker 5>but also how to look at the night sky.</v>

4825
02:17:50.390 --> 02:17:51.560
<v Speaker 5>You go out with satellite charts.</v>

4826
02:17:51.561 --> 02:17:53.480
<v Speaker 5>We have fourth generation night scopes.</v>

4827
02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:55.040
<v Speaker 5>We have really good cameras.</v>

4828
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.903
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4829
02:17:55.970 --> 02:17:57.170
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

4830
02:17:57.650 --> 02:17:59.930
<v Speaker 5>in fact we're going to be doing one in Colorado in June.</v>

4831
02:18:00.290 --> 02:18:01.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the high desert.</v>

4832
02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:02.690
<v Speaker 5>I have some land up there.</v>

4833
02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:03.110
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4834
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:04.970
<v Speaker 5>what is the actual name of this app?</v>

4835
02:18:04.971 --> 02:18:06.800
<v Speaker 5>Because there was a couple of contact apps.</v>

4836
02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:07.941
<v Speaker 5>Well again,</v>

4837
02:18:07.941 --> 02:18:11.030
<v Speaker 5>you have to go to serious disclosure.com and there's a link there for it.</v>

4838
02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:11.561
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4839
02:18:11.561 --> 02:18:13.970
<v Speaker 5>you know the name of the name of your own app.</v>

4840
02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:15.633
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4841
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:17.510
<v Speaker 5>I have so many irons in the fire.</v>

4842
02:18:17.511 --> 02:18:21.810
<v Speaker 5>I think it's called a the t contact at o t contact that I'm gonna try that t</v>

4843
02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:22.693
<v Speaker 5>contract up.</v>

4844
02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:23.350
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

02:18:25.701 --> 02:18:29.090
<v Speaker 5>You have a course and in this course what are these people do?</v>

4848
02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:30.960
<v Speaker 5>The idea is,</v>

4849
02:18:30.961 --> 02:18:34.130
<v Speaker 5>is that we want to see your signal.</v>

4850

<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>

4851
02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:35.793
<v Speaker 5>that is.</v>

4852
02:18:36.410 --> 02:18:38.960
<v Speaker 5>So I just bought your APP.</v>

4853
02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:39.853
<v Speaker 5>Powerful.</v>

4854

02:18:40.641 --> 02:18:44.540
<v Speaker 5>So explain to me where would someone sign up for something like this?</v>

4856
02:18:45.020 --> 02:18:45.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4857
02:18:45.291 --> 02:18:47.870
<v Speaker 5>And we do these expeditions a few times a year.</v>

4858
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.983
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4859
02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:49.873
<v Speaker 5>I used to,</v>

4860
02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:53.030
<v Speaker 5>there there are only about 20 people who are,</v>

4861
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:54.470
<v Speaker 5>who are allowed to come now,</v>

4862
02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:55.070
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4863
02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:55.903
<v Speaker 5>when you had a time,</v>

4864
02:18:56.300 --> 02:18:59.510
<v Speaker 5>cause I can't handle more than that for a week out in the desert or out in the</v>

4865
02:18:59.511 --> 02:18:59.930
<v Speaker 5>mountains,</v>

4866
02:18:59.930 --> 02:19:01.130
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

4867
02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:04.460
<v Speaker 5>and I just don't have time to do it more often than the four or five times a</v>

4868
02:19:04.461 --> 02:19:05.530
<v Speaker 5>year that we do.</v>

4869
02:19:05.610 --> 02:19:07.750
<v Speaker 5>So you do it quarterly you,</v>

4870
02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:08.390
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4871
02:19:08.390 --> 02:19:09.280
<v Speaker 5>well yeah,</v>

4872
02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:09.861
<v Speaker 5>the seasonally,</v>

4873
02:19:09.861 --> 02:19:12.170
<v Speaker 5>but the schedule is up@cirrusdisclosure.com.</v>

4874
02:19:12.171 --> 02:19:13.970
<v Speaker 5>There's a place where do you bring these people?</v>

4875
02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:15.051
<v Speaker 5>It just depends.</v>

4876
02:19:15.051 --> 02:19:15.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean like we're at,</v>

4877
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:17.810
<v Speaker 5>the next one is going to be in the high desert of Colorado.</v>

4878
02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:19.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm at about 8,000 feet.</v>

4879
02:19:19.690 --> 02:19:22.880
<v Speaker 5>It was a remote area near the great sand dunes that's had a lot of reports of</v>

4880
02:19:22.881 --> 02:19:24.110
<v Speaker 5>Ufos and contact.</v>

4881
02:19:24.111 --> 02:19:24.501
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

4882
02:19:24.501 --> 02:19:24.800
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4883
02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:27.920
<v Speaker 5>the film director and his crew were out there last a few months ago</v>

4884
02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:32.770
<v Speaker 6>in 2012 when we had this disc fly over and then a jet came into intercepted and</v>

4885
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:33.410
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

4886
02:19:33.410 --> 02:19:34.400
<v Speaker 6>and that's going to be in the film.</v>

4887
02:19:34.401 --> 02:19:38.420
<v Speaker 6>It's really cool video of that or a photo that both really,</v>

4888
02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:42.410
<v Speaker 6>so you have a video of this disk in the sky and then a jet approaching a</v>

4889
02:19:42.411 --> 02:19:44.600
<v Speaker 6>discount probably coming out of Colorado Springs.</v>

4890
02:19:44.601 --> 02:19:45.770
<v Speaker 6>So that was coming out of that direction.</v>

4891
02:19:45.771 --> 02:19:46.131
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

4892
02:19:46.131 --> 02:19:46.341
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

4893
02:19:46.341 --> 02:19:46.790
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4894
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:47.780
<v Speaker 6>it's really pretty cool.</v>

4895
02:19:47.781 --> 02:19:48.200
<v Speaker 6>And of course,</v>

4896
02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:48.731
<v Speaker 6>I think when,</v>

4897
02:19:48.731 --> 02:19:49.840
<v Speaker 6>when the director saw this,</v>

4898
02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:50.200
<v Speaker 6>he went,</v>

4899
02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:51.033
<v Speaker 6>oh wow.</v>

4900
02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:52.550
<v Speaker 6>And who put this video together?</v>

4901
02:19:52.551 --> 02:19:53.031
<v Speaker 6>Who made it?</v>

4902
02:19:53.031 --> 02:19:53.864
<v Speaker 6>Who filmed it?</v>

4903
02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:55.010
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4904
02:19:55.010 --> 02:19:57.410
<v Speaker 6>the film crew for serious.</v>

4905
02:19:57.650 --> 02:19:58.610
<v Speaker 6>So you,</v>

4906
02:19:58.640 --> 02:19:59.473
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4907
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:01.543
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>

4908
02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:03.700
<v Speaker 6>So we have,</v>

4909
02:20:03.810 --> 02:20:05.660
<v Speaker 6>want to make sure we'll clear this.</v>

4910
02:20:05.661 --> 02:20:07.910
<v Speaker 6>You have thousands of these videos where there's one,</v>

4911
02:20:07.930 --> 02:20:08.120
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4912
02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:08.320
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4913
02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:09.830
<v Speaker 6>If you go again to this website,</v>

4914
02:20:09.831 --> 02:20:11.430
<v Speaker 6>you'll see that there's a section for the,</v>

4915
02:20:12.020 --> 02:20:16.790
<v Speaker 6>where the contact expeditions in the c five expeditions and a couple of years</v>

4916
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:17.350
<v Speaker 6>ago we were up on,</v>

4917
02:20:17.350 --> 02:20:20.060
<v Speaker 6>now there's a mountain north of here called Mt.</v>

4918
02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:21.140
<v Speaker 6>Shasta near the Oregon border,</v>

4919
02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:22.070
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4920
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:23.120
<v Speaker 6>in the cascade range.</v>

4921
02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:24.540
<v Speaker 6>And it's a volcanic mountain.</v>

4922
02:20:24.541 --> 02:20:28.130
<v Speaker 6>And we've gone up there a number of years and we've had these objects that have</v>

4923
02:20:28.131 --> 02:20:31.250
<v Speaker 6>appeared and one of them was actually in the field.</v>

4924
02:20:31.770 --> 02:20:32.140
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4925
02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:36.200
<v Speaker 6>we had their night vision camera running and it lifted up and does this.</v>

4926
02:20:36.201 --> 02:20:36.600
<v Speaker 6>And then this,</v>

4927
02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:39.050
<v Speaker 6>like this corkscrew in d materialize in the sky.</v>

4928
02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:42.290
<v Speaker 6>We have this on video tape and it was during one of these expeditions and it's a</v>

4929
02:20:42.291 --> 02:20:43.190
<v Speaker 6>really amazing,</v>

4930
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:44.300
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4931
02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:45.130
<v Speaker 6>bit of video.</v>

4932
02:20:45.130 --> 02:20:46.880
<v Speaker 6>Is Ball lightening a real phenomenon?</v>

4933
02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:48.440
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4934
02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:48.741
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

4935

<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

4937
02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:49.920
<v Speaker 6>And that,</v>

4938
02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:50.441
<v Speaker 6>that's not it.</v>

4939
02:20:50.441 --> 02:20:51.470
<v Speaker 6>This is clear skies,</v>

4940
02:20:51.471 --> 02:20:55.070
<v Speaker 6>no weather coming up from the ground but don't they but,</v>

4941
02:20:55.150 --> 02:20:57.740
<v Speaker 6>but doesn't ball lightning to have something to do with,</v>

4942
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.950
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4943
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:58.420
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

4944
02:20:58.420 --> 02:20:59.920
<v Speaker 6>there's certain types of,</v>

4945
02:20:59.930 --> 02:21:04.310
<v Speaker 6>of visual phenomenon that have to do with tectonic plates and pressure and</v>

4946
02:21:04.311 --> 02:21:04.940
<v Speaker 6>stress.</v>

4947
02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:05.750
<v Speaker 6>Pizo Electric.</v>

4948
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.961
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4949
02:21:05.961 --> 02:21:08.540
<v Speaker 6>What do you know what that's very different also that be just sort of a</v>

4950
02:21:08.541 --> 02:21:09.141
<v Speaker 6>discharge,</v>

4951
02:21:09.141 --> 02:21:11.720
<v Speaker 6>like an electrical discharge and that's from the rocks.</v>

4952
02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:15.590
<v Speaker 6>And usually it's when there's quartz depressure of it into an electromagnetic</v>

4953
02:21:15.591 --> 02:21:17.180
<v Speaker 6>energy will build up in Oberst burst out.</v>

4954
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.901
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

4955
02:21:17.901 --> 02:21:20.330
<v Speaker 6>this is an object and you can see it quite clearly and it's,</v>

4956
02:21:20.331 --> 02:21:21.110
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4957
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:23.840
<v Speaker 6>it's right at the edge of the speed of light cause it's kind of coming in and</v>

4958
02:21:23.841 --> 02:21:24.740
<v Speaker 6>out of this dimension.</v>

4959
02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:27.140
<v Speaker 6>It's a really great video and there were like 30,</v>

4960
02:21:27.141 --> 02:21:28.550
<v Speaker 6>40 people who saw this happen.</v>

4961
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:29.420
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4962
02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:30.380
<v Speaker 6>so we do this.</v>

4963
02:21:30.381 --> 02:21:32.510
<v Speaker 6>I've been doing this for 22 years.</v>

4964
02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:33.373
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

4970
02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:38.750
<v Speaker 6>it was one of these objects that came over.</v>

4971
02:21:38.751 --> 02:21:39.980
<v Speaker 6>I think that was at Mount Shasta.</v>

4972
02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:40.761
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>

4973
02:21:40.761 --> 02:21:42.920
<v Speaker 6>It's my laser and it was this object that came right over.</v>

4974
02:21:43.430 --> 02:21:43.910
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

4975
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:46.580
<v Speaker 6>we also train people who always go out with satellite charts.</v>

4976
02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:47.461
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4977

02:21:47.991 --> 02:21:52.010
<v Speaker 6>so you know when the satellite footage of this thing flying in the sky.</v>

4979
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.903
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

4989
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.931
<v Speaker 6>It'll go a hundred,</v>

4990
02:21:59.931 --> 02:22:01.220
<v Speaker 6>200 miles in the space.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like what are you trying,</v>

4998
02:22:06.890 --> 02:22:07.311
<v Speaker 6>we had,</v>

4999
02:22:07.311 --> 02:22:09.770
<v Speaker 6>so we do the protocols where you do the remote viewing,</v>

5000
02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:10.910
<v Speaker 6>set up the vector,</v>

5001
02:22:11.100 --> 02:22:12.110
<v Speaker 6>show them where you are.</v>

5002
02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:14.750
<v Speaker 6>We played these electronic tones in the space.</v>

5003
02:22:14.751 --> 02:22:17.210
<v Speaker 6>And then have electronic field detectors out there.</v>

5004
02:22:17.211 --> 02:22:19.520
<v Speaker 6>So we'll have magnetic field detectors,</v>

5005
02:22:19.970 --> 02:22:21.500
<v Speaker 6>various lasers detectors,</v>

5006
02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:23.570
<v Speaker 6>other electromagnetic spectrum.</v>

5007
02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:24.890
<v Speaker 6>And those will begin to go.</v>

5008
02:22:25.650 --> 02:22:28.730
<v Speaker 6>And then we'll have an object fly over like this object here that was right near</v>

5009
02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:30.510
<v Speaker 6>as it comes right outside.</v>

5010
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:35.780
<v Speaker 6>So what people have to understand is that if you have an object that is coming</v>

5011
02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:40.380
<v Speaker 6>in and out of dimensions,</v>

5012
02:22:40.770 --> 02:22:44.400
<v Speaker 6>it's not going to necessarily look like a seven 47 or even a flying saucer.</v>

5013
02:22:44.730 --> 02:22:46.590
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be in various energy forms.</v>

5014
02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:48.720
<v Speaker 6>And this is the weird sort of effect.</v>

5015
02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:49.913
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5016
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:55.070
<v Speaker 6>most people don't understand that 99% of the time an interstellar civilization</v>

5017
02:22:55.411 --> 02:22:58.770
<v Speaker 6>doesn't have to be in linear space time if they have that kind of physics.</v>

5018
02:22:59.130 --> 02:23:03.300
<v Speaker 6>So what happens when you go beyond the speed of light or you're going to not</v>

5019
02:23:03.301 --> 02:23:04.260
<v Speaker 6>have anything visible,</v>

5020
02:23:04.261 --> 02:23:08.640
<v Speaker 6>but if you begin to have an energy discharge into an area of space and it's very</v>

5021
02:23:08.641 --> 02:23:10.260
<v Speaker 6>close to this dimension,</v>

5022
02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:13.350
<v Speaker 6>it'll start to give off an energy field or corona.</v>

5023
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:18.860
<v Speaker 6>And so one of the witnesses we have was that a nuclear hot base out in Oklahoma</v>

5024
02:23:19.351 --> 02:23:20.340
<v Speaker 6>back a years ago,</v>

5025
02:23:20.341 --> 02:23:21.510
<v Speaker 6>I think it was in the 70s.</v>

5026
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:24.450
<v Speaker 6>And there was this object that was in the shape of Ufo,</v>

5027
02:23:24.451 --> 02:23:25.440
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't solid.</v>

5028
02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:26.700
<v Speaker 6>And it flew over the,</v>

5029
02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:27.600
<v Speaker 6>what they call the hot,</v>

5030
02:23:27.601 --> 02:23:27.751
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5031
02:23:27.751 --> 02:23:30.960
<v Speaker 6>with the jets were hot load with nuclear weapons and the alarms went off.</v>

5032
02:23:31.170 --> 02:23:33.240
<v Speaker 6>But he says this thing was not solid.</v>

5033
02:23:33.241 --> 02:23:34.074
<v Speaker 6>Like this is,</v>

5034
02:23:34.210 --> 02:23:34.620
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5035
02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:35.520
<v Speaker 6>like your rock salt.</v>

5036
02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:36.090
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5037
02:23:36.090 --> 02:23:36.923
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

5038
02:23:37.410 --> 02:23:38.610
<v Speaker 6>you could have walked right through it,</v>

5039
02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:40.650
<v Speaker 6>but it was in the shape of a craft,</v>

5040
02:23:41.010 --> 02:23:44.940
<v Speaker 6>but it was shifted so that the matter was all energy.</v>

5041
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.260
<v Speaker 6>And of course matter is energy.</v>

5042
02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:50.850
<v Speaker 6>So the physics behind this gets into some really arcane stuff probably beyond</v>

5043
02:23:50.851 --> 02:23:51.780
<v Speaker 6>the scope of the show.</v>

5044
02:23:51.930 --> 02:23:52.830
<v Speaker 6>But it's what I,</v>

5045
02:23:53.070 --> 02:23:57.510
<v Speaker 6>this is part of what we're teaching people when we take them out is how do these</v>

5046
02:23:57.511 --> 02:23:58.410
<v Speaker 6>objects appear?</v>

5047
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:59.970
<v Speaker 6>What might you see?</v>

5048
02:24:00.510 --> 02:24:02.190
<v Speaker 6>And I was talking to a,</v>

5049
02:24:02.191 --> 02:24:07.191
<v Speaker 6>an actor here in town who had one of these happen near his home and it was very</v>

5050
02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:11.130
<v Speaker 6>palpable and very real,</v>

5051
02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:12.233
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't,</v>

5052
02:24:12.570 --> 02:24:13.830
<v Speaker 6>can you tell us who the actor was?</v>

5053
02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:17.040
<v Speaker 6>Because now there are no,</v>

5054
02:24:17.041 --> 02:24:17.371
<v Speaker 6>but he,</v>

5055
02:24:17.371 --> 02:24:17.671
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5056
02:24:17.671 --> 02:24:17.821
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5057
02:24:17.821 --> 02:24:18.181
<v Speaker 6>these are,</v>

5058
02:24:18.181 --> 02:24:20.130
<v Speaker 6>there are a lot of people who've had these sort of experiences.</v>

5059
02:24:20.130 --> 02:24:25.130
<v Speaker 6>They don't want to talk about it because they're afraid of being ridiculed and,</v>

5060
02:24:26.010 --> 02:24:27.660
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

5061
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:29.010
<v Speaker 6>when it was described to me,</v>

5062
02:24:29.011 --> 02:24:29.211
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

5063
02:24:29.211 --> 02:24:29.401
<v Speaker 6>well yeah,</v>

5064
02:24:29.401 --> 02:24:30.091
<v Speaker 6>that's classic.</v>

5065
02:24:30.091 --> 02:24:30.924
<v Speaker 6>They really,</v>

5066
02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:31.261
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

5067
02:24:31.261 --> 02:24:32.010
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5068
02:24:32.010 --> 02:24:32.820
<v Speaker 6>because if it's,</v>

5069
02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:34.860
<v Speaker 6>if it's not a lucky Martin,</v>

5070
02:24:35.490 --> 02:24:36.323
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5071
02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:39.090
<v Speaker 6>antigravity and it's really as CT,</v>

5072
02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:40.560
<v Speaker 6>the weirder it is,</v>

5073
02:24:40.561 --> 02:24:42.030
<v Speaker 6>the more likely it is to be Iti.</v>

5074
02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:44.970
<v Speaker 6>And this gets into the whole question,</v>

5075
02:24:44.971 --> 02:24:46.110
<v Speaker 6>what are you looking for?</v>

5076
02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:49.740
<v Speaker 6>So we train people to know kind of what to look for versus,</v>

5077
02:24:49.770 --> 02:24:50.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5078
02:24:50.101 --> 02:24:51.540
<v Speaker 6>if experimental aircraft,</v>

5079
02:24:52.170 --> 02:24:53.250
<v Speaker 6>normal aircraft,</v>

5080
02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:53.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5081
02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:55.170
<v Speaker 6>space objects in junk,</v>

5082
02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:55.800
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5083
02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:57.960
<v Speaker 6>satellites and then the stuff,</v>

5084
02:24:57.961 --> 02:24:58.670
<v Speaker 6>that's</v>

5085
02:24:58.670 --> 02:24:59.870
<v Speaker 1>the weird end of it.</v>

5086
02:25:00.020 --> 02:25:01.280
<v Speaker 1>So the weird end of it.</v>

5087
02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5088
02:25:01.650 --> 02:25:02.750
<v Speaker 1>they're really cool stuff.</v>

5089
02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Really cool stuff.</v>

5090
02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:05.090
<v Speaker 1>You take these people,</v>

5091
02:25:05.091 --> 02:25:06.500
<v Speaker 1>you bring them out to the high desert,</v>

5092
02:25:06.740 --> 02:25:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you tune them into whatever frequency through whatever methods of meditation or,</v>

5093
02:25:11.331 --> 02:25:12.164
<v Speaker 1>or what have you.</v>

5094
02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:16.340
<v Speaker 1>And these ships are they just waiting for someone to like email them,</v>

5095
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:17.810
<v Speaker 1>send them a signal?</v>

5096
02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:19.120
<v Speaker 6>You know what I think,</v>

5097
02:25:19.121 --> 02:25:22.540
<v Speaker 6>I think that they've actually been waiting a long time for people to do</v>

5098
02:25:22.541 --> 02:25:23.374
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

5099
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:25.240
<v Speaker 6>Just passively look at them.</v>

5100
02:25:25.340 --> 02:25:26.031
<v Speaker 1>Did they have to,</v>

5101
02:25:26.031 --> 02:25:28.880
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is do they have to like load up the ship?</v>

5102
02:25:28.881 --> 02:25:29.181
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

5103
02:25:29.181 --> 02:25:30.890
<v Speaker 1>we got some fucking people in the desert.</v>

5104
02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Everybody get on board now let's go,</v>

5105
02:25:33.321 --> 02:25:33.850
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

5106
02:25:33.850 --> 02:25:34.101
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

5107
02:25:34.101 --> 02:25:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And then how are you getting them to manifest?</v>

5108
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:38.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm not getting them to,</v>

5109
02:25:38.111 --> 02:25:39.580
<v Speaker 6>but how is anybody getting,</v>

5110
02:25:39.730 --> 02:25:40.420
<v Speaker 6>how was it,</v>

5111
02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:43.300
<v Speaker 6>how was the signal being recognized by them?</v>

5112
02:25:43.330 --> 02:25:47.110
<v Speaker 6>Because I'm quite convinced they have electronics that pick up on this,</v>

5113
02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:48.120
<v Speaker 6>what we were talking about earlier,</v>

5114
02:25:48.130 --> 02:25:52.090
<v Speaker 6>this conscious field of coherent thought and this is again the most</v>

5115
02:25:52.091 --> 02:25:56.050
<v Speaker 6>controversial and of what I'm doing it to me it's the most interesting also,</v>

5116
02:25:56.470 --> 02:25:56.950
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5117
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:57.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5118
02:25:57.101 --> 02:25:57.940
<v Speaker 6>before it was a doctor,</v>

5119
02:25:57.941 --> 02:25:59.200
<v Speaker 6>I was a meditation teacher.</v>

5120
02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:00.280
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you know that,</v>

5121
02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:00.550
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

5122
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:01.280
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5123
02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:01.410
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5124
02:26:01.410 --> 02:26:02.120
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know that was it.</v>

5125
02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.030
<v Speaker 6>What type of meditation?</v>

5126
02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:07.840
<v Speaker 6>A mantra in vedic Vedanta and vedic meditation.</v>

5127
02:26:08.350 --> 02:26:08.950
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5128
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:09.790
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

5129
02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:10.391
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5130
02:26:10.391 --> 02:26:14.530
<v Speaker 6>I learned Sanskrit and learn to teach people meditation.</v>

5131
02:26:14.531 --> 02:26:17.630
<v Speaker 6>So that was my first sort of career,</v>

5132
02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:18.870
<v Speaker 6>if you can call it a career,</v>

5133
02:26:18.871 --> 02:26:21.400
<v Speaker 6>it was an avocation as much as more than a vocation.</v>

5134
02:26:21.401 --> 02:26:22.540
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

5135
02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:23.980
<v Speaker 6>and I really,</v>

5136
02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:26.320
<v Speaker 6>and it was caused as a result of this near death experience.</v>

5137
02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:26.461
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5138
02:26:26.461 --> 02:26:27.090
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5139
02:26:27.090 --> 02:26:31.070
<v Speaker 6>and I began to realize that really the thing that,</v>

5140
02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:36.270
<v Speaker 6>that is most intriguing about all this is that free energy is like late 18</v>

5141
02:26:37.511 --> 02:26:42.511
<v Speaker 6>hundreds to mid 19 hundreds antigravity mid forties to mid fifties.</v>

5142
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:48.010
<v Speaker 6>The science of consciousness and the interface between mind and matter,</v>

5143
02:26:48.100 --> 02:26:49.390
<v Speaker 6>mind and body,</v>

5144
02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:52.300
<v Speaker 6>mind and thought in electromagnetic systems.</v>

5145
02:26:52.780 --> 02:26:54.130
<v Speaker 6>That's the really cool stuff.</v>

5146
02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:54.850
<v Speaker 6>And that's,</v>

5147
02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:55.061
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5148
02:26:55.061 --> 02:26:55.894
<v Speaker 6>to me,</v>

5149
02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:59.020
<v Speaker 6>most people know me for the disclosure project and these other things,</v>

5150
02:26:59.021 --> 02:27:02.200
<v Speaker 6>but to me that's the most exciting part of this because that is the frontier.</v>

5151
02:27:02.350 --> 02:27:04.990
<v Speaker 6>The final from tier is not space is consciousness.</v>

5152
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:08.380
<v Speaker 6>So you take these people out,</v>

5153
02:27:08.381 --> 02:27:11.620
<v Speaker 6>there's 20 of them and you spend how many days out there?</v>

5154
02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:12.550
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5155
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.801
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

5156
02:27:12.801 --> 02:27:14.410
<v Speaker 6>it's usually six days and nights.</v>

5157
02:27:14.411 --> 02:27:15.710
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

5158
02:27:16.660 --> 02:27:19.420
<v Speaker 6>so we go out during the day,</v>

5159
02:27:19.450 --> 02:27:24.450
<v Speaker 6>it's more a teaching module and teaching them a remote viewing concepts and</v>

5160
02:27:25.090 --> 02:27:26.230
<v Speaker 6>science of consciousness.</v>

5161
02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:26.860
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5162
02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:28.570
<v Speaker 6>other information they need to have.</v>

5163
02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:30.130
<v Speaker 6>Then we go out at night,</v>

5164
02:27:30.131 --> 02:27:34.030
<v Speaker 6>usually from around sunset to one or so in the morning sometimes too.</v>

5165
02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:35.313
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5166
02:27:35.470 --> 02:27:39.730
<v Speaker 6>and we're in out in the stars making observation,</v>

5167
02:27:39.970 --> 02:27:42.970
<v Speaker 6>doing the remote viewing practice and then people go home and do it.</v>

5168
02:27:42.971 --> 02:27:46.870
<v Speaker 6>But there's now something like 11 or 1200 teams all over the world doing this,</v>

5169
02:27:46.871 --> 02:27:47.260
<v Speaker 6>that we,</v>

5170
02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:48.940
<v Speaker 6>that or have picked up on this idea.</v>

5171
02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:49.570
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5172
02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:50.980
<v Speaker 6>it's really a phenomenal thing.</v>

5173
02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:51.640
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

5174
02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:54.310
<v Speaker 6>people are having amazing slidings and experiences all over the world.</v>

5175
02:27:54.311 --> 02:27:56.140
<v Speaker 6>There's a global CE five initiative,</v>

5176
02:27:56.610 --> 02:27:57.040
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5177
02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:58.550
<v Speaker 6>going on and um,</v>

5178
02:27:59.300 --> 02:27:59.650
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

5179
02:27:59.650 --> 02:28:00.483
<v Speaker 6>it's really exciting.</v>

5180
02:28:00.700 --> 02:28:01.630
<v Speaker 6>Ce Five,</v>

5181
02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:04.450
<v Speaker 6>which is visual.</v>

5182
02:28:04.570 --> 02:28:05.070
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5183
02:28:05.070 --> 02:28:05.340
<v Speaker 6>what does,</v>

5184
02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:05.630
<v Speaker 6>what does it,</v>

5185
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.771
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

5186
02:28:05.771 --> 02:28:06.381
<v Speaker 6>let me explain to you,</v>

5187
02:28:06.381 --> 02:28:07.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry,</v>

5188
02:28:07.020 --> 02:28:08.440
<v Speaker 6>I don't know the movie,</v>

5189
02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:11.350
<v Speaker 6>the third kind of Steven Spielberg's movie.</v>

5190
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:12.423
<v Speaker 6>That's how I know this.</v>

5191
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:14.320
<v Speaker 6>Most people are probably like me.</v>

5192
02:28:14.321 --> 02:28:17.920
<v Speaker 6>They don't pay in the fourth kind is when someone feels they've had contact and</v>

5193
02:28:17.921 --> 02:28:18.730
<v Speaker 6>been on board.</v>

5194
02:28:18.730 --> 02:28:20.890
<v Speaker 6>The fifth kind is a term that I,</v>

5195
02:28:20.930 --> 02:28:21.763
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5196
02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:22.660
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5197
02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:23.360
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5198
02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:26.210
<v Speaker 6>launched a and the concept of in 1990,</v>

5199
02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:30.500
<v Speaker 6>which is when humans instead of passively having to all those others close</v>

5200
02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:31.251
<v Speaker 6>encounters as the first,</v>

5201
02:28:31.251 --> 02:28:31.521
<v Speaker 6>second,</v>

5202
02:28:31.521 --> 02:28:33.310
<v Speaker 6>third and fourth kind or passive,</v>

5203
02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:36.230
<v Speaker 6>could you saw her either seen it or it's a landing thing or what have you.</v>

5204
02:28:36.470 --> 02:28:40.040
<v Speaker 6>A close encounter of the fifth kind is when a human does something interactive.</v>

5205
02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:41.031
<v Speaker 6>So it's like,</v>

5206
02:28:41.031 --> 02:28:41.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5207
02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:45.110
<v Speaker 6>it's like the Internet versus something passive or where you're,</v>

5208
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:50.230
<v Speaker 6>you're actually making contact and inviting the civilizations to appear and make</v>

5209
02:28:50.751 --> 02:28:52.490
<v Speaker 6>contact for diplomatic purpose,</v>

5210
02:28:52.810 --> 02:28:53.181
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5211
02:28:53.181 --> 02:28:54.950
<v Speaker 6>or where they interact.</v>

5212
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:59.210
<v Speaker 6>And Dr. Haynes at Nasa Ames put together,</v>

5213
02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:00.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5214
02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:01.093
<v Speaker 6>a great book,</v>

5215
02:29:01.150 --> 02:29:01.400
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5216
02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:02.020
<v Speaker 6>based on,</v>

5217
02:29:02.020 --> 02:29:04.910
<v Speaker 6>on my initial research on this called close encounters of the fifth time.</v>

5218
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:06.530
<v Speaker 6>I'm CE five,</v>

5219
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:07.970
<v Speaker 6>where he collected cases.</v>

5220
02:29:08.210 --> 02:29:09.830
<v Speaker 6>We both collected cases,</v>

5221
02:29:09.831 --> 02:29:11.960
<v Speaker 6>but he published this book some years ago,</v>

5222
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.350
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5223
02:29:12.350 --> 02:29:13.183
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

5224
02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:13.820
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5225
02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:17.600
<v Speaker 6>all these people who had done this and some of them were quite incidental.</v>

5226
02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:18.121
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>

5227
02:29:18.121 --> 02:29:22.430
<v Speaker 6>a craft is there and the person sees it and instead of just gaping,</v>

5228
02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:26.630
<v Speaker 6>they actually signaled to it with say a a light and it signals back and comes</v>

5229
02:29:26.631 --> 02:29:27.350
<v Speaker 6>over.</v>

5230
02:29:27.350 --> 02:29:30.410
<v Speaker 6>The more interesting ones are the ones I discovered that which is what happened</v>

5231
02:29:30.411 --> 02:29:35.180
<v Speaker 6>to me when I was 18 where you see a craft and you just think moved to the left</v>

5232
02:29:35.181 --> 02:29:35.931
<v Speaker 6>and moves to the left,</v>

5233
02:29:35.931 --> 02:29:36.621
<v Speaker 6>move to the right,</v>

5234
02:29:36.621 --> 02:29:37.454
<v Speaker 6>move to the right.</v>

5235
02:29:37.730 --> 02:29:42.260
<v Speaker 6>And they're showing you that there's a link up between intent and thought and</v>

5236
02:29:42.261 --> 02:29:43.210
<v Speaker 6>their electronics.</v>

5237
02:29:43.450 --> 02:29:44.960
<v Speaker 6>And that's the really cool stuff.</v>

5238
02:29:45.090 --> 02:29:46.940
<v Speaker 6>You remember how many young Carl Young?</v>

5239
02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:47.720
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

5240
02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:48.051
<v Speaker 6>What did you,</v>

5241
02:29:48.051 --> 02:29:52.250
<v Speaker 6>what do you think on co he wrote a whole book on the physical manifestation of</v>

5242
02:29:52.251 --> 02:29:53.990
<v Speaker 6>Ufos through the conscious thought.</v>

5243
02:29:55.220 --> 02:29:55.491
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5244
02:29:55.491 --> 02:29:59.400
<v Speaker 6>Well I mean the world is as you are and um,</v>

5245
02:29:59.510 --> 02:30:02.810
<v Speaker 6>it depends on the level of consciousness of the person reading what he wrote.</v>

5246
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.943
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5247
02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:05.630
<v Speaker 6>I think that a lot of people say,</v>

5248
02:30:05.631 --> 02:30:06.464
<v Speaker 6>well that means that you're,</v>

5249
02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:08.540
<v Speaker 6>everything is being manifested by your mind.</v>

5250
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:09.320
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5251
02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:10.310
<v Speaker 6>but in a sense,</v>

5252
02:30:10.311 --> 02:30:12.680
<v Speaker 6>all of reality is one conscious thought.</v>

5253
02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:13.521
<v Speaker 6>If you want to look good,</v>

5254
02:30:13.521 --> 02:30:14.510
<v Speaker 6>get back into the hole.</v>

5255
02:30:14.511 --> 02:30:17.000
<v Speaker 6>All this is that concept of the vedic.</v>

5256
02:30:17.330 --> 02:30:18.680
<v Speaker 6>But I think,</v>

5257
02:30:18.681 --> 02:30:19.514
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5258
02:30:20.330 --> 02:30:22.490
<v Speaker 6>these are things when you have 30 or 40 people see it</v>

5259
02:30:24.890 --> 02:30:25.790
<v Speaker 6>and it's interactive,</v>

5260
02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:27.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5261
02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:28.490
<v Speaker 6>it's a close encounter with the fifth kind.</v>

5262
02:30:28.700 --> 02:30:30.830
<v Speaker 6>So it's not your imagination doing that.</v>

5263
02:30:31.090 --> 02:30:31.250
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5264
02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:32.490
<v Speaker 6>particularly didn't get video.</v>

5265
02:30:32.770 --> 02:30:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually think he was necessarily saying it's your imagination.</v>

5266
02:30:35.650 --> 02:30:35.831
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5267
02:30:35.831 --> 02:30:35.921
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5268
02:30:35.921 --> 02:30:36.311
<v Speaker 1>But he was,</v>

5269
02:30:36.311 --> 02:30:36.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5270
02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:39.790
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't understand what he was saying and I think that he was</v>

5271
02:30:39.791 --> 02:30:40.870
<v Speaker 1>taught really talking about some,</v>

5272
02:30:40.871 --> 02:30:42.760
<v Speaker 1>a deeper aspect of what his mind,</v>

5273
02:30:42.940 --> 02:30:43.271
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5274
02:30:43.271 --> 02:30:44.410
<v Speaker 1>What is modern mind,</v>

5275
02:30:44.470 --> 02:30:47.500
<v Speaker 1>what effect does consciousness have on physical matter?</v>

5276
02:30:47.530 --> 02:30:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5277
02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:48.510
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

5278
02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:49.343
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

5279
02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:53.020
<v Speaker 1>And in a sense he could have almost been validating it without totally</v>

5280
02:30:53.021 --> 02:30:56.500
<v Speaker 1>understanding the possibilities of contacting something when we're making</v>

5281
02:30:56.501 --> 02:30:56.930
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

5282
02:30:56.930 --> 02:30:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

5283
02:30:57.580 --> 02:30:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

5284
02:30:57.970 --> 02:30:58.803
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

5285
02:30:59.090 --> 02:31:01.180
<v Speaker 1>you seem to be convinced of,</v>

5286
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.781
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

5287
02:31:01.781 --> 02:31:02.501
<v Speaker 1>teach people to do it.</v>

5288
02:31:02.501 --> 02:31:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you've got something like that,</v>

5289
02:31:04.450 --> 02:31:09.450
<v Speaker 1>how has this not like on 2020 or whatever those stupid new shows are,</v>

5290
02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:14.110
<v Speaker 1>how will you not going well you'd be willing to do that with a film crew.</v>

5291
02:31:14.220 --> 02:31:16.890
<v Speaker 6>Oh we did with CBS with Dan Rather had a show,</v>

5292
02:31:16.891 --> 02:31:18.090
<v Speaker 6>I'm back a years ago.</v>

5293
02:31:18.091 --> 02:31:18.924
<v Speaker 6>What was it called?</v>

5294
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.580
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5295
02:31:19.580 --> 02:31:23.670
<v Speaker 6>we went down to Mexico and it Popo and we did this in a craft came up by the,</v>

5296
02:31:23.730 --> 02:31:27.930
<v Speaker 6>by the volcano flu and they were filming this with professional stuff and they</v>

5297
02:31:27.931 --> 02:31:28.650
<v Speaker 6>ended up uh,</v>

5298
02:31:28.650 --> 02:31:31.520
<v Speaker 6>completely debunking at end even though the camera guy and,</v>

5299
02:31:31.521 --> 02:31:32.570
<v Speaker 6>and the uh,</v>

5300
02:31:32.670 --> 02:31:34.800
<v Speaker 6>reporter who was there with me said,</v>

5301
02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:37.020
<v Speaker 6>anyone who sees this will know this is real.</v>

5302
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:39.060
<v Speaker 6>And CBS sanitized it.</v>

5303
02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:40.230
<v Speaker 6>And when I then said,</v>

5304
02:31:40.231 --> 02:31:40.501
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

5305
02:31:40.501 --> 02:31:42.690
<v Speaker 6>you agreed in writing that any footage you get,</v>

5306
02:31:42.691 --> 02:31:44.670
<v Speaker 6>you would share with us if we did this expedition.</v>

5307
02:31:44.671 --> 02:31:46.230
<v Speaker 6>Cause we did it on our own expense.</v>

5308
02:31:46.590 --> 02:31:46.951
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

5309
02:31:46.951 --> 02:31:47.211
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5310
02:31:47.211 --> 02:31:51.720
<v Speaker 6>the person in charge there said received bs and we're part of a corporation has</v>

5311
02:31:51.721 --> 02:31:52.890
<v Speaker 6>billions and you don't,</v>

5312
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:54.200
<v Speaker 6>you will fight you for,</v>

5313
02:31:54.310 --> 02:31:57.750
<v Speaker 6>you'll never get this footage needs CBS though it seems like you'd be able to</v>

5314
02:31:57.751 --> 02:32:00.420
<v Speaker 6>film something like that yourself and really high quality.</v>

5315
02:32:00.421 --> 02:32:01.560
<v Speaker 6>You don't need their footage.</v>

5316
02:32:01.620 --> 02:32:02.131
<v Speaker 6>What we do,</v>

5317
02:32:02.131 --> 02:32:03.210
<v Speaker 6>I mean we have a certain amount,</v>

5318
02:32:03.211 --> 02:32:04.620
<v Speaker 6>I don't operate cameras,</v>

5319
02:32:04.621 --> 02:32:05.041
<v Speaker 6>but we,</v>

5320
02:32:05.041 --> 02:32:08.730
<v Speaker 6>we've had volunteers but we've never had professional cruise with us.</v>

5321
02:32:08.731 --> 02:32:11.460
<v Speaker 6>And I mean at some point it'd be nice if we could do this and I'm a</v>

5322
02:32:11.461 --> 02:32:12.031
<v Speaker 6>professional,</v>

5323
02:32:12.031 --> 02:32:13.080
<v Speaker 6>I have a crew,</v>

5324
02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:15.840
<v Speaker 6>I have a new show that's coming out on the SCIFI network.</v>

5325
02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:16.231
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

5326
02:32:16.231 --> 02:32:16.801
<v Speaker 6>What's it's called?</v>

5327
02:32:16.801 --> 02:32:18.210
<v Speaker 6>Question everything and good.</v>

5328
02:32:18.211 --> 02:32:19.044
<v Speaker 6>One of the things,</v>

5329
02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:20.120
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5330
02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:23.540
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things we're going to do is we're going to explore things like</v>

5331
02:32:23.541 --> 02:32:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Ufo was big foot.</v>

5332
02:32:25.020 --> 02:32:27.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the Pacific northwest and look for bigfoot,</v>

5333
02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:29.300
<v Speaker 1>but I want to,</v>

5334
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:33.440
<v Speaker 6>let's go to the Atacama desert and see if we can find him.</v>

5335
02:32:34.030 --> 02:32:34.863
<v Speaker 6>Let's go,</v>

5336
02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:35.460
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

5337
02:32:35.460 --> 02:32:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

5338
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I would be more than happy to go and bring a professional crew and see if,</v>

5339
02:32:39.881 --> 02:32:40.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5340
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:41.170
<v Speaker 1>something like this can happen.</v>

5341
02:32:41.320 --> 02:32:43.330
<v Speaker 1>What kind of success rate do you have in doing this?</v>

5342
02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:45.793
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5343
02:32:45.970 --> 02:32:46.360
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5344
02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:46.601
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5345
02:32:46.601 --> 02:32:49.900
<v Speaker 6>we've never actually gone out where there hasn't been some kind of a siding or</v>

5346
02:32:49.901 --> 02:32:51.790
<v Speaker 6>event happened that had been seen by everyone.</v>

5347
02:32:51.970 --> 02:32:52.803
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

5348
02:32:52.870 --> 02:32:53.290
<v Speaker 6>Never.</v>

5349
02:32:53.290 --> 02:32:54.370
<v Speaker 6>So it's 100%,</v>

5350
02:32:54.730 --> 02:32:56.440
<v Speaker 6>not every night and not all the time,</v>

5351
02:32:56.441 --> 02:32:56.850
<v Speaker 6>but yes.</v>

5352
02:32:56.850 --> 02:32:58.780
<v Speaker 6>Something of five or six day period.</v>

5353
02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:00.310
<v Speaker 6>And are these people camping out there?</v>

5354
02:33:00.370 --> 02:33:00.551
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5355
02:33:00.551 --> 02:33:00.880
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5356
02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:01.130
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

5357
02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:01.901
<v Speaker 6>We don't stay.</v>

5358
02:33:01.901 --> 02:33:02.171
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5359
02:33:02.171 --> 02:33:02.500
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5360
02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:03.490
<v Speaker 6>I guess if someone wanted to,</v>

5361
02:33:03.491 --> 02:33:07.060
<v Speaker 6>we usually stay in condos or houses or something in the area we usually go to</v>

5362
02:33:07.061 --> 02:33:08.090
<v Speaker 6>fairly knows,</v>

5363
02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:09.810
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5364
02:33:09.810 --> 02:33:10.270
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>

5365
02:33:10.270 --> 02:33:12.880
<v Speaker 6>remote areas that are a quiet,</v>

5366
02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:16.390
<v Speaker 6>it's very hard to find locations where we're not going to be intruded upon.</v>

5367
02:33:16.391 --> 02:33:17.830
<v Speaker 6>And usually when we do this,</v>

5368
02:33:18.190 --> 02:33:18.610
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5369
02:33:18.610 --> 02:33:19.830
<v Speaker 6>we do have people who intrude.</v>

5370
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.570
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5371
02:33:20.570 --> 02:33:20.880
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5372
02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:22.300
<v Speaker 6>and so we try to keep it,</v>

5373
02:33:22.330 --> 02:33:22.571
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5374
02:33:22.571 --> 02:33:25.700
<v Speaker 6>so that the group can be coherent because the whole concept of,</v>

5375
02:33:25.701 --> 02:33:28.060
<v Speaker 6>of this is coherent thought and coherent mind.</v>

5376
02:33:28.090 --> 02:33:28.880
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5377
02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:29.670
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5378
02:33:29.670 --> 02:33:30.230
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

5379
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.461
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5380
02:33:30.461 --> 02:33:33.370
<v Speaker 6>very difficult to do when you're being disrupted by a lot of folks.</v>

5381
02:33:33.430 --> 02:33:36.040
<v Speaker 6>Know what if you pick 20 people to go and,</v>

5382
02:33:36.041 --> 02:33:36.301
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5383
02:33:36.301 --> 02:33:36.740
<v Speaker 6>and how,</v>

5384
02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:38.340
<v Speaker 6>how do you know that someone's not alone?</v>

5385
02:33:38.350 --> 02:33:40.000
<v Speaker 6>He takes some crackpot.</v>

5386
02:33:40.030 --> 02:33:40.241
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5387
02:33:40.241 --> 02:33:40.511
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5388
02:33:40.511 --> 02:33:41.910
<v Speaker 6>there had been no,</v>

5389
02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:42.790
<v Speaker 6>usually the people,</v>

5390
02:33:42.791 --> 02:33:42.941
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5391
02:33:42.941 --> 02:33:44.500
<v Speaker 6>we have an application process and,</v>

5392
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:45.000
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

5393
02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:45.221
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

5394
02:33:45.221 --> 02:33:46.054
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5395
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:49.300
<v Speaker 6>I'd say 99% of the time they're just wonderful people.</v>

5396
02:33:49.630 --> 02:33:50.980
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

5397
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:54.400
<v Speaker 6>they're very sincerely interested in learning about this.</v>

5398
02:33:54.430 --> 02:33:59.430
<v Speaker 6>And I think the science of consciousness component of the whole what JL and</v>

5399
02:34:00.181 --> 02:34:03.130
<v Speaker 6>Harnett called the High Strangeness Part of Ufo Encounters,</v>

5400
02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:04.413
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5401
02:34:04.450 --> 02:34:08.800
<v Speaker 6>is becomes very compelling for people who have had contact and understand that</v>

5402
02:34:08.801 --> 02:34:11.590
<v Speaker 6>when you go beyond the speed of light between star systems,</v>

5403
02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:12.790
<v Speaker 6>you're dealing with,</v>

5404
02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:13.570
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5405
02:34:13.570 --> 02:34:15.280
<v Speaker 6>something that's way beyond,</v>

5406
02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:16.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5407
02:34:16.330 --> 02:34:16.810
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

5408
02:34:16.810 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 6>your phone and,</v>

5409
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:19.300
<v Speaker 6>and a Ford explorer.</v>

5410
02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:20.021
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5411
02:34:20.021 --> 02:34:21.400
<v Speaker 6>and people who get that,</v>

5412
02:34:21.430 --> 02:34:25.240
<v Speaker 6>who get out of the linear box and begin to look at that and then begin to</v>

5413
02:34:25.241 --> 02:34:27.190
<v Speaker 6>experiment with a lot of the people who come on.</v>

5414
02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:30.070
<v Speaker 6>These are people who have gotten the APP or learned about it.</v>

5415
02:34:30.250 --> 02:34:31.150
<v Speaker 6>And they try it at,</v>

5416
02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:35.710
<v Speaker 6>try this at home and they have an amazing citing an encounter with a small group</v>

5417
02:34:35.711 --> 02:34:39.010
<v Speaker 6>of people or a family and then they want to come and try and do it more.</v>

5418
02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:39.850
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

5419
02:34:39.850 --> 02:34:40.683
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5420
02:34:40.740 --> 02:34:40.990
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5421
02:34:40.990 --> 02:34:41.191
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

5422
02:34:41.191 --> 02:34:41.471
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

5423
02:34:41.471 --> 02:34:42.304
<v Speaker 6>it's uh,</v>

5424
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:44.310
<v Speaker 6>an excite to me that's the,</v>

5425
02:34:44.311 --> 02:34:44.650
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5426
02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:46.360
<v Speaker 6>the next phase of all this is,</v>

5427
02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:46.721
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5428
02:34:46.721 --> 02:34:47.321
<v Speaker 6>disclosure,</v>

5429
02:34:47.321 --> 02:34:49.210
<v Speaker 6>bring out the energy and technologies,</v>

5430
02:34:49.420 --> 02:34:51.490
<v Speaker 6>but then it's about the public understanding that,</v>

5431
02:34:51.970 --> 02:34:52.451
<v Speaker 6>what does it,</v>

5432
02:34:52.451 --> 02:34:55.960
<v Speaker 6>everyone just go out under the stars instead of sitting and looking at</v>

5433
02:34:55.961 --> 02:34:58.450
<v Speaker 6>television and try some experiments,</v>

5434
02:34:58.480 --> 02:34:59.410
<v Speaker 6>experiment with,</v>

5435
02:34:59.411 --> 02:35:01.050
<v Speaker 6>with thought in mind,</v>

5436
02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:05.200
<v Speaker 6>light and tone and all kinds of interesting things and space.</v>

5437
02:35:05.500 --> 02:35:08.280
<v Speaker 6>Haven't you encountered things that are uh,</v>

5438
02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:11.350
<v Speaker 6>in closer proximity to the ground?</v>

5439
02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:12.370
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

5440
02:35:12.370 --> 02:35:17.370
<v Speaker 6>And have some very odd photographs of what you might call a trans dimensional</v>

5441
02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:19.510
<v Speaker 6>images that looked like a,</v>

5442
02:35:19.570 --> 02:35:23.680
<v Speaker 6>almost like a Hologram of a bean that floated right outside of our circle at</v>

5443
02:35:23.681 --> 02:35:25.120
<v Speaker 6>Joshua tree national park.</v>

5444
02:35:25.210 --> 02:35:26.350
<v Speaker 6>Not too far from here.</v>

5445
02:35:26.770 --> 02:35:28.850
<v Speaker 6>A back a few years ago about Theresa,</v>

5446
02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:29.680
<v Speaker 6>this thing.</v>

5447
02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:30.340
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

5448
02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:30.730
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

5449
02:35:30.730 --> 02:35:32.590
<v Speaker 6>Where can someone see that as one of the websites series,</v>

5450
02:35:32.591 --> 02:35:33.580
<v Speaker 6>disclosure.com.</v>

5451
02:35:33.581 --> 02:35:36.250
<v Speaker 6>If you link to the CE five part of it,</v>

5452
02:35:36.251 --> 02:35:39.490
<v Speaker 6>there's a whole section of this strange luminous thing.</v>

5453
02:35:39.850 --> 02:35:40.360
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5454
02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:41.770
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

5455
02:35:41.771 --> 02:35:42.040
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

5456
02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:43.120
<v Speaker 6>the photograph of that.</v>

5457
02:35:43.121 --> 02:35:44.950
<v Speaker 6>It was a three or four second exposure.</v>

5458
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:47.200
<v Speaker 6>And what was seen right before this happened,</v>

5459
02:35:47.201 --> 02:35:50.260
<v Speaker 6>which is really important for people to understand what something about half the</v>

5460
02:35:50.261 --> 02:35:50.801
<v Speaker 6>size of the,</v>

5461
02:35:50.801 --> 02:35:52.990
<v Speaker 6>about the size of my fist or a little bigger.</v>

5462
02:35:53.290 --> 02:35:55.750
<v Speaker 6>It was like a sphere that floated over the desert.</v>

5463
02:35:56.710 --> 02:35:57.543
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5464
02:35:57.700 --> 02:35:58.331
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

5465
02:35:58.331 --> 02:36:01.540
<v Speaker 6>November of Oh nine and several people saw it.</v>

5466
02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:06.010
<v Speaker 6>And then we heard what sounded like a group of people talking,</v>

5467
02:36:06.460 --> 02:36:07.091
<v Speaker 6>but with our nights,</v>

5468
02:36:07.091 --> 02:36:07.990
<v Speaker 6>cause there's nothing there.</v>

5469
02:36:08.650 --> 02:36:09.280
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

5470
02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:14.280
<v Speaker 6>so a woman on my team took her camera and it just had a three or four second</v>

5471
02:36:14.621 --> 02:36:15.340
<v Speaker 6>exposure,</v>

5472
02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:16.270
<v Speaker 6>took a photograph.</v>

5473
02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:18.850
<v Speaker 6>And in that area where this had happened,</v>

5474
02:36:19.450 --> 02:36:21.700
<v Speaker 6>there was this beam that was,</v>

5475
02:36:21.701 --> 02:36:22.534
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5476
02:36:23.310 --> 02:36:25.360
<v Speaker 6>and did you see this with your eyes or is it,</v>

5477
02:36:25.361 --> 02:36:25.721
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5478
02:36:25.721 --> 02:36:27.790
<v Speaker 6>cause this would have been in a flash,</v>

5479
02:36:27.791 --> 02:36:28.900
<v Speaker 6>but it's in the digital.</v>

5480
02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:30.610
<v Speaker 6>Is it possible that it's just an artifact?</v>

5481
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:31.150
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5482
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:31.990
<v Speaker 6>it's not an artifact.</v>

5483
02:36:31.991 --> 02:36:32.650
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely not.</v>

5484
02:36:32.650 --> 02:36:33.640
<v Speaker 6>Why is that not possible?</v>

5485
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:35.830
<v Speaker 6>Flashes always produce artifacts.</v>

5486
02:36:35.831 --> 02:36:36.664
<v Speaker 6>It produced,</v>

5487
02:36:36.700 --> 02:36:36.940
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5488
02:36:36.940 --> 02:36:37.151
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5489
02:36:37.151 --> 02:36:38.830
<v Speaker 6>she did not use a flash.</v>

5490
02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:39.150
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5491
02:36:39.150 --> 02:36:40.180
<v Speaker 6>it was visible.</v>

5492
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:41.530
<v Speaker 6>The flash was so,</v>

5493
02:36:41.531 --> 02:36:42.130
<v Speaker 6>in other words,</v>

5494
02:36:42.130 --> 02:36:43.930
<v Speaker 6>this was no flash bulb.</v>

5495
02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:44.500
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5496
02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:46.690
<v Speaker 6>we don't allow flash photography when we're out.</v>

5497
02:36:46.890 --> 02:36:47.711
<v Speaker 6>You've got to have good nights.</v>

5498
02:36:47.711 --> 02:36:48.011
<v Speaker 6>Goats,</v>

5499
02:36:48.011 --> 02:36:48.910
<v Speaker 6>you have to have good cameras.</v>

5500
02:36:48.911 --> 02:36:50.710
<v Speaker 6>You can adjust the ISO and the,</v>

5501
02:36:50.711 --> 02:36:51.910
<v Speaker 6>and the aperture and all that.</v>

5502
02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:52.900
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5503
02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:53.620
<v Speaker 6>campfires.</v>

5504
02:36:53.620 --> 02:36:54.100
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

5505
02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:54.311
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5506
02:36:54.311 --> 02:36:55.240
<v Speaker 6>we never have camp fires.</v>

5507
02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:56.920
<v Speaker 6>There's a complete darkness.</v>

5508
02:36:57.340 --> 02:36:58.173
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5509
02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:01.690
<v Speaker 6>the most you're going to see when we're out there has made me an led on a</v>

5510
02:37:01.691 --> 02:37:02.524
<v Speaker 6>camera.</v>

5511
02:37:03.310 --> 02:37:05.050
<v Speaker 6>So whatever this thing was,</v>

5512
02:37:05.210 --> 02:37:06.043
<v Speaker 6>we know what it was.</v>

5513
02:37:06.370 --> 02:37:08.950
<v Speaker 6>You think it was very confident about what it was.</v>

5514
02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:12.430
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever been a board,</v>

5515
02:37:12.460 --> 02:37:14.560
<v Speaker 6>a spatial and a well,</v>

5516
02:37:14.561 --> 02:37:15.394
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5517
02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:16.453
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5518
02:37:17.090 --> 02:37:22.090
<v Speaker 6>I've had some really amazing contact experiences that are classic and they,</v>

5519
02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:23.211
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5520
02:37:23.211 --> 02:37:23.480
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5521
02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:24.500
<v Speaker 6>I had one when I was,</v>

5522
02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:25.363
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5523
02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:25.940
<v Speaker 6>having,</v>

5524
02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:26.360
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5525
02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:30.720
<v Speaker 6>this eight when I was 18 years old up on this mountain up in,</v>

5526
02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:31.603
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5527
02:37:31.850 --> 02:37:32.270
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5528
02:37:32.270 --> 02:37:32.471
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5529
02:37:32.471 --> 02:37:33.980
<v Speaker 6>and it,</v>

5530
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.823
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

5531
02:37:35.810 --> 02:37:39.290
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't at all what you hear about in the literature because it was more in</v>

5532
02:37:39.291 --> 02:37:40.970
<v Speaker 6>this trans dimensional element,</v>

5533
02:37:41.210 --> 02:37:41.810
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5534
02:37:41.810 --> 02:37:42.643
<v Speaker 6>area.</v>

5535
02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:47.600
<v Speaker 6>And that becomes the whole question is what part of what people are reporting is</v>

5536
02:37:47.601 --> 02:37:49.670
<v Speaker 6>real and what part is memorex.</v>

5537
02:37:49.850 --> 02:37:51.530
<v Speaker 6>And this is something we haven't talked about yet,</v>

5538
02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:56.600
<v Speaker 6>but what is the capacity for the intelligence community to hoax contact?</v>

5539
02:37:57.320 --> 02:37:58.370
<v Speaker 6>And it's substantial.</v>

5540
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.750
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

5541
02:37:59.750 --> 02:38:00.583
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5542
02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:02.060
<v Speaker 1>You think a lot of people they,</v>

5543
02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:03.460
<v Speaker 1>they're hoaxing contact</v>

5544
02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:04.270
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

5545
02:38:04.270 --> 02:38:06.040
<v Speaker 6>For scaring the hell out of people.</v>

5546
02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:06.871
<v Speaker 1>Like in what way?</v>

5547
02:38:06.871 --> 02:38:07.704
<v Speaker 1>How do they do that?</v>

5548
02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:08.933
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5549
02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:12.760
<v Speaker 6>one of the things we learned about a number of years ago is actually not</v>

5550
02:38:12.761 --> 02:38:13.690
<v Speaker 6>something I discovered.</v>

5551
02:38:13.691 --> 02:38:17.250
<v Speaker 6>It was a man here who was looking into um,</v>

5552
02:38:17.770 --> 02:38:22.140
<v Speaker 6>what are called military related abductions that are made to look at ut but</v>

5553
02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:22.960
<v Speaker 6>aren't.</v>

5554
02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:27.760
<v Speaker 6>And you get into this whole question of what are they able to stage craft two</v>

5555
02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:28.301
<v Speaker 6>for four,</v>

5556
02:38:28.301 --> 02:38:29.950
<v Speaker 6>it's psychological warfare value.</v>

5557
02:38:30.310 --> 02:38:33.520
<v Speaker 6>And I have a document that's actually gonna be in the film and it's from the</v>

5558
02:38:33.521 --> 02:38:38.080
<v Speaker 6>strategic studies institute talking about the staging of abductions and other</v>

5559
02:38:38.081 --> 02:38:41.200
<v Speaker 6>scary things to create fear around the UFO issue.</v>

5560
02:38:41.210 --> 02:38:44.450
<v Speaker 1>So they create an artificial spacecraft and abducting.</v>

5561
02:38:44.451 --> 02:38:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5562
02:38:44.690 --> 02:38:45.523
<v Speaker 6>Well they might use,</v>

5563
02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:47.030
<v Speaker 6>they may use what's called an arb,</v>

5564
02:38:47.031 --> 02:38:49.240
<v Speaker 6>an alien reproduction vehicle that's manmade.</v>

5565
02:38:49.250 --> 02:38:52.400
<v Speaker 6>They may use robotic things that are called pls,</v>

5566
02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:56.030
<v Speaker 6>program life forms that are manmade but look very easy</v>

5567
02:38:56.470 --> 02:38:57.410
<v Speaker 1>lifeforms,</v>

5568
02:38:57.440 --> 02:38:57.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5569
02:38:57.640 --> 02:38:58.270
<v Speaker 1>pls,</v>

5570
02:38:58.270 --> 02:38:58.870
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

5571
02:38:58.870 --> 02:39:00.850
<v Speaker 1>they have lifeforms that,</v>

5572
02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that are like robots essentially that move around like people.</v>

5573
02:39:05.530 --> 02:39:06.000
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5574
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:09.810
<v Speaker 6>there are reports of that and in fact a ports of that.</v>

5575
02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:10.860
<v Speaker 6>And I think there is,</v>

5576
02:39:10.861 --> 02:39:11.790
<v Speaker 6>if you leave it though,</v>

5577
02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:12.421
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah.</v>

5578
02:39:12.421 --> 02:39:13.710
<v Speaker 6>I think Stan Rome and neck,</v>

5579
02:39:13.711 --> 02:39:16.200
<v Speaker 6>if you look at the photograph he had of,</v>

5580
02:39:16.210 --> 02:39:16.680
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5581
02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:17.300
<v Speaker 6>this thing,</v>

5582
02:39:17.300 --> 02:39:17.580
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5583
02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:20.370
<v Speaker 6>I think he was on Larry King or in some other shows in this thing,</v>

5584
02:39:20.371 --> 02:39:21.860
<v Speaker 6>bu that goes up and down.</v>

5585
02:39:21.861 --> 02:39:24.170
<v Speaker 6>He's got a photo and then there's a video that,</v>

5586
02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:24.350
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5587
02:39:24.350 --> 02:39:25.200
<v Speaker 6>he hasn't released,</v>

5588
02:39:25.201 --> 02:39:27.420
<v Speaker 6>but I've seen it in other people in the team have seen it.</v>

5589
02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:29.520
<v Speaker 6>And it's this very robotic looking.</v>

5590
02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:31.200
<v Speaker 6>It looks like a quote alien,</v>

5591
02:39:31.470 --> 02:39:32.460
<v Speaker 6>but we know it isn't.</v>

5592
02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:33.290
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5593
02:39:33.290 --> 02:39:33.691
<v Speaker 6>so I,</v>

5594
02:39:33.691 --> 02:39:33.961
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5595
02:39:33.961 --> 02:39:35.940
<v Speaker 6>the question is why would they want to do something like that?</v>

5596
02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:39.150
<v Speaker 6>I think if you can put enough information out there to scale,</v>

5597
02:39:39.180 --> 02:39:40.020
<v Speaker 6>scare people,</v>

5598
02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:41.320
<v Speaker 6>why not</v>

5599
02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:41.771
<v Speaker 1>scare all,</v>

5600
02:39:41.771 --> 02:39:46.570
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me though that look at the highest level robotics experts in the</v>

5601
02:39:46.571 --> 02:39:50.430
<v Speaker 1>world today are pretty open about their work because they're there.</v>

5602
02:39:50.450 --> 02:39:51.640
<v Speaker 1>But these are showing,</v>

5603
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:52.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

5604
02:39:52.091 --> 02:39:52.331
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

5605
02:39:52.331 --> 02:39:52.571
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

5606
02:39:52.571 --> 02:39:54.120
<v Speaker 1>they're showing periodic improvements.</v>

5607
02:39:54.140 --> 02:39:56.620
<v Speaker 1>The general public like that Darpa robots,</v>

5608
02:39:56.770 --> 02:39:58.150
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing in Japan.</v>

5609
02:39:58.420 --> 02:39:58.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5610
02:39:58.690 --> 02:40:02.350
<v Speaker 1>no one has come anywhere close to doing something along those lines.</v>

5611
02:40:02.530 --> 02:40:03.221
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

5612
02:40:03.221 --> 02:40:05.710
<v Speaker 1>they all have an external power source.</v>

5613
02:40:05.890 --> 02:40:06.041
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5614
02:40:06.041 --> 02:40:09.520
<v Speaker 6>But you're assuming that the things that you know about her or all that,</v>

5615
02:40:09.540 --> 02:40:11.350
<v Speaker 6>they're an existence,</v>

5616
02:40:11.380 --> 02:40:12.610
<v Speaker 6>but it's like saying that,</v>

5617
02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:13.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5618
02:40:13.890 --> 02:40:18.750
<v Speaker 6>because you haven't flown on a one to lock heats or Northrop's antigravity</v>

5619
02:40:18.751 --> 02:40:19.201
<v Speaker 6>devices.</v>

5620
02:40:19.201 --> 02:40:20.100
<v Speaker 6>They don't have those either.</v>

5621
02:40:20.430 --> 02:40:22.260
<v Speaker 6>I think that yes,</v>

5622
02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:22.711
<v Speaker 6>they do.</v>

5623
02:40:22.711 --> 02:40:23.060
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

5624
02:40:23.060 --> 02:40:23.970
<v Speaker 6>100% yes.</v>

5625
02:40:24.460 --> 02:40:25.860
<v Speaker 6>How has it been rich all but said,</v>

5626
02:40:25.861 --> 02:40:26.611
<v Speaker 6>so you know,</v>

5627
02:40:26.611 --> 02:40:28.050
<v Speaker 6>who's the head of Lockheed Skunk works?</v>

5628
02:40:28.410 --> 02:40:28.980
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5629
02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:33.650
<v Speaker 6>so these are a lot of the things that people will see out near the Nellis</v>

5630
02:40:33.650 --> 02:40:33.660
<v Speaker 6>Ranger,</v>

5631
02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:35.430
<v Speaker 6>so called area 51 that are,</v>

5632
02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:36.900
<v Speaker 6>are moving in decent ways.</v>

5633
02:40:36.901 --> 02:40:37.830
<v Speaker 6>We were talking about earlier,</v>

5634
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:39.000
<v Speaker 6>those are manmade.</v>

5635
02:40:39.001 --> 02:40:39.834
<v Speaker 6>There's aren't AET.</v>

5636
02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:42.300
<v Speaker 6>And if you go all way back to,</v>

5637
02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:43.110
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5638
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:44.010
<v Speaker 6>the forties in,</v>

5639
02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:44.970
<v Speaker 6>in Germany,</v>

5640
02:40:44.971 --> 02:40:49.320
<v Speaker 6>during World War II and after they were doing a lot of experiments with things</v>

5641
02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:53.100
<v Speaker 6>that do electromagnetic lifter effect.</v>

5642
02:40:53.430 --> 02:40:55.320
<v Speaker 6>And going back a little further,</v>

5643
02:40:55.530 --> 02:40:57.630
<v Speaker 6>you look at t Townsend Brown in 19,</v>

5644
02:40:57.780 --> 02:40:58.950
<v Speaker 6>late 1920s,</v>

5645
02:40:59.340 --> 02:40:59.581
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5646
02:40:59.581 --> 02:41:03.000
<v Speaker 6>and then also the Closky frost experiment where they actually were able to</v>

5647
02:41:03.001 --> 02:41:05.520
<v Speaker 6>create this effect of Levitation and movement.</v>

5648
02:41:05.790 --> 02:41:06.210
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

5649
02:41:06.210 --> 02:41:06.421
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5650
02:41:06.421 --> 02:41:06.751
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

5651
02:41:06.751 --> 02:41:08.040
<v Speaker 6>there's a whole science here.</v>

5652
02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:11.940
<v Speaker 6>And in the open aerospace literature in the late forties,</v>

5653
02:41:11.941 --> 02:41:12.774
<v Speaker 6>early fifties,</v>

5654
02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:16.560
<v Speaker 6>they were saying the next big thing is gravity control an antigravity stuff and</v>

5655
02:41:16.561 --> 02:41:16.770
<v Speaker 6>Dah,</v>

5656
02:41:16.770 --> 02:41:16.980
<v Speaker 6>Dah,</v>

5657
02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:17.310
<v Speaker 6>Dah.</v>

5658
02:41:17.310 --> 02:41:18.570
<v Speaker 6>And then it went all white and black.</v>

5659
02:41:18.870 --> 02:41:19.800
<v Speaker 6>You can't find it.</v>

5660
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.510
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

5661
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.730
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5662
02:41:20.730 --> 02:41:23.400
<v Speaker 6>one of the guys that I've worked with at the naval research labs,</v>

5663
02:41:24.390 --> 02:41:26.190
<v Speaker 6>which is the largest department defense lab,</v>

5664
02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:27.090
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5665
02:41:27.090 --> 02:41:32.090
<v Speaker 6>told me that it was October 54 when we really mastered gravity control and all</v>

5666
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:33.510
<v Speaker 6>those projects went black.</v>

5667
02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:34.740
<v Speaker 6>They just disappeared.</v>

5668
02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:36.960
<v Speaker 6>But up until then you can go back and fine.</v>

5669
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:37.840
<v Speaker 6>And there were,</v>

5670
02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:38.340
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5671
02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:39.270
<v Speaker 6>in the literature,</v>

5672
02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5673
02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:43.790
<v Speaker 6>now the fact that your average person at MIT to know about this doesn't mean it</v>

5674
02:41:43.791 --> 02:41:44.624
<v Speaker 6>didn't exist.</v>

5675
02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:49.410
<v Speaker 6>And I think that there's a whole history of aerospace and technology that's</v>

5676
02:41:49.411 --> 02:41:49.890
<v Speaker 6>hidden.</v>

5677
02:41:49.890 --> 02:41:50.551
<v Speaker 6>Similarly,</v>

5678
02:41:50.551 --> 02:41:54.150
<v Speaker 6>there's a whole history of robotics,</v>

5679
02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:55.073
<v Speaker 6>genetics,</v>

5680
02:41:55.350 --> 02:41:57.420
<v Speaker 6>biological studies and what have you.</v>

5681
02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:00.990
<v Speaker 6>And that that has also been very classified.</v>

5682
02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:06.520
<v Speaker 1>You are either one really nutty dude or you are a guy who has tapped into one of</v>

5683
02:42:08.811 --> 02:42:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the craziest pieces of information that's being suppressed from the American</v>

5684
02:42:13.191 --> 02:42:13.521
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

5685
02:42:13.521 --> 02:42:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And there's no room for a middle ground.</v>

5686
02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:16.293
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5687
02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:17.520
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

5688
02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:18.360
<v Speaker 6>I know that all,</v>

5689
02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:20.100
<v Speaker 6>every word I'm telling you is true.</v>

5690
02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

5691
02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:24.290
<v Speaker 1>man Wu believe that every word out of your mouth is true.</v>

5692
02:42:24.291 --> 02:42:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I do believe you.</v>

5693
02:42:26.060 --> 02:42:29.360
<v Speaker 1>But this whole thing is so it's so strains,</v>

5694
02:42:29.361 --> 02:42:30.100
<v Speaker 1>credibility,</v>

5695
02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:30.781
<v Speaker 6>all it does,</v>

5696
02:42:30.781 --> 02:42:31.400
<v Speaker 6>all of it does.</v>

5697
02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:35.370
<v Speaker 6>And you know what I was told years ago that if you really told the whole truth</v>

5698
02:42:35.371 --> 02:42:36.204
<v Speaker 6>about this,</v>

5699
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:38.610
<v Speaker 6>that'll hide itself cause no one can believe it.</v>

5700
02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:40.620
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

5701
02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:44.400
<v Speaker 6>it is kind of through the looking glass and down the rabbit hole on this</v>

5702
02:42:44.401 --> 02:42:44.851
<v Speaker 6>subject.</v>

5703
02:42:44.851 --> 02:42:49.851
<v Speaker 6>And it's a real problem because how far do you go in terms of telling what you</v>

5704
02:42:50.761 --> 02:42:52.050
<v Speaker 6>know and have discovered?</v>

5705
02:42:52.250 --> 02:42:52.440
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5706
02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:53.273
<v Speaker 6>it seems to me</v>

5707
02:42:53.350 --> 02:42:55.920
<v Speaker 1>and Hampton to like a way to show people.</v>

5708
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5709
02:42:57.440 --> 02:42:58.430
<v Speaker 6>well I mean if,</v>

5710
02:42:58.460 --> 02:42:59.570
<v Speaker 6>but who's looking at me?</v>

5711
02:42:59.571 --> 02:43:00.850
<v Speaker 6>It's like the CFA guy,</v>

5712
02:43:00.980 --> 02:43:02.030
<v Speaker 6>John Callahan who said,</v>

5713
02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:03.380
<v Speaker 6>I've got the radar tapes,</v>

5714
02:43:03.381 --> 02:43:04.430
<v Speaker 6>I got the pilot reports,</v>

5715
02:43:04.610 --> 02:43:06.140
<v Speaker 6>but who's looking and who's asking?</v>

5716
02:43:06.330 --> 02:43:06.680
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5717
02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:07.700
<v Speaker 6>Well not 20,</v>

5718
02:43:07.701 --> 02:43:08.360
<v Speaker 6>20.</v>

5719
02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:08.811
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

5720
02:43:08.811 --> 02:43:09.860
<v Speaker 6>You asked about 2020.</v>

5721
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.610
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5722
02:43:10.610 --> 02:43:13.300
<v Speaker 6>the guy was executive producer of that came out to my house.</v>

5723
02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:17.680
<v Speaker 6>I gave him 35 hours at digital stuff of all these top secret guys,</v>

5724
02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:18.880
<v Speaker 6>all the documents,</v>

5725
02:43:18.881 --> 02:43:19.714
<v Speaker 6>all this stuff.</v>

5726
02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:20.111
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

5727
02:43:20.111 --> 02:43:21.490
<v Speaker 6>this is the biggest story.</v>

5728
02:43:21.491 --> 02:43:24.520
<v Speaker 6>It's either all a hoax or it's the biggest story in history.</v>

5729
02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:24.851
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

5730
02:43:24.851 --> 02:43:25.001
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5731
02:43:25.001 --> 02:43:26.440
<v Speaker 6>well I think it's the latter.</v>

5732
02:43:26.980 --> 02:43:27.521
<v Speaker 6>And he says,</v>

5733
02:43:27.521 --> 02:43:28.690
<v Speaker 6>I want to do this story.</v>

5734
02:43:28.700 --> 02:43:29.051
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

5735
02:43:29.051 --> 02:43:30.100
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they'll let you.</v>

5736
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:33.730
<v Speaker 6>And so we went back to corporate ABC and</v>

5737
02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:37.180
<v Speaker 6>a couple of weeks later he's a Dr. Greer.</v>

5738
02:43:37.181 --> 02:43:38.980
<v Speaker 6>They won't let me do this story.</v>

5739
02:43:39.430 --> 02:43:39.731
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

5740
02:43:39.731 --> 02:43:40.564
<v Speaker 6>who are they,</v>

5741
02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:41.620
<v Speaker 6>IRA?</v>

5742
02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:42.190
<v Speaker 6>And he said,</v>

5743
02:43:42.190 --> 02:43:42.341
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5744
02:43:42.341 --> 02:43:43.270
<v Speaker 6>you know who they are.</v>

5745
02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:45.760
<v Speaker 6>And I've had producers.</v>

5746
02:43:45.761 --> 02:43:45.941
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

5747
02:43:45.941 --> 02:43:47.000
<v Speaker 6>that's crazy motherfucker.</v>

5748
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:48.023
<v Speaker 6>What else?</v>

5749
02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:50.530
<v Speaker 6>This was the executive producer in charge of the show.</v>

5750
02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:54.920
<v Speaker 6>Both the primetime live in 2020 and um,</v>

5751
02:43:55.270 --> 02:43:56.830
<v Speaker 6>he's now with the 60 minutes.</v>

5752
02:43:56.831 --> 02:43:59.260
<v Speaker 6>But I think that what we'll love to talk to him.</v>

5753
02:43:59.470 --> 02:44:00.303
<v Speaker 6>What's his name?</v>

5754
02:44:00.310 --> 02:44:00.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5755
02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:01.563
<v Speaker 6>Ira Rosen.</v>

5756
02:44:01.570 --> 02:44:03.940
<v Speaker 6>I love to talk to him on the question.</v>

5757
02:44:03.941 --> 02:44:04.774
<v Speaker 6>Everything show.</v>

5758
02:44:04.900 --> 02:44:05.860
<v Speaker 6>That'd be fascinating.</v>

5759
02:44:06.250 --> 02:44:06.670
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5760
02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:06.911
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5761
02:44:06.911 --> 02:44:07.501
<v Speaker 6>I think that the,</v>

5762
02:44:07.501 --> 02:44:07.711
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5763
02:44:07.711 --> 02:44:12.130
<v Speaker 6>this is the other big myth is that when you start dealing with the big media</v>

5764
02:44:12.460 --> 02:44:13.570
<v Speaker 6>that it's a free media.</v>

5765
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:14.920
<v Speaker 6>It's free to a point.</v>

5766
02:44:14.921 --> 02:44:15.161
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5767
02:44:15.161 --> 02:44:18.370
<v Speaker 6>it's no problem if you want to drill down on someone's sex scandal.</v>

5768
02:44:18.610 --> 02:44:20.350
<v Speaker 6>But if you really want to deal with this issue,</v>

5769
02:44:20.351 --> 02:44:22.070
<v Speaker 6>there's going to be a phone call and you,</v>

5770
02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:23.020
<v Speaker 6>one of the documents,</v>

5771
02:44:23.021 --> 02:44:24.580
<v Speaker 6>it's a up on our website,</v>

5772
02:44:25.090 --> 02:44:28.210
<v Speaker 6>I wrote an article called a media play.</v>

5773
02:44:28.450 --> 02:44:33.450
<v Speaker 6>And in it is a document I got from the 1990s from the CIA that talks about how</v>

5774
02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:39.160
<v Speaker 6>the CIA had embedded in all the major media people to change,</v>

5775
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:40.220
<v Speaker 6>alter or,</v>

5776
02:44:40.310 --> 02:44:41.680
<v Speaker 6>or stop stories.</v>

5777
02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:44.020
<v Speaker 6>And this is an official document.</v>

5778
02:44:44.380 --> 02:44:44.861
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

5779
02:44:44.861 --> 02:44:47.950
<v Speaker 6>if the public listening out there think we really have a free market and free</v>

5780
02:44:47.951 --> 02:44:48.740
<v Speaker 6>media,</v>

5781
02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:48.981
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5782
02:44:48.981 --> 02:44:49.391
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5783
02:44:49.391 --> 02:44:51.490
<v Speaker 6>wake up and this is simply not the case.</v>

5784
02:44:51.491 --> 02:44:53.290
<v Speaker 6>So I think that one of the,</v>

5785
02:44:53.291 --> 02:44:57.760
<v Speaker 6>one of the challenges we've had is that the,</v>

5786
02:44:58.000 --> 02:44:58.241
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5787
02:44:58.241 --> 02:44:58.540
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5788
02:44:58.540 --> 02:44:59.680
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of a,</v>

5789
02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:02.740
<v Speaker 6>an article of faith that if all this were true,</v>

5790
02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:05.860
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't immediate just really want to cover this.</v>

5791
02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:07.353
<v Speaker 6>And I say,</v>

5792
02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:07.810
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5793
02:45:07.810 --> 02:45:10.780
<v Speaker 6>there were some really good people in the media who've wanted to,</v>

5794
02:45:11.050 --> 02:45:11.890
<v Speaker 6>but they're not allowed to.</v>

5795
02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:12.701
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

5796
02:45:12.701 --> 02:45:13.391
<v Speaker 6>and then this good way,</v>

5797
02:45:13.391 --> 02:45:15.040
<v Speaker 6>who controls the big media?</v>

5798
02:45:15.630 --> 02:45:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about your show because I'm talking to how many shows are out</v>

5799
02:45:18.961 --> 02:45:20.820
<v Speaker 2>there dedicated to looking for Ufo was there,</v>

5800
02:45:20.821 --> 02:45:23.940
<v Speaker 2>seems like there's quite a bit and they'll see those shows are owned by,</v>

5801
02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:24.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5802
02:45:24.841 --> 02:45:27.160
<v Speaker 2>big media companies and networks that,</v>

5803
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:28.470
<v Speaker 2>that promote these shows.</v>

5804
02:45:29.010 --> 02:45:29.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just bullshit.</v>

5805
02:45:29.971 --> 02:45:32.970
<v Speaker 2>And what they're doing is paying lip service to it and not really looking and</v>

5806
02:45:32.971 --> 02:45:36.450
<v Speaker 2>they're just covering the controversial aspects of it to get viewers.</v>

5807
02:45:36.451 --> 02:45:36.691
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5808
02:45:36.691 --> 02:45:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it's shocking.</v>

5809
02:45:37.650 --> 02:45:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Dribble in Britain circus.</v>

5810
02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:41.460
<v Speaker 2>And I think that you didn't ask the question of,</v>

5811
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5812
02:45:42.380 --> 02:45:45.200
<v Speaker 2>years ago when I was on Larry King and the afterwards I got this note from his</v>

5813
02:45:45.201 --> 02:45:45.750
<v Speaker 2>produce said,</v>

5814
02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:45.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5815
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:48.090
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the most popular shows we've ever had.</v>

5816
02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:53.280
<v Speaker 2>And so if it was just about ratings and just about whether there was anything</v>

5817
02:45:53.290 --> 02:45:54.510
<v Speaker 2>legitimate there to cover,</v>

5818
02:45:54.720 --> 02:45:56.370
<v Speaker 2>this would be in the news all the time.</v>

5819
02:45:56.430 --> 02:46:01.140
<v Speaker 2>So there's something weird going on here because they'll cover all kinds of</v>

5820
02:46:01.230 --> 02:46:02.940
<v Speaker 2>sensationalistic nonsense.</v>

5821
02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:03.721
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5822
02:46:03.721 --> 02:46:05.700
<v Speaker 2>you have dozens of top secret witnesses,</v>

5823
02:46:05.701 --> 02:46:07.590
<v Speaker 2>you have legitimate government documents,</v>

5824
02:46:07.591 --> 02:46:08.341
<v Speaker 2>you have photographs,</v>

5825
02:46:08.341 --> 02:46:08.850
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>

5826
02:46:08.850 --> 02:46:10.120
<v Speaker 2>or you have teams like ours going</v>

5827
02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:12.880
<v Speaker 6>out having these sorts of experiences that isn't covered.</v>

5828
02:46:13.390 --> 02:46:14.710
<v Speaker 6>You have to ask the question why.</v>

5829
02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:19.950
<v Speaker 6>And I think the wonderful thing about 2013 that didn't exist five or 10 years</v>

5830
02:46:21.521 --> 02:46:22.354
<v Speaker 6>ago,</v>

5835
02:46:26.021 --> 02:46:28.360

5841
02:46:36.140 --> 02:46:36.973
<v Speaker 6>maybe you can help us.</v>

5842
02:46:37.180 --> 02:46:37.600

5845
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:41.370
<v Speaker 6>we need help with it actually because we're actually out of funds.</v>

5846
02:46:41.470 --> 02:46:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Well Production Brad Ustream livestream to show this,</v>

5850
02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.880
<v Speaker 6>and then it'll be VOD video on demand so that you know,</v>

5851
02:46:51.881 --> 02:46:54.940
<v Speaker 6>there are no choke holds in the big media and then you couldn't have done that</v>

5852
02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:57.100
<v Speaker 6>five or 10 years ago with any kind of value.</v>

5853
02:46:57.400 --> 02:46:58.660
<v Speaker 6>Now you can do high definition,</v>

5854
02:46:58.661 --> 02:46:59.650
<v Speaker 6>you can do really good,</v>

5855
02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:03.880
<v Speaker 6>good video on demand and we're going to do this so that everyone can sign up to</v>

5856
02:47:03.881 --> 02:47:05.950
<v Speaker 6>be an affiliate distributor.</v>

5857
02:47:06.310 --> 02:47:09.730
<v Speaker 6>So that basically if you want to distribute to show,</v>

5858
02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:10.330
<v Speaker 6>you can,</v>

5859
02:47:10.330 --> 02:47:13.090
<v Speaker 6>you can distribute it and the people who see it,</v>

5860
02:47:13.091 --> 02:47:13.361
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5861
02:47:13.361 --> 02:47:17.740
<v Speaker 6>there'll be a small fee to see it and then you'll have part of that and you just</v>

5862
02:47:17.860 --> 02:47:18.700
<v Speaker 6>build that out.</v>

5863
02:47:18.701 --> 02:47:22.090
<v Speaker 6>Because what we want to do is make this thing go viral so that we don't get into</v>

5864
02:47:22.091 --> 02:47:25.660
<v Speaker 6>the choke holds of the big media because,</v>

5865
02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:26.620
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5866
02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:26.891
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5867
02:47:26.891 --> 02:47:27.061
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

5868
02:47:27.061 --> 02:47:27.380
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

5869
02:47:27.380 --> 02:47:27.550
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5870
02:47:27.550 --> 02:47:28.970
<v Speaker 6>my experience with it is that I'm,</v>

5871
02:47:28.971 --> 02:47:29.591
<v Speaker 6>I'm very,</v>

5872
02:47:29.591 --> 02:47:34.591
<v Speaker 6>very skeptical of the big media doing anything with this until they have to.</v>

5873
02:47:35.490 --> 02:47:35.980
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

5874
02:47:35.980 --> 02:47:36.170
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

5875
02:47:36.170 --> 02:47:38.150
<v Speaker 6>and then it becomes where is,</v>

5876
02:47:38.250 --> 02:47:39.310
<v Speaker 6>there's too much noise out there.</v>

5877
02:47:39.311 --> 02:47:41.950
<v Speaker 6>We have to give it a little bit of lip service and then we'll take it off again.</v>

5878
02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:43.330
<v Speaker 6>So that's why,</v>

5879
02:47:43.331 --> 02:47:43.991
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

5880
02:47:43.991 --> 02:47:46.720
<v Speaker 6>that's why we did this crowdfunding to this.</v>

5881
02:47:46.820 --> 02:47:50.500
<v Speaker 6>It was that we really wanted the people to have a stake in it and to move,</v>

5882
02:47:50.530 --> 02:47:52.450
<v Speaker 6>move the film serious forward.</v>

5883
02:47:52.690 --> 02:47:55.690
<v Speaker 6>Because if you went to a studio or a group of investors,</v>

5884
02:47:55.691 --> 02:47:58.570
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what they're going to do with it if they control it this way,</v>

5885
02:47:58.720 --> 02:47:59.553
<v Speaker 6>the people on it.</v>

5886
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:01.090
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

5887
02:48:01.090 --> 02:48:01.211
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5888
02:48:01.211 --> 02:48:01.541
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

5889
02:48:01.541 --> 02:48:01.781
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

5890
02:48:01.781 --> 02:48:03.910
<v Speaker 4>this is a fascinating subject.</v>

5891
02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:04.580
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5892
02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:05.321
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

5893
02:48:05.321 --> 02:48:10.321
<v Speaker 4>it's one of my personal interest and it has been since I was a small child,</v>

5894
02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:10.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5895
02:48:10.990 --> 02:48:12.070
<v Speaker 4>and a to talk to you,</v>

5896
02:48:12.071 --> 02:48:12.701
<v Speaker 4>it was a real treat.</v>

5897
02:48:12.701 --> 02:48:14.350
<v Speaker 4>I really appreciate it and we really appreciate,</v>

5898
02:48:14.351 --> 02:48:15.190
<v Speaker 4>put your neck out there,</v>

5899
02:48:15.191 --> 02:48:15.431
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5900
02:48:15.431 --> 02:48:18.850

5908
02:48:27.821 --> 02:48:28.660
<v Speaker 4>I'll do whatever it is.</v>

5909
02:48:28.900 --> 02:48:29.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

5910

<v Speaker 4>one of the most mind blowing things our society is ever had access to.</v>

5918
02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:43.600
<v Speaker 4>It has ever been able to encounter.</v>
