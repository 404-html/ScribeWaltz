00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.910
What are you eating over there and directly into the microphone?

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.283
What is it?

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.380
This is like fisherman's friend.

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.500
She'll be illegal tomorrow.

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.031
We're live.

6
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:12.451
We're live.

7
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:13.284
All right.

8
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.610
Fisherman's friend.

9
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.420
That's like,

10
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.860
let's like a gross cough drop.

11
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:17.190
Right?

12
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.090
But you don't feel like doing,

13
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.650
when I lecture a lot and you have to speak in a loud voice for a long time,

14
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:23.400
sometime I go to waste.

15
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.390
My throat is killing me.

16
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.201
I take one of these things.

17
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.000
I don't fucking feel anything for 20 minutes.

18
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.380
He's like anesthesia or something.

19
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.460
It's insane.

20
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.150
Interesting.

21
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.901
I'll have to look into it,

22
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:31.770
but they taste like shit,

23
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:32.220
right?

24
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.491
Yeah.

25
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.430
But it's so bad that it's beyond tasting good or bad.

26
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:35.701
It's like,

27
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.430
it's a whole lot.

28
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.730
The medicine something girls.

56
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:30.900
I got to remember to back that up.

57
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.310
I don't back shit up.

58
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.420
I think I'm going to back it up.

59
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:35.550

easy way for you to send things through the mail without having gone to go to

76
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:17.700
the post office in way shit you have,

77
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.930
you weigh it at home,

78
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:20.820
they provide you the digital scale.

79
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.320
You enter in the information,

80
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.861
you computer,

81
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:25.860
print up the actual postage on a printer,

82
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.020
slap it on the box and it's gone.

83
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.210
As soon as the mailman comes handed to him,

84
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:33.780
you don't have to deal with any of the nonsense of going to an actual post

85
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.141
office.

86
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:37.320
Getting in the actual line and dealing with an actual employee that doesn't

87
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.420
actually give a fuck what you're sending.

88
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:41.400
It doesn't really want to talk to you and you're,

89
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:42.330
you're being annoying,

90
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:42.870
man.

91
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.500
If I was working at the post office and this asshole came in with 36 boxes of

92
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:47.340
different sizes,

93
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.250
I was like,

94
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.083
oh,

95
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.483
how boring.

96
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.760
But this way you can do it all at home and with this no risk trial,

97
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.750

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.320
All of it again could be done through your home computer.

101
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.250
You just hand the boxes to the post man when he comes and your dignity,

102
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:12.641
dignity,

103
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:13.210
done.

104
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.043
That's it.

105
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.240

We're also brought to you by on it.

113
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:30.791
That's o,

114
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:33.940
n n I t.com o,

115
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:34.361
n n,

116
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:39.361
I t and we just started carrying these new of Zombie bells.

117
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:42.610
These are the latest and greatest of the primal bell type series.

118
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.110
We started with the ones who are just apes with gorillas and chimps and,

119
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:47.944
uh,

120
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.851
orangutans.

121
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:49.960
Now how we're monkeys.

122
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.290
But now we've expanded into the supernatural and we have actual Zombie artwork

123
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.020
that was created by the same guy who did the,

124
00:03:59.021 --> 00:03:59.200
uh,

125
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.270
the chimp's named Stevens Shubin Junior,

126
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.590
very talented artists,

127
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.450
and he created the gorilla,

128
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.290
the chimps and monkeys and all these pretty Badass zombies.

129
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.511
So I feel like me,

130
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:11.590
and you're obsessed with the walking dead.

131
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.060
These are an excellent way to get your workout on and have a little fun with it

132
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:16.510
while you're at it.

133
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.440
They're all three d balance,

134
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:17.981
so they're all,

135
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:18.370
um,

136
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.700
they're,

137
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.840
they're a weighted and balanced perfectly for exercise,

138
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.661
not just for looks.

139
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:23.710
We made sure that they're,

140
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.970
they're designed,

141
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.100
they're designed sort of meshed well with the actual idea of using them.

142
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.281
I mean,

143
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:32.380
it's cool that they look cool and everything like that,

144
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:34.960
but you really want to be able to work out with them so you can work out with

145
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.120
them just as easy as you can with a regular kettle bell.

146
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.770
We also sell battle ropes,

147
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:39.640
weight vest,

148
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:40.001
steel,

149
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:40.630
maces,

150
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.040
lots of supplements.

151
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:44.410
We've got all sorts of new shit that's just come in,

152
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.130
uh,

153
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.130
including digestive enzymes and on at one 80 on at one 80 is uh,

154
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.210
the idea said when you travel or when you go out and get your drink,

155
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.740
you drink on you,

156
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.570
it's,

157
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.320
it's nice to have something that can replenish all the nutrients in your body in

158
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:07.321
one little step to zip one of these little packets and toss it into a glass of

159
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:07.720
water.

160
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.553
It has,

161
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.090
um,

162
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.180
a lot of different things that we,

163
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.930
it combines a neurotransmitter support of Alpha brain,

164
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.720
the best adaptogens from shroom tech sport,

165
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.070
some five HTP from new mood and some minerals for the immune system.

166
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:25.450
And these nutrients play a key role in supporting multiple body systems for

167
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:26.620
recovery from stress.

168
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.590
Like a lot of what you're,

169
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.453
you're,

170
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.961
if you,

171
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.980
if you get hung over or if you fly that terrible feeling that you have,

172
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.290
a lot of that is just being dehydrated.

173
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.910
A lot of that is just lacking water and nutrients and something like one 80 can

174
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:42.640
really help you recover from that shit.

175
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:43.474
Son.

176
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.350
Use the code word,

177
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:44.621
j.

178
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:46.000
R.

179
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.860
E No Rogan God.

180
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.703
I need one code.

181
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.850
He'd want to go for everything.

182
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.720
I'm trying to fuck every commercial up on purpose just so they eventually you're

183
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:53.710
forced to give me one code.

184
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.380
You use the Codeword Rogan and save 10% off any and all supplements.

185
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.870
Boom,

186
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.871
Sherlock,

187
00:05:58.871 --> 00:05:59.120
lock,

188
00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.301
lock,

189
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:00.020
boom.

190
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.230
Danieli Bolelli and Dan Carlin.

191
00:06:02.231 --> 00:06:02.541
You're here,

192
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:03.410
ladies and gentlemen.

193
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.970
This shit could get epic

194
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.853
experience.

195
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.050
<v 1>[inaudible] the two guys that have freaked me out,</v>

196
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.100
<v 0>the stories of the past.</v>

197
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.120
It's you two gentlemen.

198
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:24.860
So what we do with a pleasure for out of all the years of listening to podcasts

199
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.300
and talking to you guys on the podcast,

200
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.200
you are without a doubt these the two men who have freaked me out the most.

201
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.730
You would that crazy story about the bodies on the stakes.

202
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.440
Uh,

203
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.850
was it in Persia or Rome?

204
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.743
What was the story?

205
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.850
I think I told you have to whine about it.

206
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:43.350
Of course in Pailin and all the fun stuff that goes with it.

207
00:06:43.351 --> 00:06:47.540
Then the other one was about the end of Spartacus rebellion where they crucify

208
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.450
some 5,000 people on the road between Naples and Rome.

209
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.230
That was it.

210
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.063
Yeah,

211
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.360
that's dark.

212
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.150
That would be at [inaudible] very,

213
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.600
she would take that road on those days.

214
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.860
Could you even imagine just wa I mean,

215
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.530
just the amount,

216
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.951
the idea,

217
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:01.191
I mean,

218
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:02.210
how many miles is that?

219
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.391
What?

220
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:03.320
It's 5,000 people.

221
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:04.410
How far did they space them out?

222
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.510
Sit about a hundred miles,

223
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:06.344
something like that.

224
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.020
Since he like a hundred miles of crucified.

225
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:14.030
Bonnie's every so many steps.

226
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.043
One more,

227
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.223
you know,

228
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.150
what does that a blink in terms of actual time on this planet?

229
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.200
Just a blink ago.

230
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:26.120
Like these same things that we go to school with and go to the supermarket with

231
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.270
these same humans are capable of that darkest of dark days from your podcast and

232
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:33.141
from Danielle.

233
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:33.291
He's,

234
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:33.800
I think,

235
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.580
um,

236
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.000
I,

237
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.360
uh,

238
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.860
the understanding of how easy we got it.

239
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.380
It's really cemented home.

240
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.921
You know,

241
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:40.400
your,

242
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.270
your stories.

243
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:41.991
Some of the stories,

244
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:42.980
like especially,

245
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.640
uh,

246
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.060
one of the ones that I really enjoyed recently is the Martin Luther Tale,

247
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.280
the tale of Lutheranism and the Anabaptist and the city of Munster and

248
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.980
Fascinating Waco on a huge scale.

249
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.481
Fascinating,

250
00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:57.380
fascinating stuff.

251
00:07:57.381 --> 00:07:58.070
And again,

252
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.150
not that long ago,

253
00:07:59.151 --> 00:07:59.780
man,

254
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.040
1500 something.

255
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.640
What was it?

256
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:01.821
Oh,

257
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.800
a guy like that could arise today too.

258
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:04.370
And today,

259
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.611
I mean,

260
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.020
they still make those kinds of people.

261
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.650
Yeah,

262
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.861
yeah,

263
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:07.380
they do.

264
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.210
We do.

265
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.840
You know,

266
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.000
what is it about people that fall for that shit?

267
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.571
I mean,

268
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:12.404
it's just,

269
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.020
it's,

270
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.930
there's a sucker born every minute,

271
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:15.764
right?

272
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.420
What is the flaw in humans that were willing to believe people that are,

273
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:22.130
that fucking Nutso might take?

274
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:22.431
He's,

275
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:22.730
uh,

276
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.900
the appeal of authority.

277
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:25.410
That's why they eat lots of the ward,

278
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.730
uh,

279
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.390
gain an audience is because most people are very secure.

280
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:31.850
Where most people like a father figure to tell them,

281
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.260
I got it under control.

282
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:34.640
I'm the strong man in charge.

283
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:35.960
I can take care of business,

284
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:36.794
look at me.

285
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.950
And I think there's an appeal of people who have that day shoes.

286
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.000
They like dictators they at that's party is likely oversimplified.

287
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.560
But I think there's a part of it.

288
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.580
There's also a thing where I think people really terribly want to be a part of a

289
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:50.060
group.

290
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.720
Oh yeah.

291
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.291
Like very,

292
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:52.160
very much so.

293
00:08:52.161 --> 00:08:54.230
And the more extreme,

294
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:56.190
their devotion to that group is

295
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.140
<v 2>sometimes the more rewarding.</v>

296
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.620
The actual experience of being in the group as it means something special to be

297
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:04.620
a part of this wacky group of crazy fucks.

298
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:05.850
It's willing to murder people.

299
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.410
Like it's almost like this extra charge of being alive that's missing from a lot

300
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:11.370
of people's lives.

301
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.940
I think that being involved in a court or,

302
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:15.630
and you know,

303
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.910
so any sort of crazy wild,

304
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:20.100
rebellious group that's doing dangerous things,

305
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.490
it's like it's almost to fill a void that's left in in human beings that we've

306
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:26.694
sort of like,

307
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.820
there's these echoes of our primal days that are still just lingering around in

308
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:34.650
our DNA looking to be played upon with the right harp note.

309
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.071
You know,

310
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:36.270
I think there's almost two.

311
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:37.500
When you think about like a Hitler,

312
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:39.180
there's some wonderful film.

313
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:43.650
You can see if Hitler with crowds on the street and you can see the look in the

314
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:48.310
people's eyes and they look like they're seeing a movie star and the decent,

315
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.560
just want to get a little touch.

316
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.570
Maybe my hand will touch his fingers and,

317
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.090
and,

318
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:52.680
and you just,

319
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.513
you think to yourself,

320
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.070
Hitler as a celebrity type figure.

321
00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:57.660
But there's that same thing about,

322
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.500
about,

323
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.410
because you're famous because I don't even know how,

324
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.570
I've never understood this celebrity thing where people just get dumb a,

325
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.280
but it's the same sort of the look in the eyes and it's like seeing Elvis and

326
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:09.300
instead it's Hitler.

327
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.220
Yeah.

328
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:10.770
Yeah.

329
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.110
I think you're onto something there for sure.

330
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:14.760
Because there's something about the,

331
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:16.950
the ultimate celebrity experience,

332
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:19.360
like meeting a guy like Obama or meeting,

333
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:19.870
you know,

334
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.430
and any,

335
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.030
any world leader type care there would be so overwhelming.

336
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:26.010
Just the presence of that person.

337
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.940
Now think about this all happening at a time when I was fucking really hard to

338
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:30.774
get a book,

339
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.620
you know,

340
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.200
really hard to be properly educated and no alternative media sources that we,

341
00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:37.200
we faced the day,

342
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:37.771
you know,

343
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:39.390
Pete goof on alternative media,

344
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:41.880
all you want online and some of it as much deserve.

345
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.650
But the one thing these guys do is they'll cover all kinds of fringe shit and

346
00:10:46.651 --> 00:10:48.300
that'll be their headline news.

347
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:48.781
You know,

348
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:53.781
like I go to salon and people excuse accused salon of being like too left wing

349
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:55.164
and to,

350
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.861
you know,

351
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:59.400
but there's some smart people that are pushing it that way.

352
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.391
What I like,

353
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:03.330
what they're doing is that they're front news is like,

354
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.150
it's not like the front news that you're going to get on CNN.

355
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:07.620
It's front news about,

356
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:07.981
you know,

357
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:10.520
like a gay and lesbian rights and,

358
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.590
and things in the workplace and you know,

359
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.090
what,

360
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.471
what,

361
00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:16.320
what politicians said about,

362
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:16.561
you know,

363
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:20.580
what race that was deplorable and all that stuff's like front row shit.

364
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.060
Yeah,

365
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.331
yeah.

366
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:21.871
It's really,

367
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:22.800
really lefty.

368
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.430
Very,

369
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.263
very lefty.

370
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.520
But that's important too.

371
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.220
Like it's,

372
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.050
it's important to have like a,

373
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.440
a balance out of super ultra sensitive to balance out the fucking savages of the

374
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:35.760
15 hundreds of,

375
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.620
they're still rolling around in our DNA.

376
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.101
You know,

377
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:42.270
you need someone out there on the fringes of supersensitive progressive behavior

378
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:45.090
just to try to like give us a better medium.

379
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.710
Give us a better baseline.

380
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:46.891
Well,

381
00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:47.191
let me,

382
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:48.350
and let me bring it back to that.

383
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.920
That monster podcast we talked about.

384
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:53.110
One of the sub themes in that was whether or not you remember that the whole

385
00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:53.980
question of whether or not

386
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.650
<v 3>regular people should be able to read the Bible for themselves.</v>

387
00:11:56.651 --> 00:12:01.000
And this goes to what you said about salon or all these alternative media sites

388
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:04.690
because the prime minister in Great Britain over all these Snowden leaks and

389
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.370
what the Guardian has done was talking about,

390
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.790
you know,

391
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.200
maybe we should dial this back.

392
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:09.880
Maybe it's time for some press restrictions.

393
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.481
In other words,

394
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:11.021
maybe it's,

395
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:14.560
maybe this is too darn dangerous that you're getting to read all this stuff and

396
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:18.130
we don't have a choke point to shut it down because in the regular media,

397
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:18.941
whether it was ABC,

398
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:19.451
CBS,

399
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:19.841
NBC,

400
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:20.674
The Washington Post it,

401
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.840
there are choke points where you know,

402
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:25.870
these people literally just pick up the red phone to the editor of the

403
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.100
Washington Post and say,

404
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.380
let's talk about this story you're thinking about running.

405
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:33.790
That's a great choke point when you have the media as diversified as it is now,

406
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:35.350
all those choke points go away,

407
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.210
and the David Cameron's and all these people miss the choke points and there's

408
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:41.010
people like that,

409
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:46.010
<v 4>Glenn Greenwald or Edward Snowden in a lesser extent because he's on the run and</v>

410
00:12:46.831 --> 00:12:47.460
hiding.

411
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.720
That becomes huge celebrities because of information that they released to

412
00:12:51.721 --> 00:12:53.370
people like Greenwald,

413
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.630
even though I know they harass him and they've harassed his boyfriend.

414
00:12:56.631 --> 00:12:58.800
He detained his boyfriend in England and,

415
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.200
but the bottom line is that guy became super famous because of this.

416
00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:05.610
So it's a positive thing.

417
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:05.771
<v 3>Well,</v>

418
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:06.910
think of how he changed the world.

419
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:07.151
I mean,

420
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:09.100
I had a lot of people right when the story broke say,

421
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.480
this is no big deal.

422
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:10.750
Nothing.

423
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.260
We haven't heard,

424
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.093
all this kind of stuff.

425
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.360
They're not saying that now.

426
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.130
Even even John Kerry,

427
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:15.941
the president,

428
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:18.220
all these people have come out and said things that,

429
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.670
oh,

430
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.630
maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

431
00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:21.130
Maybe we should be having this discussion.

432
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.690
It's really changed the world.

433
00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:25.480
All this stuff we're talking about now with the NSA,

434
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.490
that's all Edward Snowden stuff.

435
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.980
Yeah.

436
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.180
<v 4>It's amazing that that one guy can have that kind of impact and in the future</v>

437
00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:33.770
when they look back on today,

438
00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:39.130
and I think historically he's getting swept under the rug and what he's done and

439
00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:43.790
the impact of it is just sort of getting ignored by the media and more and more

440
00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:46.070
they'd paint him as this controversial figure.

441
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.671
You know,

442
00:13:46.671 --> 00:13:50.330
more and more they paint him as this guy on the run from the NSA,

443
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.580
but there's no supportive him.

444
00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:55.400
Like in anything mainstream.

445
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.610
Right.

446
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.920
There's no support of what he did or who he is,

447
00:13:57.921 --> 00:13:58.191
or no,

448
00:13:58.191 --> 00:14:01.610
there's no call to action for the government to release this guy that he's

449
00:14:01.611 --> 00:14:02.660
actually a patriot,

450
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.170
that he's actually is looking out for the true American way and is exposing

451
00:14:06.171 --> 00:14:07.700
people to people.

452
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.080
Not the America,

453
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:10.470
but people in America.

454
00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:13.430
I that I'm making a huge mistake and they're doing it for the name of America

455
00:14:13.431 --> 00:14:15.290
and whether or not they think it's right or wrong,

456
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.120
ultimately we don't think it's right.

457
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.930
And ultimately finding out about it pissed the entire world off.

458
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.070
That's the facts.

459
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.500
So if the government was really representing the people,

460
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.190
they would look at it in terms of like widow,

461
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.430
all the intelligent people who've reviewed this thing.

462
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:28.971
Yeah.

463
00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:29.840
It's a travesty.

464
00:14:29.841 --> 00:14:30.590
It's a fuckup.

465
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.940
It's,

466
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.090
it's anti-American.

467
00:14:32.091 --> 00:14:33.470
The idea of is ridiculous.

468
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.020
And the idea,

469
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:39.020
this is the only way you can control security is by spying on every fucking

470
00:14:39.561 --> 00:14:40.940
person within the terrorists.

471
00:14:40.941 --> 00:14:41.630
Have one.

472
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.051
I mean that's,

473
00:14:42.051 --> 00:14:44.240
that's a victory because that's terror for everybody.

474
00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.500
That's no privacy.

475
00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:46.490
That's weirdness.

476
00:14:46.491 --> 00:14:48.920
That's employees like Snowden,

477
00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.080
who they kept going on and on about.

478
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.430
He failed high school,

479
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.780
<v 3>high school dropout,</v>

480
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:54.410
high school,

481
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.741
high school,

482
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:55.131
drop out.

483
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:56.090
That could read my email,

484
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:56.924
man.

485
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.850
High school dropout.

486
00:14:57.851 --> 00:14:59.120
That just makes you look worse.

487
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.520
You pass code to that high school,

488
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:02.000
drop out.

489
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.631
What the fuck?

490
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:03.620
Why you goofing on him?

491
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:04.430
You hired him,

492
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.690
you know it's ridiculous.

493
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:07.950
You fucking hired that guy to watch everybody's mean.

494
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.970
How you know you were talking about one person,

495
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:11.571
just one guy,

496
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:15.710
but think about how much that same attitude scares the government.

497
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.660
One of their many,

498
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:18.021
many,

499
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:21.770
many thousands of workers was able to do that.

500
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.720
That's scary on the whole opposite side.

501
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.710
You know what it is too.

502
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.330
I think we're dealing with a bit of a,

503
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.540
and this is kind of gets them a little off the hook.

504
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.750
I think you have a bubble mentality in all the,

505
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:34.640
I mean in life you have them in professions.

506
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:34.851
I mean,

507
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:35.870
scientists get it,

508
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.750
unions get it,

509
00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.521
bureaucracies get it,

510
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.211
the army gets it,

511
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:39.044
the police gets it.

512
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.210
Where where people get promoted.

513
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:45.440
These guys all get promoted to the top NSA positions because they're better at

514
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:46.070
spying.

515
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.030
They figure out better ways to get around defenses and they don't get promoted

516
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:53.600
to that special room where there's five or six of them making policy because

517
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.440
they did a better job of finding a fourth amendment that doesn't let them spy.

518
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.820
So when they're in the room,

519
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.250
they all see the world the same way.

520
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.091
So you tend,

521
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:02.661
and this happens,

522
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:03.021
like I said,

523
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:03.854
in every profession,

524
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.820
they tend to push each other forward because there's no devil's advocate there

525
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:08.390
saying,

526
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.021
wait a minute,

527
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:13.700
maybe we shouldn't use every power we have to spy as much as we can to those

528
00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:14.091
people.

529
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:18.410
You see these NSA guys testifying in front of Congress and they don't even hide

530
00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:19.730
how mad they are at us,

531
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.330
how mad they are that this is even known how mad that they have to be there,

532
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:24.770
how mad you're questioning them.

533
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.020
And it's because there's nobody in the room saying,

534
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:27.710
guys,

535
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:28.640
we shouldn't do this.

536
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.070
And,

537
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.500
and really to be honest,

538
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:34.730
there is no obvious line where you should call the dogs off.

539
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.750
You know where you should say,

540
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.470
hey,

541
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:37.850
maybe this is okay,

542
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:39.140
but that's not okay.

543
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.100
That does not happen.

544
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.570
They talk about the fourth amendment,

545
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:42.470
but then the other guy goes,

546
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:42.771
well,

547
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:44.240
we're not really violating the fourth amendment.

548
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:48.170
If we just take everybody's trash at Cannes and we keep it in a storage locker

549
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:49.004
with their name on it,

550
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.740
we're only violating it if we actually like search through their trash,

551
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:53.780
which we'll do later if we have to,

552
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:55.730
and then then everything's on the kosher up and up.

553
00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.260
If j Edgar Hoover wants to search Joe Rogan's trash for evidence of illegal

554
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:00.920
activity,

555
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.530
you're going to have to send a physical agent out there to do that.

556
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.650
Now we just collect the trash on trash day,

557
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.330
bring it to the NSA headquarters,

558
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:09.111
dump it in there,

559
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.910
and we'll sift through it later if we have to.

560
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.391
Yeah,

561
00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:16.391
they could essentially tuning on anybody anywhere in the world now with a flip

562
00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:20.480
of a switch and that kind of power is awesome.

563
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.340
If you guys are like super enlightened monks that are designed to save the

564
00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:26.150
world,

565
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.020
but he was going again,

566
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:27.680
right,

567
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.060
exactly.

568
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.480
That you're a regular person,

569
00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.130
you can't have that kind of juice.

570
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.370
Regular person just can't have autonomy over all these people's information.

571
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.910
What if Richard Nixon had it?

572
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:38.744
That's what I'll just say.

573
00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.970
And you think you're not going to get another one of those dude.

574
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.340
What if Dick Cheney had it?

575
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.210
He did have it.

576
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.930
Did he have it?

577
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:45.200
Yeah.

578
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.770
You think so?

579
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.221
Absolutely.

580
00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:46.341
He,

581
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:46.640
he,

582
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.960
he put it into place,

583
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:48.380
man.

584
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.270
So they were everybody's emails as far back.

585
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:51.980
Yeah.

586
00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.280
There's a,

587
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.250
there's a book called the 1% doctrine where they talk about how after the nine

588
00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:00.030
11 attacks the rule that they decided and mainly because of Dick Cheney to

589
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:01.410
operate under was it,

590
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:04.920
there's even a 1% chance of another nine 11 happening.

591
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.210
Anything is fair.

592
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:08.160
You can do anything to justify it.

593
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.280
And I think what their attitude was is on,

594
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.640
you know,

595
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.360
nine 12 2002 everybody would've said,

596
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.261
oh yeah,

597
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:16.591
okay.

598
00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:17.281
Whatever it takes,

599
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:17.521
man.

600
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:20.220
Don't let that happen again when it was still fresh in our mind.

601
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.691
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

602
00:18:20.691 --> 00:18:25.691
There was a weird moment after nine 11 where I remember driving to school or to

603
00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:26.864
work rather.

604
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.600
And I'm trying to school as I was driving,

605
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.010
as I was driving to,

606
00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:31.320
uh,

607
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.153
to work.

608
00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:32.960
Uh,

609
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.310
it was early in the morning and all the computers were going and everybody had a

610
00:18:37.311 --> 00:18:38.510
flag on the car.

611
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.590
Everybody had it.

612
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.760
And it was weird.

613
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.990
It was a weird feeling.

614
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:42.640
It was,

615
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.840
it wasn't just a,

616
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.480
it was like everybody was reminding everyone.

617
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.950
<v 3>How long did that last two,</v>

618
00:18:47.951 --> 00:18:48.640
cause I'm thinking,

619
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.840
I just said 2002 it,

620
00:18:49.841 --> 00:18:50.674
everyone's been equipped to handle it.

621
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:50.861
You know,

622
00:18:50.861 --> 00:18:54.850
the nine 11 attacks happened in 2001 but a year later that was still an open

623
00:18:54.851 --> 00:18:55.660
wound.

624
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.530
And so how long,

625
00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:56.950
how,

626
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:57.611
when do you think,

627
00:18:57.611 --> 00:18:58.510
if you had to guess,

628
00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.490
when did it start to wear off?

629
00:19:00.491 --> 00:19:01.990
And we started to normalize.

630
00:19:01.991 --> 00:19:05.500
I mean New York City is exempt because I don't think they ever renormalize but

631
00:19:05.501 --> 00:19:06.430
for the rest of the country.

632
00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.310
How long do you think it took to get over that PTSD?

633
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.810
<v 0>I think it took a few years.</v>

634
00:19:10.811 --> 00:19:11.220
Yeah,

635
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.240
two or three years,

636
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:12.930
something like that.

637
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:17.310
I give you even more like butch side cause I mean bushmeat and reelected made no

638
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:21.720
fucking sense under any point of view other than part of the nine 11 boosts that

639
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:22.554
he got for awhile.

640
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.380
It was also the real problem with the voting machines.

641
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.610
There's a real yeah,

642
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:30.540
that will openly reported problems with those Diebold machines and

643
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.280
<v 3>candidate he ran against.</v>

644
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:34.960
That's always the first [inaudible].

645
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.560
If you're running against John F.

646
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:37.561
Kennedy,

647
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:39.270
you lose that election but you're not,

648
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:40.260
you're running against the guy.

649
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:40.650
He's just go,

650
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.430
Oh really?

651
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.330
That's my option.

652
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.440
And that's what kills you.

653
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.900
Yeah.

654
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.340
<v 0>Well in a lot of people felt like the,</v>

655
00:19:46.341 --> 00:19:48.980
the Al Gore election that got pushed in the office in the front.

656
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.030
That was a weird one too.

657
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.923
That was a weird one.

658
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.350
There's so much fuckery involved in voting man.

659
00:19:53.351 --> 00:19:56.860
Like real open fuckery that should be like really it's treason,

660
00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.390
it's treasonous behavior and these people openly do it in order to help their

661
00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:01.931
candidates.

662
00:20:01.931 --> 00:20:06.040
When mean it's one of the most unamerican things of all time manipulating the

663
00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:06.790
vote.

664
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.270
<v 3>I think somebody who's who was a political operative would say to you that it's</v>

665
00:20:10.271 --> 00:20:13.870
one of the most American time because it's been going on.

666
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.500
I mean,

667
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:14.680
you know,

668
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.380
George Washington's giving hard cider to people,

669
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:17.831
you know,

670
00:20:17.831 --> 00:20:19.480
when they come to his little parties to get,

671
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.060
I mean this is the problem is,

672
00:20:22.061 --> 00:20:22.480
is that I,

673
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.590
and we've talked about this before,

674
00:20:23.591 --> 00:20:26.800
I think there's a certain amount of this that a healthy society and a healthy

675
00:20:26.801 --> 00:20:29.920
political system can suck up and still be okay.

676
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.070
There's a certain tipping point where you're not that healthy anymore and what

677
00:20:33.071 --> 00:20:36.190
was okay before is not suck up a bubble anymore.

678
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.270
You've got Bible.

679
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.103
I love that.

680
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:39.570
<v 0>Well,</v>

681
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.690
it also begs the question,

682
00:20:41.691 --> 00:20:43.460
all of this stuff begs the question like,

683
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.541
first of all,

684
00:20:44.541 --> 00:20:47.830
everyone's favorite argument is if you have to hide,

685
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.330
<v 2>then what are you worried about?</v>

686
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.370
And it's not that what,

687
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:51.651
what,

688
00:20:51.651 --> 00:20:52.960
what it is is first of all,

689
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.890
why do you need so much information and what,

690
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.450
what have you done that have made so many people so angry that you have to check

691
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:02.320
everyone's email?

692
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:02.501
Like,

693
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:06.160
what is the actual cause of all this that never gets addressed.

694
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.420
Like whenever we're talking about how this group hates us of that group hates us

695
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:11.350
and this group is playing.

696
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:12.670
Why?

697
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.540
Why?

698
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.340
What did we,

699
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.230
what did I want to take?

700
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.360
I want to go with we do.

701
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.500
I want to go with what you said that the,

702
00:21:17.501 --> 00:21:18.460
if you have nothing to hide,

703
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:19.181
because I was just,

704
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:21.880
I was trying to get a show up before I came here and I failed miserably.

705
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:23.530
But one of the things I was going to talk about,

706
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.210
did you see that story?

707
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.250
The lawsuit filed from that incident in New Mexico with the driver who didn't do

708
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:32.170
the full stop leaving Walmart.

709
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:32.621
You saw it,

710
00:21:32.621 --> 00:21:33.070
right?

711
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.430
Right.

712
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.910
So,

713
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.700
so the police pulled him over for,

714
00:21:35.701 --> 00:21:38.050
for California stopping the stop sign.

715
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.320
Decide that he looks like he's clenching his bud hawks in a weird way,

716
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:45.790
and this is the part I love,

717
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.690
goes to a judge and says to the judge,

718
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:51.070
while this guy is sitting on the side of the road,

719
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:52.060
he's clenching his buttocks.

720
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:52.661
In a weird way.

721
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:55.030
I think we have somebody trying to hide drugs in there.

722
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.380
And the judge goes,

723
00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.060
I guess judging from the story,

724
00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:58.871
yeah,

725
00:21:58.871 --> 00:22:00.370
that would be probable cause.

726
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.110
So they take this guy to a doctor who refuses to do with the police officer's

727
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:05.381
rescue.

728
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:06.640
So they got to go to another doctor,

729
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.960
14 hours of anal cavity searches,

730
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.153
enemas.

731
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.730
They sedated him and did a colonoscopy.

732
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:19.120
They examined his stuff right in front of him.

733
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.290
14 hours,

734
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.190
found nothing,

735
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.270
x rate him multiple times,

736
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:23.104
found nothing.

737
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.070
And then apparently send him a $6,000 bill for the procedure.

738
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.120
So when you say,

739
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.780
what have you got to hide if,

740
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.750
unless you're Heidi,

741
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.650
that's what can happen to you if [inaudible] not just that.

742
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.870
What I love is the police department spokesman said,

743
00:22:37.871 --> 00:22:38.860
we didn't do anything wrong.

744
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:39.880
This is policy.

745
00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:41.410
And we had a judge sign off on it.

746
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.390
So when you say if you have nothing to hide,

747
00:22:43.391 --> 00:22:44.200
what do you care?

748
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.970
This guy had nothing to hide.

749
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.650
And that happened to him.

750
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.520
Clearly did because he was [inaudible] away.

751
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.140
I know,

752
00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:51.973
but now,

753
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.240
now if that story's true and the and the lawsuit claims witnesses and all this

754
00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:58.390
kind of stuff and the police officer's think nothing was wrong there,

755
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.930
that's what happens to you when you get rid of these protections that keep you

756
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:04.120
from being searched willy nilly or anything like that.

757
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.410
If after a story like that,

758
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.570
everyone in the ward was going to be stopped by the police,

759
00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:09.130
he's going to claim she's in weird way.

760
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.510
Just the fear of this story.

761
00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:11.230
It's like,

762
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.010
Oh shit.

763
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.670
Little Dasko pinned on people that are but freaks and that's what they're into.

764
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:20.260
They're into cops checking them out and their skies treasures up there.

765
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.670
Put secrets up there.

766
00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:22.151
I didn't mean to,

767
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:24.370
I didn't mean to take the conversation in that direction.

768
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.980
It's a great direction.

769
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.090
It's hilarious.

770
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:28.620
It's,

771
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:28.810
it's,

772
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:29.021
well,

773
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:31.150
it's fucked up that if you search,

774
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:33.730
someone's asked for 14 hours and there's nothing up there.

775
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.600
That guy should be able to search your for 28 that should be the rule.

776
00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:40.580
He should be able to throw firecrackers in there and then mean,

777
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.620
come on man.

778
00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:43.540
He checked his ass for no reason.

779
00:23:43.541 --> 00:23:45.500
Like you owe him something.

780
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.010
What bothers

781
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.370
<v 3>me about that is that there's no penalty that actually affects the people who</v>

782
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:49.881
did this.

783
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:52.190
In other words at this guy wins is big lawsuit against them.

784
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.440
That's the taxpayers who are going to pay that.

785
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.420
The people who did it don't suffer at all.

786
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.691
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

787
00:23:56.691 --> 00:24:01.691
Like someone falsely accusing someone of murder or theft or any crime like that.

788
00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:05.210
It almost should be worth just as much if you know,

789
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.390
if you set a guy up for murder and you know he didn't really do it,

790
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.710
it should be worth almost as much as like murdering somebody.

791
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.860
<v 3>They're talking about that with these podcasts,</v>

792
00:24:14.861 --> 00:24:17.950
troll lawsuits and everything to change the sh the law that they're working on

793
00:24:17.951 --> 00:24:19.450
in DC would do.

794
00:24:19.451 --> 00:24:22.540
Some of that would put like some of the onus on these people who say these

795
00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:26.320
things and if you lose your case all of a sudden you're the one responsible for

796
00:24:26.321 --> 00:24:26.561
the day.

797
00:24:26.561 --> 00:24:27.100
In other words,

798
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.340
something story.

799
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:28.780
Yeah.

800
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.613
Tell that story.

801
00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.120
<v 4>I don't know the full extent of it.</v>

802
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.230
From what I understand.

803
00:24:32.231 --> 00:24:34.920
Someone out there has a patent says they have a pet.

804
00:24:34.921 --> 00:24:36.670
It says they have a patent on,

805
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.230
I'm in a very,

806
00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:40.240
very broadly paraphrase this.

807
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.570
I think it was putting something up in serial form on the Internet.

808
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.090
So essentially it'd be like every podcast,

809
00:24:46.091 --> 00:24:47.380
every youtube channel,

810
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:48.820
every everything.

811
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:49.683
We invented that.

812
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:50.051
Yeah,

813
00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:50.884
you owe us money.

814
00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.030
The idea is ridiculous.

815
00:24:52.031 --> 00:24:55.120
Like if you have the Bolelli blog and you decide to number them,

816
00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.860
either you're violating a patent.

817
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.770
I obviously I might be way off with this,

818
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.990
but he sent some,

819
00:25:01.991 --> 00:25:04.930
or the company had a already won.

820
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:05.950
They had beaten,

821
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.490
um,

822
00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:07.600
on a different thing though.

823
00:25:07.601 --> 00:25:08.260
A different thing.

824
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:08.560
Yeah.

825
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.960
Apple on another patent style lawsuits,

826
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.200
which may or may not have been more worthy,

827
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:19.500
but this one is a strange because he's targeting podcasters and so a,

828
00:25:19.841 --> 00:25:20.450
it's a big

829
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.660
<v 3>got,</v>

830
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.720
the whole goal is to get you to talk to the old shakedown though,

831
00:25:23.721 --> 00:25:24.590
where they essentially say,

832
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:25.431
we're not going to get,

833
00:25:25.431 --> 00:25:25.650
you know,

834
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:25.970
you,

835
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:26.240
you,

836
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.650
you stole our technology,

837
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:28.401
but it's fine.

838
00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:32.000
Just give us $1,000 a month and nobody gets hurt that much.

839
00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:32.301
Oh,

840
00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:33.134
I'm sure it was.

841
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.940
Talk to your friend Adam Corolla.

842
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:35.774
He got a letter.

843
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.903
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

844
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.950
Well that's ridiculous.

845
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:39.400
You know,

846
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.330
the idea that you could patent putting things up and serialized form on the

847
00:25:43.331 --> 00:25:43.661
Internet,

848
00:25:43.661 --> 00:25:47.470
it's like 1994 or something or whenever they claim to have it done.

849
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.090
It's what people have always done.

850
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.421
I mean,

851
00:25:49.421 --> 00:25:51.130
we put everything up and serialized form.

852
00:25:51.131 --> 00:25:54.160
Can you imagine if someone allowed them to do that with television shows?

853
00:25:54.161 --> 00:25:55.930
You can never number episodes anymore.

854
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.730
It's the stupidest idea of all time.

855
00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.590
Like the idea that you could control that

856
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.151
<v 3>but see you,</v>

857
00:26:00.151 --> 00:26:03.710
but it's not stupid if you're them and the lawyers and everything because that

858
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:05.780
thing that they're working on in DC isn't there yet.

859
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:06.860
You take a shot,

860
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.251
right.

861
00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:07.491
You know,

862
00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:08.930
you take a shot and you see what happens.

863
00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:09.764
There's no downside.

864
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.041
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

865
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:10.790
I could see that.

866
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.020
I could see it from their point of view,

867
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:13.010
from a strictly business.

868
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:13.201
Sure.

869
00:26:13.201 --> 00:26:13.910
As they build clock,

870
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:14.930
we're playing within the rules.

871
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:16.610
These are the rules and this is how you get paid.

872
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.270
Right.

873
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:22.270
But I think that ultimately we're going to have to agree on something that makes

874
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:23.600
a lot more sense.

875
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.930
Because you know you can't get money for nothing from people and that's money

876
00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:27.381
for nothing.

877
00:26:27.381 --> 00:26:28.550
You're not contributing anything.

878
00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:29.380
If you really,

879
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.220
you can get money for nothing for people.

880
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.240
I'm of the totally,

881
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.400
I think we do that all the time that well,

882
00:26:34.401 --> 00:26:37.970
we shouldn't [inaudible] can't get money for nothing.

883
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.680
I'm talking about the ideal scenario.

884
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.633
Okay.

885
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.051
Yeah.

886
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:43.100
We let's make that clear.

887
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.730
People get something for nothing,

888
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:45.480
right?

889
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:45.651
I mean,

890
00:26:45.651 --> 00:26:46.190
I think we're,

891
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.391
we're,

892
00:26:46.391 --> 00:26:48.570
we're going to have a real problem in this country no matter what.

893
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:52.630
As long as our financial systems remains so vague and is,

894
00:26:52.631 --> 00:26:53.910
it fluctuates,

895
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.530
it goes up and down.

896
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:55.771
Today,

897
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:57.990
the Dow crash tomorrow the Dow rises.

898
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.830
Like if,

899
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.510
as long as that's a possibility,

900
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:04.810
like how could you ever have anything stable ever when your entire,

901
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:09.830
the entire foundation of your economy is by nature fluctuating daily by nature,

902
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.250
up and down.

903
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.340
So much so that you have to close business at a certain time.

904
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.050
Stop fucking trading.

905
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.980
You have to blow whistle often.

906
00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.710
Say No more decisions no more.

907
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:21.301
No,

908
00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:22.134
you got to stop.

909
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.150
We have to control this economy.

910
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.890
We have to allow chaos.

911
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.460
Only an eight hour bursts and when those bursts are over,

912
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:29.900
we have to

913
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.860
<v 3>literally shut down how many trades there would be the what,</v>

914
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.440
the second the market opens when they've had a whole night to digest stuff.

915
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:36.801
Okay,

916
00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:37.610
first thing in the morning,

917
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:38.690
it's billions of dollars.

918
00:27:38.691 --> 00:27:41.330
We got to get this trade in before because everybody will beat us to it.

919
00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.700
And can you imagine what the market would do,

920
00:27:43.701 --> 00:27:43.981
you know,

921
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:44.814
on opening now.

922
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.920
Now in the old days,

923
00:27:45.921 --> 00:27:46.581
that's how it was,

924
00:27:46.581 --> 00:27:49.040
but now with the digital trading all in one sec,

925
00:27:49.041 --> 00:27:51.470
there'd be 10 bazillion trades in a second and a half.

926
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.333
What's his stream?

927
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:52.671
<v 4>Dia?</v>

928
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:56.230
The idea that you could only make transactions during the various,

929
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:56.671
<v 3>yeah,</v>

930
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:56.970
it is.

931
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.670
Especially in a global economy when the people in Japan are going,

932
00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:02.340
so we can only trade on American things when we're asleep at night,

933
00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:03.060
I don't under,

934
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:03.301
<v 4>yeah,</v>

935
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:04.134
it's stupid.

936
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.033
It's stupid.

937
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.870
But if they went 24 hours,

938
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:09.570
people would just take fucking Adderall and just hit it hard.

939
00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:11.340
And people be dying of lack of sleep.

940
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:11.880
That's right.

941
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.440
Way More than starcraft.

942
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.930
All those people that are dying from playing starcraft.

943
00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:16.390
Yeah.

944
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.000
Well that's not even for real money.

945
00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:18.840
You know,

946
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.800
you play the economy,

947
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:21.210
you're playing for real money,

948
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:21.841
but can you,

949
00:28:21.841 --> 00:28:22.351
what do you do?

950
00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:25.110
Like can you day trade in the middle of the night or do you have to do it during

951
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.260
stock market hours?

952
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.280
I think it just stoked.

953
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:27.690
No,

954
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.910
I think you can set up trades to be,

955
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.890
to be enacted at the market open or whatnot.

956
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:37.440
She can't just ride the wave and go up and down sell and buy.

957
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.513
I don't think so.

958
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.151
Unless you're doing it.

959
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.470
Maybe on Tokyo time,

960
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.390
maybe you could do the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

961
00:28:42.391 --> 00:28:43.320
They have a different stock,

962
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.260
<v 3>real addict when you go,</v>

963
00:28:45.261 --> 00:28:45.711
Oh man,

964
00:28:45.711 --> 00:28:46.640
the u s market close.

965
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:47.450
Where can I play?

966
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.680
Tokyo is just coming alive.

967
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.050
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

968
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:50.330
It's,

969
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.070
it is like an addiction.

970
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.480
I really truly believe it.

971
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.060
I don't think it's possible that it couldn't be.

972
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.220
When you're gambling and you're,

973
00:28:58.221 --> 00:29:00.590
you mean essentially the stock market has a lot of gambles.

974
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.360
Yeah.

975
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.070
<v 3>Especially the way some of these people play it.</v>

976
00:29:03.071 --> 00:29:06.550
It's one thing to say is I want to buy Coca Cola and sell it in 25 years.

977
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.740
So the other thing when you go by

978
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.630
<v 4>Coca Cola and sell it in 20 seconds,</v>

979
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.220
and even if you're right,

980
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.180
like if you say no,

981
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:12.451
look,

982
00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:14.850
it seems like a gamble to you because you're uneducated,

983
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.380
but I in fact are,

984
00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:17.990
I'm very educated on this and it's,

985
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:18.750
it's,

986
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.670
it's more of a calculated risk,

987
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:23.460
but the reward to risk ratio is very high,

988
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.420
a lot of variables,

989
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.520
but they've got to show the Gambler,

990
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.190
I'll show you on paper,

991
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.590
we,

992
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.891
you know,

993
00:29:28.891 --> 00:29:29.790
we've profited,

994
00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:30.030
you know,

995
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.470
x amount of years in a row.

996
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:33.930
This is not nearly as unstable as you like thinking this,

997
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.530
but part of their charge is the fact that it is a little,

998
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.800
so 2008 happens every now and then or a fucking,

999
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.010
everybody's scrambling and

1000
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.230
<v 0>no one's got a chair and the music just shut off.</v>

1001
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.150
What I love about that is when they show you,

1002
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:48.520
you go to the financial advisor's office and they always show you the

1003
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.630
historical,

1004
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.520
the way these things are performed historically,

1005
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.450
and it's always,

1006
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.960
the graph starts right after the last terrible crash.

1007
00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:56.800
You just go,

1008
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.341
well what about,

1009
00:29:57.341 --> 00:29:58.330
what about the depression?

1010
00:29:58.331 --> 00:29:58.691
Well,

1011
00:29:58.691 --> 00:29:58.781
the,

1012
00:29:58.781 --> 00:29:58.941
we,

1013
00:29:58.941 --> 00:29:59.080
we,

1014
00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.321
you know,

1015
00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:01.710
the depression was an unusual situation that'll never happen again.

1016
00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:05.140
And I think today they must start it from like last week.

1017
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:09.370
Don't you think historically the performance in the last seven day period,

1018
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.960
we don't know.

1019
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.010
It's,

1020
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.420
I think the idea of trying to control an entire global economy like that,

1021
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:17.530
it's preposterous.

1022
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:18.790
It's doesn't make any sense.

1023
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.380
I don't understand it at all.

1024
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.460
And the people that understand it,

1025
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:25.180
I've tried to comfort me and the shore me that it does in fact make good sense.

1026
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:25.871
Right?

1027
00:30:25.871 --> 00:30:27.250
And if that's not scary enough,

1028
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:30.420
then you get the collusion of government and we are to call them.

1029
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.761
You were,

1030
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:31.030
I mean,

1031
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.080
when you think about defended,

1032
00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:35.680
there are no laws against the fact that if you have worked for some companies

1033
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:38.530
who can pick up a government job overseeing those,

1034
00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:39.461
the workings self,

1035
00:30:39.461 --> 00:30:41.500
those very column bunnies or vice versa,

1036
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.590
you are in government first and the second you're don,

1037
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:48.010
you can pick up your vice president position in one of the companies that you

1038
00:30:48.011 --> 00:30:49.390
just finished benefiting.

1039
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.790
That's beyond pervert.

1040
00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.170
So transparent.

1041
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.100
It's one of the ways that they've said our society could go down though and

1042
00:30:57.101 --> 00:30:58.510
other societies have throughout history,

1043
00:30:58.511 --> 00:31:02.380
is that sometimes they just get too complex to manage and you can ride that wave

1044
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:04.210
sometimes until something bad happens.

1045
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.560
But a perfect example is,

1046
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:08.590
I mean a lot of people said that the great depression happened because the what

1047
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:10.060
was going on in the financial system,

1048
00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:12.820
overwhelmed people's ability to understand and,

1049
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:14.800
and react and compensate for things.

1050
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.640
And I remember people saying,

1051
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:15.731
well,

1052
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:18.940
we'll never have another great depression because we're so on top of things now.

1053
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:19.361
Yeah.

1054
00:31:19.361 --> 00:31:22.200
But we have new variables that we don't understand that somebody in the future

1055
00:31:22.201 --> 00:31:25.330
is going to say they were such idiots way back there in the early 21st century

1056
00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.820
will me as a barely educated fool,

1057
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.420
what I,

1058
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:33.160
when I look at exactly how everything has fluctuated in Ra,

1059
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:33.750
you know the,

1060
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:38.750
the crash in 2008 and I'll use it makes zero sense because as a fool I look at

1061
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:39.911
it and I go,

1062
00:31:39.911 --> 00:31:40.744
look at this,

1063
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.490
there's the same amount of people.

1064
00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:44.080
There's the same amount of metal,

1065
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.400
it's the same amount of concrete,

1066
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:46.460
the same amount of plastic,

1067
00:31:46.461 --> 00:31:50.860
same amount of material things no one has produced or taken away anything from

1068
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:55.120
the pile of humanities creations and yet all of a sudden everyone's broke.

1069
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.830
Like all of a sudden everything fell apart and people who were prospering just a

1070
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.090
week ago are no longer prospering.

1071
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.860
When I look at something like that,

1072
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.300
I have to feel like,

1073
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.230
okay,

1074
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:08.380
these guys are obviously far smarter than I and they're running the system.

1075
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:13.330
So either it's rigged as fuck and someone just extracted a shitload of money out

1076
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:18.331
of the system and did it under the guise of a crash or people were way fucking

1077
00:32:19.241 --> 00:32:20.590
dumber than I give them credit.

1078
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.300
It's one of those two things.

1079
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.193
And I have,

1080
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.020
I feel like when a guy like that,

1081
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.311
that a,

1082
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:30.340
that cat from New York that ripped everybody off in the Ponzi scheme,

1083
00:32:30.341 --> 00:32:34.330
the old dude was this made off Brady made off when a cat like Bernie made off

1084
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:37.150
comes along and rob so many people,

1085
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.411
I have to go,

1086
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:39.200
wait a minute,

1087
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:39.441
a minute,

1088
00:32:39.441 --> 00:32:39.861
wait a minute,

1089
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:40.281
wait a minute.

1090
00:32:40.281 --> 00:32:42.110
So no one knows how this thing works.

1091
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:42.721
<v 3>Well,</v>

1092
00:32:42.721 --> 00:32:43.291
but I mean look,

1093
00:32:43.291 --> 00:32:43.621
I mean it,

1094
00:32:43.621 --> 00:32:43.851
it's,

1095
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:46.260
it's not that hard to understand when people are playing with things that aren't

1096
00:32:46.261 --> 00:32:46.591
real,

1097
00:32:46.591 --> 00:32:49.950
but selling it for real money and then you're counting that as something that

1098
00:32:49.951 --> 00:32:50.460
you don't.

1099
00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.090
For example,

1100
00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.560
we take these toxic assets,

1101
00:32:52.561 --> 00:32:52.741
right?

1102
00:32:52.741 --> 00:32:54.780
It's not as hard to understand as people suggest.

1103
00:32:54.781 --> 00:32:59.250
Cause let's say I put you in a house you can't afford and and all the evidence

1104
00:32:59.251 --> 00:33:00.031
shows you can't afford it,

1105
00:33:00.031 --> 00:33:01.770
then I wouldn't have given it to you 20 years ago.

1106
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.670
And then I take a bunch of people like you and I take all of your bad things

1107
00:33:05.671 --> 00:33:07.320
that you're never going to be paid and paying back.

1108
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.950
And I bundle it into something and then I sell that to someone else based on the

1109
00:33:10.951 --> 00:33:14.130
value that isn't really there because none of you can really pay it back and

1110
00:33:14.131 --> 00:33:14.671
then you say,

1111
00:33:14.671 --> 00:33:15.810
well I'm worth this much money.

1112
00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.670
I own these assets and they're worth as much money.

1113
00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:21.480
And then those assets collapse and all of a sudden you looked like you had $50

1114
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.860
million in your asset tree of,

1115
00:33:22.861 --> 00:33:25.080
of of stuff and all of a sudden you don't,

1116
00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.120
you bought something that was worth nothing.

1117
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:30.560
And so all that money that you had on paper just disappeared overnight because

1118
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.130
it wasn't real to begin with.

1119
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.170
Wasn't weren't there banks during this crisis that we're actually banking on?

1120
00:33:37.171 --> 00:33:38.370
Things falling apart.

1121
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.030
Yes.

1122
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:39.750
Hedging.

1123
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:40.131
Hedging.

1124
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:40.271
Yeah,

1125
00:33:40.271 --> 00:33:40.790
exactly.

1126
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:43.470
So Ho profiting off of it.

1127
00:33:43.471 --> 00:33:47.400
Falling apart post to be a risk management diversification tool.

1128
00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:48.720
Jesus Christ.

1129
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:49.690
<v 0>That's a great way of saying</v>

1130
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.900
using the proper terminology that or write that down cause that's a brilliant

1131
00:33:55.901 --> 00:33:57.280
way of fucking someone in the US.

1132
00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.290
This is a risk management,

1133
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.200
not a risk management for you or risk management for them.

1134
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.220
How did they describe risk risk management diversification tool.

1135
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:07.960
That is God damn hilarious.

1136
00:34:07.961 --> 00:34:11.470
It's the greatest way the cops in New Mexico said,

1137
00:34:11.471 --> 00:34:15.370
that's too the guy searching your cavity is a risk management.

1138
00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.510
I'm actually writing that down because it's so beautiful.

1139
00:34:19.511 --> 00:34:20.870
I think you use that for all kinds of,

1140
00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:22.990
they use it in the MMA color commentary.

1141
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.680
Him throwing that punch that way as a risk management diversification.

1142
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.210
If anybody hears that though,

1143
00:34:28.211 --> 00:34:30.640
if I pretended that I actually came up with it on my own,

1144
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.500
I would get shit.

1145
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.140
All the financial advisors who've watched the MMA would be going,

1146
00:34:35.141 --> 00:34:36.400
now he's talking,

1147
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.760
if I'm saying it now I have to say it as a inside joke.

1148
00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:41.410
Wink,

1149
00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:42.243
wink,

1150
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.450
risk management,

1151
00:34:43.451 --> 00:34:44.830
diversification tool.

1152
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.600
That's how we're fucking you be able to fold.

1153
00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:47.860
That's hilarious.

1154
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.470
That's a brilliant way of putting it.

1155
00:34:49.471 --> 00:34:49.900
I'm out.

1156
00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.733
Then I'm out of it,

1157
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:54.220
but just the idea that that could be legal,

1158
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.650
that you could be loaning people money,

1159
00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.760
setting up loans,

1160
00:34:57.761 --> 00:35:01.260
and also gambling on the fact that you're,

1161
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.100
you will profit if those loans,

1162
00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.000
if they default on those,

1163
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.281
<v 3>look,</v>

1164
00:35:04.281 --> 00:35:06.320
we know you can't afford this mortgage,

1165
00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:07.160
but don't worry.

1166
00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:08.180
If you can't pay it,

1167
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.850
you'll be taken out of your house and we'll win on this other side over here.

1168
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.580
<v 0>That's my point as like an uneducated fool.</v>

1169
00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:15.720
When I look at that system,

1170
00:35:15.721 --> 00:35:15.901
I go,

1171
00:35:15.901 --> 00:35:16.141
well,

1172
00:35:16.141 --> 00:35:18.540
obviously they set it up so they can extract money.

1173
00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:19.710
That's the only way it makes sense.

1174
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.480
If you have the same amount of people,

1175
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.950
you have the same amount of knowledge,

1176
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:26.610
you have the same amount of items and yet all of a sudden everything fell apart.

1177
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.900
Somebody fucked you.

1178
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:28.501
Okay.

1179
00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:30.720
They just did it in a way that's legal.

1180
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.381
You know what I mean?

1181
00:35:31.381 --> 00:35:31.830
Banks,

1182
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.630
I have to tell your story because this is too crazy.

1183
00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:38.130
I remember when I went from incomes to one

1184
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.770
<v 5>after my wife died and every single,</v>

1185
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.180
and so I applied for the,

1186
00:35:41.181 --> 00:35:41.970
um,

1187
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:42.721
I forgot what they call it,

1188
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:43.620
loan modification,

1189
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.011
right.

1190
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:44.271
It's like,

1191
00:35:44.271 --> 00:35:44.341
oh,

1192
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:45.330
conditions of change.

1193
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:47.850
You can modify the loan to help somebody stay in the house.

1194
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:48.211
All that.

1195
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:48.900
Right.

1196
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.480
So I got two letters from the bank in the same day,

1197
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.980
one eye open and he say,

1198
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.130
we can't give you the loan modification because you make too much money.

1199
00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.570
They are doing too well you don't need it.

1200
00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.110
I opened the next latter.

1201
00:35:59.111 --> 00:35:59.361
He said,

1202
00:35:59.361 --> 00:36:01.950
we can give you a loan modification because there's no hope.

1203
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:02.720
You can keep the house,

1204
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.780
you'll make too little money.

1205
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:04.614
There's just no way.

1206
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.470
What the fuck did you talk to each other?

1207
00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:08.480
At least it's like er,

1208
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:09.600
the same department.

1209
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.910
You're said really this is what it's about.

1210
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.773
They just have,

1211
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.940
I bet probably like patent excuses,

1212
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.400
especially when they feel like you're probably going to lose the house to their

1213
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:17.640
goodwill.

1214
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.630
Just snatch up his house.

1215
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.830
This is where it gets better.

1216
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:24.270
I knew somebody was hooking up with the people who own the loan.

1217
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.690
So through somebody would know somebody who know somebody.

1218
00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:29.490
We got to the president of the company like,

1219
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:29.911
Hey man,

1220
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:30.870
can you do something?

1221
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:32.880
Is it something that we can work with and stuff?

1222
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.141
I kid you not.

1223
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:35.370
The guy sent back the word,

1224
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.040
give me 20,000 under the table and I can make it.

1225
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.180
I can make it happen.

1226
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.110
Oh my God.

1227
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.440
He asked for a bribe.

1228
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.070
Yeah,

1229
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.930
I told her shit.

1230
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.280
And if he's doing that with me,

1231
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:46.560
I'm imagining that's barely a regular business.

1232
00:36:46.561 --> 00:36:46.741
Right.

1233
00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:47.580
Amazing.

1234
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:47.911
But you know,

1235
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:50.670
there's no paper trail so you know you can prove it.

1236
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.770
So you'd have to come up with 20 cash.

1237
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.280
Yup.

1238
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.840
20,000 in cash.

1239
00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:55.531
Holy Shit,

1240
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:56.370
that's a lot of money.

1241
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.383
But he's like,

1242
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.850
how much are going to save over the next 30 years?

1243
00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:00.511
It's worth it.

1244
00:37:00.511 --> 00:37:01.180
You know?

1245
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.140
<v 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1246
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.110
I always think to me it's like it's when you talk about,

1247
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:05.830
you know,

1248
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.720
the embedding both sides of the fence essentially.

1249
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.250
How is that different though from,

1250
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:13.180
a lot of us probably know some pretty darn serious gamblers and a lot of them

1251
00:37:13.181 --> 00:37:16.000
set their sports bets up that way where we are listened to.

1252
00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:16.661
If this happens,

1253
00:37:16.661 --> 00:37:18.190
I win and if that happens I win too.

1254
00:37:18.191 --> 00:37:19.540
And either way I'm covered.

1255
00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.270
And that's definitely how the house handles things.

1256
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.220
So that essentially when we talk about the financial insiders in the economic

1257
00:37:27.221 --> 00:37:28.600
realm and that's the house,

1258
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.000
so the house usually wins.

1259
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.571
Yeah.

1260
00:37:31.571 --> 00:37:33.190
And it's not a fair game.

1261
00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:33.701
I mean,

1262
00:37:33.701 --> 00:37:35.470
I always say I love casinos,

1263
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.460
I love going to Vegas,

1264
00:37:36.461 --> 00:37:37.480
I love doing fights there.

1265
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:38.710
But if you're smart,

1266
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:39.610
you look around,

1267
00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:40.360
you realize,

1268
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.120
how do you think they built this giant buckets,

1269
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:42.610
right?

1270
00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:43.270
That's right.

1271
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.900
They didn't built it on you cracking blackjack and every week you know,

1272
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.360
they,

1273
00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.270
they built it on people losing money here,

1274
00:37:49.271 --> 00:37:49.601
man.

1275
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:52.480
That's what they don't offer you those free trips and the free hotel rooms to

1276
00:37:52.481 --> 00:37:54.350
come gamble because they're losing money on that.

1277
00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.860
There's so slick that if you win a ton of money,

1278
00:37:56.861 --> 00:37:58.720
they'll give you free tickets if you,

1279
00:37:58.721 --> 00:38:00.220
if you bet a ton of money.

1280
00:38:00.221 --> 00:38:00.970
And when a ton of money,

1281
00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:01.960
I'll fly you back.

1282
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:02.711
They're like,

1283
00:38:02.711 --> 00:38:03.640
it's just a matter of time,

1284
00:38:03.641 --> 00:38:04.210
bitch.

1285
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.110
We got you here.

1286
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.220
Just a matter of time.

1287
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:10.090
It's like having a fight with Cain Velasquez or if you don't knock him out,

1288
00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.040
you're going to run out of gas where he does.

1289
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:12.903
There's no doubt.

1290
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.280
It's just a matter of time he's going to get cha.

1291
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.840
If there was 25 round fights,

1292
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:18.770
Cain Velasquez would never fucking Lhuillier.

1293
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.410
It's impossible for him to lose.

1294
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:21.700
He just doesn't have,

1295
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.030
his gas tank is like three times larger than a normal human beings.

1296
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.500
That's the fucking house.

1297
00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.000
The House can't lose bench.

1298
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.290
They got billions,

1299
00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.160
but they do like my friend Dana White is a,

1300
00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.003
uh,

1301
00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.910
he's a crazy degenerative gambling and uh,

1302
00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.130
he

1303
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:36.970
<v 4>gambles millions.</v>

1304
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.300
He's lost a million in the 90s.

1305
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.620
Made as much as 6 million and night.

1306
00:38:39.621 --> 00:38:40.960
It's like you said on the podcast.

1307
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:41.141
Yeah,

1308
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:41.711
he's crazy.

1309
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:42.544
He's crazy.

1310
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.720
But he's a very wealthy man.

1311
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:44.830
He was at,

1312
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:45.220
uh,

1313
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:50.220
the palms and he whacked him hard and they cut his credit line in half.

1314
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.070
And he was like,

1315
00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:52.940
what?

1316
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:53.580
Like,

1317
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.251
what do we do?

1318
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:55.510
We do shows there.

1319
00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:55.870
We do.

1320
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.840
We put on UFC fight nights there and he know he's Catholic.

1321
00:38:58.841 --> 00:38:59.710
A lot of fucking money.

1322
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:00.850
He's getting crazy,

1323
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:01.803
but he won.

1324
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.900
He won a lot and so they,

1325
00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.930
they cut his,

1326
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.410
his,

1327
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.750
his ability to gamble in half.

1328
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.760
So he left the palms.

1329
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.520
So he pulled the UFC fights out and said,

1330
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.030
no.

1331
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.331
Okay,

1332
00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:13.501
we'll go,

1333
00:39:13.501 --> 00:39:14.650
we'll go to the hard rock now.

1334
00:39:14.651 --> 00:39:15.610
What are you guys' retarded?

1335
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.990
Like why would you do that?

1336
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.580
Like you're going to get me eventually.

1337
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:20.520
Don't you know you're going to get me you chicken shits.

1338
00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.720
And it's like they pulled his fucking credit to my exact opposite of what you're

1339
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.560
supposed to do.

1340
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.520
You are in the casinos,

1341
00:39:27.521 --> 00:39:28.360
you want the back,

1342
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:29.650
you don't want them to send them away.

1343
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:33.350
You get numbers crunchers who don't understand human nature and they,

1344
00:39:33.351 --> 00:39:36.400
they just look at it as like a management tool.

1345
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:36.951
<v 3>Well,</v>

1346
00:39:36.951 --> 00:39:39.270
to get back to our risk management division,

1347
00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.600
I think there's a little bit of them going,

1348
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.850
I don't know how he's gaming the system,

1349
00:39:43.851 --> 00:39:45.500
but I can judge from the results.

1350
00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:46.820
He's up to something.

1351
00:39:46.821 --> 00:39:47.331
Cut this guy,

1352
00:39:47.331 --> 00:39:48.200
he's counting cards.

1353
00:39:48.201 --> 00:39:49.034
He's this or that.

1354
00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:49.870
Just get them out.

1355
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:50.391
Just get them out.

1356
00:39:50.391 --> 00:39:51.710
I don't think you can count cards.

1357
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.101
I mean,

1358
00:39:52.101 --> 00:39:52.934
I guess he can,

1359
00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.330
but in Blackjack,

1360
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:58.180
but my point is they don't know what the next scam is and,

1361
00:39:58.181 --> 00:39:58.281
and,

1362
00:39:58.281 --> 00:40:01.880
and they can sometimes deduce that something's going on when those odds and

1363
00:40:01.881 --> 00:40:05.330
averages that they've worked out to the nth degree don't seem to be working with

1364
00:40:05.331 --> 00:40:05.820
you.

1365
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:06.460
<v 4>Right.</v>

1366
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:06.630
Well,

1367
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.111
if you're,

1368
00:40:07.111 --> 00:40:08.610
if you're a smart player,

1369
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.190
that definitely has an impact on blackjack.

1370
00:40:11.191 --> 00:40:12.960
Like blackjack is absolutely a skill game.

1371
00:40:12.961 --> 00:40:13.530
Right?

1372
00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:14.800
And I know they use a gang,

1373
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:16.680
a decks now they don't just use one deck.

1374
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.190
So I bet you can most certainly count those cards.

1375
00:40:20.191 --> 00:40:21.810
But I think you have to be like a super genius.

1376
00:40:21.811 --> 00:40:22.200
Yeah.

1377
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.480
You have to be somebody like way smarter than Dana.

1378
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.360
He ain't calling cards.

1379
00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.650
It's just getting lucky.

1380
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.450
He just knows how to play.

1381
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.081
You know,

1382
00:40:31.081 --> 00:40:33.060
he'll tell you he's not a fucking math genius.

1383
00:40:33.061 --> 00:40:33.420
He's a,

1384
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.590
he's a business genius.

1385
00:40:34.591 --> 00:40:36.120
He knows that a pro fights.

1386
00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:39.810
Maybe that's because he inks Cain Velasquez suite team and puts him right next

1387
00:40:39.811 --> 00:40:39.921
door,

1388
00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:40.754
the other door.

1389
00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.030
And he's like,

1390
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.500
he won,

1391
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:42.840
right?

1392
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.200
Yeah.

1393
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:43.561
No problem.

1394
00:40:43.561 --> 00:40:45.840
100% in favor of gambling.

1395
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.270
I'm 100% in favor of liquor too.

1396
00:40:48.271 --> 00:40:51.570
I'm 100% in favor of all options on the table.

1397
00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.930
It doesn't mean you're going to indulge in all of them or nor does it mean that

1398
00:40:54.931 --> 00:40:55.750
you should.

1399
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:59.040
And a lot of the indulgences that are available right now are very unhealthy.

1400
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:00.330
Like we talked about the gambling one.

1401
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.380
I could go to Vegas,

1402
00:41:01.381 --> 00:41:02.041
you could go to vague.

1403
00:41:02.041 --> 00:41:05.190
We all could any weekend and gamble everything we own.

1404
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.930
I know a dude who,

1405
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.231
uh,

1406
00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.160
worked with a guy,

1407
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.690
he worked with this guy for 10 years,

1408
00:41:09.691 --> 00:41:10.291
for 10 years.

1409
00:41:10.291 --> 00:41:12.240
This guy saved up all his money to go to Vegas.

1410
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.300
And his idea was he's going to go to Vegas and gamble and you know,

1411
00:41:15.301 --> 00:41:17.010
and when he felt like that was his destiny,

1412
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.090
so you saved up,

1413
00:41:18.091 --> 00:41:18.301
you know,

1414
00:41:18.301 --> 00:41:20.340
x amount of thousands of dollars for 10 years.

1415
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.770
Lost it in the first 24 hours in Vegas,

1416
00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.280
came back home to Oklahoma and was just freaked out.

1417
00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.430
Just literally like shell shocked.

1418
00:41:28.431 --> 00:41:31.110
Like he had been attacked and raped by a hundred ghosts.

1419
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:31.790
You know,

1420
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:33.060
just like had this look on his face.

1421
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.780
He would never recover from this port prick.

1422
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.150
That's natural selection.

1423
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:40.370
He's going to go follow a preacher in Munster now.

1424
00:41:40.371 --> 00:41:41.204
I mean,

1425
00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:44.840
I firmly believe that you should know that that's possible.

1426
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.250
I think we all should know

1427
00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:46.851
<v 3>big sign,</v>

1428
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:47.910
a big sign on the door.

1429
00:41:47.911 --> 00:41:51.390
You can lose ever walk in these doors and you can lose everything.

1430
00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:52.210
Welcome.

1431
00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:52.960
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1432
00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.580
But I think that exists for everything.

1433
00:41:54.581 --> 00:41:54.761
I mean,

1434
00:41:54.761 --> 00:41:58.270
I think ultimately we have to learn from all these horrible examples that we see

1435
00:41:58.271 --> 00:41:59.380
on TV and in the news,

1436
00:41:59.381 --> 00:42:01.540
but every time some guy,

1437
00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:02.081
you know,

1438
00:42:02.081 --> 00:42:04.960
gets in a street fight and beat some guy to death and they're pulling them away

1439
00:42:04.961 --> 00:42:06.390
and we should all learn from that.

1440
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.641
You know,

1441
00:42:06.641 --> 00:42:07.750
we should all learn from that and go,

1442
00:42:07.751 --> 00:42:07.961
hey,

1443
00:42:07.961 --> 00:42:08.381
you know what?

1444
00:42:08.381 --> 00:42:11.140
The human body is a lot more fragile than we like to pretend it is.

1445
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.810
Who's that boxer that just fell into a coma?

1446
00:42:13.811 --> 00:42:14.644
Did you hear about that?

1447
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.950
Fighting on Hbo the other night?

1448
00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:18.911
Yeah.

1449
00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:19.744
He uh,

1450
00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:23.620
they put him in a coma and brain swelling.

1451
00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:24.130
Yeah.

1452
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.680
He had some swelling and then when they put him in a coma,

1453
00:42:26.681 --> 00:42:27.610
he had a stroke.

1454
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:28.630
His name is,

1455
00:42:28.631 --> 00:42:28.860
uh,

1456
00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.740
it's really sad.

1457
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.360
I just heard him interviewed.

1458
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:31.631
Yeah.

1459
00:42:31.631 --> 00:42:32.500
Mega Med.

1460
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:33.870
Dual,

1461
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.320
a small,

1462
00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:36.270
uh,

1463
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.140
to Abdu Salad all fighting.

1464
00:42:38.141 --> 00:42:38.471
I just,

1465
00:42:38.471 --> 00:42:40.360
I heard a pregame Eric Perez,

1466
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:41.020
Mike pressed,

1467
00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:41.470
excuse me,

1468
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:42.640
and Mike presents this up.

1469
00:42:42.641 --> 00:42:43.840
Pat asked Cuban boxer,

1470
00:42:43.841 --> 00:42:46.390
it was a great fight and that guy is,

1471
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.400
I mean,

1472
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.200
this is a perfect example of a guy being too tough for his own good.

1473
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.890
Macramed took a tremendous amount of punishment in that fight,

1474
00:42:53.891 --> 00:42:54.940
but kept trying.

1475
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.110
He just kept trying.

1476
00:42:56.111 --> 00:42:57.310
He didn't make it through the bout.

1477
00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.960
He made it through the bout,

1478
00:42:59.140 --> 00:42:59.711
I think.

1479
00:42:59.711 --> 00:43:00.250
Um,

1480
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.420
it was a decision,

1481
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.610
I believe it was a 10 round decision.

1482
00:43:03.611 --> 00:43:04.420
Yeah.

1483
00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:05.530
And he took a,

1484
00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:06.051
just a,

1485
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:07.870
a furious amount of damage in that fight.

1486
00:43:07.871 --> 00:43:12.871
And afterwards they found out that he had broke his hand and broke his nose and

1487
00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.170
it was taken to the hospital where a small blood clot was discovered on his

1488
00:43:17.171 --> 00:43:18.004
brain.

1489
00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:18.611
And,

1490
00:43:18.611 --> 00:43:18.821
uh,

1491
00:43:18.821 --> 00:43:19.261
so they,

1492
00:43:19.261 --> 00:43:23.530
they induced him in a medically induced coma and then while he was in the coma,

1493
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.550
he had a stroke.

1494
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:25.631
So it's,

1495
00:43:25.631 --> 00:43:26.280
uh,

1496
00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:26.750
it's,

1497
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:27.820
it's pretty bad.

1498
00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:29.640
<v 3>That's what's made boxing hard for me.</v>

1499
00:43:29.641 --> 00:43:30.070
I mean I'm,

1500
00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.070
I've always been a huge boxing fan and it's just,

1501
00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:33.041
it's football.

1502
00:43:33.041 --> 00:43:34.530
It's getting a little like this where you start to,

1503
00:43:34.531 --> 00:43:35.700
you start to wince,

1504
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.211
you know,

1505
00:43:36.211 --> 00:43:36.720
you can't,

1506
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.230
I never,

1507
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.801
it's funny,

1508
00:43:37.801 --> 00:43:38.760
I know this is stupid to say,

1509
00:43:38.761 --> 00:43:40.680
but I would watch boxing and I never,

1510
00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:42.930
I never connected it with pain.

1511
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:43.411
You know,

1512
00:43:43.411 --> 00:43:46.580
you're watching tactics and you're watching different strategies working with

1513
00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.660
you and you're watching foot movement and head movement.

1514
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.360
And it never even occurred to me that you're watching,

1515
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:51.931
you know,

1516
00:43:51.931 --> 00:43:54.510
the pain and the suffering and then someone dies and you go,

1517
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.201
okay,

1518
00:43:55.201 --> 00:43:56.970
how much enjoyment did I get out of this sport?

1519
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:58.260
And I still watch it.

1520
00:43:58.261 --> 00:44:00.810
But this is the kind of thing that just reminds you of,

1521
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:01.980
of what's going on in there.

1522
00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:06.460
<v 4>Well for me it has an even deeper connection because I've competed,</v>

1523
00:44:06.461 --> 00:44:09.520
cause I've fought a few kickboxing bouts and probably,

1524
00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.010
I don't know how many taekwondo bouts,

1525
00:44:12.011 --> 00:44:14.830
but it was over a period of like six,

1526
00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.120
six or seven years.

1527
00:44:16.121 --> 00:44:20.020
It was all I did with my life and was mine a hundred percent waking life.

1528
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:25.240
So I competed a lot in full contact tournament's and I got away with it.

1529
00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.500
I got lucky,

1530
00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.260
but I've seen some guys get really hurt.

1531
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:29.740
I see.

1532
00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.100
I've seen some guys get kicked the head where

1533
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.080
<v 0>they were just really never the same person again.</v>

1534
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.580
<v 3>Doesn't this go to what you were saying though about you know,</v>

1535
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.750
you kind of have a right,

1536
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:38.350
it's like,

1537
00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:38.560
yeah,

1538
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.620
talk to these boxers who are,

1539
00:44:39.621 --> 00:44:40.454
like you said,

1540
00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.440
every day they're training,

1541
00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:45.010
you're going to tell this person they can't do that as long as they know the

1542
00:44:45.011 --> 00:44:45.430
risks.

1543
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:46.370
<v 0>To this day.</v>

1544
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.660
That was one of the most important things I ever did as far as developing me as

1545
00:44:50.661 --> 00:44:52.610
a human being because it was terrifying.

1546
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.360
It was terrifying and I got really good at it and I got really good at

1547
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:57.201
competing.

1548
00:44:57.201 --> 00:45:02.201
In a really dangerous high high risk quick happening situation like striking,

1549
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.820
especially like the weight class that was false kickboxing at one 60 and these

1550
00:45:10.821 --> 00:45:11.720
light guys,

1551
00:45:11.721 --> 00:45:13.250
everyone moves really fast,

1552
00:45:13.251 --> 00:45:15.470
they all hit hard is a scary weight class,

1553
00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.590
lot of knockouts and you're,

1554
00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.120
when you're competing in that sort of an environment,

1555
00:45:20.121 --> 00:45:22.310
your training and that sort of environment on a regular basis,

1556
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:27.170
regular shit just doesn't scare you the same way regular people and they flare

1557
00:45:27.171 --> 00:45:30.080
up and yell or someone gets do she with you.

1558
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:34.220
It doesn't have this overwhelming sense of fear that it has on a lot of people

1559
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.180
and I've seen people in confrontations where a guy and another guy were in a

1560
00:45:38.181 --> 00:45:43.181
confrontation and something happens mostly because one guy like loses his

1561
00:45:44.151 --> 00:45:45.770
ability to stay calm.

1562
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:50.990
Like he's so confused and nervous that he can't react properly.

1563
00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:51.950
When I see that,

1564
00:45:51.951 --> 00:45:56.300
I see that's a human with a deficit in the development of their character.

1565
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.990
I don't think he,

1566
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:58.160
unless you have been there,

1567
00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.900
I don't think that physical violence is something that you're just born and

1568
00:46:01.901 --> 00:46:02.830
knowing how to deal with,

1569
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:03.370
you know,

1570
00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:03.681
he's like,

1571
00:46:03.681 --> 00:46:07.190
either you are used to it cause you got beat up at dawn as a kid or you're used

1572
00:46:07.191 --> 00:46:10.100
to it cause you fought a lot or you're used to it because of something,

1573
00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:11.150
but you're not gonna,

1574
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.560
you know the first time is that pence,

1575
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:13.394
he's fucking scary.

1576
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:16.710
That's why the scariest kids to fight her kids who've got beat by their dad.

1577
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:17.300
Yeah,

1578
00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:17.960
exactly.

1579
00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.310
Those kids though,

1580
00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:23.690
I remember competing against kids that I knew had like really violent

1581
00:46:23.691 --> 00:46:24.860
relationships with their fathers.

1582
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.810
Those kids were like really used to getting hit.

1583
00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.190
Yup.

1584
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:28.310
This is a different thing.

1585
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.791
Like,

1586
00:46:28.791 --> 00:46:29.071
and they,

1587
00:46:29.071 --> 00:46:29.301
they,

1588
00:46:29.301 --> 00:46:32.030
it was a part of normal everyday life getting smacked around.

1589
00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:32.971
<v 3>Well,</v>

1590
00:46:32.971 --> 00:46:33.640
I looked up,

1591
00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:33.910
you know,

1592
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:34.390
though,

1593
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.850
and this gets me back to not thinking about the pain in boxing.

1594
00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:37.811
I remember,

1595
00:46:37.811 --> 00:46:38.230
um,

1596
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.570
there was a Ryan O'Neal,

1597
00:46:40.571 --> 00:46:41.081
I think it was,

1598
00:46:41.081 --> 00:46:41.860
he was doing the,

1599
00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.020
the remake of the champ movie and,

1600
00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.570
and they had on on site one of these,

1601
00:46:46.571 --> 00:46:46.841
uh,

1602
00:46:46.841 --> 00:46:47.020
uh,

1603
00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.330
one of these actual boxers who was going to kind of,

1604
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:49.690
you know,

1605
00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:51.880
teach him a little bit about how to do this or that.

1606
00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:52.630
And he says,

1607
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:53.261
he tells the story,

1608
00:46:53.261 --> 00:46:53.501
he says,

1609
00:46:53.501 --> 00:46:54.110
at one point,

1610
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:54.580
he goes,

1611
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.413
the boxer who was,

1612
00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:56.440
who was working with him said,

1613
00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.700
I want you to hit me.

1614
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:58.241
And he said,

1615
00:46:58.241 --> 00:46:58.451
okay,

1616
00:46:58.451 --> 00:46:59.051
I'm not going to hit you.

1617
00:46:59.051 --> 00:46:59.261
And you know,

1618
00:46:59.261 --> 00:47:00.250
long time hit me,

1619
00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:00.731
you got to hit me.

1620
00:47:00.731 --> 00:47:01.020
So,

1621
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:01.841
so we finally hits him.

1622
00:47:01.841 --> 00:47:02.230
He goes,

1623
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.441
no,

1624
00:47:02.441 --> 00:47:02.801
I mean,

1625
00:47:02.801 --> 00:47:03.880
really hit me,

1626
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.180
you know,

1627
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:04.751
and he says,

1628
00:47:04.751 --> 00:47:07.090
I squared up and I hit him as hard as I could.

1629
00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:07.540
He goes,

1630
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:07.871
no,

1631
00:47:07.871 --> 00:47:08.171
I mean,

1632
00:47:08.171 --> 00:47:09.160
really hit me.

1633
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:09.600
And,

1634
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.290
and you start to realize that guys who take lots of punches all the time in

1635
00:47:14.291 --> 00:47:16.150
training and everything that,

1636
00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:17.230
that there you,

1637
00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.050
it doesn't do to them what it would do to you.

1638
00:47:20.051 --> 00:47:20.190
And,

1639
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.291
well,

1640
00:47:20.291 --> 00:47:20.740
not you,

1641
00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:21.573
me,

1642
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.911
but,

1643
00:47:21.911 --> 00:47:22.091
but,

1644
00:47:22.091 --> 00:47:25.630
but to them the punches can do just as much damage to their brain,

1645
00:47:25.631 --> 00:47:28.270
but in terms of shaking them or hurting them,

1646
00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.980
it's not the thing when you're used to

1647
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.340
<v 4>it.</v>

1648
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:30.910
Well,

1649
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:31.451
the one,

1650
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:33.760
one of the big things is the shock of being hit.

1651
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.400
The shock of being hit is how a lot of people,

1652
00:47:36.401 --> 00:47:41.230
they literally go into a freeze mode and they can't move correctly and they get

1653
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:42.064
knocked out.

1654
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.110
Like their body shuts off and it's,

1655
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:47.140
it's being overwhelmed by the moment,

1656
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:47.451
by the,

1657
00:47:47.451 --> 00:47:51.460
the fact that you're actually engaged in arm and I mean hand to hand combat with

1658
00:47:51.461 --> 00:47:52.150
somebody.

1659
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:53.680
That's a weird feeling.

1660
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.000
I've seen it happen.

1661
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.730
I've seen guys fall apart like in street fights and stuff.

1662
00:47:57.731 --> 00:47:58.150
I've seen,

1663
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:01.270
I've seen street fights that happened just because the guy was scared.

1664
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.151
You know that,

1665
00:48:02.151 --> 00:48:03.700
that that's a possibility too.

1666
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.571
That gets done.

1667
00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:05.640
The more scared you are,

1668
00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.860
the more you called for it because then you're encouraging the other because he

1669
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:09.694
found out scared.

1670
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:12.580
It's like damn makes the other person and sink twice.

1671
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:13.200
He's like,

1672
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.470
I really want to get into with this.

1673
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:16.810
Crazy motherfucker was not scared of getting hurt.

1674
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:19.180
It also doesn't progress the correct way.

1675
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:19.610
You know,

1676
00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:20.310
the,

1677
00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:21.070
the,

1678
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.740
the way that it like the natural way in a,

1679
00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:26.650
in a idiots mind is I yell at you,

1680
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.880
you either back down and get scared and I kick your ass or you yell back at me

1681
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.990
and we fucking puffed chests until somebody fucks up and makes the wrong move.

1682
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.580
But if the guy backs down,

1683
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.210
you know that you can press forward instinct,

1684
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:42.760
the natural instinct of the bullies to press forward.

1685
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:43.240
Yup.

1686
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.920
It's almost unavoidable.

1687
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.533
I think that's,

1688
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:51.310
people do themselves a huge disservice by not understanding at least some form

1689
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:52.210
of martial arts,

1690
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:54.100
at least having some experience in it.

1691
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:54.640
You know,

1692
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.361
hopefully sell that.

1693
00:48:55.361 --> 00:48:56.194
We won't need it though.

1694
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.140
That book that we are

1695
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.620
<v 5>talking about right before we come on with [inaudible] phone,</v>

1696
00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.510
the um,

1697
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:02.630
the Persian expedition,

1698
00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:07.340
one of his speeches when they already is 10,000 Greek guys like way behind enemy

1699
00:49:07.341 --> 00:49:08.840
lines in Persian territory.

1700
00:49:08.841 --> 00:49:10.280
They have to make their way back home.

1701
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:11.240
It looks desperate.

1702
00:49:11.241 --> 00:49:11.901
They have no chance.

1703
00:49:11.901 --> 00:49:16.901
And one of he needs sort of in these like speech that he's trying to give them

1704
00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:18.400
to rally them up.

1705
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:19.070
Uh,

1706
00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:23.420
one of the things he says is exactly what you are saying about the psychologies.

1707
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:25.400
If you guys are scared now,

1708
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.930
Yara,

1709
00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:26.660
we'll going to die.

1710
00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:27.530
They're just no way.

1711
00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.970
Because if you are afraid of dying,

1712
00:49:28.971 --> 00:49:30.320
that's exactly what's going to happen.

1713
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:33.470
If you guys are willing to die because you just,

1714
00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:36.770
you know that your odds are desperate but you're willing to just go for it

1715
00:49:36.771 --> 00:49:37.461
because a,

1716
00:49:37.461 --> 00:49:38.930
you don't have any other chance be,

1717
00:49:38.931 --> 00:49:40.160
you'll go for it with honor.

1718
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:45.350
The odds are not all you are going to behave honorably by your actually your

1719
00:49:45.351 --> 00:49:47.700
chances of surviving improved dramatic critically.

1720
00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.850
<v 4>That makes sense though.</v>

1721
00:49:49.851 --> 00:49:53.630
The universe favors bravery doesn't want weak bitches out there spreading their

1722
00:49:53.631 --> 00:49:54.464
seeds.

1723
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:57.283
Sorry.

1724
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:58.190
Sorry.

1725
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:59.060
That's a fact.

1726
00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.613
It's a fact.

1727
00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:01.663
You know,

1728
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:06.800
there's a weird trend today to like almost like encourage weakness.

1729
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.000
You know,

1730
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.690
I think encouraging kindness is always very important,

1731
00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.230
but it gets really confused with encouraging weakness.

1732
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.040
There's,

1733
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.520
there's a lot of like bitch ass men out there that it would help them.

1734
00:50:20.521 --> 00:50:21.440
It would benefit them.

1735
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:23.330
Take a fucking boot clamp class,

1736
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.871
you know,

1737
00:50:23.871 --> 00:50:27.020
just to do something with your body other than sitting.

1738
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.010
That's shit

1739
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.690
<v 5>drive me insane because you know,</v>

1740
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:34.370
the fact that we have moved beyond the stupid stereotype of the tough macho man

1741
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:36.050
and the woman who stay back,

1742
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.460
that's nice.

1743
00:50:37.461 --> 00:50:42.461
But at the same time solve then Eskom and the price of people giving up the good

1744
00:50:42.711 --> 00:50:43.820
sides of the stereotype.

1745
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:44.100
You know,

1746
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.510
if the stereotype of the man was you are strong and tough,

1747
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:48.201
but you're also,

1748
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:48.381
you know,

1749
00:50:48.381 --> 00:50:51.770
emotionally deficient and not very sensitive radar.

1750
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:53.600
And I'm working on the kindness aspect.

1751
00:50:53.601 --> 00:50:54.434
As you've noted.

1752
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:55.670
The idea has been,

1753
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:57.350
well then strength is bad.

1754
00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:58.400
Who should get rid of that?

1755
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:59.210
Yeah,

1756
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.790
that's,

1757
00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:00.450
that's really good.

1758
00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:00.670
It's

1759
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:01.491
<v 4>so stupid.</v>

1760
00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:02.270
It's not fun.

1761
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:04.040
People associate prejudice.

1762
00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:04.460
Lee,

1763
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.480
anything male,

1764
00:51:05.481 --> 00:51:06.440
masculine,

1765
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:11.470
anything unapologetically masculine with suppression of the feminine,

1766
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:12.980
with suppression,

1767
00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:17.981
like with antifeminist ideas like I have on more than one occasion gotten into

1768
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:20.054
it with uh,

1769
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.710
people that call themselves feminists.

1770
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:26.030
And their idea was that something that I had said like doesn't promote

1771
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.420
femininity or does it or is an anti feminine.

1772
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.640
This is the furthest couldn't be true.

1773
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:33.560
I just expect a balance.

1774
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:33.840
Yeah.

1775
00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.810
Expect cycle to just be people.

1776
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:36.321
Exactly.

1777
00:51:36.321 --> 00:51:36.471
You know,

1778
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:37.070
I don't,

1779
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:40.960
when you start looking at feminist or masculinist or you know,

1780
00:51:40.961 --> 00:51:41.780
like I don't,

1781
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.140
I don't,

1782
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.340
that doesn't mean shit to me.

1783
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:46.520
What means shit to me is leave me alone.

1784
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.810
I'll leave you alone.

1785
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.850
I'll give you the right to do anything you want to do.

1786
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.940
But you can't say I'm an ape cause I like working out.

1787
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:53.893
Okay.

1788
00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.800
You can't say I'm an asshole because I've got some fucking guns.

1789
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:58.551
All right.

1790
00:51:58.551 --> 00:51:59.750
That's nonsense.

1791
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.690
If you're a man and you,

1792
00:52:01.691 --> 00:52:04.160
you don't work out because it's not enjoyable for you.

1793
00:52:04.161 --> 00:52:05.450
I totally understand.

1794
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:10.310
But the idea that someone who does or someone who does participate in manly type

1795
00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:12.860
shit is an asshole because of that.

1796
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:13.550
You're like,

1797
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:13.730
I,

1798
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.470
I watched this one thing,

1799
00:52:15.471 --> 00:52:19.280
it was just horrible piece that someone wrote about the,

1800
00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:19.431
uh,

1801
00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:21.380
the rape in Ohio with those,

1802
00:52:21.381 --> 00:52:21.980
uh,

1803
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.180
those high school kids,

1804
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.890
one of the most disgusting aspects of male culture.

1805
00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:28.370
Yup.

1806
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:33.220
This ability to get someone fucked up and do that to them and treat them as a

1807
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.220
sub human.

1808
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.370
I mean it is without a doubt one of the scariest,

1809
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.320
darkest aspects of the,

1810
00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.630
of men that they can do that.

1811
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:45.080
But in this article they were talking about how,

1812
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:46.400
let's just face the facts,

1813
00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.980
all high school athletes are assholes.

1814
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:50.181
Yeah.

1815
00:52:50.181 --> 00:52:52.220
That's the logical conclusion.

1816
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:52.971
The flow from that.

1817
00:52:52.971 --> 00:52:56.120
It's like what it hurt my head was I was a blog,

1818
00:52:56.121 --> 00:52:57.380
it was a blog and somebody wrote,

1819
00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.573
but it was just,

1820
00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.300
I was like,

1821
00:52:59.300 --> 00:52:59.760
oh come.

1822
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.400
I mean it was a very progressive,

1823
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:04.370
very left wing blog that I visit sometimes.

1824
00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:05.420
And the,

1825
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.751
you know,

1826
00:53:05.751 --> 00:53:10.751
they were actually saying that supporting the ideas of competition actually

1827
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:14.210
encourages people to treat people as subhuman.

1828
00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:15.500
And that's an old,

1829
00:53:15.501 --> 00:53:15.980
old,

1830
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:16.540
uh,

1831
00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:17.070
idea.

1832
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:17.960
When you think about that.

1833
00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:19.043
Um,

1834
00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:19.790
listen,

1835
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:20.390
I think we,

1836
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:21.590
we exist in a,

1837
00:53:21.591 --> 00:53:25.890
in a realm where it's going to be competitive no matter what you do.

1838
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.600
<v 3>So I think to pretend we're going to deemphasize these things doesn't do anybody</v>

1839
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:30.931
any,

1840
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:31.920
any good down the road.

1841
00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:34.140
Cause then once you drop them in life,

1842
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:35.190
they're not prepared.

1843
00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:35.451
Well I,

1844
00:53:35.451 --> 00:53:37.290
it is a little bit like what you were saying about the,

1845
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:38.190
about the fighting but,

1846
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:39.690
but like with my kids,

1847
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:40.980
you don't,

1848
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.330
you don't want to over,

1849
00:53:42.331 --> 00:53:44.340
you don't want to crush anybody early on.

1850
00:53:44.341 --> 00:53:47.100
You want to nurture them so that they can handle the competition.

1851
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.920
But if you don't teach them about competition there,

1852
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:51.390
you're not preparing them for life.

1853
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.990
And that's when you're going to release them into a world where,

1854
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:57.990
I mean if those people really don't want to competitive world,

1855
00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:03.210
think about how much you would have to do to turn off the competitive world.

1856
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.880
How much intrusion that would have to be on all of our lives.

1857
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:07.710
There goes your stock market right away,

1858
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:07.981
right?

1859
00:54:07.981 --> 00:54:12.750
I mean the economy isn't that a little like what some of the really hardcore

1860
00:54:12.751 --> 00:54:15.000
communist ideas we're about where we are.

1861
00:54:15.001 --> 00:54:16.710
Different people have different capabilities.

1862
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:20.910
So forcing them to compete as inherently unequal because you and I are born

1863
00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:21.211
different,

1864
00:54:21.211 --> 00:54:23.730
so we'll compensate for that and blend it out.

1865
00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.260
Sounds great in theory.

1866
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.010
But the amount of work it takes to recreate a whole system,

1867
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:30.750
you know where you don't have competition,

1868
00:54:30.751 --> 00:54:32.280
you don't have differences is

1869
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.810
<v 5>worse than the disease.</v>

1870
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:34.250
Yeah.

1871
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.520
Yeah.

1872
00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:38.130
Even quizzy are treating people like they are sick as opposed to treating

1873
00:54:38.131 --> 00:54:40.530
somebody like you are going to teach everyone.

1874
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.071
Man,

1875
00:54:41.071 --> 00:54:42.090
woman doesn't matter.

1876
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:43.770
Gender doesn't come into place.

1877
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.300
Everybody should be strong.

1878
00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.800
Everybody should be kind.

1879
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.000
Everybody should have both of the qualities that are normally attributed to only

1880
00:54:51.001 --> 00:54:52.350
one gender or the other.

1881
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:53.730
They are human qualities.

1882
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:54.880
There are good qualities there.

1883
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.730
What you need to be a complete human being,

1884
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:57.930
you in core edge,

1885
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.150
that stuff and you make it a must complete human being,

1886
00:55:00.151 --> 00:55:01.170
the creme possibility,

1887
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.230
and they will deal with whatever shape life throws at them,

1888
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:05.550
competitive or otherwise,

1889
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:08.280
because they're always going to be challenges and as he safe,

1890
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:09.143
there are no,

1891
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:12.510
but a partition for the challenges they are are going to come your way,

1892
00:55:12.511 --> 00:55:13.620
whether you like it or not.

1893
00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.390
No matter how safe you make the word,

1894
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:17.260
then you're dead meat already.

1895
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.750
You know?

1896
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:20.910
Then you're going to get squashed the first time that universe goes booyah too.

1897
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:23.060
You're going to fit a coyote and crash.

1898
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:23.671
For me,

1899
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:28.671
the big question in a competitively based system is not the competition part and

1900
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:30.090
not the winning part.

1901
00:55:30.091 --> 00:55:31.850
It's what do you do with the people who

1902
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:33.670
<v 3>come out on the short end of the stick?</v>

1903
00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:36.370
Because I think in a sink or swim system,

1904
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.940
you're going to find that the people who are sinking are going to decide that

1905
00:55:39.941 --> 00:55:44.260
the system socks and we're going to change it because there's too many losers.

1906
00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:47.810
I've always said that one of the things that you do when you know,

1907
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.060
I said in recent show that you know poverty is going to come back to bite us all

1908
00:55:52.061 --> 00:55:53.980
in the ass one day if we don't do something about it.

1909
00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:55.960
Not because you should care about poor people,

1910
00:55:55.961 --> 00:55:57.610
but because eventually if they're hurting enough,

1911
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:59.170
they will make you care about them.

1912
00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.010
They will,

1913
00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:01.330
they will turn the system around.

1914
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:03.220
I mean you can outcompete them all you want,

1915
00:56:03.221 --> 00:56:05.650
but they'll come and burn down your nice house at a certain point.

1916
00:56:05.651 --> 00:56:06.100
So,

1917
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:06.851
so to me,

1918
00:56:06.851 --> 00:56:08.500
when you talk about a competitive system,

1919
00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.150
the winters aren't the issue.

1920
00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:13.360
It's what you do with the people cause you're going to have some losers in a

1921
00:56:13.361 --> 00:56:14.194
competitive system.

1922
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:16.240
How do you mitigate the downsides of that?

1923
00:56:16.241 --> 00:56:17.000
And that's what I always try.

1924
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.090
It's trying to

1925
00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:17.690
<v 5>think about,</v>

1926
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:18.770
that's a very good point.

1927
00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.251
That's a very,

1928
00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:20.084
very good point.

1929
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.670
You're,

1930
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.820
you're always going to have good and bad in the,

1931
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:24.520
you're always going to have conflict.

1932
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.610
<v 4>You're always going to in in the,</v>

1933
00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:30.620
the ability to recognize that and deal with whatever comes in front of you is

1934
00:56:31.181 --> 00:56:32.014
very important.

1935
00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:32.561
<v 3>Well,</v>

1936
00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:33.011
like you said,

1937
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:36.010
you're going to have kids who get raised by parents who beat the hell out of

1938
00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:38.440
them and who don't raise them the right way and who don't give him those

1939
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:39.041
qualities,

1940
00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:39.491
Daniella,

1941
00:56:39.491 --> 00:56:40.360
that you were talking about,

1942
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.640
and then you're going to unleash those people in the world and say,

1943
00:56:42.641 --> 00:56:45.850
go compete with this guy who went to Harvard and had a great education and it

1944
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:46.840
was born with a lot of money.

1945
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.880
The world's had unequal place.

1946
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.590
You can't fix that,

1947
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.480
but you can build that into your thinking.

1948
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:53.380
I think it's also,

1949
00:56:53.381 --> 00:56:53.930
there's such a

1950
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:58.310
<v 4>broad spectrum of human beings and what the human being,</v>

1951
00:56:58.311 --> 00:56:59.930
where they fit into society.

1952
00:56:59.931 --> 00:57:00.680
Where there places,

1953
00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.550
like I have a lot of friends that have like zero willpower but they make amazing

1954
00:57:04.551 --> 00:57:05.600
standup Comedians,

1955
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:06.201
you know,

1956
00:57:06.201 --> 00:57:08.030
and that's where they might go together.

1957
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:09.680
They're very well mine.

1958
00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:13.040
Like Joey Diaz is my favorite example and Joey has willpower.

1959
00:57:13.041 --> 00:57:13.731
He gets up in the morning,

1960
00:57:13.731 --> 00:57:14.370
everything I price,

1961
00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:14.630
you know,

1962
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:15.860
300 and whatever pounds.

1963
00:57:15.861 --> 00:57:16.730
He doesn't give a fuck.

1964
00:57:16.731 --> 00:57:17.011
And he's,

1965
00:57:17.011 --> 00:57:17.601
he's an animal,

1966
00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:18.434
he's just savage.

1967
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:20.870
But he's also the funniest human being I've ever met in my life.

1968
00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.210
It's like you can't,

1969
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:28.490
you can't make a Joey Diaz if you get some guy who's doing fucking sit ups every

1970
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.491
morning,

1971
00:57:28.491 --> 00:57:31.790
a thousand sit ups and Chin ups and jogging around the block and only eating

1972
00:57:31.791 --> 00:57:32.390
Kale,

1973
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:33.620
it's not going to be that guy.

1974
00:57:33.621 --> 00:57:34.970
You need a guy went to jail,

1975
00:57:34.971 --> 00:57:35.900
did a lot of coke,

1976
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.233
you know,

1977
00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:38.570
kidnapped the guy.

1978
00:57:38.571 --> 00:57:39.470
You need all that,

1979
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:39.701
you know,

1980
00:57:39.701 --> 00:57:42.680
like in order to get a guy who's that wild and crazy and funny.

1981
00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:47.980
And I feel like the real problem that we have in raising children is all they

1982
00:57:49.521 --> 00:57:53.890
teach in school is to try to filter you into standard position in,

1983
00:57:53.891 --> 00:57:54.290
in,

1984
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:54.890
in the,

1985
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:56.780
in the economy standard job.

1986
00:57:57.170 --> 00:58:00.260
Whether it's the filter you towards a career and one,

1987
00:58:00.261 --> 00:58:02.300
one or more very definable things,

1988
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:02.690
right?

1989
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:05.840
There's a lot of people out there with talents that never get nurtured.

1990
00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.020
They just can't figure out their way in that system because it's

1991
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:10.730
<v 5>taught them so small.</v>

1992
00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:14.010
Such a small chunk of the spectrum is taught well.

1993
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:14.530
It goes cool,

1994
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:15.920
are designed to make you average.

1995
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.450
That's what schools are about,

1996
00:58:17.451 --> 00:58:21.050
which if you are a considerably below average because of your opportunities in

1997
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:21.470
life,

1998
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:22.010
great.

1999
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:23.030
That's a step up.

2000
00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:27.080
But if you are not and that goes for the other 50% of humanity,

2001
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:30.620
Dan is just designed to make it not nurture your talents,

2002
00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:35.580
not do all the sinks and try to make you fit in the little box and [inaudible]

2003
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:38.810
of the realities and that now because the people who create schools are evil and

2004
00:58:38.811 --> 00:58:40.250
they just want to faculty or life,

2005
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:43.280
he's because they need to go with Samsung.

2006
00:58:43.281 --> 00:58:46.520
That knowledge as something that can be objectively tested.

2007
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.721
What is that?

2008
00:58:47.721 --> 00:58:49.100
You can objectively test.

2009
00:58:49.101 --> 00:58:50.630
Can you test some body's wisdom?

2010
00:58:50.631 --> 00:58:51.141
I was married,

2011
00:58:51.141 --> 00:58:51.561
Arl,

2012
00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:52.640
cool of human being.

2013
00:58:52.641 --> 00:58:54.590
They are objectively not really.

2014
00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.420
What you can do is you can test a well,

2015
00:58:56.421 --> 00:58:58.040
they speak back in formation at you,

2016
00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.620
which is a skill in itself that it's better than not knowing.

2017
00:59:01.621 --> 00:59:03.140
Now you need to have the discipline.

2018
00:59:03.141 --> 00:59:04.190
You need to know some things.

2019
00:59:04.191 --> 00:59:04.671
It's cool.

2020
00:59:04.671 --> 00:59:05.360
It makes you,

2021
00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.950
it gives you those average qualities,

2022
00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.830
but it says nothing about what you're going to do with them.

2023
00:59:09.831 --> 00:59:11.000
Whether you're going to be brilliant,

2024
00:59:11.001 --> 00:59:13.610
whether you're going to be able to use these ideas in an amazing way.

2025
00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:19.030
And the realities that gets to most people in charge of schools feel that's too

2026
00:59:19.821 --> 00:59:20.654
subjective.

2027
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.340
When start talking about wisdom.

2028
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:22.701
<v 0>Ah,</v>

2029
00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:26.060
what the fuck is waste on me is your wisdom is not my definition.

2030
00:59:26.061 --> 00:59:28.910
So we can really test it where we can test these.

2031
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:30.740
And so you'll go back to the,

2032
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:33.140
they don't want to get sued by the people who don't do well.

2033
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:35.960
Like if I come into class and I say I'll give you an a cause,

2034
00:59:35.961 --> 00:59:39.440
you're really fucking smart and I can see it now you are really are not that

2035
00:59:39.441 --> 00:59:39.681
good.

2036
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:40.191
So sorry.

2037
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:42.680
You got to see the person who got to see is going to be a fuck you.

2038
00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:43.251
You know why?

2039
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:44.001
Why are you giving me,

2040
00:59:44.001 --> 00:59:44.160
Oh,

2041
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.680
show me why you know where he is in the exactly that I deserve this.

2042
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:54.160
And part of the game is the stuff that you can prove in that fashion is not the

2043
00:59:54.501 --> 00:59:57.440
kind of knowledge to make a complete human being is the kind of annoy

2044
00:59:57.441 --> 00:59:58.940
application of that knowledge.

2045
00:59:58.941 --> 01:00:03.800
In a capitalist society is what we tried to find as proof that you've actually

2046
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:05.320
got some intelligence buys x,

2047
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:06.830
y people who,

2048
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.050
you know,

2049
01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:08.540
you might not even think that that smart,

2050
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:11.360
but if they're very successful financially and go,

2051
01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:11.601
well,

2052
01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:12.440
he's smart at that.

2053
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:12.741
Right?

2054
01:00:12.741 --> 01:00:13.130
You know,

2055
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.850
it's,

2056
01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:18.800
<v 3>there's that thing [inaudible] I think what you're trying to do theoretically in</v>

2057
01:00:18.801 --> 01:00:22.820
an education system is to prepare people to succeed in life.

2058
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:28.040
And the problem that I think the education system has is that it's stuck in a

2059
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:32.150
design for an era where succeeding in life is very different than succeeding in

2060
01:00:32.151 --> 01:00:33.020
life today.

2061
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.870
You're not going to go onto the factory assembly line.

2062
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:37.220
You're not going to do those kinds of things.

2063
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:41.510
But the way our system has evolved is to create people who can succeed at that.

2064
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.441
The problem is,

2065
01:00:42.441 --> 01:00:46.610
is that what we have now is a creativity based economy that we're moving towards

2066
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.740
and teaching creativity.

2067
01:00:48.741 --> 01:00:49.670
One would be,

2068
01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:54.320
it's tremendously hard and we haven't worked to create that on a mass system

2069
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:55.580
where you've got schools that are,

2070
01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.980
I mean obviously schools work with creativity,

2071
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.290
but it's a different thing entirely to sit there and go,

2072
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.440
we're going to start in the first grade and by the time you graduate high

2073
01:01:03.441 --> 01:01:03.681
school,

2074
01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:07.910
we are going to maximize your creative abilities that are unique to you.

2075
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:08.091
You know,

2076
01:01:08.091 --> 01:01:08.481
Danielle,

2077
01:01:08.481 --> 01:01:09.021
you were saying this,

2078
01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:11.390
part of the problem is you could talk about creativity,

2079
01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:14.420
but Joe's creative gifts are going to be different than yours and mine and you

2080
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:15.920
can't have a standard course.

2081
01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:16.060
Right?

2082
01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:16.550
Well,

2083
01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:20.410
I haven't thought of one anyway that can take your gifts and your gifts and

2084
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:21.530
bring them to maturity.

2085
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:24.940
Unless we all share those gifts because you know your,

2086
01:01:24.941 --> 01:01:26.120
your gifts are in one area,

2087
01:01:26.121 --> 01:01:27.020
you're gives her an another.

2088
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.831
The problem is,

2089
01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:28.730
is that in our system,

2090
01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:30.590
there are no assembly lines or or few,

2091
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:34.130
you can't educate the mass of people to take a bunch of jobs that don't exist

2092
01:01:34.131 --> 01:01:34.790
anymore.

2093
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:38.240
So I think the system has to redesign itself to push creativity.

2094
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.110
And there's also some

2095
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:43.190
<v 0>utopian ideals and raising kids that are contrary to human nature,</v>

2096
01:01:43.191 --> 01:01:46.220
like this new thing that they're doing where or not having kids when,

2097
01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.241
when you know,

2098
01:01:47.241 --> 01:01:51.170
when they're playing like ball games and no one wins,

2099
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.400
you know,

2100
01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:51.970
when they're little.

2101
01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:53.530
<v 3>This is back to your competition.</v>

2102
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:54.550
Yeah.

2103
01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:55.061
Seriously.

2104
01:01:55.061 --> 01:01:55.810
Out of beads,

2105
01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:56.680
peas as a kid.

2106
01:01:56.681 --> 01:01:57.870
Did you ever heard of this before?

2107
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:58.631
It's a joke.

2108
01:01:58.631 --> 01:01:59.081
I mean it's,

2109
01:01:59.081 --> 01:02:00.300
I mean it's pretty widespread.

2110
01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:01.300
Been going on for quite awhile.

2111
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.010
It trophies for everyone,

2112
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:03.630
that kind of thing.

2113
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:04.320
Yeah.

2114
01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:04.730
<v 0>Um,</v>

2115
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:06.270
I dunno how I would Google that,

2116
01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.193
but uh,

2117
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.400
they're not giving out first and second place anymore then not then you know.

2118
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:12.780
<v 3>Well it's not a broad brush.</v>

2119
01:02:12.781 --> 01:02:13.261
I was going to say,

2120
01:02:13.261 --> 01:02:13.411
yeah,

2121
01:02:13.411 --> 01:02:14.244
some places,

2122
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:14.780
no,

2123
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:15.920
you don't keep score.

2124
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.050
A lot of kids at the younger,

2125
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.100
they don't do that anymore.

2126
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.390
<v 0>We kept scoring tee ball when I was a kid and you rubbed someone's nose in it.</v>

2127
01:02:24.391 --> 01:02:25.224
If they lost,

2128
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:27.360
there was no coach pitch.

2129
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.010
I had five year old boys.

2130
01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.740
You couldn't do anything but hit me with the ball pitching to me all day.

2131
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:33.420
There are no schools,

2132
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:34.590
there are no losers.

2133
01:02:34.591 --> 01:02:36.090
You're just the last winner.

2134
01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:39.210
I'm sorry I have to go throw up.

2135
01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:40.044
I'll be right back.

2136
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:41.820
I mean,

2137
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.380
I think that competition,

2138
01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:49.020
we all hate losing and therefore we connect competition with being a negative

2139
01:02:49.441 --> 01:02:50.010
thing.

2140
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:50.731
I don't think,

2141
01:02:50.731 --> 01:02:52.260
I don't think it's a negative thing at all.

2142
01:02:52.261 --> 01:02:53.790
I think competition is important.

2143
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:55.620
I think it's important in art.

2144
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.810
I think it's important in everything you know?

2145
01:02:57.811 --> 01:02:58.321
And you might say,

2146
01:02:58.321 --> 01:02:59.580
oh well that's not the,

2147
01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:00.010
the,

2148
01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:00.390
you know,

2149
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.600
the,

2150
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:00.811
the,

2151
01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.220
the real spirit of art.

2152
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:03.240
It's not competition.

2153
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:03.841
You're right,

2154
01:03:03.841 --> 01:03:04.530
it's not.

2155
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:09.530
But that competition can motivate the accomplishment of work and the

2156
01:03:09.721 --> 01:03:10.800
accomplishment of work.

2157
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.551
Sometimes,

2158
01:03:11.551 --> 01:03:11.940
you know,

2159
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.930
procrastination or what have you can,

2160
01:03:13.931 --> 01:03:16.470
you can delay someone releasing their art.

2161
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:17.520
So in that way,

2162
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.800
the competition inspires the creation of art.

2163
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.090
It's not always,

2164
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.650
and most of the time you're better off with that competition being internal or

2165
01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:25.891
not,

2166
01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:27.150
not even being a competition,

2167
01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:31.020
but rather an embracement of the complexities of figuring out whatever thing

2168
01:03:31.021 --> 01:03:31.854
you're working on.

2169
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.340
But that's still you.

2170
01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:33.691
There's,

2171
01:03:33.691 --> 01:03:34.830
there's something going on.

2172
01:03:34.831 --> 01:03:35.940
There's a game going on,

2173
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:38.010
whether it's going on with you and your head,

2174
01:03:38.011 --> 01:03:39.570
whether it's going on with the audience,

2175
01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:41.280
it's going to review whatever you're creating,

2176
01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:44.550
like a podcast or whether it's going on with you,

2177
01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:46.680
any competing directly against your peers and it,

2178
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.090
and they're sensing to me,

2179
01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:51.780
I love something about competition cause I love the media feedback it gives you,

2180
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:53.640
yeah know he's like you go out there,

2181
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.330
you do what you can to do and at the end of the day you see the results.

2182
01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:59.940
We don't pull it off or you didn't losing.

2183
01:03:59.941 --> 01:04:00.750
To me,

2184
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:02.340
as horrible as that feel,

2185
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.230
as it fucking sucks and you feel like,

2186
01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:04.820
you know,

2187
01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:05.653
you're so mad,

2188
01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.070
he's the best team that can happen to you because that's,

2189
01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:08.431
you know,

2190
01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:09.010
we need,

2191
01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:10.920
you are going to keep doing the same thing you've always done.

2192
01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:13.290
You have no motivation to push harder because look,

2193
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.340
I'm already doing great.

2194
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:16.260
Motivation may be fear of losing.

2195
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:16.620
Yeah,

2196
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.191
exactly.

2197
01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:18.480
And then when you do lose,

2198
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:21.210
Danny forces you to go back to the drawing board and figure out,

2199
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:21.780
okay,

2200
01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.613
how can I,

2201
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.420
I ran into the stumbling block.

2202
01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:25.560
How can I go around it?

2203
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:26.783
And in fact these,

2204
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.200
you know these bullshit about,

2205
01:04:28.201 --> 01:04:28.531
you know,

2206
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.311
no losers.

2207
01:04:29.311 --> 01:04:29.521
No,

2208
01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:30.360
we never know.

2209
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:35.340
Not letting somebody experience what it is to do your best and still lose.

2210
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.770
You're not doing them any favor because the fact is in life immediately on times

2211
01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.500
just because that's the design of life shit is going to happen whether you like

2212
01:04:43.501 --> 01:04:43.911
it or not,

2213
01:04:43.911 --> 01:04:45.030
whether it's fair or not,

2214
01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:46.380
whether you deserve it or not.

2215
01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.450
And how you respond to that.

2216
01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:49.284
If you feel that,

2217
01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:50.940
why did this happen to me?

2218
01:04:50.941 --> 01:04:51.271
You know,

2219
01:04:51.271 --> 01:04:52.350
it's unfair.

2220
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:54.210
It's I shouldn't be in this place.

2221
01:04:54.211 --> 01:04:55.290
I shouldn't feel like shit.

2222
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.300
Well you do now what you know.

2223
01:04:57.301 --> 01:05:01.260
And that's that experience of losing in that case is you're losing at the game

2224
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:02.094
of life,

2225
01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:03.990
not necessar to because of your fault.

2226
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:04.561
Maybe it is,

2227
01:05:04.561 --> 01:05:05.394
maybe it isn't.

2228
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.950
Now are you out of fuckery?

2229
01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:07.741
Gonna respond to this.

2230
01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:09.660
If you have been there a million times,

2231
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:12.300
maybe you have develop the muscle to grow out of it.

2232
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:15.450
If you have never been there the first time,

2233
01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:16.590
that light slap you around,

2234
01:05:16.591 --> 01:05:17.424
you freak out.

2235
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:17.980
And isn't

2236
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.360
<v 2>that sort of one of the reasons why our economy and society itself is so fucked</v>

2237
01:05:22.361 --> 01:05:22.540
up?

2238
01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.750
It's because we're so god damn competitive and it's because it's so natural to

2239
01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:26.531
do that.

2240
01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:28.120
When you start controlling some of the money,

2241
01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:29.200
you want to control more of the money.

2242
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:30.561
You know you,

2243
01:05:30.561 --> 01:05:30.670
you,

2244
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:33.070
when you start making some of the laws,

2245
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:33.551
Ben,

2246
01:05:33.551 --> 01:05:35.680
to help and benefit your business.

2247
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:36.220
Right?

2248
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:36.491
Dude,

2249
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:40.210
I watched a really disturbing documentary this past couple of days.

2250
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.320
It was gas land.

2251
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:42.790
Have you seen that or heard of it?

2252
01:05:42.791 --> 01:05:44.470
I haven't seen Holy Shit.

2253
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.820
You want to talk about a must see hydraulic fracturing,

2254
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:50.410
what they call fracking?

2255
01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:50.890
Yeah.

2256
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:52.090
Wow.

2257
01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.390
It's interesting why it's scary shit,

2258
01:05:55.391 --> 01:05:57.430
what they're doing and this guy breaks it down.

2259
01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:59.350
The amount of wells that they have.

2260
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:00.450
I had no idea.

2261
01:06:00.451 --> 01:06:00.970
It's a lot.

2262
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:04.900
And how many people's drinking water is for forever poisoned.

2263
01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:05.561
I mean,

2264
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:09.940
you're talking about giant chunks of America that are rendered poisonous.

2265
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:10.151
Well,

2266
01:06:10.151 --> 01:06:10.871
understand something.

2267
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:15.190
This is the wonderful example now of if somebody came to you and said,

2268
01:06:15.191 --> 01:06:19.270
how much money would we have to give you to poison your country?

2269
01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:19.931
What does that worth?

2270
01:06:19.931 --> 01:06:22.060
Because look at the other side of this.

2271
01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.220
Fracking as it's called,

2272
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:29.460
has taken the United States from an energy really insufficient position where we

2273
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:30.581
were in the Middle East.

2274
01:06:30.581 --> 01:06:34.720
We're in all these places because of the energy question and I mean in in a

2275
01:06:34.721 --> 01:06:35.650
geologic sense,

2276
01:06:35.651 --> 01:06:40.651
overnight turned us into an energy exporter again and we haven't been that way

2277
01:06:40.961 --> 01:06:41.770
since.

2278
01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:43.000
I mean we've always explored it energy,

2279
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:47.800
but I mean the 1960s were like the last really high water mark where we had lots

2280
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:48.970
of oil and we didn't have to worry.

2281
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:52.510
All of a sudden we're the natural gas kings and everything again and there's a

2282
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:53.343
ton of money.

2283
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:54.910
That amount of money,

2284
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.350
the amount we're talking about here,

2285
01:06:56.351 --> 01:06:57.310
not just money for now,

2286
01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:58.390
money for 10 years from now,

2287
01:06:58.391 --> 01:07:00.100
20 this is like longterm,

2288
01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:03.370
lots of money you that money will buy anything.

2289
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:03.551
Well,

2290
01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:08.551
by poisoning your water supply will by earthquakes that destroyed small Oklahoma

2291
01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:09.431
towns.

2292
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:09.521
It.

2293
01:07:09.521 --> 01:07:09.880
Well,

2294
01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:14.560
it's an interesting thing to see what we're willing to sell for a ton of money

2295
01:07:14.561 --> 01:07:17.680
that doesn't go to Joe Rogan or Dan Carlin by the west coast for the problem is

2296
01:07:17.681 --> 01:07:18.371
the word we.

2297
01:07:18.371 --> 01:07:19.720
It's not what we're willing.

2298
01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:22.960
Most people had no idea this was even happening until it was already too late

2299
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.550
and during the Bush administration,

2300
01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:24.761
this,

2301
01:07:24.761 --> 01:07:29.761
this documentary Gasland highlights how this all came to be and how Dick Cheney

2302
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:34.170
signed over these new exemptions that are,

2303
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.120
you didn't have to follow the water out of the clean water act,

2304
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:38.081
the clean air act,

2305
01:07:38.081 --> 01:07:39.340
all those were exempt.

2306
01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:41.020
Fracturing was exempt,

2307
01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.560
so you could just fuck everything up in order to get to,

2308
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:47.650
it's essentially like a small ocean of natural gas.

2309
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:50.740
The amount that's under New York and a big,

2310
01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:52.210
big chunks of the country in Texas.

2311
01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.620
It's huge.

2312
01:07:53.621 --> 01:07:57.760
It's gigantic change the entire energy situation on the planet,

2313
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.930
but these people have water that comes out of their faucet that you can light on

2314
01:08:01.931 --> 01:08:02.621
fire.

2315
01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:03.270
Yep.

2316
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:05.620
Surprise lighted on fire.

2317
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:10.120
There's more than 500 different chemicals that they have to pump into the ground

2318
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.630
in order to break up this natural gas and then extract it.

2319
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:14.650
And when they do that,

2320
01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:15.890
they basically,

2321
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.840
<v 4>everything gets mixed up together.</v>

2322
01:08:17.841 --> 01:08:20.540
The well water gets mixed up with the chemicals,

2323
01:08:20.541 --> 01:08:25.541
gets Mitch mixed up with the natural gas and it's just talk sick as fuck.

2324
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.520
It's coming out of holes in the ground and you can come up to it and light it on

2325
01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:29.180
fire.

2326
01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.530
It's mad.

2327
01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:30.820
<v 3>No,</v>

2328
01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.630
you know what the best chance,

2329
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:33.710
and it's a sad thing.

2330
01:08:33.711 --> 01:08:38.120
The best chance you have of combating that amount of money over something is

2331
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:42.860
when we have screwed up so much of the fresh water supply that the fresh water

2332
01:08:42.861 --> 01:08:44.690
actually becomes worth more.

2333
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:47.900
And you're already seeing this happening in some places where,

2334
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.400
where they're talking about,

2335
01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:49.581
you know,

2336
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:52.630
do we sell water rights to California from the Colorado River or this or that.

2337
01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.070
The other and the amounts of money that they're talking about.

2338
01:08:55.071 --> 01:08:55.281
I mean,

2339
01:08:55.281 --> 01:08:56.150
they're already talking about,

2340
01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:56.571
you know,

2341
01:08:56.571 --> 01:08:59.750
why should water be considered a feature that's owned by everybody?

2342
01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:03.920
Can I buy the water in the Colorado River and then can I sell it back to you?

2343
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:04.821
So I mean,

2344
01:09:04.821 --> 01:09:07.130
the old joke is that if you buy the bottled water,

2345
01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:08.630
it's worth more than gasoline.

2346
01:09:08.631 --> 01:09:08.931
You know,

2347
01:09:08.931 --> 01:09:09.561
at that amount.

2348
01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:10.400
If you go to the store,

2349
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:14.690
well what happens when it really is worth more than gasoline in large

2350
01:09:14.691 --> 01:09:15.524
quantities?

2351
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:18.350
Then all of a sudden fracking sounds like you're destroying and even more

2352
01:09:18.351 --> 01:09:19.070
important,

2353
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:20.450
I can get more money for that water,

2354
01:09:20.451 --> 01:09:21.890
then I can get for that natural gas.

2355
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:24.500
That's the only chance we have in a system driven by money,

2356
01:09:24.501 --> 01:09:26.240
I think to to keep the waterfront.

2357
01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:27.760
It's incredibly short.

2358
01:09:27.761 --> 01:09:27.800
Yeah.

2359
01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:32.480
<v 4>Decided and the amount of deception that's gone on to cover the amount of damage</v>

2360
01:09:32.481 --> 01:09:34.280
that's been done is staggering.

2361
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:34.791
I mean,

2362
01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:36.110
when these people tell their stories,

2363
01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:36.401
it's,

2364
01:09:36.401 --> 01:09:39.350
it's incredibly hard to watch and listen to cause people get sick because they

2365
01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:41.210
were drinking the water that kids get sick.

2366
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:42.140
The water,

2367
01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.130
like for the longest time,

2368
01:09:43.131 --> 01:09:45.080
they wouldn't meant that there was anything wrong with the water.

2369
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.670
And then they started giving people water.

2370
01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:47.091
They give it.

2371
01:09:47.091 --> 01:09:51.020
They set up these giant tanks and pumping water to them every week so that they

2372
01:09:51.021 --> 01:09:54.100
get their water from that instead of their wells they've had for you know,

2373
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:55.190
a hundred plus years.

2374
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:56.960
It's crazy shit man.

2375
01:09:56.961 --> 01:09:58.040
It's crazy shit to watch.

2376
01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.590
<v 3>But this is where you see the corruption of our political system,</v>

2377
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:04.520
which is what's destroying you would think that people who live in places where

2378
01:10:04.521 --> 01:10:07.940
they can light their water on fire would have their representatives in

2379
01:10:07.941 --> 01:10:09.590
Washington working to stop that.

2380
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:14.000
But that's where your free speech rights and my free speech rights are not equal

2381
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.590
to the free speech rights of these other people.

2382
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:18.350
And this is where I always argue with the courts that say that money is free

2383
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:18.920
speech,

2384
01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.640
which I don't mind except who said you get 50 or 100 times my free speech

2385
01:10:22.641 --> 01:10:23.474
rights.

2386
01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:24.410
<v 4>The,</v>

2387
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:28.160
the Internet I think ultimately is going to be a place where people vote on

2388
01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:31.820
things and it's also ultimately going to be a place where people can donate to

2389
01:10:31.821 --> 01:10:35.360
campaigns that promote values they believe in.

2390
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.570
And I think that is going to be a special interest along with all the other

2391
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:41.000
special interests in the world competing for influence.

2392
01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:43.630
<v 3>But what about that really changed things?</v>

2393
01:10:43.631 --> 01:10:44.710
They'd make it illegal?

2394
01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.950
Well I think it's about money and I think ultimately if,

2395
01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:50.860
if people invest money in

2396
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.640
<v 4>a party and a lobbyist and an idea that supports the things that they believe</v>

2397
01:10:55.641 --> 01:10:56.210
in,

2398
01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.990
that money can influence people just as easily as the money that supports

2399
01:10:59.991 --> 01:11:01.370
fracking or the money support.

2400
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.650
The idea is that it's just trading of commodities.

2401
01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.540
<v 3>So let's buy a legislator,</v>

2402
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:07.460
should we get the group together?

2403
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.050
I'm taking up a cause.

2404
01:11:09.051 --> 01:11:11.030
We're going to by Senator Ron Wyden sending around.

2405
01:11:11.031 --> 01:11:11.900
My is probably already on,

2406
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:14.610
but you know this guy who's been working for the fracking industry,

2407
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.290
how much do you need dude?

2408
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.531
You know,

2409
01:11:16.531 --> 01:11:17.341
you get him out of the tape of the,

2410
01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:20.280
how much is it going to take to bring you over to our side?

2411
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.510
I have powerful backers.

2412
01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:23.220
The guy was cut off in Vegas.

2413
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:24.170
He can't gamble anymore.

2414
01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.080
He's got a lot of money and you know what?

2415
01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.750
What's it going to take to buy this particular,

2416
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:29.130
I mean maybe we should just do that.

2417
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:32.790
The part maybe that's unfair about this is that you're never offered the chance

2418
01:11:32.791 --> 01:11:36.690
to buy a legislator that's kept to a small group of people in a smoke filled

2419
01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:37.470
back room.

2420
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:38.610
Maybe what we need is,

2421
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:38.970
look,

2422
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:40.200
if you're going to be sold,

2423
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.120
give us the option of buying to,

2424
01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:47.150
we collectively have a fuck load of money to buy me a legend to write off,

2425
01:11:47.641 --> 01:11:48.060
isn't it?

2426
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.250
Could you buy a legislated and that our business expense?

2427
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.520
Yes it is.

2428
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:52.620
If it helps my business,

2429
01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:53.910
can't call it buying off though.

2430
01:11:53.911 --> 01:11:56.670
We have to call it something creative risk management.

2431
01:11:59.340 --> 01:11:59.900
That's right.

2432
01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.310
You know that.

2433
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:01.440
You've got that podcast,

2434
01:12:01.441 --> 01:12:02.760
a troll lawsuit.

2435
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:05.480
I'm going to buy a few legislators and get them in my corner and then I'm going

2436
01:12:05.481 --> 01:12:06.630
to write that off on us.

2437
01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:09.210
Taxpayers can pick up my buying of the cause.

2438
01:12:09.211 --> 01:12:10.620
That's how it's done at the best levels.

2439
01:12:10.621 --> 01:12:11.420
Right.

2440
01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.081
<v 0>Did ultimately,</v>

2441
01:12:12.081 --> 01:12:15.530
that would be a smart thing for them to pursue just by virtue of the fact that

2442
01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:19.070
there's more money there than there is in all the corporations combined.

2443
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:22.280
I know it's a lot harder to please all of us that just that one guy,

2444
01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:22.791
you're right,

2445
01:12:22.791 --> 01:12:27.410
but the potential for extracting money off of a giant group by 300 million,

2446
01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:32.090
even if you get 1% that's still a huge amount of human beings that are donating

2447
01:12:32.091 --> 01:12:32.400
money.

2448
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:32.521
<v 3>Well,</v>

2449
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:34.110
the audience is going to say that already exists.

2450
01:12:34.111 --> 01:12:34.291
I mean,

2451
01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:35.730
look at all the small contribution,

2452
01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.070
but it's not the same as walking up to somebody and saying,

2453
01:12:38.071 --> 01:12:38.341
listen,

2454
01:12:38.341 --> 01:12:40.620
I went to all my friends and here's $5 million.

2455
01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.593
<v 0>Right?</v>

2456
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:41.861
Yeah.

2457
01:12:41.861 --> 01:12:42.990
Because the guy,

2458
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.230
you know,

2459
01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:44.730
the corporation was gonna.

2460
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:48.150
They are going to invest the money to buy off a vote to get what they want.

2461
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:52.830
They are going to make that amount of money 50 times over in the next tier.

2462
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:53.430
Right.

2463
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:55.710
The person who's going to donate to a campaign,

2464
01:12:55.711 --> 01:12:59.280
they are doing that in order to avoid something to be taken from them.

2465
01:12:59.281 --> 01:13:00.660
Whether it's Google out there or something,

2466
01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:02.010
they're not going to see their money back.

2467
01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:02.730
They are not going to,

2468
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:04.320
I'm going to make more money on it.

2469
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:07.020
So there is a little bit of hesitancy and other people are like,

2470
01:13:07.530 --> 01:13:07.891
fuck,

2471
01:13:07.891 --> 01:13:08.161
really?

2472
01:13:08.161 --> 01:13:11.430
Do I have to pay for something that I still had until yesterday?

2473
01:13:11.431 --> 01:13:12.540
And Oh man,

2474
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:12.840
you know,

2475
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.510
there's not that pay off of like you're going to win big.

2476
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:19.410
Is Your plane a defensive game where it's like you're just so risk avoidance.

2477
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:20.550
Yeah.

2478
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.851
Yeah.

2479
01:13:20.851 --> 01:13:24.780
It's sort of like you have that money and you have to invest it in making sure

2480
01:13:24.781 --> 01:13:25.860
they don't rob you in the future.

2481
01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:26.070
Yeah,

2482
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.600
exactly.

2483
01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.050
Rather than invest in you too,

2484
01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:28.441
rob,

2485
01:13:28.441 --> 01:13:29.274
everybody else,

2486
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.130
one of the others either get your agenda across,

2487
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:34.070
but the idea that these business come,

2488
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.470
these,

2489
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:39.470
these companies that have in enforced fracking or encourage fracking or spent

2490
01:13:39.991 --> 01:13:40.920
money to make it happen.

2491
01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:46.080
And this guy goes really clearly into detail about how it all took place and

2492
01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:46.321
you,

2493
01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:46.471
you,

2494
01:13:46.471 --> 01:13:51.120
they're ruining like a huge chunk of the country and they're doing it right in

2495
01:13:51.121 --> 01:13:53.670
front of everybody's face and no one can stop it.

2496
01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:57.170
And the worst part is they won't be around when the bill comes due for kicking

2497
01:13:57.171 --> 01:13:57.780
it up either.

2498
01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.680
You can't clean it up.

2499
01:13:58.681 --> 01:13:59.700
That's what's really crazy.

2500
01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:00.271
These,

2501
01:14:00.271 --> 01:14:00.600
uh,

2502
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.171
these people,

2503
01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:02.940
one of the people that got incredibly sick,

2504
01:14:02.941 --> 01:14:04.780
this woman got sick because they,

2505
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:08.340
it turned out that these filters that they had set up don't work with the

2506
01:14:08.341 --> 01:14:09.870
chemicals that they use for fracking.

2507
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.040
The chemicals actually eat the membranes of the

2508
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.790
<v 4>filter.</v>

2509
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:13.750
So she,

2510
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:14.350
it was all,

2511
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.500
uh,

2512
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.770
some of the chemicals were getting through to her and she was getting incredibly

2513
01:14:17.771 --> 01:14:18.340
sick,

2514
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.540
neurological damage,

2515
01:14:19.541 --> 01:14:20.820
all sorts of like really,

2516
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:21.940
like everyone's sick,

2517
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:22.240
right?

2518
01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:22.481
It's,

2519
01:14:22.481 --> 01:14:22.810
it's,

2520
01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:24.370
it's an incredible documentary.

2521
01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:24.510
<v 3>I,</v>

2522
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.641
I've,

2523
01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:26.610
it's very hard to protect the water supply.

2524
01:14:26.611 --> 01:14:30.120
You remember here in California with that gasoline additive that sunk into the

2525
01:14:30.121 --> 01:14:31.980
ground and made it into the water and it,

2526
01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:35.730
and it was a weird situation because of the additive had been put in there to

2527
01:14:35.731 --> 01:14:39.390
take some of the lead from the air pollution and then it was seeping into the

2528
01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:40.224
ground water.

2529
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.640
So you're damned if you do,

2530
01:14:41.641 --> 01:14:42.361
damned if you don't.

2531
01:14:42.361 --> 01:14:45.930
But that's the problem is it doesn't take a whole lot to seep into the water

2532
01:14:45.931 --> 01:14:47.370
supply and then you're screwed.

2533
01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:50.500
<v 4>What was that that you just put up that said Gaslamp producers put it up.</v>

2534
01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.693
We'll put it up.

2535
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:56.940
What does it say that I don't know how they could mislead debunking things about

2536
01:14:57.461 --> 01:15:00.340
both documentaries on gas land is one and two and they're both saying there's

2537
01:15:00.341 --> 01:15:00.920
some,

2538
01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:01.210
well,

2539
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:06.210
but just put up the thing that I asked the Gaslamp producer misled viewers on.

2540
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:08.121
<v 3>What does it show?</v>

2541
01:15:08.121 --> 01:15:11.150
Rogan is space spreading false information.

2542
01:15:11.151 --> 01:15:11.984
We could see it.

2543
01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.450
It said that it's been happening since the 1930s.

2544
01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:15.230
Um,

2545
01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:16.700
this isn't necessarily just from,

2546
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.740
their water was flammable before fracking.

2547
01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.181
You know,

2548
01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:19.730
it's funny Phil,

2549
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:19.960
he's,

2550
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.510
every time you expose anything you're going to have the next day.

2551
01:15:23.511 --> 01:15:25.040
15 sites saying no,

2552
01:15:25.041 --> 01:15:26.540
you made the top is not reality.

2553
01:15:26.541 --> 01:15:29.480
It's not that a public relations firms or four.

2554
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:30.290
Exactly right.

2555
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.770
Yup.

2556
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:31.100
<v 4>Yup,</v>

2557
01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:31.933
Yup.

2558
01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:32.391
Yeah.

2559
01:15:32.391 --> 01:15:36.230
I think that it's hard to know who the fuck is right in that situation.

2560
01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:40.700
But somewhere in the country you can fucking without a doubt guarantee that

2561
01:15:40.701 --> 01:15:42.020
these people have been poisoned.

2562
01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:42.831
Whether the lighting,

2563
01:15:42.831 --> 01:15:44.030
the water on fire,

2564
01:15:44.031 --> 01:15:44.350
it,

2565
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:45.260
it always existed.

2566
01:15:45.261 --> 01:15:46.400
That doesn't make any sense to me.

2567
01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:49.020
<v 3>Poisoning the citizens is an age old thing.</v>

2568
01:15:49.021 --> 01:15:51.120
I mean we do it it nuclear plants,

2569
01:15:51.121 --> 01:15:51.481
we do it.

2570
01:15:51.481 --> 01:15:54.690
I mean there's been lots of situations where you're living near something that

2571
01:15:54.691 --> 01:15:56.360
might be bad for you and,

2572
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:57.780
and that's nothing new.

2573
01:15:57.781 --> 01:15:59.010
That's what's crazy is that,

2574
01:15:59.011 --> 01:15:59.371
is that,

2575
01:15:59.371 --> 01:16:03.480
that's always taken a back seat to somebody profits somewhere.

2576
01:16:03.481 --> 01:16:03.721
And that's,

2577
01:16:03.721 --> 01:16:08.370
that's a bit sad that we can't as an entire population being poisoned balance

2578
01:16:08.371 --> 01:16:11.380
out the interests of those people who decide poisoning is,

2579
01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.121
is okay.

2580
01:16:12.121 --> 01:16:15.300
Cause they can go to Hawaii because I mean from their point of view,

2581
01:16:15.301 --> 01:16:15.590
you know,

2582
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:16.390
a corporation,

2583
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:17.760
you're in the business of making money.

2584
01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:19.350
We are not in the business of being nice.

2585
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:22.620
We are not going to be off me mean he's whatever it takes to make money,

2586
01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:23.360
you'll do it.

2587
01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.290
If he takes screwing people over.

2588
01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.570
Oh well even if you didn't want to make money,

2589
01:16:27.571 --> 01:16:31.530
you may have a fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders to maximize that.

2590
01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.453
Wouldn't that be funny?

2591
01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:33.920
I don't really want to frack.

2592
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.190
Right.

2593
01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:34.740
But uh,

2594
01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:35.131
but you know,

2595
01:16:35.131 --> 01:16:37.290
the shareholders will take me out if I don't,

2596
01:16:37.291 --> 01:16:38.011
but that's the problem.

2597
01:16:38.011 --> 01:16:38.250
He said,

2598
01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:39.060
I'll go to jail.

2599
01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.090
That's the corporation on,

2600
01:16:40.091 --> 01:16:40.520
right.

2601
01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:45.250
The role of government in a beauty for labs toward would be today actually in

2602
01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:45.990
force.

2603
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:49.440
Lowe's to stop the stuff that's damaging to the public.

2604
01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:51.000
That's only good for those.

2605
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.711
What job?

2606
01:16:51.711 --> 01:16:52.544
You're out the loop.

2607
01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:53.460
You brought up a loophole.

2608
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:57.450
And to me that's the biggest thing that I think people don't understand is that

2609
01:16:57.451 --> 01:17:01.660
you can make all the laws in the world if you let the loopholes happen.

2610
01:17:01.661 --> 01:17:02.280
They don't mean,

2611
01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.300
it's like people say to me,

2612
01:17:03.301 --> 01:17:03.840
Dan,

2613
01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:06.060
why do you keep saying the fourth amendment's going the way the fourth

2614
01:17:06.061 --> 01:17:07.080
amendment's their courts ruling.

2615
01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:07.351
Yeah,

2616
01:17:07.351 --> 01:17:09.030
but you Swiss cheese that enough.

2617
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.340
It doesn't matter anymore.

2618
01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:10.610
<v 5>Right.</v>

2619
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:12.980
This stuff is meaningless unless it's accessible

2620
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:13.883
<v 4>barrier.</v>

2621
01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.820
I got to watch research this now because a bunch of people in my message board

2622
01:17:17.821 --> 01:17:18.750
or putting up all these,

2623
01:17:18.751 --> 01:17:18.991
uh,

2624
01:17:18.991 --> 01:17:21.930
websites that say that they're debunking gas land,

2625
01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.033
first of all,

2626
01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:23.881
a,

2627
01:17:23.881 --> 01:17:25.440
I would without a doubt,

2628
01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:29.940
I would imagine that if I was working for the fracking industry and someone put

2629
01:17:29.941 --> 01:17:31.650
out a hit piece on fracking,

2630
01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:33.630
that I would debunk the fucking shit out of him.

2631
01:17:33.631 --> 01:17:34.110
Yeah.

2632
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:36.840
Even if it doesn't make any sense that d bunkie doesn't make any sense.

2633
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.910
<v 5>And if you're a legislator who voted to allow it,</v>

2634
01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.170
you'd have the same interest.

2635
01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:40.421
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2636
01:17:40.421 --> 01:17:41.171
But that said,

2637
01:17:41.171 --> 01:17:43.120
I haven't read any of the debunking,

2638
01:17:43.121 --> 01:17:44.590
so I'll read that and I'll get back.

2639
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:44.680
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2640
01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:47.710
But even if you don't focus on the specific example,

2641
01:17:47.711 --> 01:17:50.860
you look at the general picture is fucking undeniable that were poisoned in our

2642
01:17:50.861 --> 01:17:53.590
environment that I don't think you can debunk that.

2643
01:17:53.591 --> 01:17:53.981
It's like,

2644
01:17:53.981 --> 01:17:54.310
no,

2645
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:55.143
it's,

2646
01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.230
that's just facts.

2647
01:17:56.231 --> 01:17:58.630
So you'll pick one specific example.

2648
01:17:58.631 --> 01:18:01.840
They may not be exactly 100% through who the fuck cares.

2649
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:03.550
The general picture remained the same.

2650
01:18:03.850 --> 01:18:05.530
That's not going to change.

2651
01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.513
Yeah.

2652
01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:07.481
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2653
01:18:07.481 --> 01:18:08.314
I dunno man.

2654
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:12.010
I think that we do really for without a doubt,

2655
01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.850
have an issue with the fact that people were super competitive and that people

2656
01:18:15.851 --> 01:18:17.080
are progressive in nature.

2657
01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:17.650
I mean,

2658
01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:20.050
but I mean by progressive they move forward.

2659
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:20.980
If they have $2,

2660
01:18:20.981 --> 01:18:21.581
they want three.

2661
01:18:21.581 --> 01:18:22.091
If they have three,

2662
01:18:22.091 --> 01:18:22.924
they want four.

2663
01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:24.160
It's a natural,

2664
01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:25.330
weird thing that we do.

2665
01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.230
I was like,

2666
01:18:26.230 --> 01:18:30.490
I was trying to explain anal sex to somebody and I was in a girl is a natural

2667
01:18:30.491 --> 01:18:31.030
segue.

2668
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.900
Why did guys,

2669
01:18:31.901 --> 01:18:33.100
why you guys want to do that?

2670
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:33.551
I go,

2671
01:18:33.551 --> 01:18:36.340
because they have regular sex with you and then they go,

2672
01:18:36.341 --> 01:18:37.270
can I put it in your mouth?

2673
01:18:37.271 --> 01:18:37.541
And they go,

2674
01:18:37.541 --> 01:18:37.751
yeah.

2675
01:18:37.751 --> 01:18:38.051
And they go,

2676
01:18:38.051 --> 01:18:38.231
okay,

2677
01:18:38.231 --> 01:18:38.921
well what about that?

2678
01:18:38.921 --> 01:18:39.580
And that's just,

2679
01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.660
it's a natural,

2680
01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:41.830
weird progression.

2681
01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:44.950
I mean all that stuff happens when you hear about like crazy,

2682
01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.910
not a philosophy major jury.

2683
01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:52.240
When you hear about like crazy super freaks that have like gigantic orgies,

2684
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.961
how did that happen?

2685
01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.310
Did they just start off having orgies?

2686
01:18:54.311 --> 01:18:54.880
No,

2687
01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.580
they started out with regular sex and they've got a lot of regular sex and they

2688
01:18:57.581 --> 01:18:58.391
started getting boards.

2689
01:18:58.391 --> 01:19:01.090
They brought an extra girls and before you know what they're having these freaky

2690
01:19:01.091 --> 01:19:01.900
sex parties,

2691
01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:04.000
it's a natural thing of progression.

2692
01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:04.780
People,

2693
01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.171
if they're,

2694
01:19:05.171 --> 01:19:06.520
if they can run five miles,

2695
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:08.800
they want to run 10 if they got their brown belt,

2696
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:09.600
they want to get their black.

2697
01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.710
<v 5>So it's competition,</v>

2698
01:19:10.711 --> 01:19:13.980
which you guys were talking about how great it was all the time and now you're

2699
01:19:13.981 --> 01:19:14.521
slamming it,

2700
01:19:14.521 --> 01:19:15.354
make up your law.

2701
01:19:15.490 --> 01:19:16.261
That's not what I'm saying.

2702
01:19:16.261 --> 01:19:17.094
I say

2703
01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:20.170
<v 4>the idea's gone wild.</v>

2704
01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.390
The idea of what makes a human exceptional,

2705
01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:25.450
what make makes a human create everything that exists really,

2706
01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:29.080
I think from electronics to the wheel to houses and everything.

2707
01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:33.160
There's this natural desire for humans to improve upon.

2708
01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:34.090
What they've already done.

2709
01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.980
And I think that extends to control.

2710
01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:38.080
I think it extends to evil as well.

2711
01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.180
It's one of my old my arguments when a,

2712
01:19:40.181 --> 01:19:42.870
when everyone would talk about like uh,

2713
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:47.230
problems with government and whether or not there's still corruption in

2714
01:19:47.231 --> 01:19:47.890
government.

2715
01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:51.550
All you have to do is look back on the corruption that you can document for a

2716
01:19:51.551 --> 01:19:55.660
fact that happened in the 1960s and know that there's no bodies,

2717
01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:00.900
there's no like a slew of people lives ruined careers destroyed parties brought

2718
01:20:00.941 --> 01:20:03.190
down now is actually very little.

2719
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:07.590
If you think about exactly what they're absolutely positively guilty doing.

2720
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.020
<v 3>This is very little damage and you know that that everything progresses.</v>

2721
01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:17.060
So the amount of utter and complete total corruption that exists today and the

2722
01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:19.470
sophistication of it would naturally

2723
01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:23.490
<v 4>be above and beyond what existed documentable from the 19 six</v>

2724
01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:26.060
<v 3>let me take it to a different level cause I think it's a different thing.</v>

2725
01:20:26.061 --> 01:20:31.061
I think that we are incentivized as human beings going back to primate times to

2726
01:20:31.701 --> 01:20:34.610
look at things through a short term lens there.

2727
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:37.880
The carrots and sticks are all set up for the short term approach.

2728
01:20:37.881 --> 01:20:38.031
You know,

2729
01:20:38.031 --> 01:20:39.440
you brought up wisdom awhile ago,

2730
01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:44.420
Daniella wisdom is being able to look at things from a longterm perspective.

2731
01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:47.960
Now it's a perfect example is investing.

2732
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.501
Uh,

2733
01:20:48.501 --> 01:20:49.370
in the old days,

2734
01:20:49.371 --> 01:20:49.521
you know,

2735
01:20:49.521 --> 01:20:53.580
ty Cobb would buy coca cola shares and when he died he had all these cocacola

2736
01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.630
shares on his chest,

2737
01:20:54.631 --> 01:20:57.290
did the hospital that he'd had for forever,

2738
01:20:57.291 --> 01:20:57.471
you know,

2739
01:20:57.471 --> 01:20:58.090
hell yeah.

2740
01:20:58.090 --> 01:20:58.371
Oh yeah.

2741
01:20:58.371 --> 01:20:59.680
He was so afraid someone would take his,

2742
01:20:59.681 --> 01:21:00.180
his,

2743
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:00.890
so he kept it.

2744
01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:01.480
So he's got,

2745
01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:01.851
he's two,

2746
01:21:01.851 --> 01:21:02.990
he's got all these shares.

2747
01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:06.260
He's owned forever because to him he wasn't going to sell them in five minutes.

2748
01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:07.910
He was in it for the long term.

2749
01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:10.760
Our society is set up for the short term.

2750
01:21:10.761 --> 01:21:12.650
Making money is set up for the short term.

2751
01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.350
There is no interest in saying something like,

2752
01:21:15.351 --> 01:21:16.550
well let's protect clean water.

2753
01:21:16.551 --> 01:21:17.840
Who are you protecting it for?

2754
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:19.820
I won't be around to enjoy that clean water.

2755
01:21:19.821 --> 01:21:21.080
By the time that happens,

2756
01:21:21.081 --> 01:21:21.831
I'm dead now.

2757
01:21:21.831 --> 01:21:23.090
What can I make in the short term?

2758
01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:24.560
Politics is the same way.

2759
01:21:24.561 --> 01:21:27.740
It's like when people were talking about President Obama lying about the

2760
01:21:27.741 --> 01:21:28.500
healthcare planning,

2761
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.620
but keeping your own doctor right and all that stuff.

2762
01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.750
He's incentivized to do that.

2763
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:35.360
All he cared about was winning that next election.

2764
01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.700
You will worry about the fallout later.

2765
01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.510
None of this matters if you lose right dealing with the fallout of the lie

2766
01:21:41.511 --> 01:21:41.811
later,

2767
01:21:41.811 --> 01:21:43.550
there's no incentive to not lie.

2768
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:45.050
The incentives are all on the,

2769
01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:49.070
and this is if you're an intelligent human being weighing the pros and cons,

2770
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:53.870
you are not incentivized to think longterm and yet that may be the only solution

2771
01:21:53.871 --> 01:21:54.351
for the planet.

2772
01:21:54.351 --> 01:21:55.190
You talk about long term.

2773
01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:00.230
If we can't somehow contradict where the incentives are and go against our

2774
01:22:00.231 --> 01:22:02.090
natural primate instincts,

2775
01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:03.740
we might not be able to make it work.

2776
01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.850
I think it's going to take

2777
01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.430
<v 4>a greater level of awareness culturally than exists today.</v>

2778
01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.190
I think the great level of awareness,

2779
01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:12.581
the,

2780
01:22:12.581 --> 01:22:12.821
the,

2781
01:22:12.821 --> 01:22:13.601
the really,

2782
01:22:13.601 --> 01:22:18.040
truly objective view of humanity and the potential possibilities of the future

2783
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:20.470
is something that is contemplated by few groups,

2784
01:22:20.471 --> 01:22:22.000
small groups of people,

2785
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:23.410
people sitting in conversation,

2786
01:22:23.411 --> 01:22:24.460
dinner parties and stuff.

2787
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:27.550
But if you think of the greater whole of humanity,

2788
01:22:27.551 --> 01:22:27.711
the,

2789
01:22:27.711 --> 01:22:31.660
the amount of damage we're doing to the world on a daily basis,

2790
01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:36.840
the amount of like really ridiculous behavior that operates our financial and,

2791
01:22:37.151 --> 01:22:37.401
and,

2792
01:22:37.401 --> 01:22:37.631
and,

2793
01:22:37.631 --> 01:22:41.020
and justice system and our political systems.

2794
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:43.450
It's all like complete and total chaos.

2795
01:22:43.451 --> 01:22:48.190
And yet it still continues in the exact same way it always has before.

2796
01:22:48.191 --> 01:22:51.400
There's only small groups of people that speak out against it.

2797
01:22:51.401 --> 01:22:53.450
I think once the,

2798
01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.030
the,

2799
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.310
the,

2800
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.551
the,

2801
01:22:54.551 --> 01:22:57.730
the sphere of understanding of like what,

2802
01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.710
what a complete disaster this world is because of our actions and because of our

2803
01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.420
inability to correct those actions.

2804
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:06.130
Once that understanding

2805
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:06.401
<v 0>is,</v>

2806
01:23:06.401 --> 01:23:07.270
is in place,

2807
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:09.430
then hopefully it's not too late.

2808
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.040
There'll be some sort of way to turn back the tide.

2809
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.170
But I feel like it's an ebb and a flow thing,

2810
01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.460
much like everything in life.

2811
01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:19.540
And I think it's almost like we have to fucking poison the ocean before we

2812
01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:21.640
realize it's ridiculous and then stop doing it.

2813
01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:23.120
<v 3>I think it's going to be money.</v>

2814
01:23:23.121 --> 01:23:23.421
I think.

2815
01:23:23.421 --> 01:23:26.240
I think somewhere down the road when water for clean water,

2816
01:23:26.241 --> 01:23:26.691
for example,

2817
01:23:26.691 --> 01:23:30.320
is worth a bazillion dollars to Halliburton and they buy the water,

2818
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:31.730
then the rules will be,

2819
01:23:31.731 --> 01:23:32.564
you can't,

2820
01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.090
you can't piss in water anywhere because you know,

2821
01:23:35.091 --> 01:23:35.760
you might be,

2822
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:39.440
then all of the money going to Washington will be to preserve water.

2823
01:23:39.441 --> 01:23:40.940
Will it preserve Halliburton's water supply?

2824
01:23:40.941 --> 01:23:43.850
Otherwise their profits will be impacted when they sell it back to the public.

2825
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.930
I don't,

2826
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:45.051
I,

2827
01:23:45.051 --> 01:23:45.560
you know,

2828
01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:45.861
Joe,

2829
01:23:45.861 --> 01:23:46.850
you always need,

2830
01:23:46.851 --> 01:23:47.111
you know,

2831
01:23:47.111 --> 01:23:47.281
you,

2832
01:23:47.281 --> 01:23:47.990
Oh,

2833
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:52.190
you want human nature to improve and you think it's going to happen and I don't

2834
01:23:52.191 --> 01:23:52.761
disagree with you.

2835
01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:53.461
The problem is,

2836
01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:58.340
is that so many people like Dick Cheney have to be improved too before this

2837
01:23:58.341 --> 01:24:00.410
works that I don't see that happening.

2838
01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.190
I see it.

2839
01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:02.210
It's going the other way.

2840
01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:04.190
Their incentives have to become the,

2841
01:24:04.230 --> 01:24:05.390
there's still going to want money.

2842
01:24:05.391 --> 01:24:06.800
They're still going to think short term,

2843
01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:10.030
but the incentives have to change so that protecting the environment becomes the

2844
01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.560
the way to keep your millions in tact as opposed to,

2845
01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:13.220
you know,

2846
01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:15.660
polluting the environment becomes the way to keep your millions in tax.

2847
01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:20.340
<v 0>But if you look at the dissolving of boundaries between people and information</v>

2848
01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:23.370
and how that trend is going to continue,

2849
01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.640
I think that our idea of looking at the possibilities of the future based on how

2850
01:24:29.071 --> 01:24:33.900
humans were able to run the world just 10 years ago are kind of ridiculous when

2851
01:24:33.901 --> 01:24:35.310
you think about it from 100 years from now,

2852
01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:38.670
the options won't be available because the amount of transparency that will be

2853
01:24:38.671 --> 01:24:41.250
required to communicate with people is going to be completely different.

2854
01:24:41.251 --> 01:24:43.740
It's gonna be very hard to hold back reality.

2855
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:47.840
<v 3>You're assuming that there's not going to be some David Cameron cracked down,</v>

2856
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.231
you know,

2857
01:24:48.231 --> 01:24:49.220
between now and then.

2858
01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.360
<v 0>I don't think they can do it.</v>

2859
01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.460
And I think even if they did,

2860
01:24:52.461 --> 01:24:57.110
the young people that are coming up that are more in line with the ideas of an

2861
01:24:57.111 --> 01:24:59.870
anonymous or the ideas of open source internet,

2862
01:24:59.871 --> 01:25:03.950
the ideas of spreading information and what a massively important thing that is

2863
01:25:03.951 --> 01:25:06.350
for society and human culture as a whole,

2864
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:08.920
I think they're overwhelming and I think they're,

2865
01:25:08.921 --> 01:25:10.730
they're going to continue that trend.

2866
01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.220
The people that know that,

2867
01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:13.661
the,

2868
01:25:13.661 --> 01:25:16.240
the idea of anybody being able to control information,

2869
01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:17.690
they are literally controlling.

2870
01:25:17.691 --> 01:25:18.500
If they do that,

2871
01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.810
they're controlling educational evolution.

2872
01:25:21.170 --> 01:25:23.350
They're controlling the ability for,

2873
01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.210
<v 3>are you suggesting they wouldn't want to,</v>

2874
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:26.103
can't,

2875
01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:26.920
you can't do it.

2876
01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:27.860
I don't think you could do it.

2877
01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.440
Is that a challenge?

2878
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.273
It's like triage.

2879
01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:31.660
It's like I pull

2880
01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.250
<v 0>all the sand off the beaches.</v>

2881
01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:34.200
Uh,

2882
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:34.611
and let's see,

2883
01:25:34.611 --> 01:25:34.961
it happened.

2884
01:25:34.961 --> 01:25:36.280
I want to stop that you guys are saying,

2885
01:25:36.281 --> 01:25:38.920
I actually think it goes hand in hand because what you're saying Joe,

2886
01:25:38.921 --> 01:25:43.180
about the fact that a certain level of transformation in terms of consciousness,

2887
01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:46.630
in terms of priorities that happen at a mass level when enough people,

2888
01:25:46.631 --> 01:25:51.631
we'd sort of a critical mass that feeds into dance arguments that at that point

2889
01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.660
corporations are going to respond to it because there's money attached to it.

2890
01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:00.430
So I don't think he's just purely from an economic standpoint and he's clearly

2891
01:26:00.431 --> 01:26:03.350
not purely from a consciousness standpoint is going to go ahead.

2892
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:04.370
I mean it's happening now,

2893
01:26:04.371 --> 01:26:04.641
right?

2894
01:26:04.641 --> 01:26:08.060
He's like more and more people care about environmental issues.

2895
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:13.180
So companies that market themselves as were nice to the environment can hike

2896
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:16.490
their prices a little bit because they know that they are going to have some

2897
01:26:16.491 --> 01:26:17.600
people who buy them.

2898
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.210
They are products because of those values.

2899
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:20.370
Yeah.

2900
01:26:20.370 --> 01:26:25.370
Could you imagine if you were buying some gas that costs 10 cents less per

2901
01:26:25.371 --> 01:26:25.851
gallon,

2902
01:26:25.851 --> 01:26:26.540
but it,

2903
01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:26.960
you know,

2904
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.670
it was guarantee comes from like child labor in some shitty part of the country

2905
01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:35.120
in the world where the Dolphin Safe Tuna label thing.

2906
01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:35.510
Yeah,

2907
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:36.111
exactly.

2908
01:26:36.111 --> 01:26:36.380
Yeah,

2909
01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:37.010
exactly.

2910
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:40.790
I think that it's going to be impossible in the future to hide any evil

2911
01:26:40.791 --> 01:26:41.331
behavior.

2912
01:26:41.331 --> 01:26:42.980
I think right now it's still too muddy.

2913
01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:43.971
It's still to money.

2914
01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:47.600
I think as technology advances and approves this connection with people and

2915
01:26:47.601 --> 01:26:50.150
ideas and information is going to be cleaner and quicker.

2916
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.100
I don't know what form that's going to take in,

2917
01:26:52.101 --> 01:26:55.850
but all I'm doing is sort of objectively extrapolating what's happened in the

2918
01:26:55.851 --> 01:26:59.240
past to what's happened recently to where I feel like it's going.

2919
01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:02.240
I just don't think you can hold this waterfall back.

2920
01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.460
I feel like there's too much going on.

2921
01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:09.670
There's too many people communicating to freely all over the world and improving

2922
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:11.330
upon the methods of communication.

2923
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:14.030
And they're going to get to a point where you're not going to be able to hide a

2924
01:27:14.031 --> 01:27:17.750
goddamn thing and you're not going to be able to make money off of,

2925
01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:20.660
you're gonna not gonna be able to profit of doing something that directly

2926
01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:21.471
damages the earth.

2927
01:27:21.471 --> 01:27:22.490
Cause everyone's gonna see it.

2928
01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:23.271
It's going to be,

2929
01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.980
it's going to be something that your neighbors know about.

2930
01:27:24.981 --> 01:27:25.850
It's going to be something that I,

2931
01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:28.430
we're going to know what each other were getting away with.

2932
01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:29.091
But don't you sink?

2933
01:27:29.091 --> 01:27:33.620
You end up with the guy slammed a kind of story where you can push a story and

2934
01:27:33.621 --> 01:27:37.010
maybe you twist 15% of the data to make it a little,

2935
01:27:37.011 --> 01:27:38.480
to make your point a little harder.

2936
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:43.370
And somebody else based on that 15 or 20% of your making up debunk the whole

2937
01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:44.690
thing and say it's all crap.

2938
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.130
And there's that part of the flow of information is that there's so much of it

2939
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.910
that for every single thing you hear that seems to prove the sinks going one

2940
01:27:52.911 --> 01:27:53.600
way.

2941
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.860
F people seem pretty credible who give you good evidence to argue the exact

2942
01:27:57.861 --> 01:28:01.130
opposite things and he leaves a ton of human beings feeling like,

2943
01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:02.180
uh,

2944
01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:02.661
what the fuck?

2945
01:28:02.661 --> 01:28:05.420
I don't know which one of them to believe they these ones sound good.

2946
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:06.710
This one also makes sense.

2947
01:28:06.850 --> 01:28:09.200
I feel like we're either going to go one way or the other.

2948
01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:13.220
We're either going to go slide into complete total dictatorship brought out by a

2949
01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:17.690
series of terrorist events or we're going to slide into the next level of

2950
01:28:17.691 --> 01:28:19.670
evolution and I think it's a battle right now.

2951
01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:22.430
What does that quote from Orson Welles history?

2952
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:24.650
History is,

2953
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.633
Goddammit,

2954
01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:28.040
I forget the quote,

2955
01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.110
amazing court by Orson Wells,

2956
01:28:30.111 --> 01:28:32.090
but essentially w to paraphrase it,

2957
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:37.270
what is saying is that there's a race going on between people who were looking

2958
01:28:37.401 --> 01:28:42.020
to improve the human race and people that are stuck in the old paradigm that are

2959
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.170
constantly battle between education and,

2960
01:28:45.171 --> 01:28:45.810
fuck.

2961
01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:46.431
God dammit.

2962
01:28:46.431 --> 01:28:46.791
I hate when,

2963
01:28:46.791 --> 01:28:50.230
I don't remember a great quote that I think I have at my fingertips need to

2964
01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.180
quote board here up on the walls,

2965
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:53.720
his story,

2966
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:57.680
Orson Welles human history becomes more and more a race between education and

2967
01:28:57.681 --> 01:28:58.760
catastrophe narratives.

2968
01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.140
One and that's exactly what it is.

2969
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.040
I mean that's exactly what

2970
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.790
<v 4>we're talking about.</v>

2971
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:05.790
I feel like the way things are going,

2972
01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:06.600
the what,

2973
01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.310
when you hear people like the NSA folks say that you know that the angry that a

2974
01:29:11.311 --> 01:29:15.270
guy like Edward Snowden released all the data and he's a trader and you know all

2975
01:29:15.271 --> 01:29:20.271
this craziness where you trying to convince us that this guy is bad because he

2976
01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:21.240
told us that you right.

2977
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.050
<v 3>Bad.</v>

2978
01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:24.090
See why can I always see the dark side?

2979
01:29:24.091 --> 01:29:25.950
I want to come with you guys into the light.

2980
01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:26.784
I really do.

2981
01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:30.990
But see all I see happening is another nine 11 attack and then the people in the

2982
01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:33.090
Nsa going guess what allowed that one?

2983
01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.130
That was the stuff Edward Stoten told you.

2984
01:29:35.131 --> 01:29:36.720
Now see now don't you learn?

2985
01:29:36.721 --> 01:29:38.790
Trust us next time and you won't have another one of these.

2986
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:39.810
I just,

2987
01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:40.261
you know,

2988
01:29:40.261 --> 01:29:44.100
I mean I think things could break in the right way,

2989
01:29:44.370 --> 01:29:48.630
but I think history shows that they're stacked up against us.

2990
01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:52.050
And so I think if you take this attitude that hey,

2991
01:29:52.051 --> 01:29:53.430
things could break the right way,

2992
01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.360
you are not girding yourself up for the fight that you're facing.

2993
01:29:57.361 --> 01:29:59.550
And this gets back to what we talked about when you talked about fights.

2994
01:29:59.551 --> 01:30:00.120
If you think,

2995
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.400
oh that George Foreman,

2996
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:02.243
I'm about to fight,

2997
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.671
ah,

2998
01:30:02.671 --> 01:30:03.540
he's got openings,

2999
01:30:03.541 --> 01:30:05.010
I watched him and taping it,

3000
01:30:05.011 --> 01:30:06.180
that is left is slow,

3001
01:30:06.181 --> 01:30:06.870
I'll get in on that.

3002
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:07.291
And then you,

3003
01:30:07.291 --> 01:30:10.170
you don't account for the right and you get in there and you go,

3004
01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:10.891
oh damn,

3005
01:30:10.891 --> 01:30:11.730
I forgot about that.

3006
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:14.340
I think you need to gird yourself and say,

3007
01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.330
history shows that there's always a small group of people you know who have a

3008
01:30:18.331 --> 01:30:21.600
little bit of the ear of the powerful or who have a little bit more money or

3009
01:30:21.601 --> 01:30:22.434
what have you,

3010
01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:25.080
and they're extremely formidable.

3011
01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:26.460
There's never going to be like,

3012
01:30:26.461 --> 01:30:29.400
we all get this consciousness expansion and Dick Cheney's never getting anywhere

3013
01:30:29.401 --> 01:30:30.001
near government.

3014
01:30:30.001 --> 01:30:30.570
Again.

3015
01:30:30.570 --> 01:30:34.140
The truth is we're playing Black Hawk down and Dick Cheney's busy,

3016
01:30:34.141 --> 01:30:34.591
you know,

3017
01:30:34.591 --> 01:30:37.290
buying up corporations and I just,

3018
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:42.330
I think this is a monumental struggle that's going to require,

3019
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:43.260
you know,

3020
01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:43.891
what's missing,

3021
01:30:43.891 --> 01:30:46.710
and I've always said this is we don't have any leaders.

3022
01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:49.320
I mean in other generations you can name people,

3023
01:30:49.321 --> 01:30:52.920
you can Wikipedia and search people that were out in the forefront,

3024
01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:54.990
bringing groups of people in two directions.

3025
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:58.710
I feel like we were a very directionless group except for Putin.

3026
01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:00.230
Dan Carlingford precedent,

3027
01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:01.580
and that's what you want.

3028
01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.260
That's when you really see how limited the person I am.

3029
01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:06.060
I'm already at the height of my game.

3030
01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.590
I don't get any better than this.

3031
01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:09.780
So you put me up to president and it's all over.

3032
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.000
Then the reviews on iTunes will be horrible

3033
01:31:12.490 --> 01:31:17.380
<v 4>guy like Putin is like one of the last real leaders and a leader in a very</v>

3034
01:31:17.381 --> 01:31:17.760
gangster

3035
01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.780
<v 3>Moorish sort of way,</v>

3036
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:19.980
but still isn't where the old,

3037
01:31:19.981 --> 01:31:21.840
he's old school as old school as it gets.

3038
01:31:21.841 --> 01:31:22.260
Yeah.

3039
01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:22.471
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3040
01:31:22.471 --> 01:31:24.150
I mean the guy was the president and they say,

3041
01:31:24.151 --> 01:31:24.990
you can't be present anymore.

3042
01:31:24.991 --> 01:31:25.171
He goes,

3043
01:31:25.171 --> 01:31:25.560
all right,

3044
01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:26.490
I'll be a prime minister.

3045
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:28.500
This guy's the president now fuck heads.

3046
01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:29.190
<v 3>Oh No,</v>

3047
01:31:29.190 --> 01:31:30.280
it's on the president again.

3048
01:31:30.670 --> 01:31:35.350
He is kind of showing a blueprint for how you take a new democracy and just kind

3049
01:31:35.351 --> 01:31:35.810
of,

3050
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:36.120
and,

3051
01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.490
and the people wanted a democracy and you just kind of convinced them that the

3052
01:31:39.491 --> 01:31:40.630
way you're doing it is better.

3053
01:31:40.631 --> 01:31:41.730
And you interview these people in the street,

3054
01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:42.070
they go,

3055
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.251
oh,

3056
01:31:42.251 --> 01:31:43.780
Russia really needs a strong man.

3057
01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:44.590
Really.

3058
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:45.940
When did you get convinced to that?

3059
01:31:45.941 --> 01:31:48.910
Where's your awareness or raising level and everything?

3060
01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:49.210
Um,

3061
01:31:49.210 --> 01:31:49.770
just to,

3062
01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:49.980
to

3063
01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:53.130
<v 4>play devil's advocate for what you said earlier when you were talking earlier</v>

3064
01:31:53.131 --> 01:31:53.730
about,

3065
01:31:53.730 --> 01:31:54.180
uh,

3066
01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.220
you see it going in a bad direction.

3067
01:31:56.670 --> 01:32:00.640
We were just talking at the beginning of this conversation how fucked up things

3068
01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:03.010
were just a few hundred years ago.

3069
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:05.650
Like how much worse things were 500 years ago.

3070
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:10.240
How much is that really correct where they really that much worse?

3071
01:32:10.241 --> 01:32:11.350
And if that's true,

3072
01:32:11.351 --> 01:32:15.430
then isn't there some sort of a marked improvement in society and the safety and

3073
01:32:15.431 --> 01:32:17.110
society that we can demonstrate today?

3074
01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:17.261
Well,

3075
01:32:17.261 --> 01:32:19.420
the first and the situation was better back then.

3076
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:20.500
Yeah,

3077
01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:20.831
the cold,

3078
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:21.940
the water was all clean,

3079
01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:23.450
different,

3080
01:32:23.450 --> 01:32:24.850
different things were messing up the water,

3081
01:32:24.851 --> 01:32:25.830
pick that shit and everything.

3082
01:32:25.831 --> 01:32:26.680
That's right.

3083
01:32:26.681 --> 01:32:27.371
And bodies,

3084
01:32:27.371 --> 01:32:28.660
they tossed bodies in there.

3085
01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:29.231
Yeah.

3086
01:32:29.231 --> 01:32:32.560
I mean there's always been people doing stupid shit to the ground because they

3087
01:32:32.561 --> 01:32:34.700
had short term interest at stack.

3088
01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.860
That's a very good point.

3089
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:38.860
That point that you had about people looking at it and it,

3090
01:32:38.861 --> 01:32:40.840
and also back in the day,

3091
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:44.620
I mean up until recently you didn't really live long enough to see the hustle.

3092
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:44.980
Right.

3093
01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:45.341
You know,

3094
01:32:45.341 --> 01:32:46.180
if you were lucky,

3095
01:32:46.181 --> 01:32:48.130
you live to be 30 ish,

3096
01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:51.850
you know a good 50% of your friends are probably dead by then.

3097
01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:55.480
And then you know the guys that would live to be 60 those rare birds,

3098
01:32:55.481 --> 01:32:57.880
it would be hanging around philosophizing and square.

3099
01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:00.670
They were so rare that we really didn't get that many of them.

3100
01:33:00.671 --> 01:33:04.120
So when you got a guy like Socrates had dropped all this crazy knowledge like

3101
01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:04.631
yeah,

3102
01:33:04.631 --> 01:33:05.950
that guy had been around a long time.

3103
01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:06.250
He made,

3104
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:06.920
he made through,

3105
01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.380
wrote some shit down and figured it out.

3106
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.240
Most people not going to get there.

3107
01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:13.390
Most 25 year olds today are half retarded.

3108
01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:16.800
Try having a conversation with the average 25 year old.

3109
01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:17.620
Don't worry.

3110
01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.710
Their awareness is going to compensate for that and believe you me,

3111
01:33:20.711 --> 01:33:23.800
I know that a lot of you out there that are 25 are way fucking smarter than me.

3112
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:24.760
Don't get me wrong.

3113
01:33:24.761 --> 01:33:25.780
I'm not saying it's you,

3114
01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.040
but you know those other dudes,

3115
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:30.070
Joe Bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

3116
01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:33.070
That's the proverb that applies to this whole short term thing.

3117
01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:33.731
If you think,

3118
01:33:33.731 --> 01:33:35.740
I might not even be alive to profit off this stuff,

3119
01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:37.720
but I can profit off it today,

3120
01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:39.300
what are you going to know about that?

3121
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.641
I mean,

3122
01:33:39.641 --> 01:33:43.210
back then you're dealing with like a whole society that was sort of structured

3123
01:33:43.211 --> 01:33:48.211
on people that never got old enough or never had exposure to enough data to,

3124
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:50.583
to sort of go,

3125
01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:51.453
ah,

3126
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:53.830
I don't think we should have a Caesar.

3127
01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:55.790
I don't think we should have this coliseum.

3128
01:33:55.791 --> 01:33:55.941
Hey,

3129
01:33:55.941 --> 01:33:57.820
this whole lions versus Christians thing,

3130
01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.650
this is kind of fucked man.

3131
01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:00.820
Let's not to that.

3132
01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:02.560
But that's what I Dorson was cool.

3133
01:34:02.561 --> 01:34:03.280
It was so cool with,

3134
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.640
because that's exactly what it t's.

3135
01:34:04.641 --> 01:34:06.310
He's the ugly side,

3136
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.811
easy,

3137
01:34:06.811 --> 01:34:09.250
insanely strong and in some way getting stronger.

3138
01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:13.850
The potential for optimism there also that's also happening and it's one of

3139
01:34:13.851 --> 01:34:14.920
those racist where you're like,

3140
01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:15.460
hmm,

3141
01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:16.420
that's an interesting one.

3142
01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:18.490
You can put the accent on either one.

3143
01:34:18.491 --> 01:34:21.880
The reality is that they are both real well sort of what we were also talking

3144
01:34:21.881 --> 01:34:23.530
about about competition earlier,

3145
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.910
that the Yin and the Yang.

3146
01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.890
It's almost like you need opposing forces.

3147
01:34:26.891 --> 01:34:28.060
You need a pull and a push.

3148
01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:31.300
You need something in order to motivate change.

3149
01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:37.200
It's almost the idea is that in order for society to get great or get better and

3150
01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:42.880
it has to go through stupid shit and if it doesn't go through stupid shit,

3151
01:34:42.881 --> 01:34:43.780
it never gets anywhere.

3152
01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:44.530
That's great.

3153
01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:45.850
I'm curious for,

3154
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.550
I had a question for Dan on that because I don't,

3155
01:34:48.551 --> 01:34:49.450
these are gonna be your review.

3156
01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:50.350
I mean there is a law.

3157
01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.041
You're allowed to.

3158
01:34:51.041 --> 01:34:51.461
Don't worry.

3159
01:34:51.461 --> 01:34:52.180
I'm okay.

3160
01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.140
Everybody else does.

3161
01:34:54.210 --> 01:34:54.580
No.

3162
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.031
But no,

3163
01:34:55.031 --> 01:34:57.590
I actually most days that's exactly I feel,

3164
01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:58.070
and even

3165
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.910
<v 2>the days that I don't,</v>

3166
01:34:58.911 --> 01:35:00.380
I still feel that there's a lot of it.

3167
01:35:00.381 --> 01:35:00.890
That's true.

3168
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:05.890
So the point to me is how do you turn that awareness that our stock up against

3169
01:35:06.861 --> 01:35:07.640
some seeing,

3170
01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:07.901
you know,

3171
01:35:07.901 --> 01:35:10.430
Yara Nan to trying to attack a tank.

3172
01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:10.761
You know,

3173
01:35:10.761 --> 01:35:11.720
you are the odds.

3174
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:12.920
What you can do,

3175
01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:14.630
not even as it needs single individual,

3176
01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:18.020
but even in mass level feel sometimes so limited.

3177
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:19.310
And uh,

3178
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:21.320
ow do you wake up in the morning,

3179
01:35:21.321 --> 01:35:21.531
you know,

3180
01:35:21.531 --> 01:35:24.710
how do you deal with the Fed that you have a lot of armies drinks,

3181
01:35:24.711 --> 01:35:28.070
whiskey powers down double espresso shots.

3182
01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:29.660
Some of that is true.

3183
01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:36.530
<v 3>I actually talk about this on our political show because when you feel the most</v>

3184
01:35:36.710 --> 01:35:38.780
upset about things in the most powerless,

3185
01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:42.890
you start to wonder about the wisdom of caring about this stuff.

3186
01:35:42.891 --> 01:35:44.390
And you look at people who don't.

3187
01:35:44.770 --> 01:35:45.041
I mean,

3188
01:35:45.041 --> 01:35:48.080
I think we all know people who don't pay any attention to politics,

3189
01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.430
who don't watch the news,

3190
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.850
whose life is a very,

3191
01:35:51.190 --> 01:35:51.351
you know,

3192
01:35:51.351 --> 01:35:52.131
it's my kids,

3193
01:35:52.131 --> 01:35:52.821
it's my wife,

3194
01:35:52.821 --> 01:35:53.541
it's my job.

3195
01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:53.631
And,

3196
01:35:53.631 --> 01:35:54.260
and,

3197
01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:58.070
and there are times when I questioned the wisdom of caring about things you

3198
01:35:58.071 --> 01:35:58.980
cannot change.

3199
01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.110
Then someone else will say,

3200
01:36:00.111 --> 01:36:00.360
well,

3201
01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:00.491
the,

3202
01:36:00.491 --> 01:36:01.340
that kind of attitude,

3203
01:36:01.341 --> 01:36:02.240
you can be guaranteed.

3204
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:03.074
You won't change it.

3205
01:36:03.710 --> 01:36:04.251
Yes.

3206
01:36:04.251 --> 01:36:08.480
But there are some forces at work that if you alone have to do it,

3207
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:09.950
it is an ant against a tank.

3208
01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:10.340
Right?

3209
01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:10.600
And,

3210
01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:10.861
and,

3211
01:36:10.861 --> 01:36:12.500
and at some point you look and you go,

3212
01:36:12.501 --> 01:36:12.801
okay,

3213
01:36:12.801 --> 01:36:15.090
it's me and Rogan and Danieli and,

3214
01:36:15.091 --> 01:36:15.441
and,

3215
01:36:15.441 --> 01:36:16.790
and that's not enough.

3216
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:18.650
I might as well do what I can.

3217
01:36:18.651 --> 01:36:18.950
What's the,

3218
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:20.150
in the 1960s he used to say,

3219
01:36:20.151 --> 01:36:20.650
you know,

3220
01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:20.810
Oh,

3221
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:21.800
look at the man in the mirror.

3222
01:36:21.801 --> 01:36:23.090
Take care of yourself first.

3223
01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:25.070
Sometimes that's all you can control.

3224
01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.080
But if that's the way you look at it,

3225
01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:29.420
you're letting the Dick Cheney's I'm using him as my,

3226
01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:29.750
my,

3227
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:32.330
my Darth Vader figure for everything today.

3228
01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:33.140
But I mean,

3229
01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.340
then you let them win.

3230
01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.810
<v 2>Could you imagine if you've got Dick Cheney high on mushrooms?</v>

3231
01:36:37.450 --> 01:36:38.350
I'm not sure it,

3232
01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:41.220
that he wasn't the whole time explaining some things.

3233
01:36:41.221 --> 01:36:43.650
He would never have that sort of the mushrooms.

3234
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.680
You thought he shot that friend of his just totally sober and straight.

3235
01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:46.771
Oh,

3236
01:36:46.771 --> 01:36:47.430
who's drunk?

3237
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.750
Okay,

3238
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:48.480
well,

3239
01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:49.470
well he's clearly not.

3240
01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:49.711
He was,

3241
01:36:49.711 --> 01:36:52.380
not only was he drunk and not clearly drinking,

3242
01:36:52.381 --> 01:36:55.870
but he avoided the police for like 13 or 14 ounces.

3243
01:36:55.890 --> 01:36:57.870
There weren't secret service guys there too.

3244
01:36:57.871 --> 01:37:01.320
How do you not tell him to push and put the gun down pointed toward the ground?

3245
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:02.250
That's how you know how,

3246
01:37:02.251 --> 01:37:03.570
what a real gangster is.

3247
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.880
He shot his friend in the face and his friend apologize.

3248
01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:06.580
Yeah.

3249
01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:06.900
Yeah.

3250
01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:08.070
That is actually very good.

3251
01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:09.660
That is a good at his friend was like,

3252
01:37:09.661 --> 01:37:10.411
I'm really sorry.

3253
01:37:10.411 --> 01:37:11.360
Dick's a great guy.

3254
01:37:11.730 --> 01:37:13.820
I didn't mean to cause you all this trouble with the medium.

3255
01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:14.653
Mr Cheney,

3256
01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:17.370
my facing the path of your bullet.

3257
01:37:17.371 --> 01:37:20.130
I'll try to bird like in my movement,

3258
01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.153
I'm tricky.

3259
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:26.070
I think like a bird sometimes in a hunting birds and he'd probably tuned into

3260
01:37:26.071 --> 01:37:26.904
that vibe.

3261
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.750
She shot me in my fucking therapist.

3262
01:37:28.770 --> 01:37:30.090
There've been times that I've been,

3263
01:37:30.091 --> 01:37:30.331
you know,

3264
01:37:30.331 --> 01:37:32.360
we just carrying the weapon quite wrong and not,

3265
01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:32.870
you know,

3266
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:35.040
where's the secret service to take credit for that?

3267
01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:37.170
Why didn't they say they accidentally shot the dude?

3268
01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:40.350
Why the fuck did you tell if they're willing to take a bullet for somebody?

3269
01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.641
How did that go?

3270
01:37:41.641 --> 01:37:43.770
How'd the guy not say accidentally shot himself?

3271
01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:44.790
But nothing that happens.

3272
01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:45.090
Right?

3273
01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:45.923
So it doesn't matter.

3274
01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:48.390
It's not a bird shot in the face.

3275
01:37:48.391 --> 01:37:48.820
You know,

3276
01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:51.150
birds shot is very small people.

3277
01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.370
I'm not saying try,

3278
01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:56.280
try a wad and you've got a few mannequins that we could conduct

3279
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.240
<v 3>some experiments on.</v>

3280
01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:57.660
You know,

3281
01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:59.610
how does that alien thing handled the bird shot?

3282
01:37:59.810 --> 01:37:59.991
<v 4>Well,</v>

3283
01:37:59.991 --> 01:38:01.400
there's a reason why it's so small.

3284
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:02.960
When you're shooting to something like a pheasant,

3285
01:38:02.961 --> 01:38:04.760
you can't really shoot it with a fucking 12 gauge.

3286
01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:06.200
It'll blow a hole through the cruise,

3287
01:38:06.201 --> 01:38:08.060
the meal up to later useless.

3288
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.751
You filled,

3289
01:38:08.751 --> 01:38:10.010
it's filled with little pellets.

3290
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:12.410
The fucking half the thing is blown apart.

3291
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:14.120
So you've got to have like a little,

3292
01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.990
so that's what the old guy got hit with just a little baby bird shot in the

3293
01:38:17.991 --> 01:38:18.590
face.

3294
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:19.400
No biggie.

3295
01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:20.233
Tough it out.

3296
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:22.610
Now Dick's got a new heart and that's hilarious.

3297
01:38:23.150 --> 01:38:25.880
What do imagine if you had a new heart and then they put it in and he just

3298
01:38:25.881 --> 01:38:29.570
started fucking feeling really regretful for everything and started writing.

3299
01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:30.670
<v 3>Did you hear the line?</v>

3300
01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:32.680
He said that he hit and I didn't read the story.

3301
01:38:32.681 --> 01:38:35.260
Sometimes I just read headlines so you just have to ignore me on this.

3302
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.670
But,

3303
01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:38.260
but do you remember that story about Dick Cheney where he said he feared having

3304
01:38:38.261 --> 01:38:39.700
these heart hacked or whatever?

3305
01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:43.030
Of course he did because he knew because he knew what he would have done in the

3306
01:38:43.031 --> 01:38:43.870
same situation.

3307
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:46.580
<v 4>Luli I'm hacking Joe Rogan's heart right now,</v>

3308
01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:51.470
which leads me to believe you and I had exchanged a couple of tweets and emails

3309
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.660
regarding this Michael Hastings thing.

3310
01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:55.040
Fascinating.

3311
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:57.890
That whole story was Michael Hastings,

3312
01:38:57.891 --> 01:39:02.891
the journalist who was very aggressive towards members of the military and uh,

3313
01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.460
he was aggressive toward everybody.

3314
01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.120
Yes.

3315
01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:09.980
Very aggressive and aggressive towards like these guys who are fucking killers

3316
01:39:09.981 --> 01:39:11.450
on a global scale.

3317
01:39:11.451 --> 01:39:11.900
You know,

3318
01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:14.240
when you get to be a four star general or what have you,

3319
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:16.600
like you're fucking real good at killing people.

3320
01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:17.240
You know,

3321
01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.470
there's no other way around it.

3322
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:19.370
No other way to get to that.

3323
01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:22.460
And this guy was being aggressive towards them.

3324
01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:23.590
Have you changed your mind?

3325
01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.240
I have you altered your view on that hall?

3326
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:26.210
I have zero opinion.

3327
01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.430
I don't have an opinion one way or the other.

3328
01:39:28.431 --> 01:39:29.270
I looked at it,

3329
01:39:29.690 --> 01:39:33.380
watched the video of the car slamming into the tree and I thought,

3330
01:39:33.381 --> 01:39:33.741
wow,

3331
01:39:33.741 --> 01:39:35.780
that was most likely,

3332
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:36.260
uh,

3333
01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:36.800
you know,

3334
01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.980
some sort of a,

3335
01:39:37.981 --> 01:39:41.600
a remote control device that caused him to slam.

3336
01:39:41.630 --> 01:39:43.010
That's when I started reading that.

3337
01:39:43.011 --> 01:39:43.844
People said that.

3338
01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:48.740
But I've also read that a lot of people believe that he was unstable and a lot

3339
01:39:48.741 --> 01:39:50.600
of people believe that he might've been doing drugs.

3340
01:39:50.650 --> 01:39:51.620
And that's possible too.

3341
01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:52.071
I mean,

3342
01:39:52.071 --> 01:39:55.610
the kind of guy who was so risk taking that he's willing to go after generals,

3343
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.250
like that Kinda guy might do a lot of wild shit.

3344
01:39:58.800 --> 01:39:59.420
Right.

3345
01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:01.160
I think it's possible though,

3346
01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:02.540
that they can do that to a car.

3347
01:40:02.690 --> 01:40:04.520
I think that's what I've gained from this.

3348
01:40:04.670 --> 01:40:07.430
What I've gained from this is by reading the experts,

3349
01:40:07.431 --> 01:40:08.840
the technology experts,

3350
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:11.840
that people that have no vested interest in this politically one way or the

3351
01:40:11.841 --> 01:40:12.350
other,

3352
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:14.060
we're in a Hastings fan or Denier,

3353
01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:18.650
the people that looked at the possibilities for what you can do with a remote

3354
01:40:18.651 --> 01:40:20.510
control system in a car now.

3355
01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:21.620
And they can do it.

3356
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:22.310
They can,

3357
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:23.660
they can make your car do things.

3358
01:40:23.690 --> 01:40:28.690
And the people that are formerly in the CIA have come out about it and said that

3359
01:40:29.511 --> 01:40:33.110
they believe that the technology exists and it makes sense,

3360
01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:33.380
right?

3361
01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:34.370
<v 5>Even before it exists.</v>

3362
01:40:34.371 --> 01:40:34.451
The,

3363
01:40:34.451 --> 01:40:38.920
remember the guy who had done all the exposing of the CIA crack cocaine

3364
01:40:38.921 --> 01:40:39.551
epidemic,

3365
01:40:39.551 --> 01:40:43.420
like basic called accusing the CIO for heavy now with the Latin American drug

3366
01:40:43.421 --> 01:40:45.370
lords weapon to be their friends.

3367
01:40:45.371 --> 01:40:47.110
Which guys is very seal.

3368
01:40:47.170 --> 01:40:47.351
You know,

3369
01:40:47.351 --> 01:40:48.460
I can't fucking remember the name.

3370
01:40:48.461 --> 01:40:49.930
I just don't remember that he was,

3371
01:40:49.931 --> 01:40:50.470
um,

3372
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:52.870
he owns the ray quarter for IVN quote,

3373
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:54.010
killed himself

3374
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.750
<v 0>by shooting himself with a shotgun.</v>

3375
01:40:55.751 --> 01:40:56.111
So far,

3376
01:40:56.111 --> 01:40:57.490
nothing strange twice,

3377
01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:00.700
which seems a bit complicated to pull off.

3378
01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:04.060
<v 3>The most interesting thing about the Hastings thing to me now,</v>

3379
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:04.710
because I can't,

3380
01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:04.830
I,

3381
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:05.061
I'm,

3382
01:41:05.061 --> 01:41:05.531
I'm with you.

3383
01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:08.380
I don't know what you could figure out from Hastings based on what we know.

3384
01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:12.160
I was fascinated and this gets to your new media thing,

3385
01:41:12.161 --> 01:41:14.770
all the information out there and it also gets to yours,

3386
01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:15.440
uh,

3387
01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:18.820
Daniella about about false information or muddying the waters.

3388
01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:24.180
Do you realize how much of what circulated the glow about this Hastings thing

3389
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:26.800
came from that one source,

3390
01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:31.980
that part time contributor to that local news station in San Diego that Kim

3391
01:41:32.231 --> 01:41:34.030
devor act a woman,

3392
01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:35.830
she's the one who said things like,

3393
01:41:35.831 --> 01:41:36.161
wow,

3394
01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:37.420
there was no body in the coffin.

3395
01:41:37.421 --> 01:41:38.470
And everyone was upset with that.

3396
01:41:38.471 --> 01:41:40.060
Well that turned out to be totally false,

3397
01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.410
but oh my lord.

3398
01:41:41.411 --> 01:41:42.580
Did we all share that?

3399
01:41:42.581 --> 01:41:43.720
And did everybody hear that?

3400
01:41:43.721 --> 01:41:45.460
Most people not ever hear the retracted,

3401
01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:49.360
that one person sang something that was not true.

3402
01:41:49.690 --> 01:41:53.350
Created that so much of the foundation for where we all started.

3403
01:41:53.351 --> 01:41:54.610
Cause that's when I freaked out and I said,

3404
01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:55.330
wait a minute.

3405
01:41:55.330 --> 01:41:55.481
You know,

3406
01:41:55.481 --> 01:41:58.930
the coroner didn't give the body back and cremated it without permission.

3407
01:41:58.931 --> 01:41:59.500
That is tea.

3408
01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:02.710
If you've ever dealt with coroners and that's just not kosher.

3409
01:42:02.711 --> 01:42:04.420
And that turned out to be turned out to be not true.

3410
01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:06.520
And I don't think she ever retracted it but,

3411
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:07.540
but the one,

3412
01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:07.781
you know,

3413
01:42:07.781 --> 01:42:10.480
in the old days they used to make us confirm sources twice.

3414
01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:14.350
She's in the position where she's supposed to be confirming sources twice.

3415
01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:19.590
She says that the San Diego News station runs it multiple times and then we all

3416
01:42:19.811 --> 01:42:24.190
retweet it and share it and it becomes part of the urban legend almost.

3417
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.920
But that,

3418
01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.280
that,

3419
01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.920
that a single strand one person was able to do that with the global sharing and

3420
01:42:29.921 --> 01:42:30.700
everything.

3421
01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:33.040
That to me is as fascinating as the Hastings thing.

3422
01:42:33.150 --> 01:42:33.780
<v 0>I agree.</v>

3423
01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.280
I think it's just as fascinating.

3424
01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:35.711
Uh,

3425
01:42:35.711 --> 01:42:36.660
and the,

3426
01:42:36.661 --> 01:42:36.871
the,

3427
01:42:36.871 --> 01:42:41.730
the real desire to know one way or another is just a natural part of human

3428
01:42:41.731 --> 01:42:42.301
curiosity.

3429
01:42:42.301 --> 01:42:47.301
We want to know that someone assassinate this guy or did he go wacky and drive a

3430
01:42:47.610 --> 01:42:48.420
hundred miles an hour into a tree?

3431
01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:49.620
Both are possible.

3432
01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:50.731
The reality is,

3433
01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:51.630
I don't know.

3434
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.950
And so you know,

3435
01:42:52.951 --> 01:42:54.000
I say when you say,

3436
01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:55.080
did I change my opinion?

3437
01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.101
I don't have an opinion.

3438
01:42:56.101 --> 01:42:57.300
When I first looked at it and I said,

3439
01:42:57.301 --> 01:42:57.511
wow,

3440
01:42:57.511 --> 01:42:58.321
that looks like that,

3441
01:42:58.321 --> 01:43:00.000
but I wouldn't be betting on it.

3442
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.360
Right.

3443
01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.000
You know,

3444
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.550
a lot of weird shit happens.

3445
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:03.930
Just naturally

3446
01:43:04.110 --> 01:43:04.590
<v 3>get rid of.</v>

3447
01:43:04.590 --> 01:43:05.460
There's another element,

3448
01:43:05.461 --> 01:43:05.790
Joey,

3449
01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:08.280
and the element is is an US versus them kind of thing.

3450
01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:08.551
Right?

3451
01:43:08.551 --> 01:43:10.410
I mean we felt people like yours truly.

3452
01:43:10.411 --> 01:43:10.651
Anyway.

3453
01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:12.630
It felt like Hastings was on our side of the fence.

3454
01:43:12.631 --> 01:43:13.110
Right.

3455
01:43:13.110 --> 01:43:14.820
He's reporting on stuff that we're going,

3456
01:43:14.821 --> 01:43:17.610
thank goodness finally somebody is doing this right.

3457
01:43:17.850 --> 01:43:19.440
And then all of a sudden he's gone.

3458
01:43:19.710 --> 01:43:20.880
And in a weird situation,

3459
01:43:20.881 --> 01:43:22.590
I mean I think the tendency is to say,

3460
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:26.250
one of our guys got it in the neck and he got it in the neck for doing something

3461
01:43:26.251 --> 01:43:27.420
that we've been waiting for someone to do.

3462
01:43:27.421 --> 01:43:29.370
And what does this say to the other people out there?

3463
01:43:29.371 --> 01:43:30.720
We would hope would so,

3464
01:43:30.721 --> 01:43:31.500
I mean,

3465
01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:31.811
I don't,

3466
01:43:31.811 --> 01:43:33.060
I wouldn't want to say teams,

3467
01:43:33.061 --> 01:43:35.010
but there's a part of me that says to me,

3468
01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.110
I don't know if I would have liked the guy on a personal level,

3469
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:40.470
but he was on my side and I feel like God,

3470
01:43:40.471 --> 01:43:41.370
the powers that be,

3471
01:43:41.371 --> 01:43:42.690
have everybody on their side.

3472
01:43:42.691 --> 01:43:42.931
I mean,

3473
01:43:42.931 --> 01:43:43.171
so,

3474
01:43:43.171 --> 01:43:43.621
so I mean,

3475
01:43:43.621 --> 01:43:44.454
there was a feeling like,

3476
01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:47.910
please tell me that somebody working for the good of all of us didn't get

3477
01:43:47.911 --> 01:43:48.690
knocked off.

3478
01:43:48.690 --> 01:43:49.830
I don't think he did.

3479
01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:52.130
But there's certainly that where you just go,

3480
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.400
what sort of a message to descend to other would be Michael Hastings is,

3481
01:43:55.401 --> 01:43:56.151
you don't think he did,

3482
01:43:56.151 --> 01:43:56.860
but would you be

3483
01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:58.300
<v 4>prize if you found out he did?</v>

3484
01:43:58.750 --> 01:43:59.500
If he did get not,

3485
01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.850
you found out he got knocked out.

3486
01:44:00.851 --> 01:44:01.490
I wouldn't be.

3487
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:03.230
<v 3>There's a book called poisoning the press,</v>

3488
01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:03.500
um,

3489
01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:06.290
concerning a reporter who was the Michael Hastings of his day,

3490
01:44:06.291 --> 01:44:09.530
but a thousand times bigger named Jack Anderson from the early seventies.

3491
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:13.280
And Anderson actually had the Nixon administration officials,

3492
01:44:13.281 --> 01:44:14.720
Haldeman Ehrlichman,

3493
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:18.470
those guys talking about potentially killing him.

3494
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:19.180
Um,

3495
01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:19.490
um,

3496
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:21.710
a guy who show I was on several times,

3497
01:44:21.711 --> 01:44:22.690
g Gordon Liddy,

3498
01:44:22.691 --> 01:44:23.000
ah,

3499
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.310
Liddy was volunteering to kill him.

3500
01:44:25.311 --> 01:44:27.740
They were going to run him over with a car.

3501
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:29.240
Now I always think to myself,

3502
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:29.601
okay,

3503
01:44:29.601 --> 01:44:29.930
so the,

3504
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:31.220
so the plot never happened,

3505
01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.480
but they were discussing it at the highest levels of government and that's what

3506
01:44:35.481 --> 01:44:36.230
makes you go,

3507
01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:38.660
maybe this Hastings thing isn't that far off the wall.

3508
01:44:38.661 --> 01:44:39.230
I mean,

3509
01:44:39.230 --> 01:44:40.820
I don't think it's far off the wall at all.

3510
01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:42.050
I just don't know what happened.

3511
01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:42.470
Yeah,

3512
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.621
no,

3513
01:44:42.621 --> 01:44:43.061
me either.

3514
01:44:43.061 --> 01:44:43.880
I'm not at all.

3515
01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:46.660
And I tend to go with the safer answer when in doubt.

3516
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:49.340
I mean that's the nice way of not looking stupid too,

3517
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:51.470
which is of course my goal in life.

3518
01:44:51.471 --> 01:44:52.070
Right.

3519
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.701
That's too late.

3520
01:44:52.701 --> 01:44:53.181
Too late.

3521
01:44:53.181 --> 01:44:53.531
Exactly.

3522
01:44:53.531 --> 01:44:53.961
Me Too.

3523
01:44:53.961 --> 01:44:58.490
So I just dive right into the stupid side all the time because the,

3524
01:44:58.491 --> 01:44:59.570
what if is always there.

3525
01:44:59.630 --> 01:45:01.220
That's what they're grading us on a curve.

3526
01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:01.481
<v 4>Well,</v>

3527
01:45:01.481 --> 01:45:04.390
that's the on an unfortunate reality of history,

3528
01:45:04.391 --> 01:45:04.930
isn't it?

3529
01:45:04.930 --> 01:45:06.910
That if you really do pay attention and go,

3530
01:45:06.911 --> 01:45:07.271
wow,

3531
01:45:07.271 --> 01:45:08.380
they've done it before.

3532
01:45:08.590 --> 01:45:08.921
Well,

3533
01:45:08.921 --> 01:45:10.000
there's been consumed.

3534
01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:10.331
You know,

3535
01:45:10.331 --> 01:45:11.290
people can inspire.

3536
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:12.190
They've gotten away with it.

3537
01:45:12.191 --> 01:45:12.731
They did.

3538
01:45:12.731 --> 01:45:14.080
They did false flags.

3539
01:45:14.081 --> 01:45:16.180
They lied to get us into wars.

3540
01:45:16.181 --> 01:45:18.670
They lied about a certain actions that were going on.

3541
01:45:18.671 --> 01:45:22.300
They SAS unaided people lied about that and then got caught and they had a short

3542
01:45:22.301 --> 01:45:23.051
term in south.

3543
01:45:23.051 --> 01:45:23.561
Same thing.

3544
01:45:23.561 --> 01:45:24.110
Yes.

3545
01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:24.850
Always.

3546
01:45:24.850 --> 01:45:25.600
Always has been.

3547
01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:29.080
The thing that's weird is though when people are doing the exact opposite of

3548
01:45:29.081 --> 01:45:29.950
what we're doing right now,

3549
01:45:29.951 --> 01:45:30.401
which is,

3550
01:45:30.401 --> 01:45:31.180
you know,

3551
01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:32.470
he could have gone this way.

3552
01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:33.641
It could have also,

3553
01:45:33.641 --> 01:45:34.720
or at least a Culligan this way.

3554
01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:36.520
I don't have the evidence either way.

3555
01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:37.391
Uh,

3556
01:45:37.391 --> 01:45:40.130
and people bad their lives one way or another.

3557
01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:41.093
Yeah,

3558
01:45:41.110 --> 01:45:42.160
I know what a disease,

3559
01:45:42.161 --> 01:45:43.900
what happened and there's these conspiracy or no,

3560
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:45.010
you're totally full of shit.

3561
01:45:45.010 --> 01:45:46.030
He could never happen.

3562
01:45:46.031 --> 01:45:47.680
And he's like out the fuck that you know.

3563
01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:51.970
I got a out of an argument online the other day on my message board about the

3564
01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.470
JFK assassination.

3565
01:45:53.530 --> 01:45:55.120
I get to that when I just go,

3566
01:45:55.121 --> 01:45:55.631
okay,

3567
01:45:55.631 --> 01:45:56.464
I'm good.

3568
01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:57.430
I got to step away.

3569
01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.530
I know too much about the JFK assassination.

3570
01:45:59.531 --> 01:46:04.531
I've studied it for far too long and it drives me absolutely fucking bonkers

3571
01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:09.340
when I see people that are 100% convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,

3572
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:09.850
right?

3573
01:46:09.850 --> 01:46:10.683
I'm like,

3574
01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:13.150
I don't know if we Harvey Oswald acted alone,

3575
01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:14.021
but guess what?

3576
01:46:14.021 --> 01:46:15.730
Fuck face you don't either.

3577
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:20.860
And the reality of the evidence is not that cut and dry.

3578
01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:24.760
The Warren Commission itself as a massive contradictions.

3579
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:30.030
It was clearly designed to achieve a predetermined conclusion and they ignored

3580
01:46:30.641 --> 01:46:34.150
all evidence that went contrary to that predetermined conclusion.

3581
01:46:34.151 --> 01:46:36.070
And that conclusion was there was a single shooter.

3582
01:46:36.370 --> 01:46:37.300
<v 3>Are we going to go into this?</v>

3583
01:46:37.301 --> 01:46:38.010
Is this,

3584
01:46:38.010 --> 01:46:39.700
are you opening this topic for discussion?

3585
01:46:39.701 --> 01:46:40.534
Not I'm not.

3586
01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:42.070
My message board will love.

3587
01:46:42.071 --> 01:46:43.030
My point is,

3588
01:46:43.031 --> 01:46:43.220
is

3589
01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:45.020
<v 4>that when I see people argue,</v>

3590
01:46:45.021 --> 01:46:47.150
I don't know if he acted alone and he might've acted alone.

3591
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.470
I leave that open.

3592
01:46:48.471 --> 01:46:52.020
But when you see that stupid bullet that supposedly went through both of their

3593
01:46:52.021 --> 01:46:55.800
bodies and shattered bone and came out looking all pretty and beautiful,

3594
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.341
you're like,

3595
01:46:56.341 --> 01:46:57.780
get the fuck Outta here.

3596
01:46:57.781 --> 01:47:01.440
Well that just showed up on governor Connally's Gurney at the,

3597
01:47:01.441 --> 01:47:02.131
at the hospital.

3598
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:05.760
It just magically was there in perfect shape and just happened to be from the

3599
01:47:05.761 --> 01:47:06.301
same rifle.

3600
01:47:06.301 --> 01:47:10.350
The you're attributing to the guy who's dead now who got shot by a fucking mob,

3601
01:47:10.351 --> 01:47:11.180
man.

3602
01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:12.013
Come on

3603
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.651
<v 3>now.</v>

3604
01:47:12.651 --> 01:47:13.484
I have to jump.

3605
01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:15.890
I changed my mind on this subject.

3606
01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.061
Look at that bullet,

3607
01:47:17.061 --> 01:47:17.650
Dan Carlin.

3608
01:47:17.650 --> 01:47:19.420
I've seen the magic bullet pile.

3609
01:47:19.810 --> 01:47:21.270
And you know what's funny is that I,

3610
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:23.180
I don't dispute any of those things.

3611
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:28.040
What if the government had a really good reason that you would have approved of

3612
01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:28.770
to kill a cop,

3613
01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:29.870
not to cover it up.

3614
01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:33.770
And we're doing a podcast on the first world war right now.

3615
01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:36.980
And Kennedy was famous for having given the guns of August,

3616
01:47:36.981 --> 01:47:39.890
the book that's about to lead into world war one and how nations were kind of

3617
01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:43.670
sucked into something they didn't want to do based on an assassination of a

3618
01:47:43.671 --> 01:47:46.160
world leader sitting in an open car next to his wife,

3619
01:47:46.161 --> 01:47:46.820
by the way.

3620
01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:47.610
Um,

3621
01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:48.070
and,

3622
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:50.780
and if you're Lyndon Johnson and your,

3623
01:47:50.781 --> 01:47:54.830
the people around Kennedy and it's a year after the Cuban missile crisis,

3624
01:47:54.831 --> 01:47:54.980
right?

3625
01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:59.980
You almost have world war three a year ago and a guy kills a young popular

3626
01:48:00.321 --> 01:48:02.000
president in front of his wife who was,

3627
01:48:02.001 --> 01:48:02.181
you know,

3628
01:48:02.181 --> 01:48:05.960
in there and in the Chanel close with the blood and brains all on her and his

3629
01:48:05.961 --> 01:48:07.940
children are orphaned and you're mad as hell.

3630
01:48:08.210 --> 01:48:11.450
And the guys tied to communism like nothing.

3631
01:48:11.451 --> 01:48:11.661
I mean,

3632
01:48:11.661 --> 01:48:13.340
he's fair play for Cuba Committee.

3633
01:48:13.341 --> 01:48:15.500
He's one of the few people who defected to the Soviet Union.

3634
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:17.510
He's one of the very few that came back.

3635
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:22.810
Would you maybe be worried that the American people would be so angry and so

3636
01:48:23.031 --> 01:48:27.650
ready to somehow punish the communists who may have even been behind this

3637
01:48:27.651 --> 01:48:28.484
attack?

3638
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:29.383
I mean there's,

3639
01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:33.800
you can create a scenario where it might've been a national security interests.

3640
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:34.161
Two,

3641
01:48:34.161 --> 01:48:36.380
as much as you can disassociate Cuba,

3642
01:48:36.381 --> 01:48:37.041
communism,

3643
01:48:37.041 --> 01:48:39.260
and the Soviet Union from the assassination of the president.

3644
01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:40.910
Because even if it didn't happen,

3645
01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:43.420
can you see the Republicans and the administration back then going,

3646
01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.240
we need to do,

3647
01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:46.840
you can't let them get away with potentially shooting our president was not to

3648
01:48:46.841 --> 01:48:47.481
invade Cuba.

3649
01:48:47.481 --> 01:48:47.870
What?

3650
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:48.320
I mean,

3651
01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:49.430
I'm a little confused

3652
01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:55.580
<v 4>plying that you think that they made it look like Lee Harvey Oswald didn't do it</v>

3653
01:48:55.581 --> 01:48:56.630
because if he did do it,

3654
01:48:56.631 --> 01:48:58.370
then that's communism killing the process.

3655
01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:58.791
<v 3>No,</v>

3656
01:48:58.791 --> 01:48:59.481
I think,

3657
01:48:59.481 --> 01:49:00.910
I think what most of us won't,

3658
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:02.330
when I was on the side saying that,

3659
01:49:02.331 --> 01:49:05.780
I think there was a conspiracy is you point to all the obvious things the

3660
01:49:05.781 --> 01:49:08.450
government hit and that that to me is always a red herring.

3661
01:49:08.451 --> 01:49:08.601
Right?

3662
01:49:08.601 --> 01:49:10.910
You said where they hid the magic bullet couldn't have been this and that,

3663
01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:12.110
and then you start to think,

3664
01:49:12.530 --> 01:49:12.770
well,

3665
01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:15.140
would there have been a good reason for a government coverup?

3666
01:49:15.170 --> 01:49:15.261
Well,

3667
01:49:15.261 --> 01:49:17.390
the first good reason is because they did it right.

3668
01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:17.721
So you go,

3669
01:49:17.721 --> 01:49:18.560
well bastards.

3670
01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:21.890
Could there be a reason where you would sit there and go,

3671
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.551
oh no,

3672
01:49:22.551 --> 01:49:23.750
I understand why you did that.

3673
01:49:23.751 --> 01:49:25.520
You did that to prevent a greater evil,

3674
01:49:25.670 --> 01:49:27.050
and I'm not saying that that's the case,

3675
01:49:27.051 --> 01:49:28.220
but once you sit back and do that,

3676
01:49:28.221 --> 01:49:28.760
you go,

3677
01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.260
there could be multiple reasons.

3678
01:49:30.261 --> 01:49:31.094
So you're saying

3679
01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.310
<v 4>blame it on Lee Harvey Oswald instead of blaming it on the Cuban?</v>

3680
01:49:34.450 --> 01:49:35.283
<v 3>No,</v>

3681
01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:40.340
I try to obscure the idea that this was something involving communist Cubans and

3682
01:49:42.191 --> 01:49:42.490
I think,

3683
01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:42.851
I think,

3684
01:49:42.851 --> 01:49:47.851
can you imagine if Oswald had actually had to take the stand someday and testify

3685
01:49:48.401 --> 01:49:49.570
about this and talk?

3686
01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.240
I mean this may have been the thing where the government said,

3687
01:49:52.241 --> 01:49:52.541
listen,

3688
01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:54.220
this is just one guy who did this,

3689
01:49:54.221 --> 01:49:58.240
but it's going to open up a whole can of worms with the political opposition.

3690
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.631
I mean,

3691
01:49:58.631 --> 01:49:59.380
remember there were,

3692
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:01.720
there were posters of John F.

3693
01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:05.920
Kennedy saying wanted for treason in Dallas the day he was killed,

3694
01:50:05.921 --> 01:50:07.750
that the right wingers down there had pushed.

3695
01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:11.890
What do you think they would say of Lee Harvey Oswald is tied to communism so

3696
01:50:11.891 --> 01:50:16.891
closely a year after we just avoided world war three that's a really stoned

3697
01:50:17.561 --> 01:50:18.131
idea.

3698
01:50:18.131 --> 01:50:21.640
I think you must've been hitting a bong hardcore

3699
01:50:21.930 --> 01:50:24.810
<v 2>and you decided to do multiple angles,</v>

3700
01:50:24.811 --> 01:50:25.280
baby.

3701
01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:25.440
Hey,

3702
01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:26.251
you may be right.

3703
01:50:26.251 --> 01:50:26.521
I mean,

3704
01:50:26.521 --> 01:50:26.880
look,

3705
01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.080
I'm not asserting that.

3706
01:50:28.081 --> 01:50:30.940
I'm saying you got to throw it into the minute you do.

3707
01:50:31.050 --> 01:50:34.250
It's probably a lot of way the game where you throw all the other stuff into the

3708
01:50:34.251 --> 01:50:34.470
middle.

3709
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:36.080
The Grassy Knoll Ruby

3710
01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.700
<v 4>had a direct connection to the mob.</v>

3711
01:50:37.701 --> 01:50:39.290
The mob had a direct connection to Cuba.

3712
01:50:39.291 --> 01:50:40.460
Those three things are,

3713
01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:41.481
that's a fact.

3714
01:50:41.481 --> 01:50:46.481
Those are facts and so Jack Ruby was assigned to go kill Lee Harvey Oswald in

3715
01:50:46.731 --> 01:50:47.564
front of the police,

3716
01:50:47.630 --> 01:50:50.990
thus sacrificing his own freedom to do so that he knew he was doing it while he

3717
01:50:50.991 --> 01:50:51.670
was doing it.

3718
01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:53.150
It was a total suicide bombing.

3719
01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:56.660
The that's that alone is a direct connection to Cuba.

3720
01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:57.511
Yeah.

3721
01:50:57.511 --> 01:50:58.630
I'm old for a,

3722
01:50:58.780 --> 01:50:59.780
you know what does that noise?

3723
01:50:59.781 --> 01:51:02.660
I'm hearing it to someone's car alarm.

3724
01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:05.570
<v 2>I'm just glad your studio is not a whole lot better than mine.</v>

3725
01:51:05.571 --> 01:51:06.710
It stopping noise.

3726
01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:09.580
<v 4>It has to be something like car for us to hear it,</v>

3727
01:51:09.581 --> 01:51:11.230
but how fucking dumb are car alarms?

3728
01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:15.130
Nobody goes out and looks when they were first made people like this is,

3729
01:51:15.131 --> 01:51:16.320
it is gonna be no more theft.

3730
01:51:16.321 --> 01:51:18.970
They're going to hear this alarm and everyone's going to run out with a gun.

3731
01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:19.661
Now what?

3732
01:51:19.661 --> 01:51:20.140
He'd run,

3733
01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.540
nobody fucking pays any attention to car alarms anymore.

3734
01:51:22.690 --> 01:51:23.261
They yell out,

3735
01:51:23.261 --> 01:51:24.790
shut it off.

3736
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:26.620
Like if you're an apartment building and it's going out,

3737
01:51:26.621 --> 01:51:28.090
people open up their window and yell out,

3738
01:51:28.091 --> 01:51:28.924
shut it off.

3739
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:30.160
That's all they don't,

3740
01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:32.620
they don't yell out someone's breaking into your car.

3741
01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.130
They don't believe in it.

3742
01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:36.670
Yeah,

3743
01:51:36.670 --> 01:51:38.650
they'll cry wolf too many fucking times.

3744
01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:41.141
I gotta go out.

3745
01:51:41.141 --> 01:51:41.940
What you are saying though,

3746
01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:42.773
cause

3747
01:51:43.810 --> 01:51:46.420
I'm old for thinking from multiple directions,

3748
01:51:46.421 --> 01:51:49.810
but I stick with Joe's theory about the bank called that day because now I get

3749
01:51:50.010 --> 01:51:50.843
to

3750
01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:52.350
the,

3751
01:51:52.350 --> 01:51:53.183
um,

3752
01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:58.130
<v 3>what Joe was saying is an objection on the idea that he foot yard trying to</v>

3753
01:51:58.190 --> 01:52:01.880
avoid the communist go natural and to avoid world war three wine,

3754
01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:02.331
the ward.

3755
01:52:02.331 --> 01:52:02.571
Diane,

3756
01:52:02.571 --> 01:52:06.720
would you want everybody to know that the guy responsible is a guy who has come

3757
01:52:06.721 --> 01:52:06.851
in.

3758
01:52:06.851 --> 01:52:07.580
It's called an action.

3759
01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:09.380
You know what I stuck with that.

3760
01:52:09.381 --> 01:52:09.651
I mean,

3761
01:52:09.651 --> 01:52:10.200
you know,

3762
01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:12.440
if they capture Oswald and they arrest him,

3763
01:52:12.650 --> 01:52:13.483
you're stuck.

3764
01:52:13.670 --> 01:52:14.570
The trial.

3765
01:52:14.850 --> 01:52:18.620
If there's going to be a trial is going to bring all this out and imagine that

3766
01:52:18.621 --> 01:52:20.180
trial would have taken a year,

3767
01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:21.680
would have been on TV.

3768
01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:23.780
The people are just going to fume,

3769
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:24.171
you know,

3770
01:52:24.171 --> 01:52:26.690
the communist things going to be brought up by the prosecution.

3771
01:52:26.691 --> 01:52:27.110
I,

3772
01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:27.351
you know,

3773
01:52:27.351 --> 01:52:29.960
I guess what I'm trying to say is I tried to figure out,

3774
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:32.090
we always assume that when government covers up,

3775
01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:32.410
it's,

3776
01:52:32.410 --> 01:52:33.950
it's just hide something from us.

3777
01:52:33.951 --> 01:52:34.910
We'll be angry about.

3778
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:39.770
Are there ever occasions where they cover something up because we would want to,

3779
01:52:39.771 --> 01:52:42.230
if we were in the same position for the good things.

3780
01:52:42.231 --> 01:52:45.980
Are there ever times when government covers stuff up for a good reason

3781
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.360
<v 2>to think they're smart enough to do that?</v>

3782
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:49.123
I really don't.

3783
01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:49.521
Well,

3784
01:52:49.521 --> 01:52:50.211
you might be right.

3785
01:52:50.211 --> 01:52:52.250
I think that this Lee Harvey Oswald case would,

3786
01:52:52.251 --> 01:52:56.060
it may very well be is one of the best examples possible that we're living in a

3787
01:52:56.061 --> 01:53:00.560
simulation because it's so Thea Nick Bostrom's idea.

3788
01:53:00.561 --> 01:53:00.930
Yes.

3789
01:53:00.930 --> 01:53:02.060
So theatrical,

3790
01:53:02.061 --> 01:53:03.620
I don't know how many people have had that idea,

3791
01:53:03.621 --> 01:53:05.100
but a lot of like really legit.

3792
01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:06.490
Oh yeah,

3793
01:53:06.490 --> 01:53:07.410
they and they,

3794
01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:12.480
they actually have a mathematical formula that says it's more possible than not

3795
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:13.723
that we are.

3796
01:53:13.770 --> 01:53:14.603
If you look at the,

3797
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:18.830
if you just look at the progression of technology and you think like where is it

3798
01:53:18.831 --> 01:53:20.480
eventually going to go a thousand years from now,

3799
01:53:20.481 --> 01:53:21.470
10,000 years from now,

3800
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:22.760
it's inevitable.

3801
01:53:22.761 --> 01:53:23.900
If we don't blow ourselves up,

3802
01:53:23.901 --> 01:53:27.860
we're going to be able to recreate reality and it will be completely in the ant

3803
01:53:27.861 --> 01:53:28.221
farm.

3804
01:53:28.221 --> 01:53:29.054
We live in it,

3805
01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:30.260
but here's the way you know it.

3806
01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:34.190
We already play games on our computers that are really,

3807
01:53:34.191 --> 01:53:36.680
really primitive versions of that already.

3808
01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:37.880
If somebody came out you said,

3809
01:53:37.881 --> 01:53:38.151
hey,

3810
01:53:38.151 --> 01:53:42.890
we've got the brand new version of sieve and this time you'll have real people.

3811
01:53:43.130 --> 01:53:43.610
I mean,

3812
01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:44.121
you'd be like,

3813
01:53:44.121 --> 01:53:44.901
how much is that?

3814
01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:45.980
I'm on that right now.

3815
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:48.350
That's why it leaves that opening.

3816
01:53:48.351 --> 01:53:49.730
Like if that was real,

3817
01:53:49.731 --> 01:53:50.780
where would it be?

3818
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.730
And if it was here already,

3819
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:53.720
would we know?

3820
01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:55.880
If you're gonna make an indiscernible,

3821
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:56.601
how do you not know?

3822
01:53:56.601 --> 01:53:57.434
It's not already there.

3823
01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:01.700
And then there's things that are just so dramatic and so ridiculous like the

3824
01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:02.750
Kennedy assassination.

3825
01:54:02.751 --> 01:54:05.000
So such a perfect piece of theater,

3826
01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:09.830
the way it ties up so loosely and leaves you with a bunch of confusing facts.

3827
01:54:09.831 --> 01:54:13.670
And how about the fact that within the decade after the assassination,

3828
01:54:13.671 --> 01:54:16.490
more than a hundred witnesses to the crime or dead,

3829
01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:18.620
like some of them died,

3830
01:54:18.621 --> 01:54:19.610
they were murdered,

3831
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:24.640
people die in car accidents and strange diseases and there were poisoned.

3832
01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:29.210
And I mean the odds are staggering that that would happen,

3833
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:32.390
that a hundred people who saw the assassination would die.

3834
01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:34.880
And you don't think that governments smart enough to do this,

3835
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:36.740
but they're smart enough to murder people.

3836
01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:37.820
That's pretty easy to do,

3837
01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.231
I think.

3838
01:54:39.231 --> 01:54:40.270
I think if you're good at defense,

3839
01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:43.100
they ever see you gotta you gotta go one way or the other.

3840
01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:45.140
Either they're really competent or they're really income,

3841
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:46.480
either one.

3842
01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:47.780
It's just tying up loose ends.

3843
01:54:47.781 --> 01:54:50.180
I don't think that requires an extreme amount of intelligence.

3844
01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:53.510
I think the average person knows that if someone out there knows something that

3845
01:54:53.511 --> 01:54:57.470
they shouldn't know or they can contribute to some sort of a case that you

3846
01:54:57.471 --> 01:55:00.740
believe might be coming down and eventually put people that you know in jail,

3847
01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:02.210
the people that are hiring you in jail,

3848
01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:05.330
if there's some way to stop that data from being shared,

3849
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.890
that what?

3850
01:55:05.890 --> 01:55:06.770
That's how you cut it off,

3851
01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.880
cut it off by killing the people.

3852
01:55:07.881 --> 01:55:08.720
There were witnesses.

3853
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:11.600
That's pretty how to people they should have still killed then that they didn't

3854
01:55:11.601 --> 01:55:11.880
get.

3855
01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:14.060
That's true because they killed a hundred.

3856
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.501
I mean,

3857
01:55:14.501 --> 01:55:16.010
let's killed a hundred people.

3858
01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:16.250
Yeah.

3859
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:17.630
Let's assume that they actually did it.

3860
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:20.660
If it more than a hundred witnesses were dead within a decade.

3861
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:24.020
Well you should've gotten some of those guys right in those books that sold so

3862
01:55:24.021 --> 01:55:24.854
many copies,

3863
01:55:25.130 --> 01:55:26.000
get them early.

3864
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:26.181
Yeah.

3865
01:55:26.181 --> 01:55:26.450
I mean,

3866
01:55:26.450 --> 01:55:27.320
and by the way,

3867
01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.090
just in the sense of,

3868
01:55:29.170 --> 01:55:29.390
uh,

3869
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:30.630
the interest of fairness there,

3870
01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:33.700
there have been arguments against this Arrow Posner and,

3871
01:55:33.701 --> 01:55:36.800
and this bull Yossi both wrote good books on the other side of that.

3872
01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.240
Um,

3873
01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:38.001
yeah,

3874
01:55:38.001 --> 01:55:39.230
but not that good.

3875
01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:41.300
Those books were not that you didn't like?

3876
01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:41.471
No.

3877
01:55:41.471 --> 01:55:44.370
I thought you were both parties thought they did not leave open the possibility.

3878
01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:45.030
First of all,

3879
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:48.990
they did not leave open the possibility for conspiracy and there the reality is

3880
01:55:48.991 --> 01:55:52.020
you do not know to call it case closed is nonsense.

3881
01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:52.831
If you weren't there,

3882
01:55:52.831 --> 01:55:53.760
if you didn't see it happen,

3883
01:55:53.761 --> 01:55:54.600
if you weren't a part of it,

3884
01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:56.010
I think you're guessing.

3885
01:55:56.190 --> 01:55:59.280
I think you're doing a lot of guests a shitload of gets all way,

3886
01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:01.410
but if you're guessing you can't say,

3887
01:56:01.411 --> 01:56:02.190
case closed,

3888
01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:03.023
you're full of shit.

3889
01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:03.481
Okay,

3890
01:56:03.481 --> 01:56:03.840
I see.

3891
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.673
I see that point.

3892
01:56:04.690 --> 01:56:06.630
I can send that calling it case show.

3893
01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:11.660
The way those books were directed were very clearly directed in a presupposed

3894
01:56:12.991 --> 01:56:15.030
idea that Lee Harvey Oswald acted well.

3895
01:56:15.031 --> 01:56:15.781
They were written,

3896
01:56:15.781 --> 01:56:18.300
and this is the thing I always try to tell people is that don't read those

3897
01:56:18.301 --> 01:56:18.541
books.

3898
01:56:18.541 --> 01:56:21.030
If you don't know about the Kennedy's actually don't cause they're not directed

3899
01:56:21.031 --> 01:56:21.690
at you.

3900
01:56:21.690 --> 01:56:24.060
They're directed at people who already know a ton of it.

3901
01:56:24.150 --> 01:56:24.870
I loved.

3902
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:27.480
It was one of the few books I've ever read where they didn't footnotes stuff.

3903
01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:28.140
They said,

3904
01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:28.351
you know,

3905
01:56:28.351 --> 01:56:31.890
you remember this book and they addressed other people's books without telling

3906
01:56:31.891 --> 01:56:32.700
you about them,

3907
01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:33.690
so you had to just,

3908
01:56:33.730 --> 01:56:33.981
they,

3909
01:56:33.981 --> 01:56:37.260
they figure you read all that stuff already they could address,

3910
01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:38.070
well,

3911
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:39.780
Yossi is such a good prosecutor though.

3912
01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:41.070
He told me on the phone,

3913
01:56:41.071 --> 01:56:41.580
he said,

3914
01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:44.390
he said it would have been a slam dunk convicting ons.

3915
01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:45.300
That doesn't mean anything.

3916
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:45.691
No,

3917
01:56:45.691 --> 01:56:46.060
it does.

3918
01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:46.831
If you're saying,

3919
01:56:46.831 --> 01:56:48.300
does that mean he could absolutely.

3920
01:56:48.630 --> 01:56:51.060
It just making it about it as a person trying to win a game.

3921
01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.400
He's not thinking about it as a person trying to find the truth.

3922
01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.560
The reality of the truth is he doesn't know.

3923
01:56:55.710 --> 01:56:56.161
I don't know.

3924
01:56:56.161 --> 01:56:57.120
You don't know that's true.

3925
01:56:57.230 --> 01:57:00.010
They're the only people that know are the people that were there that played a

3926
01:57:00.011 --> 01:57:01.500
part in that murder or didn't,

3927
01:57:01.650 --> 01:57:05.420
whether it's Lee Harvey Oswald and other conspirators or the other conspiracies

3928
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:08.280
and we and Lee Harvey Oswald being the Patsy that he claims he was,

3929
01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:10.260
whatever the combination of things where,

3930
01:57:10.261 --> 01:57:11.730
which whatever number was correct.

3931
01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:13.680
Those are the people that know everyone else.

3932
01:57:13.710 --> 01:57:16.890
There's a giant amount of guessing and to pretend there's not a giant amount of

3933
01:57:16.891 --> 01:57:21.060
guessing means you're an asshole if you're pretending that you've got it nailed

3934
01:57:21.061 --> 01:57:21.180
right,

3935
01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:22.013
you're an asshole.

3936
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:23.370
It's just a fact.

3937
01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:25.320
And so the people that are arguing and online,

3938
01:57:25.321 --> 01:57:25.681
I mean I,

3939
01:57:25.681 --> 01:57:26.910
I'll argue it online as well,

3940
01:57:26.911 --> 01:57:29.670
but the people that actually believe that they know for a fact one way or the

3941
01:57:29.671 --> 01:57:30.150
other,

3942
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:30.983
it's not true.

3943
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.460
And the magic bullet theory,

3944
01:57:32.461 --> 01:57:35.160
it was a lot of problems with the way people describe it.

3945
01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:35.941
A lot of the,

3946
01:57:35.941 --> 01:57:39.990
the trajectory that the angles of the bodies wasn't nearly as magical,

3947
01:57:39.991 --> 01:57:41.340
the path they were attributing to,

3948
01:57:41.370 --> 01:57:43.680
if you look at the fact that Kennedy was above him,

3949
01:57:43.681 --> 01:57:47.040
that the seat was actually raised and that Connolly was actually leaning and

3950
01:57:47.041 --> 01:57:48.560
turning around in the idea of there,

3951
01:57:48.930 --> 01:57:52.290
what's much more damning is Connolly's fucking testimony himself.

3952
01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:55.290
That he was not hit first and that when Kennedy was hit,

3953
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:58.860
he turned around and then he heard the gunshots and then he was hit afterwards.

3954
01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:03.990
His own testimony refutes the idea of the magic bullet far better than anything

3955
01:58:03.991 --> 01:58:04.530
else.

3956
01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:08.100
When you see commonly talk about the series of events and how it played out

3957
01:58:08.101 --> 01:58:09.090
inside the limousine,

3958
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:11.010
he throws the magic bullet out the window,

3959
01:58:11.011 --> 01:58:11.250
right?

3960
01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:13.830
The reason why they came up with the magic bullet theory in the first place,

3961
01:58:13.831 --> 01:58:14.790
because they had a tribute,

3962
01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:17.370
there was a bullet that hit a curb stone underneath the overpass.

3963
01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:21.360
They had to attribute a bullet that Lee Harvey Oswald shot or someone from that

3964
01:58:21.361 --> 01:58:25.110
direction of Lee Harvey Oswald shot to that bullet cause that ricocheted and hit

3965
01:58:25.111 --> 01:58:26.850
a man and the guy went to the hospital.

3966
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:27.930
So because of that,

3967
01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.660
then they had to come up with one bullet doing all this damage.

3968
01:58:30.910 --> 01:58:35.910
It doesn't mean it's logical ballistics or weird though Joe bullets do weird

3969
01:58:36.001 --> 01:58:36.251
things.

3970
01:58:36.251 --> 01:58:37.830
They do do weird things and know what they don't.

3971
01:58:37.831 --> 01:58:39.930
And when you talk about witnesses in a car,

3972
01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:42.490
remember this is than the speed of sound.

3973
01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:44.320
The sound hits at a different,

3974
01:58:44.321 --> 01:58:46.360
I mean it's 100% it's a little weird,

3975
01:58:46.361 --> 01:58:46.720
right?

3976
01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:47.590
You're absolutely right.

3977
01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:48.520
However,

3978
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:48.851
the,

3979
01:58:48.851 --> 01:58:50.650
if you look at the possibilities,

3980
01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:55.510
is it possible that a bullet hit these two bodies and smashed bone?

3981
01:58:55.690 --> 01:58:59.230
Did very little damage actually left more fragments inside the bullet?

3982
01:58:59.231 --> 01:59:00.340
Then we're missing from the bullet?

3983
01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:01.270
Is that possible?

3984
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.770
I don't know.

3985
01:59:02.770 --> 01:59:06.080
I mean he could have had a freak bullet that had like extra shit on it and that

3986
01:59:06.090 --> 01:59:07.990
maybe maybe they're attributing certain thing.

3987
01:59:07.991 --> 01:59:11.740
Maybe it's poor science and they're attributing certain things to being pieces

3988
01:59:11.741 --> 01:59:13.480
of the bullet that weren't actually pieces of bullet,

3989
01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:18.130
but the odds are that that was not a bullet that smashed bone.

3990
01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:20.590
If you've ever seen what a bullet looks like when it hits bone,

3991
01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:22.360
it doesn't look like that.

3992
01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:23.530
Can it look like that?

3993
01:59:23.531 --> 01:59:23.771
Man,

3994
01:59:23.771 --> 01:59:27.040
and I may be under some really freaky circumstance,

3995
01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:28.780
but that's the aberration.

3996
01:59:28.810 --> 01:59:29.890
That's not the norm.

3997
01:59:29.891 --> 01:59:33.400
The norm is a bullet distorts wildly when it hits bone.

3998
01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:35.350
That's part of what they're designed to do.

3999
01:59:35.530 --> 01:59:39.100
They're designed to break up inside the body and do more damage to designed to

4000
01:59:39.101 --> 01:59:40.570
hit things and spread out.

4001
01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:45.040
You know what polio season Posner's book though did that I thought was fantastic

4002
01:59:45.041 --> 01:59:46.460
and it goes back to that Kim Devorah,

4003
01:59:46.570 --> 01:59:47.440
Michael Hastings thing,

4004
01:59:47.441 --> 01:59:48.460
we talked about it a minute ago.

4005
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:53.790
They showed what a lot of the conspiracy writers deliberately left out of their

4006
01:59:53.831 --> 01:59:56.950
work because it messed up their theories making.

4007
01:59:57.490 --> 02:00:00.670
One of the big pieces of evidence that that really kind of changes a lot of

4008
02:00:00.671 --> 02:00:05.290
mines is the idea that Oswald took a shot at the general in the weeks before he

4009
02:00:05.291 --> 02:00:09.010
shot president or maybe allegedly shot Prezi and when you realize he's,

4010
02:00:09.190 --> 02:00:14.190
he's out there trying to kill people already makes him look a lot less like a

4011
02:00:14.741 --> 02:00:17.410
patsy and a lot more like a guy who was,

4012
02:00:17.590 --> 02:00:17.861
God,

4013
02:00:17.861 --> 02:00:18.671
I missed the general,

4014
02:00:18.671 --> 02:00:18.971
hey,

4015
02:00:18.971 --> 02:00:19.391
guess what,

4016
02:00:19.391 --> 02:00:22.990
president Kennedy's coming in a motorcade and I work in a building along the

4017
02:00:22.991 --> 02:00:23.710
route.

4018
02:00:23.710 --> 02:00:28.030
I guess I remember myself being upset with some of these conspiracy authors

4019
02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:31.960
whose work I like because they left this out and I remember thinking,

4020
02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:32.561
what?

4021
02:00:32.561 --> 02:00:33.790
That bastard left this out.

4022
02:00:33.791 --> 02:00:34.870
He knew that this was there,

4023
02:00:34.871 --> 02:00:37.120
but it makes us theory look bad and he left it out.

4024
02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:40.840
That's where I started to get real angry at people whose work you're reading

4025
02:00:40.841 --> 02:00:42.520
because you want to believe it and trust it.

4026
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:45.520
That's a very good point and there's is certainly possible and but you know

4027
02:00:45.521 --> 02:00:45.731
what?

4028
02:00:45.731 --> 02:00:46.990
It's also not an either or.

4029
02:00:47.050 --> 02:00:47.883
I agree with all supply.

4030
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:50.890
Agree with the Harvey Oswald acted in conjunction with some other people.

4031
02:00:51.730 --> 02:00:52.900
There's a lot of variables.

4032
02:00:52.930 --> 02:00:54.600
Many people wanted the president dead.

4033
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:55.310
Well,

4034
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:56.380
that's the real issue.

4035
02:00:56.381 --> 02:01:01.381
The real issue is did did the president at the time create enough enemies where

4036
02:01:01.811 --> 02:01:06.040
they were a gang of people that wanted him dead and that is uncontroversial,

4037
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:06.540
right?

4038
02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.031
I think so.

4039
02:01:07.031 --> 02:01:07.211
Wait,

4040
02:01:07.211 --> 02:01:07.730
now I'm leaving.

4041
02:01:07.730 --> 02:01:08.800
Going to say in controversial.

4042
02:01:08.830 --> 02:01:09.100
Well,

4043
02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:12.700
because here's the thing that I think Oliver Stone did a great job of distorting

4044
02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:16.840
was this idea that somehow president Kennedy had upset the military industrial

4045
02:01:16.841 --> 02:01:17.820
complex and all of this guy,

4046
02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:22.980
when in reality the guy had just done the biggest peacetime military buildup in

4047
02:01:23.921 --> 02:01:24.910
American history.

4048
02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:28.750
He had just re remember he campaigned on something called the missile gap.

4049
02:01:28.930 --> 02:01:30.370
So when he got the job,

4050
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:33.310
he increased military spending by a ton,

4051
02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:34.890
but he's still wanting to get out of Vietnam.

4052
02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:37.780
He didn't really want to get out of Vietnam and he was going to move assets to

4053
02:01:37.781 --> 02:01:38.980
Laos and Cambodia.

4054
02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:39.560
Uh,

4055
02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:40.460
I guess my point is,

4056
02:01:40.461 --> 02:01:44.870
is that he was not an enemy of those very forces that Oliver Stone had him being

4057
02:01:44.871 --> 02:01:45.704
the enemy of.

4058
02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:46.341
I see what you're saying.

4059
02:01:46.341 --> 02:01:46.700
Yeah.

4060
02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:47.010
He,

4061
02:01:47.010 --> 02:01:48.260
he was a hawk,

4062
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:49.880
but was it that black and white?

4063
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:50.391
No,

4064
02:01:50.391 --> 02:01:50.751
no,

4065
02:01:50.751 --> 02:01:51.020
no.

4066
02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:52.310
It was not that black and white.

4067
02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:52.761
It was not.

4068
02:01:52.761 --> 02:01:56.120
And you don't know what other things they may have wanted that he was pushing

4069
02:01:56.121 --> 02:01:56.841
back on and see.

4070
02:01:56.841 --> 02:02:00.350
We just don't know what you didn't know that he said he wanted to get rid of the

4071
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:01.183
Federal Reserve.

4072
02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:03.290
How don't know enough about that.

4073
02:02:03.291 --> 02:02:03.611
I can't,

4074
02:02:03.611 --> 02:02:05.420
I can't comment intelligently on that.

4075
02:02:05.421 --> 02:02:05.880
I mean,

4076
02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:06.110
I,

4077
02:02:06.110 --> 02:02:08.860
I can't eat comment intelligently on almost everything I say,

4078
02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:11.810
but it doesn't stop a stop at the membrane.

4079
02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.450
Some of us are more competitive.

4080
02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:15.140
They have k federal bank.

4081
02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:16.610
But I mean that's the thing though.

4082
02:02:16.611 --> 02:02:17.600
That's when you,

4083
02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:22.930
what's funny about these arguments is when you see people who are really good at

4084
02:02:23.481 --> 02:02:25.130
pushing forward all the evidence,

4085
02:02:25.131 --> 02:02:29.120
supporting their conclusion and the staff that doesn't fit with their

4086
02:02:29.121 --> 02:02:29.954
conclusion,

4087
02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:30.920
it's not there.

4088
02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:31.753
It's like poop.

4089
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:32.640
I just for you,

4090
02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:35.150
just the same thing that he accused the government are doing right?

4091
02:02:35.151 --> 02:02:38.510
Hiding and omissions and all that stuff and that's why you read one book and

4092
02:02:38.511 --> 02:02:38.751
you're like,

4093
02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:41.120
it looks really convincing and all the points they are making,

4094
02:02:41.121 --> 02:02:41.960
it looks pretty good.

4095
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.823
And then you're like,

4096
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:43.250
wait,

4097
02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:44.840
why the hell did you leave this stuff out?

4098
02:02:44.841 --> 02:02:46.190
And when you find out they leave it out,

4099
02:02:46.191 --> 02:02:48.160
you start to distrust them to absolutely.

4100
02:02:48.170 --> 02:02:50.840
I don't trust the government or some of those conspiracy writers.

4101
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:52.240
<v 4>The idea,</v>

4102
02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:57.240
the conspiracy theories site theorist site is this executive order one one one

4103
02:02:57.791 --> 02:03:02.791
one zero and this was issued by Kennedy on June 4th of 1963 and this executive

4104
02:03:04.271 --> 02:03:06.760
order are delegated to the secretary of the treasury of the president's

4105
02:03:06.761 --> 02:03:11.761
authority to issue silver certificates under the Thomas Amendment of the

4106
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:14.950
Agricultural Adjustment Act as amended by the Gold Reserve Act and the order

4107
02:03:14.951 --> 02:03:17.980
allow the secretary to issue silver certificates,

4108
02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:21.640
if any word needed during the transition period under president Kennedy's plan

4109
02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:24.190
to eliminate silver certificates.

4110
02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:29.640
So the idea was that he was moving in on the institution known as the Federal

4111
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:32.620
Reserve because the Federal Reserve,

4112
02:03:32.621 --> 02:03:34.300
as most people realize,

4113
02:03:34.450 --> 02:03:38.080
isn't really a federal kind of a thing at all.

4114
02:03:38.081 --> 02:03:38.680
It's it's,

4115
02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:40.420
it's not a part of the government.

4116
02:03:40.570 --> 02:03:40.901
Oh look,

4117
02:03:40.901 --> 02:03:41.920
it's the horn again.

4118
02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:47.410
Hopefully the police are on their way to stop this dastardly person from

4119
02:03:47.411 --> 02:03:49.780
stealing someone's pens and change.

4120
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:51.970
You didn't even have car radios.

4121
02:03:51.971 --> 02:03:52.810
He can steal anymore.

4122
02:03:52.811 --> 02:03:54.340
They're all integrated into the system.

4123
02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:55.960
We'll see me if you're not going to steal a car.

4124
02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:56.890
And if you do steal a car,

4125
02:03:57.070 --> 02:03:58.480
good luck trying to fucking hide it.

4126
02:03:58.481 --> 02:04:00.430
Everyone's got a goddamn gps in their car now.

4127
02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:00.950
Yes.

4128
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:01.783
Stupid fuck.

4129
02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:03.820
So the idea that they,

4130
02:04:03.821 --> 02:04:04.290
uh,

4131
02:04:04.290 --> 02:04:05.500
espouse is that,

4132
02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:06.353
um,

4133
02:04:06.490 --> 02:04:10.840
this was the executive order that s that started the beginning of the end.

4134
02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:15.190
I've also seen a lot of people say that they think Lyndon Johnson had something

4135
02:04:15.191 --> 02:04:15.770
to do.

4136
02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:17.670
<v 2>Somebody just sent me that book.</v>

4137
02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:18.960
I haven't looked at it yet,

4138
02:04:18.961 --> 02:04:22.920
but the Lyndon Johnson killed out a kid killed Kennedy book or something.

4139
02:04:22.921 --> 02:04:24.060
Is it a new one that's out?

4140
02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:30.100
I had Jesse Ventura on my show a couple of times and now I get it and now I get

4141
02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:32.850
all those books without even asking,

4142
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.361
Oh,

4143
02:04:33.361 --> 02:04:34.390
you poor bastard.

4144
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:35.303
It's bad.

4145
02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:35.701
I,

4146
02:04:35.701 --> 02:04:36.150
um,

4147
02:04:36.150 --> 02:04:39.690
I did a with the people that did his show and uh,

4148
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:40.051
you know,

4149
02:04:40.051 --> 02:04:44.130
there was a couple of times when we had like these sort of discussions about

4150
02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:45.820
conspiracies and you know what's,

4151
02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:46.740
and I'm like,

4152
02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:47.250
you know,

4153
02:04:47.250 --> 02:04:49.230
they're all juicy and salacious,

4154
02:04:49.231 --> 02:04:54.231
but the idea that if you look at too many things as being in conspiracy,

4155
02:04:54.510 --> 02:04:58.410
you do a huge disservice to what might actually be a conspiracy by playing into

4156
02:04:58.411 --> 02:04:59.800
the hands of the Phoenix Zack,

4157
02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:01.350
whether you realize it or not,

4158
02:05:01.351 --> 02:05:06.351
I mean to be like a crazy right wing radical like the fire and brimstone sort of

4159
02:05:07.351 --> 02:05:10.230
a guy you played directly into the hands of the government to slam me.

4160
02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:11.011
I'm getting this slam,

4161
02:05:11.011 --> 02:05:14.550
like I'm an anti conspiracy person and they were all saying Dan Carlin edge,

4162
02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:16.380
somebody even wrote a review on Itunes,

4163
02:05:16.381 --> 02:05:18.870
said something like he doesn't understand how the world works and he's just

4164
02:05:18.871 --> 02:05:19.980
giving you the pablum mine.

4165
02:05:20.190 --> 02:05:20.371
Yeah.

4166
02:05:20.371 --> 02:05:21.900
But there are conspiracies out there,

4167
02:05:21.901 --> 02:05:22.621
but like you said,

4168
02:05:22.621 --> 02:05:24.990
you do yourself a disservice when you buy all of them.

4169
02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:25.501
Dan Carlin,

4170
02:05:25.501 --> 02:05:27.730
you got to stop listening to critics these topless,

4171
02:05:27.731 --> 02:05:28.910
and I was telling me,

4172
02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:30.420
Joe was telling me that before the show,

4173
02:05:30.421 --> 02:05:32.220
he goes to listen to anybody.

4174
02:05:32.221 --> 02:05:33.054
Listen,

4175
02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:36.860
you can learn things from people's criticism is good.

4176
02:05:36.930 --> 02:05:39.000
I've learned a lot from people's criticism,

4177
02:05:39.001 --> 02:05:42.930
but you also have to understand human nature and there's a lot of people out

4178
02:05:42.931 --> 02:05:46.460
there that are sad as fuck and they want you to feel sad too.

4179
02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:49.380
We want you to hurt and instead,

4180
02:05:49.381 --> 02:05:53.130
I mean it's cause their water is liable on fire and flammable and yours isn't.

4181
02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:54.030
It could be that.

4182
02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:55.560
It could be the number one to fuck them.

4183
02:05:55.561 --> 02:05:56.430
I'm going with the ladder.

4184
02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.790
Most of the time it's no one wants to fuck them and you have a deficit.

4185
02:05:59.791 --> 02:06:01.640
You have a desire for attention.

4186
02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:02.850
They'd put that in the review.

4187
02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:04.720
Then let's,

4188
02:06:04.721 --> 02:06:05.090
let's,

4189
02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:09.210
I'm probably only saying this because I'm 496 pounds.

4190
02:06:09.211 --> 02:06:11.190
I Shit my pants on a daily basis.

4191
02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:16.220
No one's touched me in a decade that [inaudible] doesn't know shit about how the

4192
02:06:16.681 --> 02:06:19.560
world works that suck these out.

4193
02:06:19.561 --> 02:06:20.700
They're confusing us.

4194
02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:22.711
Yeah.

4195
02:06:22.711 --> 02:06:23.101
I don't know,

4196
02:06:23.101 --> 02:06:23.740
man.

4197
02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:27.350
I think that you can get a lot out of it is in terms of a,

4198
02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:28.560
you can get other people's eyes.

4199
02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:30.760
I think it's helped me a lot with my standup.

4200
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:31.590
It's helped me a lot.

4201
02:06:31.590 --> 02:06:32.730
Even negative criticism.

4202
02:06:32.731 --> 02:06:32.961
I go,

4203
02:06:32.961 --> 02:06:33.211
okay,

4204
02:06:33.211 --> 02:06:34.140
I can see how you see that.

4205
02:06:34.170 --> 02:06:35.003
I think it's good.

4206
02:06:35.190 --> 02:06:35.941
It fires you up,

4207
02:06:35.941 --> 02:06:37.740
makes you want to perform better.

4208
02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:38.431
It makes you want to,

4209
02:06:38.431 --> 02:06:38.791
you know,

4210
02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:40.710
analyze things with under a more critical eye,

4211
02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:41.760
under a Nada,

4212
02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:42.130
Nada,

4213
02:06:42.130 --> 02:06:43.080
not indoctrinated.

4214
02:06:43.081 --> 02:06:43.550
I,

4215
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:44.383
I think it's good,

4216
02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:46.920
but I also think you've got to know when to listen to them and when not to.

4217
02:06:46.921 --> 02:06:47.521
When someone says,

4218
02:06:47.521 --> 02:06:48.980
Dan Carlin doesn't know how to work to go.

4219
02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:49.630
All right.

4220
02:06:49.630 --> 02:06:51.440
Do you think it shuts people down?

4221
02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:53.370
We were talking about why more people don't,

4222
02:06:53.371 --> 02:06:55.530
don't get ahead and the competition thing.

4223
02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:59.160
I think that kind of criticism does shut some people down where they're just,

4224
02:06:59.161 --> 02:06:59.341
they,

4225
02:06:59.341 --> 02:06:59.600
they're,

4226
02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:00.240
they're not,

4227
02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:00.870
they can't,

4228
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:03.770
I mean obviously we all can handle it cause we all do something where we're

4229
02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:05.160
criticized on a daily basis.

4230
02:07:05.370 --> 02:07:05.731
But I mean,

4231
02:07:05.731 --> 02:07:06.840
I think there's some people that just,

4232
02:07:07.130 --> 02:07:07.963
they don't want,

4233
02:07:08.250 --> 02:07:09.083
my boss does it,

4234
02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:10.210
but I don't want it in public.

4235
02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:12.630
I was reading a thing the other day,

4236
02:07:12.631 --> 02:07:12.991
it's just,

4237
02:07:12.991 --> 02:07:17.220
I've been railing on about this lately about the idea of people are,

4238
02:07:17.221 --> 02:07:22.140
are going on about what they're calling for fat shaming and fat shaming is

4239
02:07:22.141 --> 02:07:24.540
making people feel bad for being overweight.

4240
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:29.750
And I've read this one article where this woman was talking about how she was

4241
02:07:30.001 --> 02:07:34.560
being fat shamed because she went to a family function and everyone was gushing

4242
02:07:34.590 --> 02:07:35.680
about cousin.

4243
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.450
<v 4>Her cousin lost 20 pounds and the that they were making such a big deal out of</v>

4244
02:07:40.451 --> 02:07:40.631
it,

4245
02:07:40.631 --> 02:07:45.160
that it was clear to her that they were judging her for not losing the 20

4246
02:07:45.161 --> 02:07:45.461
pounds.

4247
02:07:45.461 --> 02:07:49.120
So it made her feel awful and she didn't understand how they couldn't understand

4248
02:07:49.121 --> 02:07:54.121
that what they were doing was fat shaming her by complimenting someone on losing

4249
02:07:54.881 --> 02:07:55.211
weight,

4250
02:07:55.211 --> 02:07:59.230
you're fat shaming the person who hasn't lost the weight and that it made her

4251
02:07:59.231 --> 02:08:02.020
feel awful and that it was incredibly insensitive of them.

4252
02:08:02.021 --> 02:08:02.500
And that,

4253
02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:03.333
you know,

4254
02:08:04.570 --> 02:08:06.430
I'm fascinated by that kind of thinking.

4255
02:08:06.431 --> 02:08:07.131
I really am.

4256
02:08:07.131 --> 02:08:08.770
I'm fascinated by that sort of like,

4257
02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:13.870
like reverse victimology sort of a thing where instead of you being the victim

4258
02:08:13.871 --> 02:08:15.010
of your own handiwork,

4259
02:08:15.011 --> 02:08:20.011
you become like a persecuted person because they don't accept you for the flaws

4260
02:08:20.381 --> 02:08:24.760
that you have or even mentioned the possibility of those flaws existing by

4261
02:08:24.761 --> 02:08:28.360
virtue of complimenting someone for having gotten over the same flaws that you

4262
02:08:28.361 --> 02:08:29.194
possess.

4263
02:08:29.230 --> 02:08:30.220
Hilarious.

4264
02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:34.240
I think without even knowing the specifics on us on particular issues,

4265
02:08:34.241 --> 02:08:35.200
anytime somebody,

4266
02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:37.540
so we'll link to embrace the victim role,

4267
02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:38.090
uh,

4268
02:08:38.090 --> 02:08:40.260
his mouth traveled right away and be like,

4269
02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:45.160
do you know there's a reality to losing weight that we have this Dave Asprey guy

4270
02:08:45.161 --> 02:08:49.000
who's an expert in a lot of aspects of nutrition.

4271
02:08:49.001 --> 02:08:51.970
He's a fascinating guy and one of the things he was talking about where he was

4272
02:08:51.971 --> 02:08:53.740
giving a overweight people a pass,

4273
02:08:53.741 --> 02:08:57.350
because you're saying the level of addiction that these people actually have for

4274
02:08:57.370 --> 02:09:02.370
food to say that they don't have willpower is really unfair because there are so

4275
02:09:02.531 --> 02:09:03.364
overweight.

4276
02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:07.540
Like a lot of these folks are so far gone that they used up all of their

4277
02:09:07.541 --> 02:09:12.010
willpower just to get up in the morning just to walk to the bus stop,

4278
02:09:12.011 --> 02:09:12.580
just to go,

4279
02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:13.031
go to work,

4280
02:09:13.031 --> 02:09:13.960
just to get their,

4281
02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:14.680
their,

4282
02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:16.000
their chores done during the day.

4283
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.590
Like they don't have the same level of energy that a healthy person has.

4284
02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:22.660
So to attribute them to having like this,

4285
02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:27.640
there's this backlog of energy they're not tapping into because they're weak

4286
02:09:27.641 --> 02:09:28.240
willed.

4287
02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:29.560
It's not that like they're,

4288
02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:31.330
they're already so far in the hole.

4289
02:09:31.450 --> 02:09:34.000
It's almost impossible for them to get motivation.

4290
02:09:34.150 --> 02:09:37.360
They have to get something like incredibly extreme has to happen to them.

4291
02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:39.130
And I thought that was really unique.

4292
02:09:39.131 --> 02:09:39.351
And,

4293
02:09:39.351 --> 02:09:41.350
and looking at that west people to say,

4294
02:09:41.351 --> 02:09:41.860
yes,

4295
02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:42.610
yes,

4296
02:09:42.610 --> 02:09:43.421
people out of shade,

4297
02:09:43.421 --> 02:09:44.254
people who are depressed,

4298
02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:47.770
you could see the in with people that are ruining their life too,

4299
02:09:47.771 --> 02:09:49.060
whether it's through addictions,

4300
02:09:49.061 --> 02:09:49.241
you know,

4301
02:09:49.241 --> 02:09:50.350
you see that as well.

4302
02:09:50.351 --> 02:09:52.910
It's like why can't they see it the way other people see it?

4303
02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:54.490
It's almost like they can't,

4304
02:09:54.730 --> 02:09:54.911
like,

4305
02:09:54.911 --> 02:09:57.790
they're so trapped up in the momentum of whatever it is,

4306
02:09:57.791 --> 02:09:59.350
whether it's gambling or food.

4307
02:09:59.560 --> 02:09:59.771
I mean,

4308
02:09:59.771 --> 02:10:03.280
I've seen people with food addictions that you can watch the gears spinning in

4309
02:10:03.281 --> 02:10:04.840
their mind when food is nearby.

4310
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:07.060
Like they know they're supposed to lose weight and they know they're not

4311
02:10:07.061 --> 02:10:07.894
supposed to be eating it,

4312
02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:08.460
but the,

4313
02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:12.190
the gears start spinning in their mind and that becomes the primary focus of

4314
02:10:12.191 --> 02:10:13.024
their existence.

4315
02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:14.230
Get that fucking doughnut.

4316
02:10:14.231 --> 02:10:15.190
I need that donut.

4317
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:16.750
That donut is huge.

4318
02:10:17.050 --> 02:10:17.261
It's,

4319
02:10:17.261 --> 02:10:17.501
it's,

4320
02:10:17.501 --> 02:10:21.460
it's critical for fueling whatever the whatever trouble is going on in their

4321
02:10:21.461 --> 02:10:26.461
mind and it's a weird aspect of human beings and you don't do that any favors by

4322
02:10:27.371 --> 02:10:32.371
pretending that encouraging someone who lost weight is a bad thing either.

4323
02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:34.160
The idea that

4324
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.070
<v 2>socially that's irresponsible because you're fat and you're near them.</v>

4325
02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:37.461
No,

4326
02:10:37.461 --> 02:10:40.370
it's actually responsible because that terrible feeling that you have,

4327
02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:45.290
it's supposed to be the bump that pushes you towards eating a salad instead of a

4328
02:10:45.291 --> 02:10:48.760
cheeseburger should be the bump that makes you write down everything you're

4329
02:10:48.761 --> 02:10:50.810
going eat that day and state some goals.

4330
02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:51.770
This is what I'm going to do.

4331
02:10:51.771 --> 02:10:55.310
I'm going to use my willpower to overcome this horrible obsession that I have

4332
02:10:55.311 --> 02:10:56.144
with shitty food.

4333
02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:57.860
That's also possible.

4334
02:10:58.070 --> 02:11:02.480
It's also possible by by you going home and blaming everybody in the blog that

4335
02:11:02.481 --> 02:11:06.350
you've projected yourself away from any potential benefit from having these bad

4336
02:11:06.351 --> 02:11:07.161
feelings and game.

4337
02:11:07.161 --> 02:11:08.070
He's the same as the above.

4338
02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:11.690
The competition is somebody who never learned how to lose and the same in a

4339
02:11:11.710 --> 02:11:13.700
avoiding criticism like you gotta,

4340
02:11:13.701 --> 02:11:14.540
you gotta look at it.

4341
02:11:14.541 --> 02:11:14.781
It's a,

4342
02:11:14.781 --> 02:11:15.620
it feels like shit,

4343
02:11:15.621 --> 02:11:17.360
but that feel like shit.

4344
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:19.310
Correct it so it doesn't feel like shit anymore.

4345
02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:23.120
I thought the show was very disorganized until you guys just tied it into a

4346
02:11:23.121 --> 02:11:24.860
beautiful bow like that.

4347
02:11:25.190 --> 02:11:29.540
It's all of a sudden got a theme that's running through it and planned it this

4348
02:11:29.541 --> 02:11:29.751
way.

4349
02:11:29.751 --> 02:11:30.980
Everyone had a finger.

4350
02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:36.290
There's a way to bring this bitch around all art form.

4351
02:11:36.291 --> 02:11:37.110
It is.

4352
02:11:37.110 --> 02:11:37.611
Oh,

4353
02:11:37.611 --> 02:11:38.480
most certainly is,

4354
02:11:38.481 --> 02:11:38.811
right.

4355
02:11:38.811 --> 02:11:39.770
I mean for sure.

4356
02:11:39.771 --> 02:11:41.510
Actually podcasting is an art form.

4357
02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:42.800
Look,

4358
02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.820
I tell everybody,

4359
02:11:43.821 --> 02:11:44.041
and I'll,

4360
02:11:44.041 --> 02:11:44.630
I'll say it,

4361
02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:45.620
even though you're here,

4362
02:11:45.860 --> 02:11:50.120
you're fucking podcast is one of my favorite things that I listened to,

4363
02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:52.670
one of my absolute favorite things.

4364
02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:54.440
It is a national treasure.

4365
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:55.890
It's so interesting.

4366
02:11:56.340 --> 02:12:00.800
It educates people on aspects of history that were completely ignored and it

4367
02:12:00.801 --> 02:12:03.500
does in a really entertaining and dynamic way.

4368
02:12:03.501 --> 02:12:04.700
And it's so important,

4369
02:12:04.701 --> 02:12:05.060
dude.

4370
02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:05.301
Dude,

4371
02:12:05.301 --> 02:12:05.870
I did not.

4372
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:07.100
Can I just tell you I don't get it.

4373
02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:08.120
I've never gotten it.

4374
02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:09.920
I've never ever gotten it.

4375
02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:10.490
You know,

4376
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:11.690
just why you can do it.

4377
02:12:11.691 --> 02:12:12.524
That's why it's good.

4378
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:12.981
I mean,

4379
02:12:12.981 --> 02:12:13.461
I'm grateful.

4380
02:12:13.461 --> 02:12:14.121
Don't get me wrong,

4381
02:12:14.121 --> 02:12:14.450
but,

4382
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:16.850
but I've never quite seen it as others see it.

4383
02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:17.451
Oh,

4384
02:12:17.451 --> 02:12:17.661
it'd be,

4385
02:12:17.661 --> 02:12:18.261
that's good.

4386
02:12:18.261 --> 02:12:19.680
That's good goals.

4387
02:12:19.770 --> 02:12:20.603
That's what I,

4388
02:12:20.630 --> 02:12:20.991
you know,

4389
02:12:20.991 --> 02:12:21.824
I do.

4390
02:12:23.290 --> 02:12:24.950
I know that's how you got me.

4391
02:12:24.951 --> 02:12:27.830
Because I've been a fan of Mongo guy.

4392
02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:29.120
I've been a fan of chaos.

4393
02:12:29.121 --> 02:12:29.601
And so I was a young,

4394
02:12:29.601 --> 02:12:30.860
it's not a fucking coincidence.

4395
02:12:30.861 --> 02:12:33.440
And I'm a standup comedian and I'm also a cage fighting commentator.

4396
02:12:33.441 --> 02:12:33.891
That's true.

4397
02:12:33.891 --> 02:12:34.210
I mean,

4398
02:12:34.210 --> 02:12:34.321
it's,

4399
02:12:34.321 --> 02:12:35.300
that's not a coincidence.

4400
02:12:35.301 --> 02:12:35.511
I'm,

4401
02:12:35.511 --> 02:12:35.790
I've,

4402
02:12:35.790 --> 02:12:35.971
I'm,

4403
02:12:35.971 --> 02:12:38.030
I'm a massive fan of chaotic events.

4404
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:39.860
I'm a massive fan of this,

4405
02:12:39.861 --> 02:12:44.300
these explosive things that that throw the norm in the question and completely

4406
02:12:44.630 --> 02:12:46.110
change the paradigm of the,

4407
02:12:46.111 --> 02:12:47.990
the existing reality that we operate under.

4408
02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:51.830
And when you listen to something like a podcast on the mon goals,

4409
02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:52.791
it's like Jesus,

4410
02:12:52.791 --> 02:12:55.420
that was only the 12 hundreds there wasn't that long ago.

4411
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:56.330
I forgot to bring this shirt.

4412
02:12:56.331 --> 02:12:58.950
I got this bad ass getting his con world tour shirt.

4413
02:12:58.980 --> 02:12:59.571
That's great.

4414
02:12:59.571 --> 02:12:59.961
A back.

4415
02:12:59.961 --> 02:13:03.320
It has all the fucking to towns that he sacked and although he better we're mode

4416
02:13:03.321 --> 02:13:06.650
now you got to send me a photo by you one,

4417
02:13:06.651 --> 02:13:07.341
I'll send it to you.

4418
02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:10.890
You owe me all these appearances I've done for you a bitch and I do.

4419
02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:13.580
We all know each other man,

4420
02:13:13.581 --> 02:13:13.791
but I,

4421
02:13:13.791 --> 02:13:15.260
I definitely owe you for many,

4422
02:13:15.261 --> 02:13:15.441
many,

4423
02:13:15.441 --> 02:13:17.030
many times I have to say,

4424
02:13:17.031 --> 02:13:18.020
I hope this doesn't embarrass you.

4425
02:13:18.021 --> 02:13:21.890
Did you read what that one comic set about being on Joe Rogan's podcast or

4426
02:13:21.891 --> 02:13:23.000
having Joe Rogan endorse him?

4427
02:13:23.150 --> 02:13:24.680
Was it bill burr or someone like that said,

4428
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:26.870
you are the Oprah of podcasts.

4429
02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:28.190
We come on your show.

4430
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:29.120
It just,

4431
02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:32.170
all of a sudden everything is rainbows and Unicorns us once we're on Joe

4432
02:13:32.170 --> 02:13:32.580
<v 3>show,</v>

4433
02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:34.170
which is true by the way.

4434
02:13:34.171 --> 02:13:34.950
But otherwise,

4435
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:37.170
I mean the favor you've done to all the rest of us,

4436
02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:38.820
not to kiss anybody's ass here,

4437
02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:39.721
but it really is.

4438
02:13:39.721 --> 02:13:40.481
I mean you,

4439
02:13:40.481 --> 02:13:42.390
you've made a lot of people aware of what we do.

4440
02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:42.601
Well,

4441
02:13:42.601 --> 02:13:43.170
I'm honored

4442
02:13:43.170 --> 02:13:44.010
<v 4>that I could do that,</v>

4443
02:13:44.011 --> 02:13:44.651
but you know,

4444
02:13:44.651 --> 02:13:45.270
on my end,

4445
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:46.260
from my perspective,

4446
02:13:46.261 --> 02:13:49.560
all I've done is let people know things that I found that are awesome.

4447
02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:51.390
That's not that difficult Joe Rogan book.

4448
02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:52.321
Well,

4449
02:13:52.321 --> 02:13:53.071
if you're honest,

4450
02:13:53.071 --> 02:13:56.940
if you're an honest person and I pride myself in being insanely honest to the

4451
02:13:56.941 --> 02:13:57.570
point where,

4452
02:13:57.570 --> 02:13:58.041
you know,

4453
02:13:58.041 --> 02:13:58.350
I'm,

4454
02:13:58.350 --> 02:14:02.260
I'm like one of the reasons why I'm really good at accepting criticism because I

4455
02:14:02.261 --> 02:14:04.080
am an insanely self critical.

4456
02:14:04.410 --> 02:14:04.711
I mean,

4457
02:14:04.711 --> 02:14:06.660
I'm good at avoiding going nuts.

4458
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:07.650
<v 3>I think I'm all are.</v>

4459
02:14:07.651 --> 02:14:09.010
I think that's kind of what makes you,

4460
02:14:09.011 --> 02:14:10.790
you can't do what we do without being that.

4461
02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:11.780
<v 4>I agree.</v>

4462
02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:12.470
I agree.

4463
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:13.100
But,

4464
02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:13.610
um,

4465
02:14:13.610 --> 02:14:14.091
but my,

4466
02:14:14.091 --> 02:14:16.730
my recognition of the role,

4467
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:17.121
um,

4468
02:14:17.121 --> 02:14:18.200
I'm aware of it.

4469
02:14:18.290 --> 02:14:19.640
I'm also a,

4470
02:14:19.641 --> 02:14:20.800
I'm honored and I,

4471
02:14:20.801 --> 02:14:23.660
I feel like without a doubt I have an obligation,

4472
02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:27.950
but I also feel like all I'm doing is letting people know about amazing shit

4473
02:14:27.951 --> 02:14:28.784
that already exists.

4474
02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:33.200
It's beautiful to be that sort of a conduit to be sort of a funnel point where

4475
02:14:33.201 --> 02:14:36.530
people can know they can a portal where they can go here and they can learn

4476
02:14:36.531 --> 02:14:37.670
about all sorts of cool shit.

4477
02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:39.530
But if the cool shit didn't exist,

4478
02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:41.810
I would have run out of things to talk about it a long time ago.

4479
02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:42.040
No,

4480
02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:42.531
that's through.

4481
02:14:42.531 --> 02:14:46.550
But it's also through the fact that that what you have done for so many pictures

4482
02:14:46.551 --> 02:14:47.140
on the reality is,

4483
02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:48.980
I mean when I think about un Dan Kahn,

4484
02:14:48.981 --> 02:14:50.420
for me in my life,

4485
02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:53.980
the impact that it does add coming onto your show and Dan Kuschell imparticular,

4486
02:14:55.190 --> 02:14:56.480
it's fucking hot in Rio.

4487
02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.811
You know,

4488
02:14:56.811 --> 02:14:57.320
so it's like,

4489
02:14:57.320 --> 02:14:58.910
that's why I always say as a joke,

4490
02:14:58.911 --> 02:15:00.110
but maybe not as a joke about it.

4491
02:15:00.111 --> 02:15:02.230
Like you guys ever need out moving around

4492
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:03.143
<v 3>bodies.</v>

4493
02:15:05.710 --> 02:15:06.240
But again,

4494
02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:06.720
you know

4495
02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:07.530
<v 4>what I mean?</v>

4496
02:15:07.530 --> 02:15:09.540
It's important that you guys are out there.

4497
02:15:09.541 --> 02:15:13.980
You guys are out there providing us with an entertainment information and

4498
02:15:13.981 --> 02:15:16.890
entertainment form that expands my view of the world.

4499
02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:21.660
You're personally responsible for extent expanding my view of history above and

4500
02:15:21.661 --> 02:15:23.580
beyond where it would have ever been without you.

4501
02:15:23.610 --> 02:15:24.443
That's a fact.

4502
02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:28.890
And when I looked down and iTunes and I saw your show rising through the ranks,

4503
02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:30.290
I mean I've,

4504
02:15:30.330 --> 02:15:30.990
I was,

4505
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:32.310
I was so happy for you.

4506
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:34.310
<v 3>So Oprah Book Club Picking Them Up.</v>

4507
02:15:35.290 --> 02:15:35.531
Yeah.

4508
02:15:35.531 --> 02:15:37.800
What was the highest year he got on iTunes forth.

4509
02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:38.800
That's insane.

4510
02:15:38.801 --> 02:15:39.100
That's him.

4511
02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:40.010
All of it.

4512
02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:42.010
And that's your help,

4513
02:15:42.011 --> 02:15:42.360
baby.

4514
02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:42.720
What did you,

4515
02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:44.200
what were you and your listeners too,

4516
02:15:44.201 --> 02:15:44.680
by the way,

4517
02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:45.910
before you ever came on the show,

4518
02:15:45.911 --> 02:15:46.870
what was the highest he'd ever been?

4519
02:15:46.871 --> 02:15:49.690
We got up to like eight a long,

4520
02:15:49.691 --> 02:15:52.930
long time ago before we had any of this competition we have now.

4521
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.740
You know,

4522
02:15:53.740 --> 02:15:57.400
and I don't know if folks understand that it is so competitive now.

4523
02:15:57.401 --> 02:15:58.600
There are so many things out.

4524
02:15:58.601 --> 02:16:03.070
There was so much promotion that that to reach 20th now is a bigger deal than

4525
02:16:03.071 --> 02:16:04.720
reaching seventh or eighth,

4526
02:16:04.721 --> 02:16:05.890
five or six years ago.

4527
02:16:05.891 --> 02:16:06.321
I mean it's,

4528
02:16:06.321 --> 02:16:06.461
yeah,

4529
02:16:06.461 --> 02:16:08.140
it's much more competitive.

4530
02:16:08.410 --> 02:16:08.921
But you know,

4531
02:16:08.921 --> 02:16:12.610
I mean we hover around 12th 14th 15th something like that.

4532
02:16:12.611 --> 02:16:15.110
The numbers of people making podcasts right now.

4533
02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:15.993
Crazy.

4534
02:16:16.630 --> 02:16:18.280
But I think that's a great thing.

4535
02:16:18.490 --> 02:16:19.323
Absolutely.

4536
02:16:19.610 --> 02:16:22.150
And I become an evangelist and I tell people all the time,

4537
02:16:22.270 --> 02:16:23.710
if you've ever thought about doing it,

4538
02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:24.670
you ought to try it.

4539
02:16:25.050 --> 02:16:25.391
Yeah.

4540
02:16:25.391 --> 02:16:26.330
Why not fuck up.

4541
02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:27.041
You never know.

4542
02:16:27.041 --> 02:16:27.680
You never know.

4543
02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:28.880
<v 4>I mean I would have never known.</v>

4544
02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:30.153
I would have never

4545
02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:31.340
<v 3>Joe,</v>

4546
02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:33.080
I don't mean to say it's up to it to bring up a subject.

4547
02:16:33.081 --> 02:16:34.390
Maybe your whole audience already knows.

4548
02:16:34.550 --> 02:16:36.320
How did you get the idea to do this?

4549
02:16:36.430 --> 02:16:40.930
<v 4>Well we started just putting it on a a on Ustream.</v>

4550
02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.010
We got an idea.

4551
02:16:42.011 --> 02:16:42.791
So that was first.

4552
02:16:42.791 --> 02:16:43.001
Yeah.

4553
02:16:43.001 --> 02:16:44.970
Well actually before even used to Ustream,

4554
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:46.420
there's a thing called Justin dot.

4555
02:16:46.421 --> 02:16:47.950
TV and we were on that and we would do,

4556
02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:51.130
we would broadcast from the green room and like take questions from the green

4557
02:16:51.131 --> 02:16:52.480
room and people enjoyed it.

4558
02:16:52.481 --> 02:16:53.010
It was fun.

4559
02:16:53.010 --> 02:16:54.180
<v 3>But what made you think of eve?</v>

4560
02:16:54.181 --> 02:16:56.670
I mean cause the idea of deciding to do it is such a,

4561
02:16:56.790 --> 02:16:57.900
especially back then,

4562
02:16:58.020 --> 02:16:59.790
it was such a weird step to take.

4563
02:16:59.791 --> 02:17:00.470
Well there was a lot of yeah.

4564
02:17:00.470 --> 02:17:01.460
<v 4>People that had already done it.</v>

4565
02:17:01.490 --> 02:17:01.850
Um,

4566
02:17:01.850 --> 02:17:03.590
Adam Carolla and current,

4567
02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:04.670
no Corolla didn't do it.

4568
02:17:04.671 --> 02:17:04.911
Did he?

4569
02:17:04.911 --> 02:17:05.061
Yeah,

4570
02:17:05.061 --> 02:17:05.940
he had done for me,

4571
02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:08.480
he had one straight from radio to doing it.

4572
02:17:08.481 --> 02:17:09.141
That was the first step.

4573
02:17:09.141 --> 02:17:12.620
So we had snow flakes on in the background and we just did on Ustream.

4574
02:17:12.621 --> 02:17:13.490
We didn't know what we're doing.

4575
02:17:13.550 --> 02:17:14.540
And I did it with Brian.

4576
02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:15.350
Um,

4577
02:17:15.350 --> 02:17:15.741
the,

4578
02:17:15.741 --> 02:17:16.574
uh,

4579
02:17:16.730 --> 02:17:21.170
we went from that to also opie and Anthony Opie and Anthony,

4580
02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:25.700
a great radio show on Sirius and their radio show is so similar to the way that

4581
02:17:25.701 --> 02:17:28.340
I started doing podcasts where it's just to hang,

4582
02:17:28.580 --> 02:17:29.630
it's just a conversation.

4583
02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:29.871
Right.

4584
02:17:29.871 --> 02:17:31.670
I mean sometimes I have questions for the guests.

4585
02:17:31.671 --> 02:17:34.010
Sometimes it's kind of structured in that way where there's some things that I

4586
02:17:34.011 --> 02:17:36.560
want to get to cause I know that you have an expertise in that area,

4587
02:17:36.890 --> 02:17:40.040
but a lot of it is just a bunch of people shooting the shit and just talking

4588
02:17:40.220 --> 02:17:41.360
honestly about life.

4589
02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:43.550
And I've always found that incredibly entertaining.

4590
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:46.070
And Anthony started doing this thing out of his basement.

4591
02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:48.140
He set up this thing called live from the compound.

4592
02:17:48.290 --> 02:17:48.560
He's,

4593
02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:49.011
he's a nut.

4594
02:17:49.011 --> 02:17:49.400
He's a gun.

4595
02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:51.530
Nadia is like 50 caliber machine guns and shit.

4596
02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:54.840
And he put the green screen behind him and he was doing karaoke while he's

4597
02:17:54.850 --> 02:17:56.120
singing with a gun in his hand.

4598
02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:57.770
He's fucking crazy.

4599
02:17:57.980 --> 02:17:58.491
But I was like,

4600
02:17:58.491 --> 02:18:01.250
this guy's got like a professional studio set up in his basement.

4601
02:18:01.251 --> 02:18:01.551
And I'm like,

4602
02:18:01.551 --> 02:18:02.081
God damn it,

4603
02:18:02.081 --> 02:18:03.080
we should start doing something.

4604
02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:07.400
So we started doing it just on Ustream and then started putting it on iTunes.

4605
02:18:07.401 --> 02:18:09.380
And now in the end of next month,

4606
02:18:09.381 --> 02:18:10.340
it'll be four years.

4607
02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:11.490
And you know,

4608
02:18:11.490 --> 02:18:13.660
we're 400 plus episodes in.

4609
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:15.500
<v 3>Look what iTunes has done for,</v>

4610
02:18:15.530 --> 02:18:16.460
for the whole,

4611
02:18:16.550 --> 02:18:19.550
you know what I thought the greatest thing they ever did for people like us was,

4612
02:18:19.850 --> 02:18:22.580
was not separating the ESPNs and the,

4613
02:18:22.581 --> 02:18:22.941
and the,

4614
02:18:22.941 --> 02:18:27.920
and the professional content from the stuff that we do because it allows us an

4615
02:18:27.921 --> 02:18:30.590
equal playing field in a way that if they said,

4616
02:18:30.591 --> 02:18:30.831
okay,

4617
02:18:30.831 --> 02:18:31.850
here's your professional stuff,

4618
02:18:31.851 --> 02:18:34.250
now here's your amateur stuff in this pile over here in this,

4619
02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:35.750
in this grab bag of singles.

4620
02:18:35.751 --> 02:18:36.584
Nobody wants,

4621
02:18:36.810 --> 02:18:39.500
I feel like in the same way that we just said,

4622
02:18:39.501 --> 02:18:39.720
you know,

4623
02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:39.921
I mean,

4624
02:18:39.921 --> 02:18:40.401
I owe you,

4625
02:18:40.401 --> 02:18:41.181
I owe iTunes.

4626
02:18:41.181 --> 02:18:44.000
There's a lot of people that made something possible here.

4627
02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:46.400
I don't know what I'd be doing anymore without a podcast.

4628
02:18:46.450 --> 02:18:48.170
I'm no longer a news reporter kind of guy.

4629
02:18:48.171 --> 02:18:49.430
I'm no longer a radio talk shows.

4630
02:18:49.670 --> 02:18:50.930
I'd be like janitor.

4631
02:18:50.931 --> 02:18:52.880
And I would be really bad at that too.

4632
02:18:52.881 --> 02:18:53.600
So I mean,

4633
02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:53.811
I,

4634
02:18:53.811 --> 02:18:56.120
there's a lot of people we owe for where we are today.

4635
02:18:56.180 --> 02:18:56.720
Uh,

4636
02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:57.510
no daisy.

4637
02:18:57.510 --> 02:18:57.781
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4638
02:18:57.781 --> 02:19:00.330
And if there wasn't some sort of a form like Itunes,

4639
02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:03.570
we could just upload it to them and then people could download it from the RSS

4640
02:19:03.571 --> 02:19:05.160
and the hosting services and everything.

4641
02:19:05.161 --> 02:19:05.371
Yeah,

4642
02:19:05.371 --> 02:19:05.701
yeah,

4643
02:19:05.701 --> 02:19:05.911
yeah.

4644
02:19:05.911 --> 02:19:07.620
You're number six right now in the world,

4645
02:19:07.621 --> 02:19:08.150
son.

4646
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:09.360
Ah Jeez.

4647
02:19:09.361 --> 02:19:09.961
Six on.

4648
02:19:09.961 --> 02:19:11.220
I try to be making more money.

4649
02:19:11.221 --> 02:19:11.611
Don't you think?

4650
02:19:11.611 --> 02:19:14.190
Number six in the world getting fucked and you see what I drive here?

4651
02:19:14.191 --> 02:19:17.820
Sometimes I wonder if this is America and wonder if it's the u s it's got some

4652
02:19:17.821 --> 02:19:18.900
BBC stuff on there.

4653
02:19:18.901 --> 02:19:19.590
I Dunno.

4654
02:19:19.590 --> 02:19:20.700
I Dunno if it is a,

4655
02:19:20.701 --> 02:19:22.740
whether or not is actually the country or the world,

4656
02:19:22.741 --> 02:19:23.371
but whatever it is,

4657
02:19:23.371 --> 02:19:24.860
you're number six at of all podcasts.

4658
02:19:25.170 --> 02:19:27.980
<v 3>I owe your audience and you know your audience is awesome by the</v>

4659
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.191
<v 2>way.</v>

4660
02:19:28.191 --> 02:19:28.461
I mean,

4661
02:19:28.461 --> 02:19:31.190
I hear from them and they always say the same thing I found out about you from

4662
02:19:31.191 --> 02:19:31.670
Joe Rogan.

4663
02:19:31.670 --> 02:19:32.503
Just so you know.

4664
02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.770
Find Cool Shit.

4665
02:19:33.771 --> 02:19:34.604
Don't lie to them.

4666
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:35.300
That's it.

4667
02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:35.541
Yeah.

4668
02:19:35.541 --> 02:19:36.620
You find cool shit.

4669
02:19:36.621 --> 02:19:37.454
Be Honest.

4670
02:19:37.650 --> 02:19:39.530
To be honest about how you feel about things.

4671
02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:39.981
Don't,

4672
02:19:39.981 --> 02:19:42.230
don't be transparent in the way you mean.

4673
02:19:42.410 --> 02:19:43.310
Even when I talk,

4674
02:19:43.311 --> 02:19:45.530
like if I talk about something like the,

4675
02:19:45.550 --> 02:19:48.440
the magic bullet theory where I'll argue something,

4676
02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:53.420
the bottom line always is I will tell you exactly what I actually do know and I

4677
02:19:53.421 --> 02:19:54.080
don't know.

4678
02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:54.920
I don't know what happened.

4679
02:19:54.921 --> 02:19:55.490
You can't know.

4680
02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:55.730
Right.

4681
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:59.000
And I think finding out about cool things and being honest about the and,

4682
02:19:59.020 --> 02:19:59.210
and,

4683
02:19:59.210 --> 02:20:03.500
and encouraging that sort of really objective discussion about things that

4684
02:20:03.501 --> 02:20:03.950
that's a,

4685
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:05.330
that's the thing that we're missing.

4686
02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:08.540
That's the thing we're missing in our social circles to sit thing we're missing

4687
02:20:08.541 --> 02:20:08.840
in life.

4688
02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:10.460
People get attached to ideologies.

4689
02:20:10.480 --> 02:20:10.670
Yeah.

4690
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:11.301
Like we were saying,

4691
02:20:11.301 --> 02:20:14.870
well people say one way or another and then just fucking argue it to death.

4692
02:20:14.900 --> 02:20:16.730
I know Michael Hastings was killed by then.

4693
02:20:16.731 --> 02:20:18.920
Your credibility is on the line and everything.

4694
02:20:18.921 --> 02:20:19.311
Yeah.

4695
02:20:19.311 --> 02:20:22.880
Whether it's big foot or fucking Ufos or being a Republican,

4696
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.631
there's,

4697
02:20:23.631 --> 02:20:26.730
there's people that get on a fucking team and they will,

4698
02:20:26.850 --> 02:20:28.460
all those people were a problem.

4699
02:20:28.470 --> 02:20:29.750
Their problem to themselves.

4700
02:20:29.751 --> 02:20:31.370
They're a huge problem politically too.

4701
02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:32.661
Because as I said,

4702
02:20:32.661 --> 02:20:32.880
you know,

4703
02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:35.480
it doesn't hurt us that one party does something.

4704
02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:36.890
But then when we forgive it,

4705
02:20:36.891 --> 02:20:37.910
when our Party,

4706
02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:39.980
whatever party that might be gets in power,

4707
02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:41.370
there are Democrats who,

4708
02:20:41.371 --> 02:20:41.810
who if,

4709
02:20:41.810 --> 02:20:43.100
if George W.

4710
02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:46.430
Bush was doing what President Obama is doing would be out in the streets with

4711
02:20:46.431 --> 02:20:46.851
signs,

4712
02:20:46.851 --> 02:20:47.300
but then yes,

4713
02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:50.600
it's their guy they don't and vice versa.

4714
02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:54.670
That's such a good point and one that I really get on progressive's leftwing

4715
02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:55.573
people about,

4716
02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:55.771
um,

4717
02:20:55.771 --> 02:21:00.771
like your acceptance of war crimes done under a democratic administration.

4718
02:21:01.430 --> 02:21:05.510
The idea of the same exact things being done in the Republican administration

4719
02:21:05.511 --> 02:21:08.020
would be horrific war crimes and you,

4720
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:13.030
the acceptance of them is so gross and so telling and codified the whole thing.

4721
02:21:13.491 --> 02:21:16.190
You were so against when the other guy was doing it because now you don't have a

4722
02:21:16.191 --> 02:21:16.941
leg to stand on.

4723
02:21:16.941 --> 02:21:18.320
When the Republicans get back in office,

4724
02:21:18.330 --> 02:21:18.830
do this,

4725
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:19.581
what are you going to say?

4726
02:21:19.581 --> 02:21:20.750
You got to complain about it again.

4727
02:21:20.751 --> 02:21:24.620
Then it reinforces the idea of this being a fucking simulation and that that's

4728
02:21:24.621 --> 02:21:25.530
all design.

4729
02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:27.080
We're liking that idea more and more.

4730
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:28.040
It's the Yin and Yang.

4731
02:21:28.041 --> 02:21:28.731
It's the theater.

4732
02:21:28.731 --> 02:21:29.960
It's the two party system.

4733
02:21:29.961 --> 02:21:31.880
It sounds like they brought in a fourth party,

4734
02:21:31.881 --> 02:21:33.020
but there's too confusing.

4735
02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:34.990
People didn't know what to follow anymore.

4736
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.350
They start tuning into different channels.

4737
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:39.680
So is that Perot character came along and fucking threw a big monkey wrench into

4738
02:21:39.681 --> 02:21:40.610
the whole situation.

4739
02:21:40.970 --> 02:21:41.660
It's too much.

4740
02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:43.670
Let's go back to two and a fringy.

4741
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:47.480
That's why we haven't had a third person at those presidential debates since.

4742
02:21:47.481 --> 02:21:48.021
Yeah.

4743
02:21:48.021 --> 02:21:50.080
Well the commission for presidential debates,

4744
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:54.140
a privately funded institution with half Democrats and half Republicans on their

4745
02:21:54.141 --> 02:21:54.974
staff.

4746
02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:59.510
It's hilarious and they try so hard to make sure that Weirdos don't get in the

4747
02:21:59.511 --> 02:22:01.040
Gary Johnson's of the world.

4748
02:22:01.041 --> 02:22:03.080
The people that are going to throw ask this though.

4749
02:22:03.081 --> 02:22:04.790
Why are they all Weirdos?

4750
02:22:04.791 --> 02:22:08.930
Because I keep feeling like that's almost like part of the rigged thing that if

4751
02:22:08.931 --> 02:22:10.430
you have somebody who has some ideas,

4752
02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:10.671
you go,

4753
02:22:10.671 --> 02:22:12.600
finally somebody's saying the right thing about this and they got,

4754
02:22:12.610 --> 02:22:12.791
let's go.

4755
02:22:12.791 --> 02:22:13.040
Go.

4756
02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:13.281
Yes,

4757
02:22:13.281 --> 02:22:15.440
but I'm also a secret clan member just so you know.

4758
02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:20.060
Why do they always have to come with some baggage like that you're not doing,

4759
02:22:20.290 --> 02:22:25.290
it might not be my Nazi newsletters from the past and I'll come to haunt me.

4760
02:22:25.530 --> 02:22:26.250
Right.

4761
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:29.820
That the only type of people that have the balls to step out like that or

4762
02:22:29.821 --> 02:22:32.010
socially a little wacky for everybody else.

4763
02:22:32.011 --> 02:22:32.701
It's a big risk.

4764
02:22:32.701 --> 02:22:33.451
We talk about that.

4765
02:22:33.451 --> 02:22:36.570
Like if you're Anthony Wiener and you know there's more pictures out there but

4766
02:22:36.571 --> 02:22:39.900
you run any way knowing they're going to catch you again and you do it anyway.

4767
02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:41.610
That guy,

4768
02:22:41.610 --> 02:22:45.060
obviously he's got a few fucking screws when he's running for president.

4769
02:22:45.061 --> 02:22:46.980
Next time just be ready for the publicity.

4770
02:22:46.981 --> 02:22:48.420
He's going to turn it all around.

4771
02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:48.721
Yeah.

4772
02:22:48.721 --> 02:22:49.151
Wonder what,

4773
02:22:49.151 --> 02:22:51.030
what a guy like that eventually winds up doing.

4774
02:22:51.031 --> 02:22:52.110
That is an interesting point.

4775
02:22:52.140 --> 02:22:54.000
You can have a podcast of course.

4776
02:22:54.180 --> 02:22:55.140
Probably would be good at that.

4777
02:22:55.860 --> 02:22:57.930
Good at talking about what you could tweet right there.

4778
02:22:57.931 --> 02:23:00.600
That's a good promotion of his share it with your friends before they caught him

4779
02:23:00.601 --> 02:23:01.434
the first time,

4780
02:23:01.470 --> 02:23:01.830
uh,

4781
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:02.663
being a freak,

4782
02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:03.181
they,

4783
02:23:03.181 --> 02:23:03.610
uh,

4784
02:23:03.610 --> 02:23:08.010
there was a great video of him speaking on the floor and just like really

4785
02:23:08.011 --> 02:23:11.160
passionate and screaming and yelling and very eloquent and very articulate and

4786
02:23:11.161 --> 02:23:11.341
like,

4787
02:23:11.341 --> 02:23:11.641
wow,

4788
02:23:11.641 --> 02:23:12.390
this guy is like fighting.

4789
02:23:12.390 --> 02:23:13.130
Same thing.

4790
02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:14.550
KKK letters in your past.

4791
02:23:14.551 --> 02:23:14.880
I mean,

4792
02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:16.050
why do you get one with the,

4793
02:23:16.051 --> 02:23:16.291
I mean,

4794
02:23:16.291 --> 02:23:16.890
it's crazy.

4795
02:23:16.890 --> 02:23:19.320
I think that most people when they get to be a certain age,

4796
02:23:19.321 --> 02:23:21.840
they have a family and they have obligations,

4797
02:23:21.841 --> 02:23:22.651
mortgages,

4798
02:23:22.651 --> 02:23:24.690
and they have certain risks and not willing to take.

4799
02:23:24.691 --> 02:23:27.640
And one of the big risks is you don't want to go against the target government

4800
02:23:27.641 --> 02:23:28.590
and say everyone's corrupt.

4801
02:23:28.591 --> 02:23:29.341
Like Jesus Christ,

4802
02:23:29.341 --> 02:23:29.851
they'll come after you,

4803
02:23:29.851 --> 02:23:30.690
they'll take your house,

4804
02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.201
you know,

4805
02:23:31.201 --> 02:23:31.331
your,

4806
02:23:31.331 --> 02:23:32.460
your kids got to go to college.

4807
02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:36.150
So like for the guys like the Ron Paul's of the world,

4808
02:23:36.210 --> 02:23:36.571
you know,

4809
02:23:36.571 --> 02:23:38.970
it's like to get to be a certain age where they're just,

4810
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:40.320
they don't give a fuck.

4811
02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:40.831
Like,

4812
02:23:40.831 --> 02:23:41.261
what are you going to do?

4813
02:23:41.261 --> 02:23:42.094
You're going to shoot him.

4814
02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:44.280
He's a fucking 85 years old or whatever he is.

4815
02:23:44.281 --> 02:23:44.491
You know,

4816
02:23:44.491 --> 02:23:44.761
he's,

4817
02:23:44.761 --> 02:23:48.990
he's last run for president has done now it's up to his son and his son.

4818
02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:51.480
Apparently he's been using cheat sheets.

4819
02:23:51.540 --> 02:23:53.040
What's up with that plagiarizing?

4820
02:23:53.050 --> 02:23:56.010
I gave the guy a lot of credit for that wonderful filibuster we did for the

4821
02:23:56.011 --> 02:23:56.844
fourth amendment,

4822
02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.050
got the best publicity,

4823
02:23:58.051 --> 02:24:01.260
the fourth amendment's gotten in so long and then you go pull that on me,

4824
02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:04.560
make me look like an idiot for people don't know what you're talking about.

4825
02:24:04.570 --> 02:24:07.200
That's apparently he had used some,

4826
02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:11.400
some words from some various speech that were exactly the same.

4827
02:24:11.401 --> 02:24:12.060
Exactly.

4828
02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:14.520
Is it possible that he has writers and he doesn't know?

4829
02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:15.450
That's what his father said.

4830
02:24:15.451 --> 02:24:17.970
The newsletters where that got his father in so much trouble,

4831
02:24:18.090 --> 02:24:20.880
but remember Rand Paul who have said Nice things about,

4832
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.841
also has his,

4833
02:24:21.841 --> 02:24:22.950
one of his main advisors,

4834
02:24:22.951 --> 02:24:25.080
that guy who did the southern Avenger,

4835
02:24:25.310 --> 02:24:26.010
you know confirm?

4836
02:24:26.010 --> 02:24:26.551
Oh yeah.

4837
02:24:26.551 --> 02:24:27.110
The Guy,

4838
02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:30.690
one of his advisors was the southern Avenger and he wore a mask and had a

4839
02:24:30.691 --> 02:24:33.780
confederate flag behind him and it's like a youtube show or something.

4840
02:24:33.930 --> 02:24:34.501
And then when they said,

4841
02:24:34.501 --> 02:24:35.520
are you going to fire this guy?

4842
02:24:35.521 --> 02:24:36.091
He goes something like,

4843
02:24:36.091 --> 02:24:36.241
well,

4844
02:24:36.241 --> 02:24:37.260
that's all in his past,

4845
02:24:37.530 --> 02:24:38.363
and you just go,

4846
02:24:38.610 --> 02:24:39.720
what's up with this?

4847
02:24:39.721 --> 02:24:41.370
Why are these people all crazy?

4848
02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:43.620
If you talk about freedom in our constitution,

4849
02:24:43.621 --> 02:24:44.400
you're crazy.

4850
02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:45.270
That's adorable.

4851
02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:45.630
Yeah.

4852
02:24:45.630 --> 02:24:47.580
Maybe it's the southern Avenger.

4853
02:24:47.581 --> 02:24:48.880
Look at his fellow southern is that,

4854
02:24:49.350 --> 02:24:50.370
oh my God,

4855
02:24:50.850 --> 02:24:51.210
wait,

4856
02:24:51.210 --> 02:24:53.630
if that guy's on your staff and somebody,

4857
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:54.600
you could honestly say,

4858
02:24:54.601 --> 02:24:54.781
God,

4859
02:24:54.781 --> 02:24:56.130
I didn't know he was a southern adventure.

4860
02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:57.450
Once they tell you,

4861
02:24:57.570 --> 02:25:00.210
don't you fire him five seconds later?

4862
02:25:00.270 --> 02:25:02.780
I think it's probably so,

4863
02:25:02.970 --> 02:25:03.960
so that that to me,

4864
02:25:03.961 --> 02:25:04.171
right?

4865
02:25:04.171 --> 02:25:04.471
There you go.

4866
02:25:04.471 --> 02:25:04.831
Great.

4867
02:25:04.831 --> 02:25:05.690
Thanks for taking my,

4868
02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:09.060
my pet issue of the fourth amendment and trashing it with your southern Avenger

4869
02:25:09.061 --> 02:25:09.390
guy.

4870
02:25:09.390 --> 02:25:10.950
What is a southern Avengers stance?

4871
02:25:10.951 --> 02:25:11.790
Maybe I'm on his team.

4872
02:25:12.450 --> 02:25:12.931
I don't know.

4873
02:25:12.931 --> 02:25:14.990
I have never watched the southern event.

4874
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:15.480
You want to be.

4875
02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:18.300
I saw clips painting with a broad blush brush.

4876
02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:19.950
The confederate flag does that for you.

4877
02:25:21.090 --> 02:25:21.630
I don't know.

4878
02:25:21.630 --> 02:25:23.480
What could he possibly four.

4879
02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:25.210
He's confusing the shit out of me already.

4880
02:25:25.211 --> 02:25:26.044
Conservative,

4881
02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:26.891
Libertarian,

4882
02:25:26.891 --> 02:25:27.724
Independent.

4883
02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:28.290
He's done.

4884
02:25:28.290 --> 02:25:28.500
He's,

4885
02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:28.811
he's just,

4886
02:25:28.811 --> 02:25:28.961
he's,

4887
02:25:28.961 --> 02:25:29.310
he's,

4888
02:25:29.310 --> 02:25:30.820
he's destroyed conservative,

4889
02:25:30.821 --> 02:25:33.560
independent and libertarian in one tag line.

4890
02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:34.780
He's probably,

4891
02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:35.261
you know,

4892
02:25:35.261 --> 02:25:36.580
working for a group who's design,

4893
02:25:36.610 --> 02:25:38.320
who's trying to discredit all those things.

4894
02:25:38.321 --> 02:25:40.420
I'm surprised it doesn't have a TM at the end of it.

4895
02:25:41.890 --> 02:25:42.510
We'll look,

4896
02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:43.360
look at the logo.

4897
02:25:43.361 --> 02:25:45.190
It's a better logo that a lot of people have.

4898
02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:45.520
Yeah.

4899
02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:45.761
I mean,

4900
02:25:45.761 --> 02:25:46.594
what does he try to do?

4901
02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:48.200
Is this guy still acts like a wrestler?

4902
02:25:48.210 --> 02:25:48.620
It doesn't,

4903
02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:49.270
he does.

4904
02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:50.021
Is he still have a,

4905
02:25:50.021 --> 02:25:50.681
a show now?

4906
02:25:50.681 --> 02:25:52.030
He works for Rand Paul.

4907
02:25:52.031 --> 02:25:52.864
Now.

4908
02:25:53.350 --> 02:25:54.210
They didn't fire him.

4909
02:25:54.211 --> 02:25:54.520
It.

4910
02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:55.420
Where's Brian?

4911
02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:56.530
He keeps supposed to look.

4912
02:25:56.531 --> 02:25:58.840
All that stuff is just going to interrupt.

4913
02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:00.300
Oh,

4914
02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:00.630
he's,

4915
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:04.960
he been Panish is this a temporary punishment but ran Paul still has this guy

4916
02:26:04.961 --> 02:26:05.430
working for,

4917
02:26:05.430 --> 02:26:06.263
I can't say.

4918
02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:07.430
I can't comment on that.

4919
02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:09.850
Know if the southern Avengers said anything bad.

4920
02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:12.600
He says speak at the same conferences.

4921
02:26:12.610 --> 02:26:16.690
Random Paul after neo conservative alter ego was revealed.

4922
02:26:16.930 --> 02:26:18.790
Hunter left a post on the,

4923
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.420
uh,

4924
02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:20.800
as the Kentucky senators.

4925
02:26:20.801 --> 02:26:21.634
Social media.

4926
02:26:22.450 --> 02:26:23.950
That's the guy that's southern or avenger.

4927
02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:24.821
I was,

4928
02:26:24.821 --> 02:26:25.361
I couldn't see it.

4929
02:26:25.361 --> 02:26:30.310
It looks like guys look at that photo over his right shoulder for the left

4930
02:26:30.311 --> 02:26:30.551
shoulder.

4931
02:26:30.551 --> 02:26:31.270
That's disturbing.

4932
02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:32.710
Is that guy I have no shirt on.

4933
02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:35.200
There's like a bunch of people and one guy has no shirt on.

4934
02:26:35.201 --> 02:26:36.170
That's a gay orgy.

4935
02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:39.170
Southern Gay orgy.

4936
02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:39.671
They just said,

4937
02:26:39.671 --> 02:26:41.500
we just have some chicken and we're fixing to fuck.

4938
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.700
Look at him.

4939
02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:45.100
The guy has no shirt on and a big chest tattoo.

4940
02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:49.270
What if that chest tattoo was like some fucking conservative?

4941
02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.780
You don't know what's on his back statement.

4942
02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:51.370
Yeah,

4943
02:26:51.370 --> 02:26:54.700
a big confederate flag cover of the fucking,

4944
02:26:54.730 --> 02:26:56.140
the roof of the Gel dude.

4945
02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:00.550
How come whenever you get someone who sang some important things in a halfway

4946
02:27:01.050 --> 02:27:01.883
decent way,

4947
02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:02.793
they have to come.

4948
02:27:02.830 --> 02:27:03.011
You know,

4949
02:27:03.011 --> 02:27:03.880
people say to me all the time,

4950
02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:04.810
when we vote all the time,

4951
02:27:04.811 --> 02:27:05.020
Dan,

4952
02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:08.680
the of course the countries on is it's based on voters voting for people.

4953
02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:09.461
How come?

4954
02:27:09.461 --> 02:27:12.100
When we get somebody who would like to change course in a direction,

4955
02:27:12.101 --> 02:27:16.450
most of us would like to see half of them is really fantastic and the other half

4956
02:27:16.451 --> 02:27:17.470
of them is so crazy.

4957
02:27:17.471 --> 02:27:19.330
You'd never let a person like that in a million years.

4958
02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:22.630
Why can't we have somebody who has some common sense and it doesn't sound like

4959
02:27:22.631 --> 02:27:22.720
that.

4960
02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:23.171
Two words,

4961
02:27:23.171 --> 02:27:27.010
my friends simulation theory back and diversify risk management.

4962
02:27:27.011 --> 02:27:29.500
Diversification tool.

4963
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:30.400
Yeah.

4964
02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:31.630
I wonder,

4965
02:27:31.631 --> 02:27:31.991
you know,

4966
02:27:31.991 --> 02:27:35.800
I think he's hedging his bets in case white people take over the world again,

4967
02:27:35.801 --> 02:27:36.101
you know,

4968
02:27:36.101 --> 02:27:36.241
in a,

4969
02:27:36.241 --> 02:27:36.461
in a,

4970
02:27:36.461 --> 02:27:36.731
in a,

4971
02:27:36.731 --> 02:27:38.260
in a very dominant sort of way.

4972
02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.060
We'll have the southern Avenger on staff.

4973
02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:40.861
He can advise us.

4974
02:27:40.861 --> 02:27:43.420
You ever watched those extreme preppers shows?

4975
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:45.040
Those shows were dudes or,

4976
02:27:45.041 --> 02:27:49.150
or fixing to the preparing for the end of the world or the banker people

4977
02:27:49.151 --> 02:27:54.151
stockpile and water and creating escape routes and battering rams.

4978
02:27:54.401 --> 02:27:57.280
They're welding to the front of their pickup truck opposite of the hoarders

4979
02:27:57.281 --> 02:27:59.500
because they are the borders that are doing it for a good cause,

4980
02:27:59.501 --> 02:27:59.860
right?

4981
02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:00.071
Yeah.

4982
02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:02.620
They believe that it's all going to come crumbling down and those,

4983
02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:07.860
I think that there's an mentality and the same kind of mentality that is the

4984
02:28:08.591 --> 02:28:12.520
type of person that wants to get in this word rebellious position of power,

4985
02:28:12.521 --> 02:28:13.640
rebellious position of,

4986
02:28:13.870 --> 02:28:14.703
you know,

4987
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:16.360
railing out against the government.

4988
02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:19.300
They're very similar to these people that are prepping.

4989
02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:21.950
It's very similar to their extreme folks.

4990
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:25.310
Like those are the only people that make it to the front of that crazy line.

4991
02:28:25.310 --> 02:28:26.660
They have to be a bit nutty.

4992
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:29.510
It's not that the ideas aren't interesting to you or I,

4993
02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:30.920
when you look at a guy like ran Paul,

4994
02:28:30.921 --> 02:28:34.010
the things that he says that you agree with or his dad,

4995
02:28:34.011 --> 02:28:35.690
the things that he says that you agree with,

4996
02:28:35.930 --> 02:28:37.310
but it's to get there.

4997
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:40.850
He's facing so much opposition.

4998
02:28:40.851 --> 02:28:42.590
There's so much bullshit along the way,

4999
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:43.940
so much pressure,

5000
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:44.810
so much,

5001
02:28:44.810 --> 02:28:47.720
so much back and forth debate.

5002
02:28:47.721 --> 02:28:49.040
So much frustration,

5003
02:28:49.041 --> 02:28:50.690
so much suppression of information.

5004
02:28:50.930 --> 02:28:53.750
By the time he gets to a position where the world is listening to him,

5005
02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:54.980
he's already broken.

5006
02:28:55.310 --> 02:28:58.730
He like broke every bone in his fucking soul just to get to the front of the

5007
02:28:58.731 --> 02:28:59.510
line.

5008
02:28:59.510 --> 02:29:00.241
You know what's funny though?

5009
02:29:00.241 --> 02:29:01.520
People say to me all the time,

5010
02:29:02.030 --> 02:29:02.271
you know,

5011
02:29:02.271 --> 02:29:05.120
can you get a staff together to do what you do so you can do better?

5012
02:29:05.180 --> 02:29:06.140
I want more history shows.

5013
02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:06.561
Can we,

5014
02:29:06.561 --> 02:29:07.400
can we help you do this?

5015
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:08.600
And I always say the same thing.

5016
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.871
I said,

5017
02:29:08.871 --> 02:29:12.080
you can't help me because I can't watch y'all and I can't keep track of it.

5018
02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:13.570
That's what all these people do.

5019
02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:14.061
You know,

5020
02:29:14.061 --> 02:29:14.520
what was it?

5021
02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:14.960
Uh,

5022
02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:16.160
Paul said a Ron.

5023
02:29:16.161 --> 02:29:16.521
Paul said,

5024
02:29:16.521 --> 02:29:16.701
well,

5025
02:29:16.701 --> 02:29:17.534
this guy who wrote,

5026
02:29:17.540 --> 02:29:19.040
he was doing my newsletter for me.

5027
02:29:19.041 --> 02:29:19.701
I was in Congress.

5028
02:29:19.701 --> 02:29:20.730
I didn't have time to do a newsletter.

5029
02:29:20.731 --> 02:29:23.060
So he did it and he wrote all this stuff and I didn't know what was happening.

5030
02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:25.820
That's my fear is that you're going to hire a bunch of people and then you're

5031
02:29:25.821 --> 02:29:26.654
gonna turn around and go,

5032
02:29:26.690 --> 02:29:27.590
what did you do for me?

5033
02:29:27.591 --> 02:29:27.910
What did you,

5034
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:30.020
which we started the southern Avengers show for you.

5035
02:29:30.021 --> 02:29:31.670
We thought would be a good promotional vehicle for your show,

5036
02:29:31.671 --> 02:29:32.001
Dan.

5037
02:29:32.001 --> 02:29:32.570
No doubt.

5038
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:32.871
Yeah,

5039
02:29:32.871 --> 02:29:33.650
no doubt.

5040
02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:35.030
I think that there's,

5041
02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:36.400
it's a catch 22 do you,

5042
02:29:36.401 --> 02:29:38.810
do you give away some of your control or do you keep it,

5043
02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:39.201
you know,

5044
02:29:39.201 --> 02:29:40.640
where you know everything's cool,

5045
02:29:40.641 --> 02:29:41.690
but the minute you give it away,

5046
02:29:41.691 --> 02:29:43.310
you got rogue people,

5047
02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:46.880
you know with your name running around graffitiing the side.

5048
02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:48.170
Banksy and Carlin,

5049
02:29:48.171 --> 02:29:49.004
we're here.

5050
02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:50.060
Some of the isolated,

5051
02:29:50.061 --> 02:29:51.110
the photograph pull.

5052
02:29:51.150 --> 02:29:52.040
This is the photograph.

5053
02:29:52.041 --> 02:29:53.210
It's all bunch of wrestlers.

5054
02:29:54.910 --> 02:29:55.743
Like a wrestler.

5055
02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:56.091
Yeah.

5056
02:29:56.091 --> 02:29:59.660
These are like old school southern wrestlers that I was probably right.

5057
02:29:59.661 --> 02:30:00.890
They'd probably be fucked each other.

5058
02:30:00.891 --> 02:30:01.880
As soon as this was over.

5059
02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:04.160
And this guy's got this in the,

5060
02:30:04.170 --> 02:30:04.550
the,

5061
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:04.640
well,

5062
02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:08.990
he's got it framed on his wall in the background of his fucking study.

5063
02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:10.640
So yay.

5064
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:11.690
Southern Avenger.

5065
02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:12.770
Yay.

5066
02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:13.970
Simulation theory.

5067
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:15.290
And does it say he parted ways?

5068
02:30:15.291 --> 02:30:15.741
So are so,

5069
02:30:15.741 --> 02:30:16.670
so he got rid of him.

5070
02:30:16.671 --> 02:30:17.504
Finally,

5071
02:30:17.610 --> 02:30:18.140
I guess the,

5072
02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:21.920
the hue and cry was a little too much for a sitting senator from Kentucky to

5073
02:30:21.921 --> 02:30:24.290
have somebody named the southern Avenger on his staff.

5074
02:30:24.290 --> 02:30:24.381
Well,

5075
02:30:24.381 --> 02:30:27.950
he was a cogo coauthor of the 2011 book with Rand Paul,

5076
02:30:27.951 --> 02:30:28.670
the tea party.

5077
02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:29.930
Oh God.

5078
02:30:29.931 --> 02:30:32.480
I had maybe forgotten blanked it out.

5079
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:33.343
But you're right.

5080
02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:35.450
It is funny that these people,

5081
02:30:35.451 --> 02:30:36.410
they have to be,

5082
02:30:36.530 --> 02:30:38.660
we can't have a fourth amendment person who's not Wa.

5083
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:39.440
I mean I guess you do.

5084
02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:41.090
You got guys like widen and you'd all,

5085
02:30:41.091 --> 02:30:41.841
and some of these people,

5086
02:30:41.841 --> 02:30:42.170
but,

5087
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:45.500
but when you get somebody who's a real lightning rod for this stuff and you

5088
02:30:45.501 --> 02:30:46.311
think finally,

5089
02:30:46.311 --> 02:30:47.870
we've been waiting for a guy like this forever.

5090
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:50.960
They come with these poison pills that you just can't swallow.

5091
02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:51.681
Yeah,

5092
02:30:51.681 --> 02:30:52.071
it's an,

5093
02:30:52.071 --> 02:30:53.950
it's an unfortunate reality of the,

5094
02:30:53.951 --> 02:30:54.250
the,

5095
02:30:54.250 --> 02:30:54.521
the,

5096
02:30:54.521 --> 02:30:58.190
the control that has been exerted on the political climate.

5097
02:30:58.460 --> 02:30:58.791
I mean,

5098
02:30:58.791 --> 02:31:03.710
the fact that the two party system exists just shows you how much power the

5099
02:31:03.711 --> 02:31:04.700
people that are in power.

5100
02:31:04.701 --> 02:31:04.940
You know,

5101
02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:05.900
the people that are running things,

5102
02:31:05.901 --> 02:31:09.080
how much they've actually been able to exert on our system.

5103
02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:11.350
They've locked it down to two pao,

5104
02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:15.010
two parties that are both often supported by the exact same corporations.

5105
02:31:15.011 --> 02:31:15.651
George Carlin said,

5106
02:31:15.651 --> 02:31:17.390
you know exactly how many people you have to bribe.

5107
02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:17.751
Yeah.

5108
02:31:17.751 --> 02:31:18.980
Bull Bill Hicks had the best.

5109
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:20.520
He's like a,

5110
02:31:20.521 --> 02:31:20.821
he goes,

5111
02:31:20.821 --> 02:31:21.181
well,

5112
02:31:21.181 --> 02:31:22.500
I like the puppet on the left.

5113
02:31:22.501 --> 02:31:23.610
He's more to my liking.

5114
02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:23.881
Well,

5115
02:31:23.881 --> 02:31:25.890
the pumping on the right supports my beliefs.

5116
02:31:26.010 --> 02:31:26.251
Hey,

5117
02:31:26.251 --> 02:31:28.320
wait a minute and just one guy holding both puppets.

5118
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:30.000
I mean that's really it.

5119
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:32.280
That was like his description of America.

5120
02:31:32.281 --> 02:31:33.120
That's a really good one.

5121
02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:34.590
How come we don't get it then Joe,

5122
02:31:34.591 --> 02:31:38.070
that this is what I don't understand is that if we're going to work toward this

5123
02:31:38.071 --> 02:31:41.900
awareness and if we're going to get better and and more involved in enlightened,

5124
02:31:42.270 --> 02:31:44.280
how do we not see through that scan?

5125
02:31:44.281 --> 02:31:47.190
That would only be like first scan you have to see through to get to anywhere

5126
02:31:47.191 --> 02:31:48.030
and we don't see through that.

5127
02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:48.241
Well,

5128
02:31:48.241 --> 02:31:52.140
smart people that are on the democratic side are partially to blame.

5129
02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:55.410
I'm just as much as people on the conservative side.

5130
02:31:55.411 --> 02:31:56.820
But on the democratic side,

5131
02:31:56.821 --> 02:31:59.400
I've heard so many people use the term we like,

5132
02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:03.030
we need to get into office or we need to get more this or we,

5133
02:32:03.031 --> 02:32:03.271
you know,

5134
02:32:03.271 --> 02:32:04.830
we control the house and I'm like,

5135
02:32:04.831 --> 02:32:05.370
we,

5136
02:32:05.370 --> 02:32:06.960
we like Hollywood people.

5137
02:32:06.961 --> 02:32:11.820
I have had maddening conversations with people in Hollywood that used the term

5138
02:32:11.821 --> 02:32:14.370
we to describe the Democratic Party and I'm like,

5139
02:32:14.371 --> 02:32:14.731
they're not.

5140
02:32:14.731 --> 02:32:15.270
You do,

5141
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:19.290
they're not you by a long stretch and you perpetrating this stupidity.

5142
02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:22.110
I understand that you work 12 hours a day and you don't have the time to

5143
02:32:22.111 --> 02:32:23.280
investigate this thoroughly,

5144
02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:26.940
but you pretending to be a smart guy and going with this team,

5145
02:32:26.941 --> 02:32:30.480
we need to do that and we need like how much of what they're doing are you

5146
02:32:30.481 --> 02:32:31.980
really fucking paying attention to?

5147
02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:36.980
Because this Democratic Party that's in charge right now is as Republican as it

5148
02:32:37.531 --> 02:32:42.060
gets when it comes to whistleblowers is Republican as it gets when it comes to

5149
02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:46.410
giving rights to corporations that are the same rights they used to be

5150
02:32:46.411 --> 02:32:47.610
attributed to individuals.

5151
02:32:47.620 --> 02:32:48.170
So the,

5152
02:32:48.170 --> 02:32:48.310
the,

5153
02:32:48.310 --> 02:32:48.511
the,

5154
02:32:48.511 --> 02:32:48.661
the,

5155
02:32:48.661 --> 02:32:48.841
the,

5156
02:32:48.841 --> 02:32:51.990
all the things that we were afraid of during the Bush administration,

5157
02:32:51.991 --> 02:32:56.220
they're all being done to a much lower the attacks on whistleblowers to a much

5158
02:32:56.221 --> 02:32:57.001
larger degree.

5159
02:32:57.001 --> 02:32:58.740
The tax on secrecy and privacy,

5160
02:32:58.980 --> 02:33:01.620
much larger than has ever been exhibited before.

5161
02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:03.390
Those are all Republican ideas.

5162
02:33:03.570 --> 02:33:06.060
So when do they become democratic ideas?

5163
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:10.380
I had a famous political reporter here in La when I was learning about news.

5164
02:33:10.650 --> 02:33:11.760
Explain it to me this way.

5165
02:33:11.761 --> 02:33:12.121
She goes,

5166
02:33:12.121 --> 02:33:15.630
I'm going to give you the secret to what the difference between the two parties

5167
02:33:15.631 --> 02:33:16.050
are,

5168
02:33:16.050 --> 02:33:16.930
and she kept it from me.

5169
02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:17.790
She kept it from me.

5170
02:33:17.790 --> 02:33:21.210
And then one day when we were going to interview Dan Quayle of all people,

5171
02:33:21.211 --> 02:33:21.870
believe it or not,

5172
02:33:21.870 --> 02:33:22.860
when he was the vice president,

5173
02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:23.311
she says,

5174
02:33:23.311 --> 02:33:23.581
okay,

5175
02:33:23.581 --> 02:33:26.460
the time has come to let you in on the big secret between the two parties.

5176
02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:27.770
So I leaned forward,

5177
02:33:27.771 --> 02:33:27.991
I say,

5178
02:33:27.991 --> 02:33:28.321
what is it?

5179
02:33:28.321 --> 02:33:31.680
She goes at the Republican fundraisers,

5180
02:33:31.890 --> 02:33:34.780
you get your wine in a glass at the democratic fundraisers.

5181
02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:36.120
It comes in a plastic cup.

5182
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.801
That was it.

5183
02:33:37.801 --> 02:33:39.990
That was this big piece of knowledge I was waiting for.

5184
02:33:40.050 --> 02:33:43.020
The difference between the two parties is what they serve the wine in when you

5185
02:33:43.021 --> 02:33:45.840
go to their get together so deeply entrenched in money and,

5186
02:33:45.841 --> 02:33:46.360
and when I'm,

5187
02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:49.830
when I'm saying that those are democratic ideas where those are republican

5188
02:33:49.831 --> 02:33:50.340
ideas,

5189
02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:53.130
I don't mean it as then they are actually a probably good ideas.

5190
02:33:53.131 --> 02:33:56.070
I mean that as in the people that are on the democratic side that believe in

5191
02:33:56.071 --> 02:33:58.290
equality and freedom and left wing values,

5192
02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:01.920
they think that those ideas are only things that the republican support,

5193
02:34:02.130 --> 02:34:05.820
so when they're clearly being supported by the Democratic Party,

5194
02:34:06.450 --> 02:34:07.500
W who's who,

5195
02:34:07.530 --> 02:34:08.940
what's going on is up,

5196
02:34:08.941 --> 02:34:09.810
down is down,

5197
02:34:09.811 --> 02:34:10.580
up is there,

5198
02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:12.210
is everybody getting paid here?

5199
02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:14.400
Like what exactly is going on?

5200
02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:18.550
I think we assume these people have ideas when really they're a 20% of them do,

5201
02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:22.210
but I think 80% of them have the ideas as you pay them to have and also it's a

5202
02:34:22.211 --> 02:34:23.920
giant group of people.

5203
02:34:23.921 --> 02:34:28.570
In order to play politics you have to appease certain groups and you have to be

5204
02:34:28.571 --> 02:34:32.770
very good socially at this sort of give and take system that they've put into

5205
02:34:32.771 --> 02:34:33.400
place.

5206
02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:34.750
The cronyism system,

5207
02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:36.360
I mean when you look at the the,

5208
02:34:36.361 --> 02:34:39.820
that all these people that are lobbyists live in Virginia that's right outside

5209
02:34:39.821 --> 02:34:43.390
of DC and they come in and there's all this money concentrated on making things

5210
02:34:43.391 --> 02:34:44.140
happen there.

5211
02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:47.710
It's totally against the concept of we the people.

5212
02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:52.570
It's totally against the concept of in the interests of the individual,

5213
02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:55.420
the interests of the greater good of the society as a whole.

5214
02:34:55.540 --> 02:34:56.800
It's totally against that.

5215
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:59.980
It's against it and it's transparent and it's right in everybody's face.

5216
02:34:59.981 --> 02:35:01.780
But I think a lot of people do get it.

5217
02:35:01.781 --> 02:35:04.780
Like I don't think it's an issue of lacking awareness,

5218
02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:05.530
at least now,

5219
02:35:05.530 --> 02:35:05.831
you know,

5220
02:35:05.831 --> 02:35:07.120
if you took 30 or so ago,

5221
02:35:07.121 --> 02:35:08.170
you had maybe a different story,

5222
02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:09.500
but pause,

5223
02:35:09.501 --> 02:35:10.840
sneaks on ever scenes,

5224
02:35:10.841 --> 02:35:11.111
you know,

5225
02:35:11.111 --> 02:35:14.170
confidence in government has been collapsing sharply.

5226
02:35:14.171 --> 02:35:16.150
Confidence in the political system.

5227
02:35:16.151 --> 02:35:16.610
You know,

5228
02:35:16.610 --> 02:35:19.540
everybody to some degree or neither hates each feel like,

5229
02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:19.720
ah,

5230
02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:20.351
it's like a rabbit.

5231
02:35:20.351 --> 02:35:22.330
I think that is a level of awareness of that.

5232
02:35:22.810 --> 02:35:24.550
What the reason is the,

5233
02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:24.821
okay,

5234
02:35:24.821 --> 02:35:26.050
then what do we do about it?

5235
02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:26.380
You know,

5236
02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:27.700
that part is the,

5237
02:35:28.170 --> 02:35:29.470
when we have the knowledge,

5238
02:35:29.471 --> 02:35:30.520
that distinct sucks,

5239
02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:35.350
but what can I or my neighbor or the next guy do to change this?

5240
02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:36.970
What steps could be taken?

5241
02:35:36.971 --> 02:35:38.080
And that's when people go,

5242
02:35:38.770 --> 02:35:41.050
don't you think more people know it sucks now than I've ever before.

5243
02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:42.970
And more people know why it sucks now.

5244
02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.960
And you know what the real,

5245
02:35:43.961 --> 02:35:44.301
and this,

5246
02:35:44.301 --> 02:35:47.410
this ties something else up in a boat we talked about earlier with the fracking

5247
02:35:47.411 --> 02:35:48.280
and the environmental damage.

5248
02:35:48.281 --> 02:35:48.970
Everything else.

5249
02:35:48.970 --> 02:35:51.670
Part of the problem we have too is we have a system here in the United States

5250
02:35:51.671 --> 02:35:52.030
that is,

5251
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:54.700
is designed to be moderate and not radical,

5252
02:35:54.970 --> 02:35:57.340
which sounds fine most of the time,

5253
02:35:57.550 --> 02:36:00.040
but if you put off problems long enough,

5254
02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:03.790
the solutions that are moderate to fix them are no longer useful.

5255
02:36:03.791 --> 02:36:03.941
I mean,

5256
02:36:03.941 --> 02:36:07.360
if your house is slipping on its foundation and you get to it early,

5257
02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:10.150
maybe a little bit of money and a little bit of work and you can fix that.

5258
02:36:10.151 --> 02:36:12.220
If you put that off 10 15 years,

5259
02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:14.980
the solution to that problem is a lot more radical.

5260
02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:19.480
We have put off a lot of huge problems in this country and solving them for so

5261
02:36:19.481 --> 02:36:23.950
long that the solutions are so radical that we have a system that is just geared

5262
02:36:23.951 --> 02:36:26.080
to to tamping down that sort of radicalism.

5263
02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:29.200
But what does that mean if that's what it takes to fix some of the problems?

5264
02:36:29.650 --> 02:36:31.270
That's a very interesting point.

5265
02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:34.810
And then there's the idea that we're going to come up with some way in the

5266
02:36:34.811 --> 02:36:38.290
future to clean up all the mess that we've created and we'll fix it later.

5267
02:36:38.291 --> 02:36:39.250
Something will be invented.

5268
02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:42.400
The technology with the caraway need to do is get our backs against the wall

5269
02:36:42.401 --> 02:36:44.020
cause that's when America is at its best,

5270
02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:44.680
right?

5271
02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:46.150
We got our back against the wall.

5272
02:36:46.151 --> 02:36:46.841
I'll tell you what,

5273
02:36:46.841 --> 02:36:47.890
we come out swinging,

5274
02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:50.890
the better mouse trap will emerge and come out swinging and we're going to make

5275
02:36:50.891 --> 02:36:53.920
some GMO fish that eat plastic and send them bitches out there.

5276
02:36:53.921 --> 02:36:55.090
And then we've got all our problems.

5277
02:36:55.091 --> 02:36:58.210
So we're going to have the greatest population of fish and the history of the

5278
02:36:58.211 --> 02:37:01.430
fucking ocean because we're going to have plastic eating fish that we've made in

5279
02:37:01.431 --> 02:37:02.050
the lab.

5280
02:37:02.050 --> 02:37:04.020
They've got a steel lining to their stomach and they,

5281
02:37:04.021 --> 02:37:05.800
they run on fossil fuels,

5282
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:07.570
forced consciousness expansion.

5283
02:37:07.571 --> 02:37:11.110
Maybe they will prompt the awareness by putting the hallucinogenics in the

5284
02:37:11.111 --> 02:37:11.800
water.

5285
02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:12.633
And there you go.

5286
02:37:12.730 --> 02:37:13.151
Well the,

5287
02:37:13.151 --> 02:37:14.920
a lot of people believe that they came and asteroids,

5288
02:37:14.930 --> 02:37:15.763
Dan Carlin,

5289
02:37:16.270 --> 02:37:19.460
<v 4>they came from other planets simulation.</v>

5290
02:37:19.461 --> 02:37:21.140
There are no other planets that chemical,

5291
02:37:21.141 --> 02:37:22.820
the chemical composition of mushrooms,

5292
02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:24.650
the four phosphoryl,

5293
02:37:24.651 --> 02:37:27.500
oxy and and dime methyl tryptamine or however you say it.

5294
02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:28.520
Wow.

5295
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:29.830
Things being in the,

5296
02:37:29.831 --> 02:37:31.610
the phosphorus in the four positions,

5297
02:37:31.611 --> 02:37:32.241
the only one,

5298
02:37:32.241 --> 02:37:34.490
the only group of them in the entire world.

5299
02:37:34.610 --> 02:37:35.391
So there's no,

5300
02:37:35.391 --> 02:37:35.631
there's,

5301
02:37:35.631 --> 02:37:37.820
there's no immediate ancestors to suicide.

5302
02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:39.260
We're talking way over my head.

5303
02:37:39.470 --> 02:37:40.960
I'm talking over my head to way over my head,

5304
02:37:41.210 --> 02:37:42.960
Pete and some shit that I heard Terence Mckenna said,

5305
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:48.410
the idea is clear on that right spores can survive in a vacuum.

5306
02:37:48.411 --> 02:37:51.620
The idea of pants Barea Panspermia is a,

5307
02:37:51.621 --> 02:37:55.820
a well accepted idea in astronomy and that idea is that life to building blocks

5308
02:37:55.821 --> 02:37:56.331
from life.

5309
02:37:56.331 --> 02:37:58.220
Water even came from other planets.

5310
02:37:58.460 --> 02:38:00.060
Asteroid impacts on other planets,

5311
02:38:00.061 --> 02:38:01.580
sent large bodies into space.

5312
02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:02.660
They landed on earth.

5313
02:38:02.661 --> 02:38:03.770
Many of them perhaps,

5314
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.490
you know,

5315
02:38:04.490 --> 02:38:07.610
billions and billions and billions of years ago and actually created the ocean's

5316
02:38:07.611 --> 02:38:09.350
actually created a lot of life itself,

5317
02:38:09.351 --> 02:38:10.400
the building blocks for life.

5318
02:38:10.490 --> 02:38:14.660
So in a sense we are all of alien composition period,

5319
02:38:14.930 --> 02:38:17.210
but other things are continuing to come this way,

5320
02:38:17.211 --> 02:38:18.290
including spores,

5321
02:38:18.410 --> 02:38:19.970
which can survive in a vacuum.

5322
02:38:20.270 --> 02:38:23.600
And when you have large doses of siliciden mushrooms,

5323
02:38:23.601 --> 02:38:27.470
one of the weird things is you feel like you're communicating with something.

5324
02:38:27.650 --> 02:38:31.700
You feel like your and the whimsical amongst us believe that what you're

5325
02:38:31.701 --> 02:38:35.030
actually doing is communicating with an alien life form that have,

5326
02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:38.270
has come here and wants you to eat it in order to tune into it.

5327
02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:39.250
<v 3>You know,</v>

5328
02:38:39.250 --> 02:38:43.190
I actually have some thoughts that I agree with some of that.

5329
02:38:43.191 --> 02:38:43.301
And,

5330
02:38:43.301 --> 02:38:45.800
and this is coming from someone who doesn't talk about this very much,

5331
02:38:46.100 --> 02:38:49.640
but I've always been fascinated with how things like that had been used by

5332
02:38:49.641 --> 02:38:53.330
humankind throughout history as a means to open up other,

5333
02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:53.750
you know,

5334
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:55.730
to use Huxley's term doors of perception.

5335
02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:56.953
Um,

5336
02:38:57.050 --> 02:38:58.940
it's fascinating to me when you think,

5337
02:38:59.010 --> 02:39:01.460
if you think that none of this stuff is,

5338
02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:01.731
you know,

5339
02:39:01.731 --> 02:39:03.320
if you think about evolutionary things,

5340
02:39:03.321 --> 02:39:03.560
right?

5341
02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:05.030
So this is all stuff that evolves.

5342
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:07.190
Why the hell were hallucinogenic mushrooms?

5343
02:39:07.490 --> 02:39:10.490
What's the evolutionary benefit to the mushroom itself?

5344
02:39:10.610 --> 02:39:11.130
To have that.

5345
02:39:11.130 --> 02:39:14.870
Is it supposed to ward off birds from eating it because they get a bad trip?

5346
02:39:14.871 --> 02:39:15.704
If they do,

5347
02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:17.210
I find it fascinating.

5348
02:39:17.211 --> 02:39:18.230
How much of a role,

5349
02:39:18.231 --> 02:39:18.441
you know,

5350
02:39:18.441 --> 02:39:20.450
we did a podcast once about the,

5351
02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:20.901
the,

5352
02:39:20.901 --> 02:39:24.470
the hidden side of intoxication in history.

5353
02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:29.180
Well I think you could make a very good case that hallucinogenics of all kinds

5354
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:32.630
have probably played huge roles in history that we don't even know about,

5355
02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:35.750
especially with tribal peoples who have played a huge role.

5356
02:39:35.751 --> 02:39:36.110
I mean,

5357
02:39:36.110 --> 02:39:39.320
why did the Germans decided to migrate into Roman territory?

5358
02:39:39.321 --> 02:39:39.651
It just,

5359
02:39:39.651 --> 02:39:43.550
this time will they have sorcerers and which doctors as part of their culture

5360
02:39:43.610 --> 02:39:47.150
who lose used hallucinogenics who knows that they didn't go to the chiefs in

5361
02:39:47.151 --> 02:39:47.511
there and say,

5362
02:39:47.511 --> 02:39:49.160
you remember that thing I told you we have to do?

5363
02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:51.080
I was just told now's the right time.

5364
02:39:51.170 --> 02:39:53.810
Move into that Roman territory and all history is different.

5365
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:55.160
I mean that's the side of history.

5366
02:39:55.161 --> 02:39:56.180
We're never going to get,

5367
02:39:56.390 --> 02:39:58.880
be interesting to find out how much of history has been determined by things

5368
02:39:58.881 --> 02:39:59.241
like that.

5369
02:39:59.241 --> 02:39:59.750
The episode,

5370
02:39:59.750 --> 02:40:00.021
by the way,

5371
02:40:00.021 --> 02:40:00.830
it was hilarious.

5372
02:40:00.830 --> 02:40:01.663
I remember

5373
02:40:02.940 --> 02:40:04.640
the problem is is that you can't know,

5374
02:40:04.641 --> 02:40:06.230
so the whole thing is speculative,

5375
02:40:06.231 --> 02:40:06.800
but you can say,

5376
02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:06.981
well,

5377
02:40:06.981 --> 02:40:09.830
Napoleon had opium the night before Waterloo and he slept late and he was

5378
02:40:09.831 --> 02:40:10.251
sluggish.

5379
02:40:10.251 --> 02:40:11.450
How much did that impact history?

5380
02:40:11.451 --> 02:40:12.560
And some you've got to go,

5381
02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:14.250
you've got to the little teeny pieces

5382
02:40:14.250 --> 02:40:15.120
<v 2>of the jigsaw puzzle,</v>

5383
02:40:15.121 --> 02:40:16.560
you know about that construct.

5384
02:40:16.561 --> 02:40:18.600
A totally fictional narrative that might be true.

5385
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:18.751
Well,

5386
02:40:18.751 --> 02:40:20.220
there's one thing that's undeniable.

5387
02:40:20.221 --> 02:40:22.140
People love altering their consciousness.

5388
02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:23.033
Yes,

5389
02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:23.640
it's true.

5390
02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:27.780
They love it so much that in this day and age we have partnership for a drug

5391
02:40:27.781 --> 02:40:30.750
free America and they're finding against the trend,

5392
02:40:30.751 --> 02:40:31.170
right?

5393
02:40:31.170 --> 02:40:35.550
Who not only that are funded initially by alcohol and tobacco companies now

5394
02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:37.500
mostly by pharmaceutical muscletech of course,

5395
02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:40.440
which is so rich and so delicious.

5396
02:40:40.441 --> 02:40:40.561
I,

5397
02:40:40.561 --> 02:40:41.360
the way I described it,

5398
02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:46.290
I go that having pharmaceutical companies and allowing them to do literally

5399
02:40:46.291 --> 02:40:50.200
commercials against marijuana is like hookers making commercials against

5400
02:40:50.201 --> 02:40:51.034
strippers.

5401
02:40:51.270 --> 02:40:52.050
Right?

5402
02:40:52.050 --> 02:40:52.570
That's,

5403
02:40:52.570 --> 02:40:53.030
it's literally,

5404
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:54.930
it's like the most ridiculous things.

5405
02:40:54.931 --> 02:40:55.650
It is.

5406
02:40:55.650 --> 02:40:57.330
The idea behind it is,

5407
02:40:57.420 --> 02:40:57.930
you know,

5408
02:40:57.930 --> 02:40:59.190
it's so preposterous,

5409
02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:01.080
but we have,

5410
02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:05.190
we still have a method and as long as you give people a method,

5411
02:41:05.310 --> 02:41:07.290
if they'll accept a certain amount of restrictions,

5412
02:41:07.470 --> 02:41:09.870
as long as the method is good and the method is very good,

5413
02:41:09.871 --> 02:41:11.630
the alcohol method is great for most sacks.

5414
02:41:12.110 --> 02:41:12.841
If prohibition,

5415
02:41:12.841 --> 02:41:13.710
I hadn't been repealed,

5416
02:41:13.711 --> 02:41:13.861
I mean,

5417
02:41:13.861 --> 02:41:17.490
think about how interesting a world we might live in today had that stayed the

5418
02:41:17.491 --> 02:41:18.390
law of the land.

5419
02:41:18.450 --> 02:41:19.290
I don't think it can.

5420
02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:22.440
I don't think you can have no options for people to,

5421
02:41:22.530 --> 02:41:22.771
well,

5422
02:41:22.771 --> 02:41:23.131
the old,

5423
02:41:23.131 --> 02:41:24.930
one thing that's interesting is during prohibition,

5424
02:41:24.931 --> 02:41:26.040
marijuana was legal.

5425
02:41:26.130 --> 02:41:28.350
Marijuana wasn't legal until after prohibition.

5426
02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:30.940
The Henry Anslinger and all those pet.

5427
02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:31.171
Yeah,

5428
02:41:31.171 --> 02:41:33.900
Harry Anslinger and I'm William Randolph Hearst.

5429
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.900
They actually did,

5430
02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:36.060
they originally done it.

5431
02:41:36.090 --> 02:41:39.780
They really originally did it to try to suppress hemp as a commodity because you

5432
02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:42.630
got so much more than you got out of threes.

5433
02:41:42.631 --> 02:41:45.170
And if you're in the business of making paper business,

5434
02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:46.710
the logging industry,

5435
02:41:46.830 --> 02:41:49.590
and that's also a perfect example of the difference between controlling

5436
02:41:49.591 --> 02:41:50.101
information.

5437
02:41:50.101 --> 02:41:51.180
Back then and today,

5438
02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:55.560
they were able to sell this idea that there's a new drug that was forcing

5439
02:41:55.770 --> 02:41:57.270
Mexicans and blacks to wait,

5440
02:41:57.271 --> 02:42:00.450
rape white women and they even name this drug marijuana,

5441
02:42:00.451 --> 02:42:05.451
which is a name for a Mexican slang term for a while tobacco had nothing to do

5442
02:42:05.581 --> 02:42:06.414
with cannabis.

5443
02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:07.860
You know what does blow me away though?

5444
02:42:07.861 --> 02:42:08.520
It blows me away.

5445
02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:11.130
I can understand you making the case that this has to be illegal.

5446
02:42:11.131 --> 02:42:11.881
Whatever we're talking,

5447
02:42:11.881 --> 02:42:14.910
this has to be legal because it's so dangerous and we know it so dangerous.

5448
02:42:15.180 --> 02:42:18.890
What I don't understand is that we basically have a policy in this country that

5449
02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:20.850
there will be no new intoxicants.

5450
02:42:20.970 --> 02:42:24.450
If something is invented in a bath tub tomorrow that doesn't hurt anybody,

5451
02:42:24.451 --> 02:42:25.440
that has no hangovers,

5452
02:42:25.441 --> 02:42:26.370
that nobody gets in car.

5453
02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:30.600
We're going to ban it the day after tomorrow on general principles and that's

5454
02:42:30.601 --> 02:42:31.351
what I don't understand.

5455
02:42:31.351 --> 02:42:31.861
What is that?

5456
02:42:31.861 --> 02:42:35.580
There are beneficial drugs that they have to attribute to diseases in order to

5457
02:42:35.581 --> 02:42:36.670
get them pass through there.

5458
02:42:36.750 --> 02:42:40.830
Like there's a thing called provigil and provigil is this smart drug that all of

5459
02:42:40.831 --> 02:42:42.440
these is silicon valley on

5460
02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:44.850
breast.

5461
02:42:44.850 --> 02:42:45.960
Some pretty impressive stuff.

5462
02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:50.370
Provigils pretty wild and it gives you this buzz but it doesn't give you a

5463
02:42:50.371 --> 02:42:50.940
caffeine.

5464
02:42:50.940 --> 02:42:51.331
He buzz,

5465
02:42:51.331 --> 02:42:52.620
it's not like a heart rate thing.

5466
02:42:52.621 --> 02:42:54.030
It gives you this clarity thing.

5467
02:42:54.031 --> 02:42:57.110
It's a very strange sort of intoxicant or of,

5468
02:42:57.111 --> 02:42:58.830
it's sort of a pharmaceutical drug rather.

5469
02:42:59.010 --> 02:42:59.843
But they,

5470
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:03.420
they couldn't just sell it as a performance enhancing drug,

5471
02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:07.680
so they had to sell it as some sort of a response to a disease.

5472
02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:09.180
So they came up with narcolepsy.

5473
02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:09.501
It's like,

5474
02:43:09.501 --> 02:43:09.910
yeah,

5475
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:10.470
narcolepsy.

5476
02:43:10.470 --> 02:43:11.200
I've heard about,

5477
02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:13.480
but it was originally created in order to like,

5478
02:43:13.481 --> 02:43:15.280
it was created to benefit consciousness,

5479
02:43:15.370 --> 02:43:16.660
but you can't do that.

5480
02:43:16.780 --> 02:43:20.140
You can't have a drug that just a drug that makes you smarter.

5481
02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:21.310
You literally can't you,

5482
02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:25.720
there has to be something wrong with your fucking brain so they have to come up

5483
02:43:25.721 --> 02:43:26.250
with something.

5484
02:43:26.250 --> 02:43:26.740
Right.

5485
02:43:26.740 --> 02:43:27.940
That's a weird rut.

5486
02:43:28.270 --> 02:43:29.230
But here's the weird thing.

5487
02:43:29.231 --> 02:43:30.490
If that's how it has to be.

5488
02:43:30.491 --> 02:43:33.340
Why don't they all go back and then find things,

5489
02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:34.010
you know?

5490
02:43:34.010 --> 02:43:35.920
Couldn't you sell the old drugs that way?

5491
02:43:36.250 --> 02:43:36.431
Yeah,

5492
02:43:36.431 --> 02:43:37.510
I guess they are kind of,

5493
02:43:37.511 --> 02:43:38.321
I mean if you think about it,

5494
02:43:38.321 --> 02:43:41.920
that's what the whole medical marijuana kind of thing could be construed as if

5495
02:43:41.921 --> 02:43:42.754
you wanted to.

5496
02:43:42.820 --> 02:43:43.061
Well,

5497
02:43:43.061 --> 02:43:44.470
we found a new way to market this thing.

5498
02:43:44.471 --> 02:43:45.880
It's a solution to a problem.

5499
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:46.151
Yeah.

5500
02:43:46.151 --> 02:43:46.450
Well,

5501
02:43:46.450 --> 02:43:48.760
medical marijuana is the reason why they're,

5502
02:43:48.790 --> 02:43:52.540
that's the backdoor that I think we all understand that even if we think that

5503
02:43:52.541 --> 02:43:52.901
there are,

5504
02:43:52.901 --> 02:43:55.270
and I do think there are medical uses for this stuff,

5505
02:43:55.271 --> 02:43:59.170
there's no question that it has been used as a backdoor to sort of open the door

5506
02:43:59.171 --> 02:44:01.540
to what would not have been possible without it.

5507
02:44:01.570 --> 02:44:02.650
Also all genius.

5508
02:44:03.490 --> 02:44:04.810
I'm just throwing it out there.

5509
02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:07.810
Getting people in government addicted to the money and the revenue that it

5510
02:44:07.811 --> 02:44:08.141
brings us.

5511
02:44:08.141 --> 02:44:08.711
True legal.

5512
02:44:08.711 --> 02:44:09.280
That's church.

5513
02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:10.750
You don't get at all.

5514
02:44:10.750 --> 02:44:11.583
If it's illegal,

5515
02:44:11.730 --> 02:44:11.941
the,

5516
02:44:11.941 --> 02:44:14.430
the money still goes into the economy and that's,

5517
02:44:14.431 --> 02:44:18.100
that's been really documented in British Columbia that the economy is very

5518
02:44:18.101 --> 02:44:18.641
dependent.

5519
02:44:18.641 --> 02:44:19.630
Even though it's illegal,

5520
02:44:20.020 --> 02:44:23.200
but the taxes that you would get from selling it,

5521
02:44:23.350 --> 02:44:27.850
the government actually is what loses out on marijuana being illegal.

5522
02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:32.200
The government loses out because they not getting any of the tax money from it

5523
02:44:32.201 --> 02:44:36.100
being sold to one of the things we create and do well in this country too.

5524
02:44:36.101 --> 02:44:39.960
You'd think they'd be hard to sort of safeguard the few things we do well and

5525
02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:40.803
producing in this guy.

5526
02:44:40.890 --> 02:44:42.880
They're just starting to now pass laws and no,

5527
02:44:42.881 --> 02:44:45.010
and on it we sell hemp protein powder,

5528
02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:47.710
but we have to buy or hemp protein powder in Canada.

5529
02:44:47.830 --> 02:44:49.060
It's legal to possess.

5530
02:44:49.061 --> 02:44:49.960
It's legal to sell.

5531
02:44:50.110 --> 02:44:51.280
It's not legal to grow.

5532
02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:55.510
That is so asinine because you're not even talking about a psychoactive plan.

5533
02:44:55.690 --> 02:44:58.390
You're talking about the male version of the cannabis plant.

5534
02:44:58.420 --> 02:44:59.500
It's roped the very,

5535
02:44:59.501 --> 02:44:59.711
yeah,

5536
02:44:59.711 --> 02:45:00.850
the different variations.

5537
02:45:00.851 --> 02:45:01.171
The the,

5538
02:45:01.171 --> 02:45:03.160
the cousins of the cannabis plant,

5539
02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:03.750
there's,

5540
02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:05.260
there's more than one different type of hemp,

5541
02:45:05.261 --> 02:45:06.190
but all of them,

5542
02:45:06.250 --> 02:45:10.390
what they all have in la and they share in common is the amount of THC in them

5543
02:45:10.391 --> 02:45:11.770
is insanely small.

5544
02:45:11.950 --> 02:45:14.380
So what you're getting out of it is just a textile you're getting,

5545
02:45:14.381 --> 02:45:15.161
you're getting close,

5546
02:45:15.161 --> 02:45:15.881
you're getting oil,

5547
02:45:15.881 --> 02:45:19.480
you're getting food that you can eat and we can't even grow it in America.

5548
02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:22.630
We're buying it in bulk from Canada and then we sell it.

5549
02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:25.870
We try to buy the best stuff that we could possibly find and it's really

5550
02:45:25.871 --> 02:45:30.220
difficult like because unless you can grow it yourself like it's hard to quality

5551
02:45:30.221 --> 02:45:30.701
control.

5552
02:45:30.701 --> 02:45:31.151
You have to,

5553
02:45:31.151 --> 02:45:35.110
you have to like really search out these farms that are in another country that

5554
02:45:35.111 --> 02:45:37.480
are growing this shit and it's so stupid,

5555
02:45:37.630 --> 02:45:41.500
so they're just starting to pass laws that are allowing farmers to grow it.

5556
02:45:41.501 --> 02:45:42.334
In America.

5557
02:45:42.430 --> 02:45:44.230
California's recently passed it.

5558
02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:46.090
They're trying to pass it in other states.

5559
02:45:46.091 --> 02:45:49.780
I believe they passed it in Colorado and I believe they passed it in Washington

5560
02:45:49.781 --> 02:45:52.990
state because those are the two places where they've made it legal to consume

5561
02:45:52.991 --> 02:45:53.650
for adults.

5562
02:45:53.650 --> 02:45:54.550
I sewed the,

5563
02:45:54.551 --> 02:45:56.380
one of the best documentaries I've seen on these,

5564
02:45:56.381 --> 02:45:58.900
there's this documentary called standing silent nation,

5565
02:45:58.930 --> 02:46:01.660
which is what happened a few years ago on the Pine Ridge reservation surveys.

5566
02:46:01.710 --> 02:46:04.360
Start with for those who are Italian accent impaired,

5567
02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:08.400
he said standing silent nature nation nation.

5568
02:46:08.420 --> 02:46:10.100
So I understood him.

5569
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:11.140
<v 5>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

5570
02:46:11.150 --> 02:46:12.260
Standing silent nation.

5571
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:14.491
That was really cool.

5572
02:46:14.491 --> 02:46:16.040
It showed what happened on Pine Ridge,

5573
02:46:16.041 --> 02:46:16.630
which was,

5574
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.850
you know,

5575
02:46:16.850 --> 02:46:20.690
one of the poorest reservations in the United States where prospects for

5576
02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:22.940
economic growth are really deem.

5577
02:46:23.330 --> 02:46:24.500
And so what these guys did,

5578
02:46:24.501 --> 02:46:25.101
they figure,

5579
02:46:25.101 --> 02:46:25.341
you know,

5580
02:46:25.341 --> 02:46:29.780
we are somewhat of a sovereign entity because that's our reservation sat right

5581
02:46:29.781 --> 02:46:31.460
there in this weird limbo and they figure,

5582
02:46:31.461 --> 02:46:31.671
okay,

5583
02:46:31.671 --> 02:46:34.430
we can plant industrial hamper,

5584
02:46:34.490 --> 02:46:35.390
will cultivate it,

5585
02:46:35.391 --> 02:46:36.260
will do this whole thing.

5586
02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:40.190
And you see the progression through drew command three of the viciousness with

5587
02:46:40.191 --> 02:46:43.970
which the da goes after them to just stamp it out.

5588
02:46:44.060 --> 02:46:46.640
And you see the facts that you are listening right now.

5589
02:46:46.641 --> 02:46:49.340
You know the THC aspect and the fact that this is not a drag.

5590
02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:49.641
You know,

5591
02:46:49.641 --> 02:46:50.990
we're not talking about a drug.

5592
02:46:51.290 --> 02:46:54.290
You're not talking about marijuana as a,

5593
02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:54.711
you know,

5594
02:46:54.711 --> 02:46:56.780
even money when I was there [inaudible] but let's,

5595
02:46:56.781 --> 02:46:58.130
that's a whole different stories.

5596
02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:00.860
There are none of the THC that you find in that.

5597
02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:01.850
It's the same plant,

5598
02:47:01.970 --> 02:47:05.900
but he's like marijuana without the stuff that gets you high and you use it for

5599
02:47:05.901 --> 02:47:07.370
Emilio and seeing so that as you say,

5600
02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:10.370
it's legal to own the products in the United States,

5601
02:47:10.610 --> 02:47:13.730
but it's not legal to grow it where we can actually make it a product in the

5602
02:47:13.731 --> 02:47:15.830
United States and there's no argument for it.

5603
02:47:15.890 --> 02:47:17.030
It just makes no sense.

5604
02:47:17.090 --> 02:47:17.660
It's a t,

5605
02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:17.991
it's a,

5606
02:47:17.991 --> 02:47:18.771
it's a commodity.

5607
02:47:18.771 --> 02:47:22.520
It's a commodity that's being banned because of a close association with an

5608
02:47:22.521 --> 02:47:24.080
intoxicated intoxicated.

5609
02:47:24.081 --> 02:47:24.411
By the way,

5610
02:47:24.411 --> 02:47:25.950
it's the safest known to man one,

5611
02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:31.020
not that has massive amounts of medical benefits documented for sure for real

5612
02:47:31.611 --> 02:47:34.430
noncontroversial medical benefits and it's illegal.

5613
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:36.570
<v 3>I've never understood why we don't have,</v>

5614
02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:36.931
you know,

5615
02:47:36.931 --> 02:47:41.820
cause I always thought one of the arguments that screwed up kids the most was to

5616
02:47:41.821 --> 02:47:44.600
put marijuana on this list of terrible drugs because then they,

5617
02:47:44.601 --> 02:47:45.690
when they try the marijuana,

5618
02:47:45.691 --> 02:47:47.200
they think you're lying about the heroin.

5619
02:47:47.380 --> 02:47:47.670
Right.

5620
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:51.930
I always thought that there ought to be a checklist that the government used to

5621
02:47:51.931 --> 02:47:53.850
decide if something should be legal or illegal.

5622
02:47:54.030 --> 02:47:54.271
You know,

5623
02:47:54.271 --> 02:47:55.081
a hundred questions.

5624
02:47:55.081 --> 02:47:56.700
How addictive is it likely to be,

5625
02:47:56.701 --> 02:47:57.060
you know,

5626
02:47:57.060 --> 02:47:57.631
how dangerous,

5627
02:47:57.631 --> 02:47:58.261
how many of you blah blah,

5628
02:47:58.261 --> 02:47:58.590
blah.

5629
02:47:58.590 --> 02:48:00.030
And then if you pass or fail,

5630
02:48:00.031 --> 02:48:00.811
you know you pass,

5631
02:48:00.811 --> 02:48:01.261
it's legal.

5632
02:48:01.261 --> 02:48:01.981
If you fit that,

5633
02:48:01.981 --> 02:48:05.280
that also would be used if you invent some new bathtub drug tomorrow.

5634
02:48:05.370 --> 02:48:05.761
Okay,

5635
02:48:05.761 --> 02:48:07.020
well let's run it down the checklist.

5636
02:48:07.021 --> 02:48:07.141
Right.

5637
02:48:07.141 --> 02:48:08.400
And then you could say to the people,

5638
02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:09.151
well look,

5639
02:48:09.151 --> 02:48:12.750
I mean here's how it's scored in the checklist and I think the damage to that

5640
02:48:12.751 --> 02:48:13.111
would be,

5641
02:48:13.111 --> 02:48:15.670
cause alcohol might not score very highly on that.

5642
02:48:16.390 --> 02:48:19.650
But certainly I don't think that there's any way marijuana doesn't score better

5643
02:48:19.651 --> 02:48:22.200
than most of the intoxicants that are out there today.

5644
02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:23.453
And I think,

5645
02:48:24.450 --> 02:48:28.380
I guess what I'm saying is I think it would help me in raising my own children

5646
02:48:28.381 --> 02:48:32.100
and keeping them off these harder drugs to be able to have a decent argument.

5647
02:48:32.101 --> 02:48:36.000
There's a good reason this heroin isn't in general use kids.

5648
02:48:36.090 --> 02:48:36.960
It'll really hurt you.

5649
02:48:36.961 --> 02:48:37.620
Trust me.

5650
02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:39.500
It wouldn't be illegal if it wouldn't really hurt.

5651
02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:43.170
<v 5>Well what's mind boggling is that that's not even scheduled one here.</v>

5652
02:48:43.250 --> 02:48:45.070
I know cause medical use census,

5653
02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:45.770
right?

5654
02:48:45.770 --> 02:48:48.290
Heroin is scheduled scheduled to schedule one,

5655
02:48:48.291 --> 02:48:50.150
the most dangerous of all drugs.

5656
02:48:50.151 --> 02:48:51.050
Marijuana is in that.

5657
02:48:51.230 --> 02:48:54.230
I remember that a running salt that Ronald Reagan in the 80s,

5658
02:48:54.231 --> 02:48:56.720
marijuana is the most dangerous drug in America.

5659
02:48:56.960 --> 02:48:58.130
That was a great speech.

5660
02:48:58.510 --> 02:49:00.330
How could you hold that face?

5661
02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:01.760
It's hilarious.

5662
02:49:01.970 --> 02:49:02.211
You know,

5663
02:49:02.211 --> 02:49:04.490
they found that cone snail venom,

5664
02:49:04.570 --> 02:49:04.970
um,

5665
02:49:04.970 --> 02:49:07.980
there they can make a drug out of cone snail venom that it's

5666
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:12.690
<v 2>a hundred times more potent than any existing pain medication and it's</v>

5667
02:49:12.691 --> 02:49:14.140
completely non addictive.

5668
02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:19.880
So it works a hundred times better than all of the oxycontins and all that other

5669
02:49:20.311 --> 02:49:20.670
shit.

5670
02:49:20.670 --> 02:49:21.690
And it's not addictive.

5671
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.903
Why listen to this,

5672
02:49:23.650 --> 02:49:26.110
<v 6>the message this evening is not my message,</v>

5673
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:27.783
but hours.

5674
02:49:28.570 --> 02:49:30.130
Despite our best efforts,

5675
02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:31.720
shortage of marijuana,

5676
02:49:31.721 --> 02:49:34.660
I now being reported from the early,

5677
02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:35.800
<v 2>this is not,</v>

5678
02:49:35.800 --> 02:49:36.320
this is,

5679
02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:38.020
this is a parody parody.

5680
02:49:38.370 --> 02:49:40.230
You fail,

5681
02:49:40.590 --> 02:49:41.520
fail hard,

5682
02:49:41.521 --> 02:49:41.821
dude.

5683
02:49:41.821 --> 02:49:43.930
So what I have to say to my mythical producer all the time,

5684
02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:44.300
fail.

5685
02:49:44.300 --> 02:49:45.180
How dare you?

5686
02:49:45.690 --> 02:49:46.523
Um,

5687
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:47.160
yeah,

5688
02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:47.751
it,

5689
02:49:47.751 --> 02:49:51.900
it becomes an insult and it becomes one more piece of evidence that we're

5690
02:49:51.901 --> 02:49:52.620
getting fucked.

5691
02:49:52.620 --> 02:49:53.111
And it's,

5692
02:49:53.111 --> 02:49:56.370
it's bad to have that out there if you want to run a government.

5693
02:49:56.490 --> 02:49:56.671
Right.

5694
02:49:56.671 --> 02:49:58.440
Because it fuels the resistance.

5695
02:49:58.441 --> 02:49:59.700
It fuels people's,

5696
02:49:59.890 --> 02:50:02.040
it turns the citizens into the enemy.

5697
02:50:02.310 --> 02:50:03.200
That's what it does.

5698
02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:07.470
There's millions and millions of fucking schedule one criminals in this country,

5699
02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:12.810
clenching guy who run the stop sign at Walmart into the bad guy.

5700
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.351
Well,

5701
02:50:13.351 --> 02:50:14.730
he didn't even have any marijuana on,

5702
02:50:14.731 --> 02:50:15.564
and that's the part I like.

5703
02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:16.950
But marijuana was the Rick,

5704
02:50:16.980 --> 02:50:17.461
do you know that?

5705
02:50:17.461 --> 02:50:19.680
That's what they suspected him of having.

5706
02:50:19.681 --> 02:50:19.950
Yeah.

5707
02:50:19.950 --> 02:50:20.820
So here's the thing.

5708
02:50:20.850 --> 02:50:21.481
So I'm walking,

5709
02:50:21.481 --> 02:50:24.810
I'm in my car and I've got some marijuana I want to smoke later,

5710
02:50:24.811 --> 02:50:25.980
but I'm afraid if it's in my car,

5711
02:50:25.981 --> 02:50:26.580
you'll find it.

5712
02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:29.880
So I shove it up my rear end so that I can smoke it later.

5713
02:50:30.210 --> 02:50:30.751
I did.

5714
02:50:30.751 --> 02:50:32.460
The whole thing is so insane.

5715
02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:32.881
Yeah,

5716
02:50:32.881 --> 02:50:33.714
it's beautiful.

5717
02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:35.970
We're living in a simulation.

5718
02:50:35.971 --> 02:50:37.770
So real and wiener,

5719
02:50:37.771 --> 02:50:40.680
he's not real wieners showing his wiener come on.

5720
02:50:40.681 --> 02:50:41.514
None of it's real.

5721
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:42.750
It's not real.

5722
02:50:42.780 --> 02:50:44.010
We're all mad.

5723
02:50:44.070 --> 02:50:48.120
We're mad as a hatter and we're just alone by herself somewhere linked up to

5724
02:50:48.121 --> 02:50:53.121
some computer trying to pretend at this fucking simulated society we pieced

5725
02:50:53.161 --> 02:50:53.994
together.

5726
02:50:54.050 --> 02:50:57.420
Makes it very interested to hear what they're writing on Rogan's message board

5727
02:50:57.421 --> 02:50:59.480
about this wide variety of interesting topics.

5728
02:50:59.530 --> 02:50:59.750
Oh,

5729
02:50:59.750 --> 02:51:00.181
what do you mean?

5730
02:51:00.181 --> 02:51:01.014
He told us grief.

5731
02:51:02.210 --> 02:51:03.630
I get right back to it.

5732
02:51:03.631 --> 02:51:04.590
Let me see what he does here.

5733
02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:05.453
Savages.

5734
02:51:05.810 --> 02:51:05.970
Well,

5735
02:51:05.970 --> 02:51:09.450
we're a new world order mouthpiece here at the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

5736
02:51:09.451 --> 02:51:10.350
I don't know if you know that.

5737
02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:13.140
I became a new world order mouthpiece once a,

5738
02:51:13.141 --> 02:51:13.860
I started doing that.

5739
02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:15.240
Joe Rogan questions everything.

5740
02:51:15.350 --> 02:51:15.480
Oh,

5741
02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:15.751
of course.

5742
02:51:15.751 --> 02:51:17.700
It wasn't really willing to question everything.

5743
02:51:19.470 --> 02:51:19.980
I thought.

5744
02:51:19.980 --> 02:51:23.680
I thought the eye rolls that you did were absolutely artistic in some of those

5745
02:51:23.681 --> 02:51:24.514
things very much.

5746
02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:24.901
Well,

5747
02:51:24.901 --> 02:51:25.230
some,

5748
02:51:25.230 --> 02:51:27.510
it got to a certain point where I was like,

5749
02:51:27.511 --> 02:51:28.140
you know what?

5750
02:51:28.140 --> 02:51:29.190
I can't do this anymore.

5751
02:51:29.340 --> 02:51:30.900
I can't keep talking to liars,

5752
02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:31.411
you know,

5753
02:51:31.411 --> 02:51:33.630
and and pretending that we're putting together a TV show.

5754
02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:37.980
When I'm talking to a guy who told me he saw bulletproof wolf that popped out of

5755
02:51:37.981 --> 02:51:38.101
a,

5756
02:51:38.101 --> 02:51:40.800
a vortex of missed or somebody told you that?

5757
02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:41.220
Yeah,

5758
02:51:41.220 --> 02:51:41.730
it's true.

5759
02:51:41.730 --> 02:51:42.190
By the way.

5760
02:51:42.190 --> 02:51:43.260
Also told me he saw a Ufo,

5761
02:51:43.261 --> 02:51:46.470
sees them on a regular basis and went and found bigfoot the very first time we

5762
02:51:46.471 --> 02:51:47.304
went looking for it.

5763
02:51:47.850 --> 02:51:48.211
I was like,

5764
02:51:48.211 --> 02:51:49.020
Oh cry money.

5765
02:51:49.020 --> 02:51:50.100
Like what am I doing with my life?

5766
02:51:50.130 --> 02:51:54.530
This is like we're so far off of the reality road that I don't,

5767
02:51:54.531 --> 02:51:55.710
I'm never going to find my way back.

5768
02:51:55.711 --> 02:51:59.130
I just talk to it is pretty hard to maintain the straight face thing.

5769
02:51:59.190 --> 02:52:00.140
It's not worth it.

5770
02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:01.650
It is a certain point in time you're like,

5771
02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:03.690
oh this is just a broken idea.

5772
02:52:03.720 --> 02:52:04.011
These are,

5773
02:52:04.011 --> 02:52:05.070
this is a person with a,

5774
02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:06.370
they're chasing

5775
02:52:06.370 --> 02:52:10.300
<v 4>down thoughts that are bad and they don't stop chasing them down and they're</v>

5776
02:52:10.301 --> 02:52:13.090
reasonably intelligent so they can argue the way around these things.

5777
02:52:13.091 --> 02:52:16.180
When confronted and Michael Shermer had a quote about that,

5778
02:52:16.181 --> 02:52:19.240
about really smart people who believe in really dump things cause they're smart

5779
02:52:19.241 --> 02:52:20.074
enough to argue it.

5780
02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:21.220
And I think that's,

5781
02:52:21.220 --> 02:52:25.690
that's the case with a lot of these folks and the flaw in the thinking is so

5782
02:52:25.691 --> 02:52:26.524
obvious.

5783
02:52:26.770 --> 02:52:31.000
So when I didn't believe in chem trails that every fucking airplane that you see

5784
02:52:31.001 --> 02:52:35.110
a contrail that's persistent is the government spraying us with evil chemicals.

5785
02:52:35.111 --> 02:52:36.130
All of a sudden people were like,

5786
02:52:36.131 --> 02:52:37.110
you're a fucking mouthpiece.

5787
02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:37.721
<v 3>The new world.</v>

5788
02:52:37.721 --> 02:52:40.950
I told you I got that too though for questioning the Hastings thing and yeah,

5789
02:52:41.310 --> 02:52:41.630
<v 5>but you know,</v>

5790
02:52:41.630 --> 02:52:42.470
you're going to get that,

5791
02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:43.190
get it all.

5792
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:48.190
But then when you have a warped view that's nuanced when you went some wonderful

5793
02:52:49.011 --> 02:52:49.281
word.

5794
02:52:49.281 --> 02:52:49.700
Yes.

5795
02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:50.001
Thank you.

5796
02:52:50.001 --> 02:52:50.301
By the way,

5797
02:52:50.301 --> 02:52:54.380
for [inaudible] now to public on [inaudible].

5798
02:52:54.381 --> 02:52:54.921
Got It.

5799
02:52:54.921 --> 02:52:55.970
Everybody got it.

5800
02:52:56.270 --> 02:52:56.691
But yeah,

5801
02:52:56.691 --> 02:52:57.860
the um,

5802
02:52:57.980 --> 02:53:02.240
because the fact is like the reviews you get or the feed bag of that joy's got

5803
02:53:02.241 --> 02:53:05.570
ton about this stuff to me is not surprising because anytime you have a position

5804
02:53:05.571 --> 02:53:08.420
that's not stereotypical or you're not clearly in one camp,

5805
02:53:08.430 --> 02:53:12.620
150% where is the Oh as well did it or no,

5806
02:53:12.621 --> 02:53:13.660
that's total bullshit.

5807
02:53:13.670 --> 02:53:14.630
How can you believe that?

5808
02:53:14.660 --> 02:53:16.070
Or you know about anything,

5809
02:53:16.071 --> 02:53:16.401
right?

5810
02:53:16.401 --> 02:53:21.170
When you start asking questions that poke holes in one line of thinking,

5811
02:53:21.260 --> 02:53:24.590
but then at the same time when people started feeling reassured that Oh Dan you

5812
02:53:24.591 --> 02:53:25.610
are on this side.

5813
02:53:25.640 --> 02:53:28.700
Then you start saying well kind of by weight the sack him.

5814
02:53:28.701 --> 02:53:29.130
Cause there was one,

5815
02:53:29.130 --> 02:53:32.300
there was something gear that's problematic here and you're just keeping an open

5816
02:53:32.301 --> 02:53:32.631
mind,

5817
02:53:32.631 --> 02:53:32.930
right?

5818
02:53:32.930 --> 02:53:34.760
It doesn't mean that you can commit to an idea.

5819
02:53:34.761 --> 02:53:37.310
It doesn't mean that you are flip flopping yard.

5820
02:53:37.320 --> 02:53:40.880
Just considering the pros and cons and some time is not that black and white.

5821
02:53:41.480 --> 02:53:42.530
It drives people crazy

5822
02:53:42.560 --> 02:53:44.700
<v 3>because the media doesn't want you to do that.</v>

5823
02:53:44.701 --> 02:53:46.410
And he did it because they used to tell me on the radio,

5824
02:53:46.620 --> 02:53:51.480
a listener has to know where you stand on every issue within three minutes of

5825
02:53:51.481 --> 02:53:52.410
turning you on.

5826
02:53:52.620 --> 02:53:53.370
And I said,

5827
02:53:53.370 --> 02:53:55.860
that's a cartoon character or a real person.

5828
02:53:56.040 --> 02:53:57.180
And it's the same thing where,

5829
02:53:57.181 --> 02:53:57.660
um,

5830
02:53:57.660 --> 02:54:00.300
I had just done a show recently where we were talking about,

5831
02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:01.363
um,

5832
02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:02.520
go ahead and wrap this up.

5833
02:54:02.820 --> 02:54:04.570
The point is it that that whole idea that,

5834
02:54:04.571 --> 02:54:04.861
that,

5835
02:54:04.861 --> 02:54:06.360
that nuance is a bad thing.

5836
02:54:06.361 --> 02:54:07.194
Somebody called me,

5837
02:54:07.290 --> 02:54:10.650
I'm being called a moderate and a realist more and more today,

5838
02:54:10.651 --> 02:54:12.000
which is coming from like tin foil,

5839
02:54:12.001 --> 02:54:12.330
hat,

5840
02:54:12.330 --> 02:54:16.320
crazy radical territory and I haven't changed my views at all in 20 years.

5841
02:54:16.321 --> 02:54:16.620
Well,

5842
02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:17.131
a couple things,

5843
02:54:17.131 --> 02:54:19.200
but basically it means that society,

5844
02:54:19.201 --> 02:54:19.741
like you said,

5845
02:54:19.741 --> 02:54:22.710
has started to pick up on things and has moved in a direction.

5846
02:54:22.740 --> 02:54:23.573
I used to say to people,

5847
02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:25.380
the NSA spying on everyone and they said,

5848
02:54:25.500 --> 02:54:25.801
no,

5849
02:54:25.801 --> 02:54:26.281
they're not.

5850
02:54:26.281 --> 02:54:26.791
You're crazy.

5851
02:54:26.791 --> 02:54:27.750
Get your tinfoil hat out.

5852
02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:29.400
Now I say the NSA spying on everyone and they go,

5853
02:54:29.550 --> 02:54:30.390
I know.

5854
02:54:30.830 --> 02:54:35.040
So society is just sort of moved in a different direction and nuance.

5855
02:54:35.670 --> 02:54:37.110
That's what society is missing today.

5856
02:54:37.140 --> 02:54:37.973
Gray areas.

5857
02:54:38.110 --> 02:54:42.010
<v 4>I've been called a conspiracy theory or with good reason for theorists for a</v>

5858
02:54:42.011 --> 02:54:43.840
long time about a lot of different subjects,

5859
02:54:43.841 --> 02:54:48.460
but I've always found that really odd that the idea that people haven't

5860
02:54:48.461 --> 02:54:50.260
conspired on things is,

5861
02:54:50.330 --> 02:54:51.730
is so attractive to people.

5862
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:52.020
Right?

5863
02:54:52.020 --> 02:54:56.500
Like people want to be able to debunk things just as willingly as other people

5864
02:54:56.501 --> 02:54:58.030
want to find conspiracy and things.

5865
02:54:58.240 --> 02:54:59.310
And there's some things that are,

5866
02:54:59.311 --> 02:55:00.670
are not debunk bull.

5867
02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:02.670
There's some realities he bankable.

5868
02:55:02.710 --> 02:55:03.200
Yeah.

5869
02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:05.990
Some realities like the reality of the fucking central bank,

5870
02:55:05.991 --> 02:55:09.830
the reality of the realities of the influence of the Bilderberg group,

5871
02:55:09.850 --> 02:55:10.490
the the out,

5872
02:55:10.490 --> 02:55:15.410
the realities of the influence of corporations and special interest groups and

5873
02:55:15.411 --> 02:55:16.070
lobbyists,

5874
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.903
those are real,

5875
02:55:17.150 --> 02:55:18.230
those are real things.

5876
02:55:18.231 --> 02:55:19.760
So if those exist,

5877
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:24.800
those are probably some of the biggest conspiracies the entire world has ever

5878
02:55:24.801 --> 02:55:25.460
known,

5879
02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:27.410
and they're right in front of your fat fucking face.

5880
02:55:27.710 --> 02:55:28.041
Okay.

5881
02:55:28.041 --> 02:55:32.330
Look at the reality of money today and what monies controlling whether or not

5882
02:55:32.331 --> 02:55:34.520
this gas land documentary is 100% correct,

5883
02:55:34.670 --> 02:55:36.290
even if it's 50% correct.

5884
02:55:36.410 --> 02:55:38.600
That 50% is fucking terrifying.

5885
02:55:38.900 --> 02:55:42.980
And every one of those examples that they showed that if those were the only

5886
02:55:42.981 --> 02:55:43.551
examples,

5887
02:55:43.551 --> 02:55:44.570
and I don't think they are,

5888
02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:48.500
we're doing something crazy and it's all being done because of money.

5889
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:51.080
We're ruining this world forever.

5890
02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:53.720
Whether it's the ocean patch that's bigger than Texas,

5891
02:55:53.721 --> 02:55:58.280
it's all plastic that's floating out there and choking birds and whales and

5892
02:55:58.690 --> 02:56:00.410
whale was just be a beached whale.

5893
02:56:00.411 --> 02:56:01.071
Just died.

5894
02:56:01.071 --> 02:56:02.870
His stomach was filled with plastic.

5895
02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:04.311
I mean we,

5896
02:56:04.311 --> 02:56:08.990
what we are doing for real that we're doing bad is fucking insane.

5897
02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:09.620
Yup.

5898
02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:13.760
So anybody who's not willing to look at the other possibilities like,

5899
02:56:14.180 --> 02:56:14.571
man,

5900
02:56:14.571 --> 02:56:16.910
you're rigid view of the world is fucking your head up.

5901
02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:20.660
There's some weirdness of foot simulation theory,

5902
02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:21.200
gun,

5903
02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:22.550
short term gain baby.

5904
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:24.290
That way I wasn't doing any good for me.

5905
02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:26.000
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

5906
02:56:26.001 --> 02:56:26.990
Case closed.

5907
02:56:26.991 --> 02:56:28.850
I say case closed.

5908
02:56:29.890 --> 02:56:30.390
Well listen,

5909
02:56:30.390 --> 02:56:32.040
I think we could do this at the end of the time,

5910
02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:33.300
the end of today,

5911
02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:34.950
but we were not going to.

5912
02:56:35.130 --> 02:56:36.270
This is that we're going to wrap this up,

5913
02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:38.160
but we could fucking do this again.

5914
02:56:38.260 --> 02:56:38.970
God Damn it,

5915
02:56:38.970 --> 02:56:39.700
Dan Carlin,

5916
02:56:39.700 --> 02:56:40.533
you don't go below.

5917
02:56:40.660 --> 02:56:42.130
Thank you for coming up with this idea.

5918
02:56:42.131 --> 02:56:42.891
This is mister bow,

5919
02:56:42.891 --> 02:56:43.540
Ellie's ideas.

5920
02:56:43.540 --> 02:56:45.340
I came up with it without telling either of you.

5921
02:56:45.410 --> 02:56:47.830
I felt both of you.

5922
02:56:47.890 --> 02:56:49.590
There was a mind meld and a,

5923
02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:52.510
if anybody wants to listen to Daniela [inaudible] podcast,

5924
02:56:52.511 --> 02:56:53.830
it is the drunk and Taoist.

5925
02:56:53.831 --> 02:56:55.060
It's available on everything,

5926
02:56:55.061 --> 02:56:55.290
right?

5927
02:56:55.290 --> 02:56:57.370
Itunes and is it on Stitcher as well?

5928
02:56:57.400 --> 02:56:57.570
Yep.

5929
02:56:57.570 --> 02:57:02.290
Stitch stitcher and of course Dan Carlin is not one but two fucking podcast.

5930
02:57:02.291 --> 02:57:05.590
Jesus Christ as if you had enough free time to absorb them all.

5931
02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:07.090
One is hardcore history,

5932
02:57:07.091 --> 02:57:08.500
which is absolutely sensational.

5933
02:57:08.501 --> 02:57:10.210
The other one is DC common sense,

5934
02:57:10.330 --> 02:57:11.163
a little mediocre,

5935
02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:12.073
I guess.

5936
02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:13.520
They're bulk,

5937
02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:17.530
awesome lies and you can catch them on iTunes.

5938
02:57:17.531 --> 02:57:19.420
He gives away the first 50 for free.

5939
02:57:19.421 --> 02:57:23.260
He's just to get you hooked and then the rest of them you get by prescription

5940
02:57:23.350 --> 02:57:24.130
prescription.

5941
02:57:24.130 --> 02:57:26.650
I shouldn't say prescription because you can learn to fucking,

5942
02:57:26.651 --> 02:57:28.660
it's good for your brain subscription,

5943
02:57:28.661 --> 02:57:30.180
but they are fucking worth it there.

5944
02:57:30.181 --> 02:57:31.210
God Damn books,

5945
02:57:31.330 --> 02:57:32.230
their audio books,

5946
02:57:32.231 --> 02:57:36.700
their lessons on life and the history of this wacky ass country of so get them

5947
02:57:36.701 --> 02:57:37.210

5975

he was up in the space station until recently,

5982
02:58:45.091 --> 02:58:46.890

5983

He'll be here on Monday.

5984
02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:48.900
