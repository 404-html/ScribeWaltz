00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:01.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:01.891 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>and I think first of all,</v>

4
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>those style of comedy that you and I come from too,</v>

5
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you get very spoiled at it for a certain particular type of colleague.</v>

6
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Boston comedy is a very specific kind of comedy.</v>

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>If you stop and think about how many good comics have come from Boston,</v>

8
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Jay Leno came from Boston.</v>

10
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Steven Wright came from Boston guys that people don't know that it probably</v>

11
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>better than 90% of the fucking people that are like big name comics.</v>

12
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:25.974
<v Speaker 1>Like Gavin,</v>

13
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Don Gavin,</v>

14
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>one of the funniest guys ever walked the face of the earth.</v>

15
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

16
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>he's a monster.</v>

17
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a masterful king like the east coast,</v>

18
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I think all the way down to like DC,</v>

19
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>the amount of guys.</v>

20
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>But I think that Boston was a rare place because we're from Boston does have a</v>

21
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>lot of it in and leave.</v>

22
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>They didn't leave.</v>

23
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Those guys stayed there.</v>

24
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>No one left Boston,</v>

25
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>the big monsters.</v>

26
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:51.090

<v Speaker 1>Kenny Rogers,</v>

28
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Sin Those Don Gavin,</v>

29
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.220

32
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>when I first started doing open mics there and those guys were all the national</v>

33
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>headliners or the the local headliners rather,</v>

34
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>they'd be at Nick's and they'd be it.</v>

35
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>You have the connection.</v>

36
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>I remember sitting there watching those guys and they would kind of like some</v>

37
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>like national guy would come through like Billy crystal and Billy crystal would</v>

41
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>They did it on purpose.</v>

42
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>They knew that the level of comedy was so high there and these guys were only</v>

43
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:30.260
<v Speaker 1>doing 20 minutes tight to say 20 minutes doing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he had some sort of back and forth with the boss and he made this reference,</v>

<v Speaker 1>day go by.</v>

84
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:39.600

85
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>and it would somehow take like fucking 40 minutes every day.</v>

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.430
<v Speaker 2>And I remember the second question other than,</v>

290
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is how green we are,</v>

301
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 2>where it was me,</v>

302
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.130

307
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it was his gig that he booked.</v>

308
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 2>We were so green and years later I finally figured it out.</v>

309
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 2>They gave us this microphone.</v>

310
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 2>It was a lapel mic.</v>

311
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.621
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

312

316
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 2>All standing there holding,</v>

318
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.340

331
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 2>let it,</v>

332
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Al would bring me up and then hand me the mic like a tea cup with his pinkies</v>

333
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 2>out picky out and I would just be like,</v>

334
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:09.121
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

335
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 2>keep it going.</v>

336
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and my dad was,</v>

337
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 2>he was pretty nuts growing up with like three fingers up in the air holding this</v>

338
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:15.170
<v Speaker 2>thing</v>

339
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.290
<v Speaker 1>and I went from that to two from from going to taekwondo,</v>

340
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.490
<v Speaker 1>straight into going to comedy,</v>

341
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.871
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing.</v>

342
00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I had a few key three kickboxing fights and then I went right into comedy</v>

343
00:09:23.751 --> 00:09:25.130
<v Speaker 1>because I knew I was going nowhere</v>

344
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.400
<v Speaker 2>so there's no money in it.</v>

345
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 2>What's your opening like standup?</v>

346
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Was it about like no knighting?</v>

347
00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

348
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:30.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

349
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I never talked to him.</v>

350
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Really intense was like,</v>

351
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.680
<v Speaker 2>hello,</v>

352

357
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.120
<v Speaker 1>There's no one wants to take some fucking guys on martial arts champion.</v>

358
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing because he was actually good at it like this that you've got to</v>

359
00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 2>be of like low self esteem.</v>

360
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.721

<v Speaker 2>all those headliners didn't leave.</v>

398
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 1>It was so intoxicating because you can make a living.</v>

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.760
<v Speaker 1>It was as long as you're willing to drive and travel.</v>

406
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 1>If you had $500 cash a week,</v>

407
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 1>you could pay for your bills.</v>

00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:44.790
<v Speaker 1>You could eat.</v>

409
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to try to go on the road,</v>

490
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.000
<v Speaker 1>It might have reopened it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mighta reopened it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

493
00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:20.370

00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:21.151
<v Speaker 1>And they brought it back.</v>

<v Speaker 2>nobody would start like,</v>

559
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:38.551
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

560
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:38.941
<v Speaker 2>I bought,</v>

561
00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:39.990
<v Speaker 2>people would just start rooms,</v>

562
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.970
<v Speaker 2>don't have a Bob Marley out of Maine.</v>

563
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.330
<v Speaker 2>He came down like a fully formed fucking headliner just because he had like 25</v>

564
00:13:47.401 --> 00:13:48.720
<v Speaker 2>rooms going up in Maine.</v>

565
00:13:48.721 --> 00:13:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Like he started basically it was like Mcdonald's,</v>

566
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.680
<v Speaker 2>but he started with like comrades.</v>

567
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.820
<v Speaker 2>He used to tell me when he was living up there and it was getting so big,</v>

568
00:13:56.821 --> 00:13:59.640
<v Speaker 2>he actually ended up leaving because he almost became,</v>

569
00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I think like a kind of almost like a club owner at that point.</v>

570
00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:02.641
<v Speaker 2>He could have done it.</v>

571
00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:04.110
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

572
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.250
<v Speaker 2>he basically started the comedy scene up there.</v>

573
00:14:08.251 --> 00:14:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Cause before that all they had was like the connection.</v>

574
00:14:10.111 --> 00:14:11.310
<v Speaker 2>But like Portland.</v>

575

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

577
00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:12.531
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

578
00:14:12.531 --> 00:14:14.880
<v Speaker 2>he started like he had at any time</v>

579
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I used to do gigs in Bangor and Bob would do like,</v>

580
00:14:17.821 --> 00:14:19.740
<v Speaker 1>guess bots and shit when he was first starting out.</v>

581
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:20.521

00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:23.161
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

00:14:23.731 --> 00:14:24.331
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

589
00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:26.550
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know who Bob Marley is a very funny guy,</v>

590
00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:27.121
<v Speaker 1>very nice guy.</v>

591
00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I've known him for fucking 20 plus years.</v>

592
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Always been just a great guy.</v>

593
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.130
<v Speaker 1>But when he first started out,</v>

594
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595

596
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.530
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

597
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

598
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.810
<v Speaker 1>probably he probably started in 89 or 90.</v>

599
00:14:36.811 --> 00:14:38.910
<v Speaker 1>There's no one known from being from Maine.</v>

600
00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:40.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no like one main comic that stands up,</v>

601
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Speaker 1>but Bob Marley in anywhere else in the country is like,</v>

602
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.630
<v Speaker 1>people might have heard of them.</v>

603
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.930
<v Speaker 1>You might have heard him on Xm radio,</v>

604
00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:48.300
<v Speaker 1>you might have seen him on comedy central or something in Maine.</v>

605
00:14:48.301 --> 00:14:50.250
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker is huge.</v>

606
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.580
<v Speaker 1>If there's no comparison,</v>

607
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like Blasius or Gabriel Iglesias and in La is giant.</v>

608
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Gabriel Iglesias does shows in La.</v>

609
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Well he'll do like five shows on a Monday night,</v>

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.621
<v Speaker 2>He used to go,</v>

617
00:15:10.621 --> 00:15:14.640

<v Speaker 3>Headlines</v>

655
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:16.391
<v Speaker 1>early on.</v>

656
00:16:16.391 --> 00:16:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I did a bunch of a really a fun little gigs for dicta already.</v>

657
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.690
<v Speaker 1>The comedy huts.</v>

658
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Remember those comedy Gods in Cambridge?</v>

659
00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Did we did Dick towards comedy?</v>

660
00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Hung out on the monkeys.</v>

661
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Dane was with a,</v>

662
00:16:30.161 --> 00:16:33.070
<v Speaker 1>a comedy troupe with Bob Kelly and him and Altel Benny was so,</v>

663
00:16:33.071 --> 00:16:34.120
<v Speaker 1>it was a good comedy troupe.</v>

664
00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:34.954
<v Speaker 1>You guys were funny.</v>

665
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.681
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

666
00:16:35.681 --> 00:16:35.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

667
00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting.</v>

668
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.550
<v Speaker 1>You would do comedy sketches and then you would do,</v>

669
00:16:39.551 --> 00:16:40.210
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

670
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.980
<v Speaker 1>each guy would go up and do stand up,</v>

671
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

672
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And so we would work together,</v>

673
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.170
<v Speaker 1>do these uh,</v>

674
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.003
<v Speaker 1>Dick Dardy gaze.</v>

675
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Those were fucking fun.</v>

676
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Our sketch comedy Improv group was,</v>

677
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:49.460
<v Speaker 3>was so bad.</v>

678
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 3>We were so bad at Improv and everybody,</v>

679
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:51.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

680
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 3>the first rule of Improv is don't deny,</v>

681
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.260
<v Speaker 3>but we were so bad at Improv that our first roles was denied.</v>

682
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 3>So we were just command and completely ruined scenes by like,</v>

683
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 3>you're pretending pantomiming I'm holding a baby and just Bobby can be big dude.</v>

684
00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Why are you holding a tire?</v>

685
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.650
<v Speaker 3>And you just,</v>

686
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.030
<v Speaker 3>it would just fall apart from there.</v>

687
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:08.890
<v Speaker 3>But we just had a boy.</v>

688
00:17:08.891 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 3>You guys have some good ones.</v>

689
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.180
<v Speaker 3>You had some good sketches.</v>

690
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

691
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>

692
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was it and it was experimental.</v>

693
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.040
<v Speaker 1>It was like you guys were taking chances.</v>

694
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 1>You were doing something a little unusual at a comedy club.</v>

695
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Just you were doing comedy too.</v>

696
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:20.411
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

697
00:17:20.411 --> 00:17:23.200
<v Speaker 3>That was probably actually better for us opening with our standup and then we</v>

698
00:17:23.201 --> 00:17:26.230
<v Speaker 3>just go fuck around and do music or skits or Improv or whatever for,</v>

699
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:26.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

700
00:17:26.531 --> 00:17:28.030
<v Speaker 3>whatever the rest of the hour to fill it out.</v>

701
00:17:28.031 --> 00:17:28.570
<v Speaker 3>But we,</v>

702
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:29.500
<v Speaker 3>we also,</v>

703
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:29.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

704
00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:32.170

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:32.830

706
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.820
<v Speaker 3>I know the guys that I can't,</v>

707
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.540

708
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.690

709
00:17:37.691 --> 00:17:39.490
<v Speaker 3>growing up that I wanted to emulate.</v>

710
00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.080
<v Speaker 3>And then when I started in Boston,</v>

711
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.430
<v Speaker 3>these guys were like,</v>

712
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.600
<v Speaker 3>killers man.</v>

713

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:49.703
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows.</v>

716
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:50.310

<v Speaker 1>He was better than all of them.</v>

723
00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:58.680
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

724
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 1>this is not an exaggeration,</v>

725
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 1>and he was fucking squeaky clean.</v>

726
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:02.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

727
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:03.121
<v Speaker 1>every now and then he say,</v>

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.180
<v Speaker 1>But his bits,</v>

731
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:07.350
<v Speaker 1>we're not dirty.</v>

732
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.230
<v Speaker 1>It was delivery was perfect.</v>

733
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:11.790
<v Speaker 1>It was perfect.</v>

734
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

735
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.190
<v Speaker 1>You would watch his economy of words,</v>

736
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the way he set a sentence up and you would just feel humbled.</v>

737
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:18.361
<v Speaker 1>You would be like,</v>

738
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:18.721
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

739
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:19.554
<v Speaker 1>he's a master.</v>

740
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 1>He's a master.</v>

741
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 1>But he got caught up in this Boston thing where there's all these great guys in</v>

742
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 1>this one area and they always drew a crowd and they always got paid well.</v>

743
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And then they would go on the road and they'd be nobody's.</v>

744
00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:30.691
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

745
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:31.710
<v Speaker 1>why would they be a fucking nobody?</v>

746
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:32.860
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be back back in Boston.</v>

747
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.410
<v Speaker 1>The next thing you know,</v>

748
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:37.080
<v Speaker 1>they're back in Boston and they're just doing the same gigs over and over again.</v>

749
00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 1>When everybody else takes a shot and branches off and disappears and becomes</v>

750
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 1>famous</v>

751
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

752
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 3>but you really would watch these guys and part of you would feel bad that they</v>

753
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 3>weren't getting over the hump,</v>

754
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.460
<v Speaker 3>but you felt like so fucking honored to be opening up and standing,</v>

755
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:51.241
<v Speaker 3>watching going,</v>

756
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:52.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm learning from the best.</v>

757
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

758
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.300
<v Speaker 3>When you leave Boston,</v>

759
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.420
<v Speaker 3>it's like you had that these were guys like,</v>

760
00:18:57.421 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 3>I always describe it like they had the energy of showman,</v>

761
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 3>but they were like men.</v>

762
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.910
<v Speaker 3>They were like men doing comedy.</v>

763
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.390

764
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I always really wanted to be there.</v>

768
00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 3>They always stood right at the fucking front of the stage.</v>

769
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 3>They were re Lenny Clarke is the perfect example of that.</v>

770
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.940
<v Speaker 3>When Lenny's a fucking man,</v>

771
00:19:12.941 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy.</v>

772
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.970
<v Speaker 3>This is what Larry Clarkson was.</v>

773
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.470
<v Speaker 3>We were at giggles and Sagas and there was this fucking table full of chicks.</v>

774
00:19:18.471 --> 00:19:18.611
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

775
00:19:18.611 --> 00:19:18.950
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't</v>

776
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:19.910
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>

777
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.350
<v Speaker 1>They were screaming and yelling.</v>

778
00:19:21.351 --> 00:19:21.740
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

779

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.720
<v Speaker 1>if you don't shut the fuck up,</v>

781
00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hire a Nigga.</v>

782
00:19:24.771 --> 00:19:26.030

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.580
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck it he does say mean.</v>

785
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.231
<v Speaker 1>It was me.</v>

786
00:19:33.231 --> 00:19:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I take Chris Mcguire was there,</v>

787
00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:35.480

788
00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:35.991
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>

789
00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:36.501
<v Speaker 1>but we were like,</v>

790
00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:38.150
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did he just say?</v>

791
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.040
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

792
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Clarke did not give a fuck.</v>

793
00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:46.310
<v Speaker 1>He was just his big gigantic burly guy who would,</v>

794
00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:46.791
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

795
00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:48.040
<v Speaker 1>he would beat your ass too.</v>

796
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:48.461
<v Speaker 1>He would.</v>

797
00:19:48.461 --> 00:19:49.191
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

798
00:19:49.191 --> 00:19:50.870
<v Speaker 1>if you like talk shit to Lenny car,</v>

799
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.030
<v Speaker 1>he'll probably do a line and punch in the face.</v>

800
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.210
<v Speaker 1>These were real like real hardcore blue collar guys,</v>

801
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.240
<v Speaker 1>but real king corollary made us,</v>

802
00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:03.740
<v Speaker 1>it made us sharper because you were held up to a much higher standard.</v>

803
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.940
<v Speaker 1>You had to go on after guys who were way better than average and you had a,</v>

804
00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:09.410
<v Speaker 1>you had to be sharp all the time.</v>

805
00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:09.681
<v Speaker 1>You had a,</v>

806
00:20:09.681 --> 00:20:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you had to constantly reassess your material self up for that kind of thing.</v>

807
00:20:12.681 --> 00:20:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I still look back and remember the first time you ever bombed?</v>

808
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

809
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.510
<v Speaker 1>or yeah,</v>

810
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:17.343
<v Speaker 1>or a bunch of them.</v>

811
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote,</v>

812
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.730
<v Speaker 1>it's called New York.</v>

813
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

814
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote a chapter in this book.</v>

815
00:20:23.211 --> 00:20:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing all on the very first time I ever bombed,</v>

816
00:20:25.521 --> 00:20:26.750
<v Speaker 1>which was horrible,</v>

817
00:20:26.751 --> 00:20:29.720
<v Speaker 1>terrible disaster that I'll never forget because it was the first time I ever</v>

818
00:20:29.721 --> 00:20:30.950
<v Speaker 1>bombed while I was getting paid.</v>

819
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

820
00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:32.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a big difference.</v>

821
00:20:32.901 --> 00:20:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

822
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Bomb and open mic nights.</v>

823
00:20:34.611 --> 00:20:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's bombing,</v>

824
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:35.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

825
00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:38.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's like five people are going to eat shit on stage and you're</v>

826
00:20:38.331 --> 00:20:39.350
<v Speaker 1>only up there for five minutes,</v>

827
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.460
<v Speaker 1>but once you do a paid,</v>

828
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.270
<v Speaker 1>and I was middling.</v>

829
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.081
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have been middling.</v>

830
00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't have the time.</v>

831
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.290
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who went on before me fucking crushed.</v>

832
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

833
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.450
<v Speaker 1>there was this chick that I seen the last time I was there and she was super</v>

834
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:49.691
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>

835
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I fucked her and she was in the front row and she brought her friends and her</v>

836
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 1>friends look and then we're going to sit in the front row when I went on stage.</v>

837
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So I was panicking.</v>

838
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:57.311
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

839

<v Speaker 1>This guy goes on stage and a then and he stopped doing comedy.</v>

857
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:18.401
<v Speaker 1>It's really too bad.</v>

858
00:21:18.401 --> 00:21:19.211
<v Speaker 1>He's a natural,</v>

859
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember his name unfortunately,</v>

860
00:21:20.711 --> 00:21:22.030
<v Speaker 1>but he fucking killed.</v>

861

<v Speaker 1>And then I went after him and eight just drive bricks of shit with no water for</v>

862
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:28.654
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes.</v>

863
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It was the most embarrassing feeling I'd ever had in my life.</v>

864
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe how unbearable loss and her and her friends were like looking</v>

865
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:39.170
<v Speaker 1>at each other and their friends would lean over and say something like,</v>

866
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 1>and then I could hear crickets and I'm trying to be like extra loud because I'm</v>

867
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:48.250
<v Speaker 1>trying to like be trying to bring it back to my side.</v>

868
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.780
<v Speaker 1>So like you like forced the punchlines and the timing is all office even worse.</v>

869
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 1>And my only experience with being nervous before,</v>

870
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 1>my only experience with pressure had been fighting.</v>

871
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 1>So when you know fighting and tournaments,</v>

872
00:22:00.491 --> 00:22:00.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

873
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:01.361
<v Speaker 1>if you're nervous,</v>

874
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 1>you just turn inward and you say,</v>

875
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 1>this isn't what I want to do this,</v>

876
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:04.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this.</v>

877
00:22:04.311 --> 00:22:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do someone to fucking explode.</v>

878
00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna to fucking cool.</v>

879
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:08.471
<v Speaker 1>Terrified.</v>

880
00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 1>But you just get psyched up to go,</v>

881
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.260
<v Speaker 1>which is the worst thing you could ever do on stage to be nervous and aggressive</v>

882
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 1>and fucking and all introspective and turned into yourself.</v>

883
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck what they take them out.</v>

884
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to call the worst mindset ever for comedy.</v>

885
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.240
<v Speaker 3>That's called being Carlos.</v>

886
00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Mitzi?</v>

887
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

888
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to turn it in.</v>

889
00:22:25.341 --> 00:22:26.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to explode.</v>

890
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:27.843
<v Speaker 1>The most fun.</v>

891
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I had a shoe.</v>

892
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.700

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

911
00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.850

<v Speaker 3>the thing where it's like there's food being served during the TVs are on every</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking places in New Hampshire.</v>

920
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:22.450
<v Speaker 1>You would drive an hour and a half up to New Hampshire and do some weird bar</v>

921
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 1>with a tinny sound system.</v>

945
00:23:57.641 --> 00:23:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It feels like I did a thing with this guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And they are dumb as fuck.</v>

971
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And they're so drunk.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's maybe 20 people in the room.</v>

974
00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.320
<v Speaker 1>All of them are so drunk.</v>

975
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.820
<v Speaker 1>They can't even keep their eyes open.</v>

976
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Their mouths are sliding.</v>

977
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I watch go high and we have to do comedy for that.</v>

978
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And Scott gets up and starts shitting all over them.</v>

979
00:24:56.381 --> 00:24:57.400
<v Speaker 1>And he was not really,</v>

980
00:24:57.401 --> 00:24:57.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

981
00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.220
<v Speaker 1>he hadn't been doing comedy that long then really probably shouldn't have been</v>

982
00:25:00.221 --> 00:25:02.170
<v Speaker 1>on stage in this sort of a situation anyway.</v>

983
00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And I went on after him and they had already turned their backs to the comedy</v>

984
00:25:05.771 --> 00:25:06.011
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1138
00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:05.950
<v Speaker 1>There was a a point in time where both of us were doing like middling gigs and</v>

1139
00:29:05.951 --> 00:29:07.450
<v Speaker 1>we really didn't have the time.</v>

1140
00:29:07.451 --> 00:29:09.760
<v Speaker 1>We really didn't have a real solid half hour,</v>

<v Speaker 1>when you're a young comic and you slip in the beginning of your set,</v>

1145
00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:18.610
<v Speaker 1>like the odds of you pulling stuff out of the fire.</v>

1147
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.690

1148
00:29:22.691 --> 00:29:23.680
<v Speaker 1>didn't address it.</v>

1149
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.533

1154
00:29:30.371 --> 00:29:30.821
<v Speaker 1>They knew I was,</v>

1155
00:29:30.821 --> 00:29:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I was killing</v>

1156
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.083
<v Speaker 4>all of them out there.</v>

1157
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.600
<v Speaker 4>It's all about their uncomfort and you denying.</v>

1158
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:37.630
<v Speaker 4>I remember being I,</v>

1159
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.560
<v Speaker 4>this was probably the cruelest thing anybody ever did to me when I was on stage.</v>

1160
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:41.590
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1161
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1162
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 4>half filled room back.</v>

1163
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.940
<v Speaker 4>It was always like the back of a Chinese restaurant where they had a banquet</v>

1164
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:48.300
<v Speaker 4>room that they just put a microphone up and,</v>

1165
00:29:48.301 --> 00:29:53.080
<v Speaker 4>and call it a comedy night and I'm up there tanking it and I'm not acknowledging</v>

1166
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:53.914
<v Speaker 4>that I'm tanking it.</v>

1167
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 4>And during one of the silences that should have had laughed rented after one of</v>

1168
00:29:57.431 --> 00:29:58.240
<v Speaker 4>my jokes,</v>

1169
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 4>I heard this middle aged woman whispered to her husband,</v>

1170
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 4>I could hear a whisper and she just goes,</v>

1171
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 4>the poor bastard.</v>

1172
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.023
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1173
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.580
<v Speaker 4>worse than any heckle.</v>

1174
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

1175
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

1176
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.833
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1177
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.570
<v Speaker 1>it would be real hard when we'd watch each other.</v>

1178
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.600
<v Speaker 1>You know your watch a friend eat dick in the beginning too.</v>

1179
00:30:24.601 --> 00:30:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know how devastating it,</v>

1180
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:27.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1181
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.010
<v Speaker 1>there's some times where you know,</v>

1182
00:30:29.011 --> 00:30:32.280
<v Speaker 1>this guy is not going to pull himself out of this and he has 15 more minutes to</v>

1183
00:30:32.281 --> 00:30:33.114
<v Speaker 1>go</v>

1184
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.101
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

1185
00:30:35.101 --> 00:30:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm slosh through.</v>

1186
00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.580
<v Speaker 4>Is there a way out of it?</v>

1187
00:30:37.581 --> 00:30:37.731
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

1188
00:30:37.731 --> 00:30:38.630
<v Speaker 4>what do you have to do?</v>

1189
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:42.770
<v Speaker 4>Like do you just have to stop or do you just pets?</v>

1190
00:30:42.771 --> 00:30:43.400
<v Speaker 4>We would go,</v>

1191
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:43.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1192
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.960
<v Speaker 4>that's where we'd steal anything.</v>

1193
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:45.680
<v Speaker 4>I Great Joe.</v>

1194
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I knew that there were grenades that I had in my waistband that were Joe.</v>

1195
00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:53.960
<v Speaker 4>Just take the fucking top off and lob it and you're back in the game.</v>

1196
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.680
<v Speaker 1>We would help each other.</v>

1197
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.690
<v Speaker 1>There was a time where I was headlined in where I had no fucking business</v>

1198
00:31:00.691 --> 00:31:02.460
<v Speaker 1>headline and there was no way.</v>

1199
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I barely had 40 minutes and they were letting me headline these rooms and I</v>

1200
00:31:06.511 --> 00:31:09.450
<v Speaker 1>would have to stretch it all out and if something went wrong,</v>

1201
00:31:09.451 --> 00:31:09.661
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1202
00:31:09.661 --> 00:31:10.860
<v Speaker 1>it went wrong hard.</v>

1203
00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:11.340
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1204
00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.710
<v Speaker 1>there's no better motivation to creating new material.</v>

1205
00:31:13.711 --> 00:31:14.544
<v Speaker 1>Then when you just,</v>

1206
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:18.450
<v Speaker 1>those shows happen and you just fucking half to get to a work.</v>

1207
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Like you need more weapons,</v>

1208
00:31:20.071 --> 00:31:20.371
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1209
00:31:20.371 --> 00:31:21.750
<v Speaker 1>You weren't on a weapons too quick.</v>

1210
00:31:21.751 --> 00:31:22.650
<v Speaker 1>You're up there dying.</v>

1211
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:23.071
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1212
00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:26.010
<v Speaker 4>especially like you can do the hour when it's going well.</v>

1213
00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.740
<v Speaker 4>You can take that one bit and you can stretch it out,</v>

1214
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:29.670
<v Speaker 4>add shit to it.</v>

1215
00:31:29.671 --> 00:31:30.071
<v Speaker 4>You're here,</v>

1216
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:32.820
<v Speaker 4>you're doing improvisational jazz and that our fills up.</v>

1217
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.320
<v Speaker 4>But when they're not laughing,</v>

1218
00:31:34.321 --> 00:31:36.210
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden it's like concentrate,</v>

1219
00:31:36.211 --> 00:31:37.470
<v Speaker 4>everything shrinks down.</v>

1220
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.650
<v Speaker 4>And now what you had as 35 minutes,</v>

1221
00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.010
<v Speaker 4>you just ripped through in 17 and now you're scared.</v>

1222
00:31:44.011 --> 00:31:47.810
<v Speaker 4>So you're tense and then you got nowhere to go except the crowds.</v>

1223
00:31:47.811 --> 00:31:49.080
<v Speaker 4>So you start fucking with a craft.</v>

1224
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 4>They don't like you now does that they,</v>

1225
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:51.763
<v Speaker 4>they don't like you.</v>

1226
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.580
<v Speaker 4>You're not making them comfortable.</v>

1227
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.490
<v Speaker 4>So there's not like a nice flow of energy.</v>

1228
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.721
<v Speaker 4>And so yeah,</v>

1229
00:31:57.721 --> 00:31:58.554
<v Speaker 4>the early,</v>

1230
00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:58.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1231
00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.520
<v Speaker 4>feel it.</v>

1232
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.870
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about Boston is,</v>

1233
00:32:00.871 --> 00:32:02.520
<v Speaker 4>and I think it was Kinda unique to a lot of,</v>

1234
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1235
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.930
<v Speaker 4>common other comedy cities is it is a punchline town.</v>

1236
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:08.220
<v Speaker 4>It's Bam,</v>

1237
00:32:08.221 --> 00:32:08.760
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

1238
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.241
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

1239
00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:09.660
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

1240
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:09.961
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1241
00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:11.910
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to see something esoteric.</v>

1242
00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:13.440
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to see a storyteller.</v>

1243
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.190
<v Speaker 4>They want you to grab them and just smack them around and then walk off stage</v>

1244
00:32:17.191 --> 00:32:18.030
<v Speaker 4>with your hands in the air.</v>

1245
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:18.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1246
00:32:18.331 --> 00:32:18.580
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1247
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.040
<v Speaker 1>there were guys that were doing it that we're so good at the best.</v>

1248
00:32:22.041 --> 00:32:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1249
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.060
<v Speaker 1>We came up in an error where,</v>

1250
00:32:24.061 --> 00:32:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1251
00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:24.720
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

1252
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this a hundred times on the podcast and people always go,</v>

1253
00:32:27.451 --> 00:32:27.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1254
00:32:27.721 --> 00:32:27.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1255
00:32:27.921 --> 00:32:28.171
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1256
00:32:28.171 --> 00:32:29.460
<v Speaker 1>we know that we're really good comedians.</v>

1257
00:32:29.461 --> 00:32:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

1258
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people even understand what it was like a utopia.</v>

1259
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Boston was like this standup comedy utopia.</v>

1260
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 1>There was at one point in time there was five clubs</v>

1261
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.540
<v Speaker 4>in a tiny little area,</v>

1262
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:42.910
<v Speaker 4>seven night a week club.</v>

1263
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1264
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.800
<v Speaker 4>I remember there was just that one block of warrant warrant,</v>

1265
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.380
<v Speaker 4>Nick's comedy stop.</v>

1266
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 4>And then there was duck soup and there was a comedy connection.</v>

1267
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:51.883
<v Speaker 4>And then Mike,</v>

1268
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 4>Mike Clark had the comedy club and the Charles play house above the comedy.</v>

1269
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.190
<v Speaker 4>And then on the weekends you cut over to Dick tardies,</v>

1270
00:32:58.191 --> 00:32:59.024
<v Speaker 4>comedy ball,</v>

1271
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.170
<v Speaker 4>50 yards away,</v>

1272
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.133
<v Speaker 4>craziness.</v>

1273
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.360
<v Speaker 4>And then you get in your car and you drive down the stitches on comm ave.</v>

1274
00:33:04.361 --> 00:33:04.611
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1275
00:33:04.611 --> 00:33:05.420
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1276
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.040
<v Speaker 4>And the best part really was,</v>

1277
00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:07.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1278
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.600
<v Speaker 4>and those were for short sets.</v>

1279
00:33:08.601 --> 00:33:09.291
<v Speaker 4>You doing five,</v>

1280
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 4>seven minutes with a big club.</v>

1281
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.691
<v Speaker 4>Those were the big ones.</v>

1282
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:12.920
<v Speaker 4>But then you and I would get,</v>

1283
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 4>and this is the thing people don't get today,</v>

1284
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.700
<v Speaker 4>is that we would get it for a year.</v>

1285
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.620
<v Speaker 4>We get either you get my car,</v>

1286
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:19.220
<v Speaker 4>I get in yours.</v>

1287
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.960
<v Speaker 4>We dragged providence one night for a 1520 minutes set for free all the time.</v>

1288
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 4>Then we go to Hartford one night,</v>

1289
00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:26.510
<v Speaker 4>then we go to Worcester one night,</v>

1290
00:33:26.511 --> 00:33:27.410
<v Speaker 4>then we go to Maine.</v>

1291
00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:29.510
<v Speaker 4>One night we would go anywhere.</v>

1292
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:31.280
<v Speaker 4>They'd give especially a longer set,</v>

1293
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.511
<v Speaker 4>and then you know,</v>

1294
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:36.500
<v Speaker 4>we were lucky enough to come up in a time where the word comedy in front of a</v>

1295
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:38.030
<v Speaker 4>place drew a crowd.</v>

1296
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.250
<v Speaker 4>You didn't need to have a big name.</v>

1297
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.080
<v Speaker 4>They just were comedy crazy.</v>

1298
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:47.081
<v Speaker 4>And we just happen to be dropped in the middle of it in a city that was a closed</v>

1299
00:33:47.571 --> 00:33:48.051
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

1300
00:33:48.051 --> 00:33:50.270
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have headliners come in from out of town.</v>

1301
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 4>So the local,</v>

1302
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:56.300
<v Speaker 4>there were four or five big local headliners that drew and the and the and the</v>

1303
00:33:56.301 --> 00:33:56.661
<v Speaker 4>club's.</v>

1304
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:59.780
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise they only booked based on do you crush?</v>

1305
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.620
<v Speaker 4>Are you funny?</v>

1306
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 4>Are you original?</v>

1307
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.840
<v Speaker 4>So it was a meritocracy and no one ever thought they were going to get famous</v>

1308
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.501
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1309
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:07.370
<v Speaker 4>What career,</v>

1310
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:08.930
<v Speaker 4>if someone used the word career,</v>

1311
00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:10.310
<v Speaker 4>people would have linked with them confused,</v>

1312
00:34:10.311 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 4>like what are you talking about?</v>

1313
00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:12.860
<v Speaker 4>All anyone wanted to do</v>

1314
00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.870
<v Speaker 1>was become a big Boston colic.</v>

1315
00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fame that you wanted was just the being accepted amongst your</v>

1317
00:34:19.361 --> 00:34:20.890
<v Speaker 1>peers and having crowds come to see you.</v>

1318
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.860
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1319
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.650
<v Speaker 4>That's what everybody expects to see you I think wasn't until later.</v>

1320
00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 4>I think for us it was just,</v>

1321
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.373
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

1322
00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:27.861
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1323
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 4>you know when your first fucking a girl and you can't believe she's letting you</v>

1324
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:34.370
<v Speaker 4>fuck her after jerking off for three straight years.</v>

1325
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.010
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was like when I was doing standup in Boston.</v>

1326
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:42.220
<v Speaker 4>They're allowing me these stages that I've watched since I was a teenager in all</v>

1327
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:44.810
<v Speaker 4>this and I'm on it and they're letting me talk.</v>

1328
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.673
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

1329
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:46.663
<v Speaker 4>That's all I needed.</v>

1330
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:47.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1331
00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:51.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the first guys I ever saw do a live set was Tom cotter.</v>

1332
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cod was one of the first guys.</v>

1333
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:58.470
<v Speaker 1>He's our buddy from Boston is a great guy and he was in like some sort of a,</v>

1334
00:34:58.871 --> 00:35:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the first time I ever went out some sort of an open mic night and uh,</v>

1335
00:35:02.051 --> 00:35:02.401
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1336
00:35:02.401 --> 00:35:04.720
<v Speaker 1>and he was like the first guy that everyone on stage,</v>

1337
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.100
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

1338
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.090
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>

1339
00:35:07.091 --> 00:35:07.601
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>

1340
00:35:07.601 --> 00:35:08.470
<v Speaker 4>He was like a not,</v>

1341
00:35:08.471 --> 00:35:11.020
<v Speaker 4>he had started maybe two years ahead of us.</v>

1342
00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.540
<v Speaker 1>That guy always used to bum me out.</v>

1343
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.560
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why I used to bum me out cause he was so fucking funny to hang</v>

1344
00:35:17.561 --> 00:35:17.981
<v Speaker 1>out with,</v>

1345
00:35:17.981 --> 00:35:22.330
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to take it down a notch and he wanted to like,</v>

1346
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:23.260
<v Speaker 1>oh maybe,</v>

1347
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe I shouldn't go so dirty and maybe I should.</v>

1348
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.350
<v Speaker 1>And you wanted to go do it.</v>

1349
00:35:26.351 --> 00:35:26.831
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>

1350
00:35:26.831 --> 00:35:27.730
<v Speaker 1>When you're at your best,</v>

1351
00:35:27.731 --> 00:35:28.600

<v Speaker 4>the shit that he would do,</v>

1358
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.010
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

1359
00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 4>I just can't say it on the air and I can see anything on the air.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But the Shit Tom Cod are dead.</v>

1361
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.650

1362
00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:52.250
<v Speaker 1>out of his pants.</v>

1363
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1364
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.820
<v Speaker 1>One of the first guys like no one was doing that back when we were 20,</v>

1365
00:35:55.821 --> 00:35:56.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1366
00:35:56.001 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 1>we were like 21 or whatever the hell we were at.</v>

1367
00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Tom Carter's walking around with his balls hanging out of his pants.</v>

1368
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.290
<v Speaker 4>Jesus man,</v>

1369
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:04.810
<v Speaker 4>it'd be a Christmas party and all the comics are there and he and he would have</v>

1370
00:36:04.811 --> 00:36:06.000
<v Speaker 4>the hands on his hips still.</v>

1371
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.020
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like he was hiding.</v>

1372
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

1373
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.670
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1374
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.240
<v Speaker 4>I remember at one point we were at somebody's house and there was a dog,</v>

1375
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.280
<v Speaker 4>it was a Oliver's dog and it was a,</v>

1376
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:15.690
<v Speaker 4>he had rescued one of those,</v>

1377
00:36:15.691 --> 00:36:16.730
<v Speaker 4>a grey hounds.</v>

1378
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 4>I think Tom was putting a dill pickle up its ass in the middle of the party.</v>

1379
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Like we were both beyond children.</v>

1380
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.260
<v Speaker 4>We were like fucking,</v>

1381
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.010
<v Speaker 4>we were like a collection of bad kids.</v>

1382
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1383
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.860
<v Speaker 1>It was the fun part of the fun of having a guy like Tom cotter too is because</v>

1384
00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:34.870
<v Speaker 1>you knew that he would like do something like that.</v>

1385
00:36:34.871 --> 00:36:36.430
<v Speaker 1>You knew he would want up things.</v>

1386
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.790
<v Speaker 1>You knew if there was a bunch of comics hang it around,</v>

1388
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Carter would find a way to make something fucked up.</v>

1389
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.200
<v Speaker 1>I always felt like he kind of pulled back on stage though,</v>

1390
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:44.870
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
