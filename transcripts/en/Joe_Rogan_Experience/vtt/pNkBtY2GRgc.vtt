<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what it was Victoria's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

14
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>He was succumbing to the pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fouling floyd had these head</v>

15
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>headbutting him and he got penalized for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it when he got penalized for it.</v>

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to make friends with floyd and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the making friends part like,</v>

17
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

19
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that in a fight because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the disruption of your focus.</v>

20
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It's adding in this emotional connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this person.</v>

21
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Now this person is your buddy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was like the golden boy and then it</v>

36
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.620

<v Speaker 1>It's happening for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>That's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait for,</v>

41
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Andre Ward is so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just has to fight more.</v>

42
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>He's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that might have viva nef might not</v>

43
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>be enough against Calvillo the Max so</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

44
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Well he's not just so he's skillful as</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

45
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and he's father at all.</v>

46
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't give a fuck.</v>

47
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>How about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of stupid talk about but</v>

48
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>it has legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather,</v>

49
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>conor Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

50
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>and if we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know cause didn't have any legs,</v>

51
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>it kind of does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

52
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>It kind of does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

53
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Because Floyd wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

54
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>New Ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to let it happen.</v>

55
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>But see I the only reason why I disagree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you there is because Dana goes,</v>

56
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>if floyd wants to make that fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

57
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>call me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dana is a businessman.</v>

58
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>They care about money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No big.</v>

59
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>That fight would be how much money do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think they could make if floyd</v>

60
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>mayweather fights conor mcgregor biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest paper you of all time?</v>

61
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think so?</v>

62
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

63
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you know the biggest draw</v>

64
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>already in UFC mma where there's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest paper,</v>

65
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>you draw a box in both time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mixed the world.</v>

66
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would tune in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including your dad.</v>

67
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I would say you telling me you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>tune in now because I was so full of</v>

68
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should very uninteresting to in two</v>

69
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>hits instead of the little baby fairy</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes turning fight.</v>

70
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating.</v>

71
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:56.374
<v Speaker 1>I spark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

72
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.561
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

73
00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>what happened was floyd mayweather would</v>
<v Speaker 1>box with conor mcgregor and basically</v>

74
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>move around and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

75
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>here goes and it'd be a spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a fight.</v>

76
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be a fight where you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking party pooper.</v>

77
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>The guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

78
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And in our cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

79
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing you gotta remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

80
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that Dana and floyd</v>
<v Speaker 1>mayweather who would be responsible in</v>

81
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.930
<v Speaker 1>this fight together and conner for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

82
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>all they care about is money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

83
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>That fight would be money and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

84
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>It would break pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'All may with a canteen.</v>

85
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.161
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

86
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would,</v>

87
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.980
<v Speaker 1>how would they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would that fight,</v>

88
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>what would they do and that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So floyd probably can knock them out</v>

89
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>anytime he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

91
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Connor has a very good shin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

92
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of got knocked out by Nate Diaz or</v>

93
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>he got knocked down and hurt Walden</v>
<v Speaker 1>wobbled by Nate Diaz.</v>

94
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little gloves.</v>

95
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nate's really good puncher needs a big</v>

96
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nate.</v>

97
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Nate's fought at one seven and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot bigger than floyd.</v>

98
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Like physically alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

99
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>but floyd is a guy who's broken his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands many,</v>

100
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>many times and he's not known for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really uncorking all of his might and</v>

101
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>try to knock guys out knockout artists</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the least bit.</v>

102
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>But he could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he certainly could.</v>

103
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>You know it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the floor doesn't hit real hard but when</v>

104
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>you box real smart knockouts come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity comes like the Ricky</v>

105
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Hatton fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect example.</v>

106
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>That knockout came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like he went looking for the</v>

107
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>victor of tease five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victor just fucked up and he just left</v>

108
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:23.960
<v Speaker 1>hook right hand dumb and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a total sucker punch.</v>

109
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you had no idea what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weather has issues against gay,</v>

110
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.970
<v Speaker 1>like May Donna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you suggest the first second fight,</v>

111
00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>he box the shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if may dial it,</v>

112
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

113
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>if I was college coach in that fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>were to happen,</v>

114
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.251
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

115
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>don't be pretty and sit on the outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hit this guy.</v>

116
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>We make this a dog bite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the bigger guy.</v>

117
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>You think connor would actually give</v>
<v Speaker 1>floyd mayweather a boxing match?</v>

118
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Is that what I'm hearing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

119
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't anybody saying no,</v>

120
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.620
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing you're saying,</v>

121
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 1>he's the biggest draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that I don't think floyd</v>

122
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>would just go out and try and knock them</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the first round.</v>

123
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>He'd box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would canelo Alvarez him,</v>

124
00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 1>obviously Canelo's way more skillful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>

126
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Canelo is a world champion.</v>

127
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>One Punch knockout artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxer.</v>

128
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean that fucking Amir Khan knockouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Jesus.</v>

129
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Louisa was a super fucking home run on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the button to floyd got hit.</v>

130
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>He said after he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fought Canelo,</v>

131
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>he got punched in the thigh by Canelo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had trouble walking for two days.</v>

132
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>He literally creeks that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't show it at the fight.</v>

133
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:27.221
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

134
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>my thigh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he punched me in the thigh so hard.</v>

135
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>I am having trouble walking.</v>

136
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>That's why floyd was never going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight mma.</v>

137
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Cause if connor would fucking break his</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs like literally mma,</v>

138
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>that it would be discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more embarrassing than conner doing</v>

139
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>just box way more than you would get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way more embarrassing because common is</v>

140
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Employed would have to like Bach smart</v>

141
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>out in connor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think connor would have just</v>

142
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably difficult time even coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to hitting him.</v>

143
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to have straight</v>

144
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.690
<v Speaker 1>boxing with tying grades and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably,</v>

145
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about if not the greatest</v>

146
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>boxer of all time and his defense is</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

147
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>It would be a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say Good.</v>

148
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>It'd be the best defense ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for sure.</v>

149
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>WHO's gets defensive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Offensive Floyd.</v>

150
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>And now you're taking a guy who is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>elite strike in the UFC,</v>

151
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>but boxing's a different game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

152
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
