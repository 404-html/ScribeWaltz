15
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.020

18
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 1>And then I went to Twitter page a Twitter page is filled with some hilarious</v>

19
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:38.591
<v Speaker 1>stuff like one of them is about you sending poop through the mail and then it</v>

20
00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>was like one of the only times the post office opened up your box or they tried</v>

21
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:45.620
<v Speaker 1>to I asked him not to.</v>

22
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 3>And they respected that.</v>

23
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Why did they want to open up your box anyway.</v>

24
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Well I put it in a box of a very expensive camera that I had and so when they</v>

25
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 2>asked me like What is this.</v>

26
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I was like oh it's the camera.</v>

27
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 2>And I said well how much was it.</v>

28
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's like well I got nine hundred dollars.</v>

29
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 4>And so they're like Oh we'll have to repackage this and and then she's like</v>

30
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:08.630
<v Speaker 4>getting her like knife ready or razor ready to open it up and I'm like oh no</v>

31
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 4>it's it's fine you can you can just leave it as is.</v>

32
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 4>And she's like well if it gets broken it's your responsibility and all this.</v>

33
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.003
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like It's fine.</v>

34
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.683
<v Speaker 5>It's okay.</v>

35
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 5>Well there was more than just poo in there.</v>

36
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 5>There was like piss there's toenail clippings.</v>

37
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 5>There was a vial of my spit like this guy had a hole like.</v>

38
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.420
<v Speaker 5>Value package for me.</v>

39
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>How did How the fuck did you get started in this business.</v>

40
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 1>You seem like a fairly normal person.</v>

41
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Granted I've only met you for a short amount of time and I seem completely</v>

42
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.024
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

43
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>It's it's a really good story.</v>

44
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I was 17 years old at the time and I was travelling abroad I was actually</v>

45
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Speaker 2>exchange student in Japan and I was really lonely like I say to the host family</v>

46
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't know any Japanese and I only spoke English and so I was online just</v>

47
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:55.580
<v Speaker 2>all the time like.</v>

48
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Me and on and on.</v>

49
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was kind of before MySpace or Facebook or anything like that but I'd</v>

50
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 2>go to different like social networking sites and talk to people.</v>

51
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.200
<v Speaker 2>And one day this guy starts talking to me and he's a total pervert.</v>

52
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 2>He's like into getting peed on and he really has a thing for like panty hose and</v>

53
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 2>and so he strikes a conversation with me because he just thinks I'm very</v>

54
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 2>attractive and all this.</v>

55
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 4>And I was kind of like grossed out by him but it intrigued at the same time you</v>

56
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

57
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 4>And so I was like OK.</v>

58
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to a guy online he can't do anything to me.</v>

59
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 4>So I kept the you know lines of communication open and we'd talk here and there</v>

60
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 4>and and he always tried to convince me to meet him.</v>

61
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 4>You really want me to pee on him and stuff like that.</v>

62
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.950
<v Speaker 4>And I was like No I'm not going to do that and I'm going to do that.</v>

63
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 4>I kept turning him down.</v>

64
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 4>And then one day he was like All right look I get it you're not going to meet me</v>

65
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.760
<v Speaker 4>but I just I think you're pissed should be bottled and sold.</v>

66
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 5>It's like I was like All right buy it.</v>

67
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 2>And like I didn't think you serious those guys full of shit.</v>

68
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 2>But I was like fine by it.</v>

69
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.400
<v Speaker 2>And he did.</v>

70
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 2>He bought a 12 ounce like bottle just like this of my urine for ten or fifty</v>

71
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.750
<v Speaker 2>dollars and after that you specify the ounces that you had to be.</v>

72
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

73
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.830
<v Speaker 5>Now I think just a bottle.</v>

74
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.160
<v Speaker 5>And so it was just a bottle.</v>

75
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.503
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

77
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.660
<v Speaker 5>And yeah From there I was like Oh there has to be more guys like this guy found</v>

78
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.100
<v Speaker 5>me on accident like this was just a mistake like what it would have been if I</v>

79
00:03:28.101 --> 00:03:30.660
<v Speaker 5>went looking for guys like this I give you promoted it.</v>

80
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

81
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Or like kind of sorted out.</v>

82
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.970
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like OK I've heard of like women selling their used panties before I</v>

83
00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:38.924
<v Speaker 2>know that's a thing.</v>

84
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.350
<v Speaker 2>And so I started searching to see if there was like a website that.</v>

85
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Like I could be on or something that catered to that.</v>

86
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 2>And and I did.</v>

87
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I found this auction site that's just like eBay but it specializes in like use</v>

88
00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:56.291
<v Speaker 2>panties or socks or pantyhose or anything like a woman can wear can auction on</v>

89
00:03:56.331 --> 00:03:57.164
<v Speaker 2>the site.</v>

90
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like oh yeah this is a I'm doing this.</v>

91
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.360
<v Speaker 2>And I started selling all sorts of stuff and I've sold anything you can imagine</v>

92
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 2>I've sold like my shirt my purse tampons like hair from my hairbrush my bathroom</v>

93
00:04:11.121 --> 00:04:11.990
<v Speaker 2>trash.</v>

94
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.240
<v Speaker 6>What is like hair from your hairbrush go for.</v>

95
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.230
<v Speaker 6>How much can you sell that for.</v>

96
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.320
<v Speaker 6>I've always sell it once I think I sell off like a hundred bucks versus like a</v>

97
00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:22.154
<v Speaker 6>good log.</v>

98
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.900
<v Speaker 4>Well the thing about my shit is it's kind of an interesting story.</v>

99
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.580
<v Speaker 4>So when I first started a guy I wanted to buy my shirt and I was like Yeah I</v>

100
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:32.820
<v Speaker 4>just won't do this because I think it's the.</v>

101
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously the money but I think it's an interesting story.</v>

102
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.730
<v Speaker 4>And so this guy bought my shirt for like one hundred dollars and after that I</v>

103
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:41.150
<v Speaker 4>knew there.</v>

104
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.670
<v Speaker 5>You know I'm just I'm like I'm just it's on my panties and it's gonna grow as I</v>

105
00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:45.410
<v Speaker 5>don't want to sell my shirt</v>

106
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.743
<v Speaker 5>anyways.</v>

107
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 4>Fast forward to this year and meanwhile guys have always asked about my shirt.</v>

108
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm like I always gave them just the most large absurd number like price wise</v>

109
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.250
<v Speaker 4>and they'd always be like What the fuck now.</v>

110
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.140
<v Speaker 4>And then two weeks I was making money otherwise but someone took me up on my</v>

111
00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:09.141
<v Speaker 4>offer recently for four thousand dollars to buy my shirt and he's since bought</v>

112
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 4>it two other times this year.</v>

113
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.240
<v Speaker 7>So I've made a grand total of twelve thousand dollars off my shirt.</v>

114
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 7>Now you pay taxes on that should you be telling say taxes.</v>

115
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.770
<v Speaker 7>Okay so what do you what do you like list under occupation.</v>

116
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.910
<v Speaker 7>I have a really good accountant that kind of takes care of all that shit</v>

117
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:27.744
<v Speaker 7>slinger.</v>

118
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 5>Money comes from.</v>

119
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.380
<v Speaker 5>Like</v>

120
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.020
<v Speaker 4>I I make fetish videos and stuff like that right.</v>

121
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.910
<v Speaker 7>Video producer this is just ice cream or whipped cream rather for lack of a</v>

122
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Speaker 7>better Cherry man cherry on top whatever so.</v>

123
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.080
<v Speaker 7>So you started from this one guy essentially this one guy.</v>

124
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.970
<v Speaker 7>Yeah have fueled your imagination.</v>

125
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah yeah.</v>

126
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.010
<v Speaker 4>So I started seeing tangible things and then from there I figured out how to</v>

127
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.020
<v Speaker 4>open up like my own phone lines where I get paid per minute like like a phone</v>

128
00:05:58.021 --> 00:06:00.520
<v Speaker 4>sex operator but I wasn't like talking sexy to guys.</v>

129
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.080
<v Speaker 4>I kept getting fetish guys that were really submissive and just wanted me to</v>

130
00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:05.680
<v Speaker 4>berate them and talk shit to them.</v>

131
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 4>And so you seek these guys out or did they it just kind of was the path that I</v>

132
00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:16.221
<v Speaker 4>ended up taking because I just I started out doing this fetish thing and so such</v>

133
00:06:16.801 --> 00:06:20.460
<v Speaker 4>just kind of was it because I like your attitude towards people that wanted to</v>

134
00:06:20.461 --> 00:06:23.280
<v Speaker 4>buy your shit your panties like you fucking losers here it is.</v>

135
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.050
<v Speaker 8>What was that like.</v>

136
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.090
<v Speaker 4>No I think I I think naturally guys that went by that sort of thing or like want</v>

137
00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:30.924
<v Speaker 4>that kind of treatment.</v>

138
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.920
<v Speaker 4>So I would get guys wanting me to treat them that way just like you know I'm</v>

139
00:06:34.921 --> 00:06:39.060
<v Speaker 4>such a lowly loser and I want to be weird pathetic little toilet and stress and</v>

140
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.253
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

141
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 4>Wow yeah.</v>

142
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.830
<v Speaker 4>And then it was like when I knew I could go about the sex industry in this way I</v>

143
00:06:46.831 --> 00:06:48.780
<v Speaker 4>was like oh I want to do it I want to do that.</v>

144
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean I tell people what I do for a living I'm pretty open honest about it.</v>

145
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.780
<v Speaker 4>And for the most part people think it's really cool.</v>

146
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 4>So I think I don't think I would get the same response if I were a stripper or</v>

147
00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:02.280
<v Speaker 4>something like that but I don't think there's a thing like being a stripper.</v>

148
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.340
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of people do and there's less stigma associated with it.</v>

149
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.540
<v Speaker 9>So it's like I kind of found this weird loophole in the sex industry where I was</v>

150
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.310
<v Speaker 9>so odd and because yes I'm a Metro Oh yeah yeah exactly.</v>

151
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.540
<v Speaker 9>That kind of makes sense.</v>

152
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.680
<v Speaker 9>Yeah but why did it's this is a gig where do you have an exit strategy.</v>

153
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.120
<v Speaker 8>Do you do you look at the future and go out fucking shit and buckets forever.</v>

154
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Shit every day I so my shit songs like Keep friends of these assholes.</v>

155
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.750
<v Speaker 1>You got 12 grand a year easy.</v>

156
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah well for one guy I'll do it.</v>

157
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 4>I always said I'll do it as as long as it makes sense to do it.</v>

158
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 4>You know open ended right.</v>

159
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.900
<v Speaker 4>But I try to be smart with my money.</v>

160
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.753
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

161
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.550
<v Speaker 4>I own a couple of houses back in Portland and you know I paid for my education</v>

162
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.530
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing.</v>

163
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.380
<v Speaker 4>So I just try and save as much as possible because I don't think I'm gonna be</v>

164
00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:54.280
<v Speaker 4>making as much money as I do now the rest of my life.</v>

165
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.380
<v Speaker 9>Yeah well there's probably going to be a drop off when you hit like 66 year old</v>

166
00:07:58.381 --> 00:08:00.780
<v Speaker 9>shit's not worth twenty eight year old shit.</v>

167
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.800
<v Speaker 9>Is that Gulf shit.</v>

168
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:04.613
<v Speaker 10>Kill.</v>

169
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.230
<v Speaker 9>There's something about Guilford just MILF is still like hot but Guilford let me</v>

170
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.373
<v Speaker 9>leave her alone.</v>

171
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 9>So do you do you have like a thought process as far as like you like OK what is</v>

172
00:08:20.071 --> 00:08:20.700
<v Speaker 9>my.</v>

173
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.870
<v Speaker 9>Is that all you do.</v>

174
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.070
<v Speaker 9>Do you have another gig.</v>

175
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.030
<v Speaker 5>No that's my only job for years now.</v>

176
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:27.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

177
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

178
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.420
<v Speaker 7>It'll be so hard for you to work like a regular job now especially would make</v>

179
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.900
<v Speaker 7>you think about like how much you can make by shitting into a Tupperware</v>

180
00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 7>container.</v>

181
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah I know.</v>

182
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.150
<v Speaker 7>Think about like how long you would have to work in an office to make for ground</v>

183
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 7>like you'd have done a month at least right.</v>

184
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 7>I got a good office job is 50 grand a year right.</v>

185
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.020
<v Speaker 7>That's a good office.</v>

186
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.063
<v Speaker 7>That's a good living.</v>

187
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.830
<v Speaker 7>Yeah that's that's a thousand bucks a week.</v>

188
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.480
<v Speaker 7>But you got to pay taxes rent.</v>

189
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 7>So the tax is chopped away.</v>

190
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 7>So to actually get four grand.</v>

191
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.703
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

192
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.660
<v Speaker 6>I think about that a lot because I'm I'm very spoiled and I realize that that</v>

193
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.160
<v Speaker 6>that's a stripper issue too right.</v>

194
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:05.283
<v Speaker 6>So right.</v>

195
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 6>Or like athlete issue like the one thing we're like Yeah you're making a lot of</v>

196
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 6>money for my time.</v>

197
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 9>Yeah especially like athletes or you know we're like when it's over it's fucking</v>

201
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 9>of millions dollars just eat through all of it and you never planned on it</v>

202
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 9>ending or having some sort of a right strategy to continue it.</v>

203
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah so you're just gonna just ride that bitch right into the rocks.</v>

261
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 11>And when you do them do you do them specifically for individuals or do you do</v>

262
00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:36.560
<v Speaker 11>them for the public like you do both.</v>

274
00:12:15.091 --> 00:12:16.080
<v Speaker 4>chastity devices.</v>

275
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.990
<v Speaker 12>No I'm not shaming I've got it too.</v>

276
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.690
<v Speaker 5>It's basically like a cock cage and I don't like those words together.</v>

277
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah okay.</v>

278
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.520
<v Speaker 4>So you put your dick in this little cage and you put like a little padlock on it</v>

279
00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:36.660
<v Speaker 4>to lock him up and then like you know the woman the dominatrix or whatever will</v>

280
00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:39.990
<v Speaker 4>wear the key and it's all about just kind of teasing this guy who can't touch</v>

281
00:12:39.991 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 4>himself or get hard.</v>

282
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.940
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

283
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

284
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:42.923
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>

285
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:43.350
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

286
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.080
<v Speaker 9>So what we're looking at for people who are listening to this if you would</v>

287
00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:49.070
<v Speaker 9>describe it he would describe it as hood.</v>

288
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.700
<v Speaker 9>There's a couple different kinds.</v>

289
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.550
<v Speaker 9>Yeah some metal ones some plastic ones.</v>

290
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 13>Some of them spikes inside them.</v>

291
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 13>Do they hurt the deck.</v>

292
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:57.270
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

293
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.110
<v Speaker 13>They start swelling up.</v>

294
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.230
<v Speaker 13>So if they get aroused it's painful for them.</v>

295
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.010
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

296
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.840
<v Speaker 13>2 they take it off and they're bleeding and stuff.</v>

297
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.360
<v Speaker 14>Well it depends.</v>

298
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.930
<v Speaker 14>If the woman has the key to it she decides to unlock it basically.</v>

299
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.280
<v Speaker 9>So you do do you do.</v>

300
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.010
<v Speaker 9>Only videos or do you do like one on ones with these guys.</v>

301
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.110
<v Speaker 14>No I don't meet anyone in person it's online and all my videos I should specify</v>

302
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.290
<v Speaker 14>are like point of view.</v>

303
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 14>So I'm talking to the camera so the guy feels like I'm I'm talking like to him.</v>

304
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.440
<v Speaker 14>So like this video I'm describing this guy.</v>

305
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.500
<v Speaker 14>You know he has this fetish for chastity.</v>

306
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.280
<v Speaker 14>So I have a habit with these little devices and I'll unlock it and I'll show it</v>

307
00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:35.970
<v Speaker 14>to the camera and I'll I'll kind of move my hand in pretending I'm putting it on</v>

308
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.073
<v Speaker 14>you know.</v>

309
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.910
<v Speaker 15>And then I lock them up and then I tease Jimmy scroll up to the upper right hand</v>

310
00:13:41.911 --> 00:13:44.300
<v Speaker 15>corner upper right above that right above that right about that.</v>

311
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.900
<v Speaker 15>What the fuck is that.</v>

312
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.490
<v Speaker 15>Oh it looks like it goes in your eyes.</v>

313
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.640
<v Speaker 9>Yes this is a giant Christmas tree looking thing that goes in your ass and it's</v>

314
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:55.680
<v Speaker 9>connected to one of those cock holsters.</v>

315
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.473
<v Speaker 9>Oh my God.</v>

316
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.960
<v Speaker 14>Yeah looks like it must strap you in that can't go off.</v>

317
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.220
<v Speaker 14>Yeah you've got this.</v>

318
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.320
<v Speaker 15>Pole in your ass and then your dick is locked up in a cage.</v>

319
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.480
<v Speaker 15>Wonderful.</v>

320
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.313
<v Speaker 15>Great idea.</v>

321
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.590
<v Speaker 15>This is ridiculous.</v>

322
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.280
<v Speaker 15>Yeah.</v>

323
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.250
<v Speaker 15>So this this one specific.</v>

324
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.680
<v Speaker 9>I like that you like that.</v>

325
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.003
<v Speaker 13>Well it's different.</v>

326
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.300
<v Speaker 13>Does that make sense it's for a girl.</v>

327
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.980
<v Speaker 13>It looks like the female jester.</v>

328
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.060
<v Speaker 13>And so this is like there's a whole fetish that goes along with this right.</v>

329
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:27.870
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

330
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.800
<v Speaker 13>The woman being in control right and kind of decides like when the man can be</v>

331
00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:32.520
<v Speaker 13>released.</v>

332
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.380
<v Speaker 9>And so how do you do that in a video though.</v>

333
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.550
<v Speaker 9>The guy's nowhere near you.</v>

334
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.510
<v Speaker 4>So like I said I'll be looking at the camera.</v>

335
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking to cameras I'm talking directly to the slave and I'll take full</v>

336
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.160
<v Speaker 4>chastity vice and I'll all kind of like go into the camera pretending I'm</v>

337
00:14:47.161 --> 00:14:47.994
<v Speaker 4>putting it on.</v>

338
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.470
<v Speaker 4>And then from there it's mostly just kind of like a tease show or you know like</v>

339
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.330
<v Speaker 4>rub my boobs together and talk all seductively.</v>

340
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.620
<v Speaker 4>And so the viewers watching it as though I'm like seducing them.</v>

341
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.940
<v Speaker 14>Do you think you have in particular it's pretty morbid so his fantasy is in this</v>

342
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 14>dungeon and I lock him up and I have this nurse outfit and I'm his nurse and I</v>

343
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 14>talk about how I'm going to train him</v>

344
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.340
<v Speaker 14>to be to to to serve me orally.</v>

345
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.340
<v Speaker 4>But what I do too.</v>

346
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.253
<v Speaker 4>So you can do this.</v>

347
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.480
<v Speaker 4>What was it.</v>

348
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.270
<v Speaker 4>I had to at first remove all his teeth because I didn't want teeth on my pussy.</v>

349
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 7>So you know I banged his teeth out.</v>

350
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

351
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.260
<v Speaker 7>I'm just talking I'm talking about it.</v>

352
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 14>So you wanted me to talk about you know taking his teeth out.</v>

353
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.690
<v Speaker 11>He wanted this.</v>

354
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 5>This is like his his what is your job to.</v>

355
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he.</v>

356
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.440
<v Speaker 5>Probably not in real life.</v>

357
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 4>Anyway a couple of clamps in his ears to be steered you know.</v>

358
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 4>And then he wanted me to tell him that his vocal cords would be removed because</v>

359
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't wanna hear him complaining.</v>

360
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.170
<v Speaker 4>Whoa yeah this guy fucking hates himself.</v>

361
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 4>Well it's funny because he he was like Could you do it.</v>

362
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.090
<v Speaker 4>A very sweet sort of way.</v>

363
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.390
<v Speaker 4>Like he didn't want me to be like a real mean mistress.</v>

364
00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.230
<v Speaker 4>Like he wanted me to be like that kind of juxtaposition of like oh really sweet</v>

365
00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:01.910
<v Speaker 4>but I'm doing all these terrible things to you.</v>

366
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.190
<v Speaker 4>Whoa yeah.</v>

367
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you find.</v>

368
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:10.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a stereotypical occupation or a type of guy who wants this sort of</v>

369
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 1>treatment.</v>

370
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 4>I think I see where he might be going with this.</v>

371
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I get all sorts of guys.</v>

372
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 4>I think there's this like kind of cliché that there are all these high powered</v>

373
00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:21.620
<v Speaker 4>CEO right that want to be dominated.</v>

374
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's the case.</v>

375
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I talk to all walks of life like young old rich poor alike.</v>

376
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 9>And so it's just a fan it's like a foot thing.</v>

377
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:32.790
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

378
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:37.100
<v Speaker 9>Like just doing his thing a lick of humiliation thing that some guys just have</v>

379
00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:37.960
<v Speaker 9>that gene.</v>

380
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.013
<v Speaker 4>Yeah whatever it is.</v>

381
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah I know it's a gene but it's totally not.</v>

382
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah you know I'm just.</v>

383
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

384
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.993
<v Speaker 6>The thing.</v>

385
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried to figure out where it comes from.</v>

386
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever like been like.</v>

387
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Because I would assume that like from the first time all these guys like you</v>

388
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 1>know so much body piss you know people like what the fuck are you talking about.</v>

389
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah but have you ever tried to figure out like what is wrong with these people.</v>

390
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.480
<v Speaker 1>All right you know what.</v>

391
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.930
<v Speaker 4>Did you get your perspective.</v>

392
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 4>Well you know there's not a lot of information about it but like the best</v>

393
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:14.651
<v Speaker 4>explanation I've heard I know like Dan Savage talks about this and and the</v>

394
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:18.320
<v Speaker 4>author early Jesse bearing you wrote that book perv.</v>

395
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 4>He talks about it it's like there's this kind of sensitive period for guys like</v>

396
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 4>around the age of 9 where their mind is just kind of almost malleable in this</v>

397
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:27.740
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

398
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.740
<v Speaker 4>And they'll usually have an experience that will you know set them off for the</v>

399
00:17:33.471 --> 00:17:34.100
<v Speaker 4>rest of their life.</v>

400
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 4>That hardwired them to like whatever they like.</v>

401
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.320
<v Speaker 4>I think for most guys that's like boobs and blowjobs.</v>

402
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.400
<v Speaker 4>But you know some of the time some some weirdo gets in there some people it's</v>

403
00:17:44.401 --> 00:17:45.650
<v Speaker 4>just shitting in your hair.</v>

404
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah and and it really seems to be just like really hardwired for guys like</v>

405
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.410
<v Speaker 4>because I as you can imagine a lot of my clients don't want to like what they</v>

406
00:17:54.411 --> 00:17:54.740
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

407
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.573
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

408
00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.020
<v Speaker 4>You know a lot of them are submissive and you know guys aren't really allowed to</v>

409
00:18:00.021 --> 00:18:00.854
<v Speaker 4>be submissive.</v>

410
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:05.030
<v Speaker 4>And so you know a lot of men really struggle with it and they try and like quit</v>

411
00:18:05.031 --> 00:18:07.640
<v Speaker 4>it like they see it as this addiction that they need to quit.</v>

412
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:08.703
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

413
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.900
<v Speaker 4>But you can't.</v>

414
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.110
<v Speaker 4>Like let's let's just how male sexuality works it seems like you can't just like</v>

415
00:18:15.111 --> 00:18:15.890
<v Speaker 4>something else.</v>

416
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:20.510
<v Speaker 11>So you say you you think it's just something that happens along the way during</v>

417
00:18:20.511 --> 00:18:21.660
<v Speaker 11>the developmental period.</v>

418
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.680
<v Speaker 9>Like a little hijacking of your of what we would consider normal sexuality to</v>

419
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:29.920
<v Speaker 9>hear it piques this interests or</v>

420
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.200
<v Speaker 9>gets this fetish fired up inside of a guy's mind.</v>

421
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah I mean I don't like to speculate about that sort of thing.</v>

422
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.800
<v Speaker 4>You know I don't want to play armchair psychologists but like from there that</v>

423
00:18:42.801 --> 00:18:44.540
<v Speaker 4>seems to be I think you've earned the position.</v>

424
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah maybe so but I mean as far as like studies I've been on this like that</v>

425
00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:52.490
<v Speaker 4>seems to be just kind of the best explanation that you have right now about it.</v>

426
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.800
<v Speaker 9>I've talked to Dan Savage about this.</v>

427
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 9>And Chris as well.</v>

428
00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.550
<v Speaker 9>Like we were talking about the guys that might not even be gay that get they</v>

429
00:19:01.551 --> 00:19:05.150
<v Speaker 9>develop a fetish for a guy giving them oral sex.</v>

430
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.410
<v Speaker 3>I talked to those guys all the time.</v>

431
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

432
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah it's not forced by the caller.</v>

433
00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.580
<v Speaker 3>What's it called forced by forced by force by force by sexuality.</v>

434
00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.040
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was for spy for spies.</v>

435
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

436
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.880
<v Speaker 4>No it's guys that want me to force them to like suck cock get fucked in the ass</v>

437
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:27.380
<v Speaker 4>and they'll tell me time and time again I would never do this unless a woman was</v>

438
00:19:27.381 --> 00:19:30.380
<v Speaker 4>forcing me to do it or a woman was present encouraging me to do it.</v>

439
00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.120
<v Speaker 4>It's a it's not about I want to suck a dick.</v>

440
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.590
<v Speaker 4>It's about I want a woman to humiliate me in this way because that's the most</v>

441
00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:37.790
<v Speaker 4>humiliating thing I can think of.</v>

442
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:43.180
<v Speaker 11>See I guess I could kind of understand like fetishes I could understand like you</v>

443
00:19:43.191 --> 00:19:46.010
<v Speaker 11>know just get really turned down when you see women's shoes or something wacky.</v>

444
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.140
<v Speaker 11>Yeah but there's something bizarre about wanting to be humiliated like that's</v>

445
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.240
<v Speaker 11>I'm shocked when I find out how many people have this thing where they want to</v>

446
00:19:56.241 --> 00:19:57.200
<v Speaker 11>be humiliated.</v>

447
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.183
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

448
00:19:59.410 --> 00:19:59.970
<v Speaker 6>What are they.</v>

449
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:00.960
<v Speaker 6>What are they tell you.</v>

450
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:01.770
<v Speaker 6>Do.</v>

451
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:02.603
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever have.</v>

452
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.370
<v Speaker 1>You have video conversations these people or audio conversations.</v>

453
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.330
<v Speaker 1>These people on the phone.</v>

454
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah I talked to them.</v>

455
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah I talked to like on Skype like I do camera phones one on one and so you see</v>

456
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:14.350
<v Speaker 4>them sometime if they turn on their cameras see them right.</v>

457
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.280
<v Speaker 4>And you know.</v>

458
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Depends on if they want to be seen or not.</v>

459
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:17.560
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

460
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.393
<v Speaker 4>I don't really care.</v>

461
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:25.120
<v Speaker 4>But I mean I'm mostly talking to them and it when they're aroused and usually</v>

462
00:20:25.121 --> 00:20:26.240
<v Speaker 4>wants the comments like good bye.</v>

463
00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.710
<v Speaker 5>So I don't have a lot of like you know post-coital conversations or anything.</v>

464
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:31.603
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

465
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.850
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know.</v>

466
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.130
<v Speaker 4>It's just it just seems to me like it's a different form of dirty talk.</v>

467
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:37.983
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

468
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.183
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

469
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:43.690
<v Speaker 11>So it's not necessarily that they really do want you to force them to suck a</v>

470
00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:44.524
<v Speaker 11>guy's dick.</v>

471
00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.480
<v Speaker 11>They want to talk about it and beat off.</v>

472
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 4>Well they don't have a choice with me because I don't do sessions or anything.</v>

473
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.183
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

474
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.230
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of guys do like I'm friends with women who work as dominatrix is.</v>

475
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.680
<v Speaker 4>And yeah they'll want to set up a session where this woman like foursome just</v>

476
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 4>like a deck or sell their house on craigslist or something like that.</v>

477
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.693
<v Speaker 5>And so they do it.</v>

478
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.613
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

479
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

480
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.913
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

481
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.030
<v Speaker 5>That's next level shit.</v>

482
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.670
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

483
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 5>None of them do.</v>

484
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:11.620
<v Speaker 9>I mean some commercials too scared but certainly guys that do but like the</v>

485
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:16.621
<v Speaker 9>ultimate for those guys is to find a dominatrix that will get them a guy that's</v>

486
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:17.890
<v Speaker 9>kind of fuck them in the ass.</v>

487
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

488
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 9>Or forced him to suck his dick.</v>

489
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.880
<v Speaker 4>I had a guy one time is this French guy and he is really into the whole force by</v>

490
00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 4>thing and he was also into being like blackmailed and exposed for what he was</v>

491
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 4>doing and so he made a video for me.</v>

492
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Speaker 4>He put my name on his for head in big letters like sea air.</v>

493
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.440
<v Speaker 4>And his ass.</v>

494
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.500
<v Speaker 4>And then he just found like this black guy with just the biggest dick ever.</v>

495
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 4>And just like made a video of him like blowing on with my name on its head and</v>

496
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:49.630
<v Speaker 4>then getting fucked in the ass and then he wanted me to put together a whole</v>

497
00:21:49.631 --> 00:21:52.660
<v Speaker 4>video where I'm like humiliating him for this video and that I was going to</v>

498
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:57.661
<v Speaker 4>expose him to the world and expose them to all his ex-girlfriends and he fucking</v>

499
00:21:57.761 --> 00:21:59.040
<v Speaker 4>loved it like it all together.</v>

500
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.450
<v Speaker 12>So happy.</v>

501
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.790
<v Speaker 12>And it keeps paying me money so I did more of it in the bag.</v>

502
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.750
<v Speaker 12>Why I this goofy French accent.</v>

503
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:08.860
<v Speaker 5>He's super flamboyant.</v>

504
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.490
<v Speaker 5>You'll probably watch this and be totally stoked and talking about him right now</v>

505
00:22:11.491 --> 00:22:11.980
<v Speaker 5>actually.</v>

506
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.813
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

507
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.120
<v Speaker 6>You know what.</v>

508
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 6>So is he gay.</v>

509
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.230
<v Speaker 6>You he's super flamboyant.</v>

510
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:17.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

511
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:17.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

512
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 4>Like I would think he was gay but he's apparently had girlfriends and part of</v>

513
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:27.391
<v Speaker 4>his kink is that he wants me to expose him to his ex girlfriends for being the</v>

514
00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:28.510
<v Speaker 4>big fag that he is.</v>

515
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.493
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

516
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.340
<v Speaker 5>Cause I need it.</v>

517
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.730
<v Speaker 5>I need to punish him for tricking all these women when he's really just a closet</v>

518
00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:34.564
<v Speaker 5>fag.</v>

519
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 5>So yeah that's his thing.</v>

520
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:42.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's clearly not totally straight but bisexual I guess.</v>

521
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.080
<v Speaker 6>I guess yeah because he's not coming to a man for this.</v>

522
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.930
<v Speaker 6>You know he's coming to me so he's obviously attracted to women.</v>

523
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.690
<v Speaker 7>But you can go deep with this one.</v>

524
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:57.750
<v Speaker 11>Yeah I guess maybe he's attracted to women or maybe he's dated women before but</v>

525
00:22:58.091 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 11>always secretly wanted a man but knows that it would be humiliating so that he</v>

526
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:06.370
<v Speaker 11>gets his kink like pretending that you're going to expose him.</v>

527
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah I mean maybe like you said Chris Ryan was saying once an orientation and</v>

528
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:10.490
<v Speaker 4>one's a fetish.</v>

529
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.570
<v Speaker 4>So it's like yeah it's a fetish for women but he's really gay the other way</v>

530
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

531
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.950
<v Speaker 11>Didn't you have a situation where a guy like gave you his bank account number</v>

532
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:21.140
<v Speaker 11>and everything to and wanted you to pretend to steal money from now.</v>

533
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.570
<v Speaker 12>I get that thing all the time.</v>

534
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 12>That's a normal one.</v>

535
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

536
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.190
<v Speaker 3>Well that's that kind of gets into financial domination where oh that's a</v>

537
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:31.720
<v Speaker 3>financial domination issue.</v>

538
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

539
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I have learned all these terms.</v>

540
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

541
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:39.330
<v Speaker 4>Forced by financial domination financial domination is basically where guys</v>

542
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.190
<v Speaker 4>literally get off on giving a woman their money.</v>

543
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.680
<v Speaker 4>Like that's their king status.</v>

544
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 7>Like get off on giving money they get off on being blackmailed or being stolen</v>

545
00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:50.944
<v Speaker 7>from.</v>

546
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.570
<v Speaker 4>That can be part of the can but a lot of guys like I get a lot of guys just</v>

547
00:23:55.571 --> 00:24:00.460
<v Speaker 4>sending me money for no reason just like you got like and that's what they like</v>

548
00:24:00.461 --> 00:24:00.700
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>

549
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.360
<v Speaker 4>They like pleasing me they like sacrificing for me and that sort of thing.</v>

550
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.890
<v Speaker 4>And some guys kind of get more into the control aspect where they want to give</v>

551
00:24:08.891 --> 00:24:13.120
<v Speaker 4>me their bank account number or their credit card number and watch me like shop.</v>

552
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Credit card.</v>

553
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.480
<v Speaker 3>He put a GoPro on and go to the mall.</v>

554
00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.490
<v Speaker 3>No I usually do it online.</v>

555
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.520
<v Speaker 4>I did a a double Cam session with this girl one time and this guy put all his</v>

556
00:24:24.131 --> 00:24:28.780
<v Speaker 4>credit card information into this Saks Fifth Avenue website you know and then</v>

557
00:24:28.781 --> 00:24:33.781
<v Speaker 4>gave us the password and was like Go ahead shop and in an hour we spent ten</v>

558
00:24:33.791 --> 00:24:37.480
<v Speaker 4>thousand dollars of his money just like buying just stupid shit that ended up</v>

559
00:24:37.481 --> 00:24:38.280
<v Speaker 4>like reselling.</v>

560
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit about Slender handbags or anything like that but he liked</v>

561
00:24:42.101 --> 00:24:45.790
<v Speaker 4>the idea of these like bitchy kind of Paris Hilton type girls that would just</v>

562
00:24:45.791 --> 00:24:48.400
<v Speaker 4>laugh at him and just use them for his money.</v>

563
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:49.150
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

564
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:49.983
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

565
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:51.750
<v Speaker 6>How strange huh.</v>

566
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.433
<v Speaker 6>Poof.</v>

567
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.310
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting though that these guys at least have an outlet now like yeah.</v>

568
00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.680
<v Speaker 5>I know what they did before the Internet.</v>

569
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.070
<v Speaker 9>Do you think it is somehow the Internet because of the the access to people who</v>

570
00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:10.240
<v Speaker 9>are willing to do this that it sort of fosters this or helps it flourish.</v>

571
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.230
<v Speaker 9>Yeah I don't know.</v>

572
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:12.130
<v Speaker 4>I've thought about that.</v>

573
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:17.340
<v Speaker 4>I've wondered if these fetishes even really existed before or if you know yeah.</v>

574
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.230
<v Speaker 4>Now these guys just have an outlet.</v>

575
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.773
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

576
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.980
<v Speaker 9>Do you mind saying how much you make doing something like this or is this</v>

577
00:25:26.981 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 9>something you ought to keep to yourself.</v>

578
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:28.770
<v Speaker 9>Like you.</v>

579
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:29.740
<v Speaker 9>OK I understand.</v>

580
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:31.120
<v Speaker 9>Totally makes sense.</v>

581
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:35.290
<v Speaker 9>Especially we talking about twelve thousand dollars just in logs you start</v>

582
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:37.420
<v Speaker 9>getting toenails and bloggers and all that.</v>

583
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:38.463
<v Speaker 9>Who knows.</v>

584
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.400
<v Speaker 9>Sky's the limit.</v>

585
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.233
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

586
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:46.650
<v Speaker 9>Have you ever had someone that you did this with that like insisted on meeting</v>

587
00:25:46.841 --> 00:25:47.674
<v Speaker 9>you.</v>

588
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about insisted I I've certainly had guys like be really persistent.</v>

589
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.540
<v Speaker 4>But I mean the answer is just now.</v>

590
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.140
<v Speaker 9>I just thought of a guy I wanted to give you like a million dollars to shit on.</v>

591
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.090
<v Speaker 9>Oh I did that.</v>

592
00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.923
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

593
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.750
<v Speaker 5>No one's offered me quite that zero.</v>

594
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 5>But is there some other effort really.</v>

595
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.260
<v Speaker 9>But it's gonna be a guy out there that becomes obsessed with you and he's really</v>

596
00:26:08.261 --> 00:26:10.110
<v Speaker 9>wealthy and he's like it's worth it.</v>

597
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.123
<v Speaker 9>It's worth it.</v>

598
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:11.980
<v Speaker 9>It's worth it.</v>

599
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.950
<v Speaker 9>I film it for several camera angles.</v>

600
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.270
<v Speaker 9>Hire a professional crew.</v>

601
00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:18.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

602
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.280
<v Speaker 6>I haven't quite gotten that offer yet but so most most of time people are</v>

603
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:25.120
<v Speaker 6>content with the videos.</v>

604
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.080
<v Speaker 6>So yeah.</v>

605
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:26.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

606
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.370
<v Speaker 6>You seem to do pretty well.</v>

607
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.420
<v Speaker 6>How many of them have the average asked to meet you in person.</v>

608
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.823
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

609
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.570
<v Speaker 4>Pretty small percentage.</v>

610
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's hard to say like in terms of there's some guys I never talk to they</v>

611
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.880
<v Speaker 4>just buy my videos round and there's some guys who by Cam some guys by custom</v>

612
00:26:42.881 --> 00:26:43.720
<v Speaker 4>videos.</v>

613
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.310
<v Speaker 9>So your videos are for sale to the public.</v>

614
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.740
<v Speaker 9>Like they're never never free.</v>

615
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

616
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean unless someone pirate some.</v>

617
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.770
<v Speaker 4>But yeah.</v>

618
00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.603
<v Speaker 11>Oh OK.</v>

619
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.120
<v Speaker 11>So you have him on your Web site or something like that and then someone signs</v>

620
00:26:55.121 --> 00:26:56.410
<v Speaker 11>up with a credit card and.</v>

621
00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

622
00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.760
<v Speaker 4>So I have access.</v>

623
00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:58.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

624
00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.530
<v Speaker 4>So I like a a normal subscription Web site you know like any kind of porn</v>

625
00:27:02.531 --> 00:27:05.800
<v Speaker 4>website where you pay monthly and get somebody's video streaming.</v>

626
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.740
<v Speaker 4>Think like two or three hundred and then I have a few like pay per view sites</v>

627
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.020
<v Speaker 4>where guys can buy the videos individually.</v>

628
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.110
<v Speaker 6>And how much of your day is spent doing this stuff.</v>

629
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.333
<v Speaker 6>Mm hmm.</v>

630
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.560
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>

631
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.980
<v Speaker 4>I could have thought a lot and I wish someone could just like watch me and see</v>

632
00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:25.240
<v Speaker 4>when I'm working and when I'm not.</v>

633
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.260
<v Speaker 4>Cause you know when you work for yourself at home it's this blend of like</v>

634
00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:33.520
<v Speaker 4>working and then Facebook and then doing the dishes and then you know working</v>

635
00:27:33.521 --> 00:27:37.300
<v Speaker 4>and so it's it's hard for me to say how much or how much time I really spend</v>

636
00:27:37.301 --> 00:27:37.840
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>

637
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.710
<v Speaker 4>But I mean I put I try and put a lot of effort into it because like we're saying</v>

638
00:27:41.711 --> 00:27:43.830
<v Speaker 4>before it's not go last forever.</v>

639
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:44.763
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

640
00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.210
<v Speaker 4>And it seems quite lucrative.</v>

641
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah yeah.</v>

642
00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.410
<v Speaker 7>It's it's very strange.</v>

643
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.050
<v Speaker 7>How does your family know about this.</v>

644
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.943
<v Speaker 7>Yeah yeah.</v>

645
00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.570
<v Speaker 7>You said that with eyes wide open.</v>

646
00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.833
<v Speaker 8>I was raised.</v>

647
00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

648
00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:01.923
<v Speaker 4>No they know.</v>

649
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.333
<v Speaker 4>What do they think about it.</v>

650
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.620
<v Speaker 4>My mom and I don't really talk about it.</v>

651
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:12.030
<v Speaker 4>The last time we talked about it was the first time I told her I had that</v>

652
00:28:12.701 --> 00:28:13.570
<v Speaker 4>conversation go.</v>

653
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.920
<v Speaker 4>Well how did it is that my house and I knew like it was situations obviously I</v>

654
00:28:24.551 --> 00:28:28.840
<v Speaker 4>wasn't working at Starbucks you know because I was making good money.</v>

655
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.440
<v Speaker 4>I had a fairly nice apartment you know about a car and that sort of thing.</v>

656
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.100
<v Speaker 4>So it was like I knew she knew something was up and so I just figured I might as</v>

657
00:28:36.101 --> 00:28:36.934
<v Speaker 4>well tell her.</v>

658
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.393
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

659
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.710
<v Speaker 4>her response was I think she just kind of nodded and was like OK.</v>

660
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.970
<v Speaker 4>And then I just assured her I was like You know I'm really happy and I'm safe</v>

661
00:28:46.971 --> 00:28:48.290
<v Speaker 4>and you know you don't need to worry.</v>

662
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.120
<v Speaker 4>And that was it.</v>

663
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.460
<v Speaker 4>She's got a reserved private person.</v>

664
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.910
<v Speaker 4>So I think you know it just kinda makes her uncomfortable to talk about it.</v>

665
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.350
<v Speaker 4>So yeah we don't need to.</v>

666
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.680
<v Speaker 4>My dad thinks it's awesome.</v>

667
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.150
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

668
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:01.983
<v Speaker 4>Well so.</v>

669
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.050

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:06.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

671
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.330
<v Speaker 6>My dad thinks it's really cool.</v>

672
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.620
<v Speaker 6>Your dad thinks it's cool.</v>

673
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.513

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:11.920

676
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.040
<v Speaker 6>Well I think he was just very surprised.</v>

677
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:20.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean the same situation like he knew something was up and unlike my mom he</v>

678
00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:24.890
<v Speaker 4>would make comments alluding to the fact that he knew something was up but</v>

679
00:29:24.891 --> 00:29:28.910
<v Speaker 4>wasn't like Western Conference because well like I said like you know how does</v>

680
00:29:28.911 --> 00:29:30.100
<v Speaker 4>one breach the subject.</v>

681
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Well I know you're shitting in buckets kid.</v>

682
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.273
<v Speaker 3>I know it.</v>

683
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.880
<v Speaker 4>Well I think he thought it was something like prostitute unquote.</v>

684
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah I think he thought something maybe worse than it was like Gallegos and he</v>

685
00:29:39.981 --> 00:29:40.880
<v Speaker 4>was alluding to that.</v>

686
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.320
<v Speaker 4>Well no he like.</v>

687
00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.570
<v Speaker 4>Like I got like about a car you know.</v>

688
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.130
<v Speaker 4>And I was told him as working at Starbucks and he just was like wow kiddo</v>

689
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Starbucks is really paying you a lot.</v>

690
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.560
<v Speaker 4>You know like comments like that.</v>

691
00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.200
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm not buying this but whatever.</v>

692
00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 4>And then when I finally told on it he said like he kind of like stopped me at</v>

693
00:30:00.351 --> 00:30:00.890
<v Speaker 4>one point.</v>

694
00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.790
<v Speaker 4>He was just like you know I don't know what's going on in your life but I just</v>

697
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.630
<v Speaker 4>And I was like all right I should just tell him because he obviously something</v>

698
00:30:14.631 --> 00:30:17.000
<v Speaker 4>else is going on his head that's way worse than it is.</v>

714
00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 6>I guess you have to be if you're gay.</v>

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.860
<v Speaker 6>How did you when did he come out to me I was 12 years old.</v>

717
00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:05.790
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

718
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.063
<v Speaker 12>What about your mom.</v>

719
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:09.923
<v Speaker 12>We're 20</v>

720
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.060
<v Speaker 12>now my parents have been divorced for like five years.</v>

721
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:19.120
<v Speaker 4>But at that point but we grow up very religious who grow up Jehovah Witness</v>

722
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:23.730
<v Speaker 4>actually so they marry young and have kids pretty young.</v>

723
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:24.060
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

724
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.880
<v Speaker 9>I was going to be one next question about how many of these guys that you you</v>

725
00:31:28.881 --> 00:31:30.620
<v Speaker 9>deal with are religious.</v>

726
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.750
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

727
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:35.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

728
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:39.050
<v Speaker 4>You know I don't necessarily take polls but there are some guys that like to be</v>

729
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:44.560
<v Speaker 4>humiliated for their religion one religion and in particular that I'd rather not</v>

730
00:31:44.841 --> 00:31:45.680
<v Speaker 4>mention publicly.</v>

731
00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.910
<v Speaker 4>But I'd rather not mention it they're too obvious.</v>

732
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah a little fanatical Islam.</v>

733
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.870
<v Speaker 4>And to.</v>

735
00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:55.883
<v Speaker 9>I mean you mentioned it.</v>

736
00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:02.020
<v Speaker 9>So there's a guy who is a Muslim who buys your videos must be humiliated for his</v>

737
00:32:03.141 --> 00:32:03.650
<v Speaker 9>religion.</v>

738

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

739
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.550
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

740
00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:05.530
<v Speaker 4>And there's guys that will.</v>

741
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't do this because I'm not touching on a 10 foot pole but there are guys</v>

742
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:13.271
<v Speaker 4>that will pay girls to like piss on the Koran and they're not Jesus Christ.</v>

770
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.450
<v Speaker 9>Hmm.</v>

771
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.490
<v Speaker 9>What a weird place to find yourself in.</v>

772
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

773
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.630
<v Speaker 9>Trapped in this or not trapped but just in this world.</v>

774
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.720
<v Speaker 9>Yeah a strange world of people strange fetishes and ideas and yeah kinks.</v>

775
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:23.120
<v Speaker 9>Does it make you like look I mean you must look at people so so much different</v>

776
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:28.010
<v Speaker 9>than most other young girls that like go walking down the street in Portland you</v>

777
00:33:28.011 --> 00:33:33.011
<v Speaker 9>see people you don't I mean you've seen the man behind the curtain so many these</v>

778
00:33:33.381 --> 00:33:33.920
<v Speaker 9>freaks.</v>

779
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah well nothing really surprises me you know and I find that a lot of guys I</v>

780
00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:41.370
<v Speaker 4>guess because I do what I do.</v>

781
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Like what is will tell me what they're into.</v>

782
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.610
<v Speaker 4>Just like just very openly about it.</v>

783
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:52.280
<v Speaker 4>Just because they know I'm you're not jaded as the right word but I was so</v>

784
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 4>accustomed to hearing like the weirdest shit.</v>

785
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 4>Nothing really surprises me.</v>

786
00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people get paranoid that I assume they're into something weird</v>

787
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.893
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of guys like.</v>

788
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's always intrigued by what I do and I tell them there's like wow.</v>

789
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.380
<v Speaker 4>And if it's a guy they're always like you know they start asking questions but</v>

790
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 4>then they backpedal and just be like I'm not into this sort of thing.</v>

791
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.460
<v Speaker 16>I just think it's that just dig it.</v>

792
00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:17.420
<v Speaker 16>It's like well I didn't think you were until you said Is it weird with dating</v>

793
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 16>and dating hasn't been a problem.</v>

794
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.270
<v Speaker 4>I've had it say three serious relationships.</v>

795
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:27.830
<v Speaker 7>I see that is right there the difference between men and women.</v>

796
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah right there in a nutshell that you say oh sorry it hasn't really been a</v>

797
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:33.140
<v Speaker 7>problem.</v>

798
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 7>You know why.</v>

799
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.450
<v Speaker 8>Because you're a pretty young girl so pretty young girls you guys like OK</v>

800
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:42.640
<v Speaker 8>whatever you do you shit in a bucket whatever we're gonna fuck yeah I can deal</v>

801
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:44.054
<v Speaker 8>with that.</v>

802
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.080
<v Speaker 8>But if you know but if a girl met a guy and the girls like what do you do for a</v>

803
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:54.180
<v Speaker 8>living is like well I take shits and bucket said I'm a dude.</v>

807
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.460
<v Speaker 7>What do you do.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

811
00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:14.060
<v Speaker 7>And that's I think you probably guys would assume oh she's a freak.</v>

812
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:14.570
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah that's a difference few men and women.</v>

817
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.180
<v Speaker 7>Men will tolerate so much more bizarre shit.</v>

818
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah lot girls want to date like a stripper necessarily.</v>

819
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.400
<v Speaker 4>Like they get jealous and that's a little different.</v>

820
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.270
<v Speaker 9>That's different because it's what you know.</v>

821
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.630
<v Speaker 9>Or a porn star certainly.</v>

822
00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:37.643
<v Speaker 9>Would be really hard.</v>

823
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:38.840

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.330
<v Speaker 9>Just he couldn't do it anymore.</v>

842
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.733

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.780
<v Speaker 9>Just her job man just her job dude.</v>

848
00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.550

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.310
<v Speaker 9>And he looked at the contract and he's like.</v>

851
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.490
<v Speaker 9>Was airtight mean.</v>

852
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:48.470
<v Speaker 9>I know their timing airtight means a dick in every hole in the mouth one but one</v>

853
00:36:48.471 --> 00:36:50.000
<v Speaker 9>the veg and I like submarine.</v>

854
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.160
<v Speaker 9>And he was like That's it I'm out.</v>

855
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.030
<v Speaker 9>That was it.</v>

856
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.210
<v Speaker 9>The phrase air tight on a contract.</v>

857
00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.560
<v Speaker 9>He just realized what he was getting into it wasn't that his girlfriend was</v>

858
00:37:00.561 --> 00:37:02.630
<v Speaker 9>going off and having sex with another man.</v>

859
00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.630
<v Speaker 9>She was getting three men stuffed.</v>

860
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.410
<v Speaker 9>Now she's getting brutalized.</v>

861
00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Mm hmm.</v>

862
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:07.933
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

863
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're okay with her your lady you know having sex with other men.</v>

864
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.853
<v Speaker 4>Like what.</v>

865
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:17.780
<v Speaker 4>How do additional dicks really make a difference to him it was just the straw</v>

866
00:37:17.781 --> 00:37:18.950
<v Speaker 4>that broke the camel's back.</v>

867
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:19.670
<v Speaker 9>I know.</v>

868
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.580
<v Speaker 9>I mean I think he's probably close to not being able to take it anyway.</v>

869
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.970
<v Speaker 9>You know sometimes people get into things like it's not I it's not what they</v>

870
00:37:25.971 --> 00:37:26.740
<v Speaker 9>want right.</v>

871
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.260
<v Speaker 9>But the girl is so much prettier than most girls they get so much hotter.</v>

872
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:35.270
<v Speaker 9>Yeah like I have a friend who's another one a different dude who has been living</v>

873
00:37:35.271 --> 00:37:36.810
<v Speaker 9>with the porn star for a long time.</v>

874
00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.020
<v Speaker 9>Yeah and then she retired recently.</v>

875
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.030
<v Speaker 9>She just does like videos and stuff.</v>

876
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:45.350
<v Speaker 9>But the whole time where they were together she was just getting gorilla fucked.</v>

877
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.210
<v Speaker 9>Yeah like four or five days a week.</v>

878
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.560
<v Speaker 9>And he's like this really nerdy.</v>

879
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.900
<v Speaker 9>Sort of like low key quiet guy.</v>

880
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.003
<v Speaker 9>And she's pretty hot.</v>

881
00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:55.400
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

882
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.970
<v Speaker 9>And it's like the only way he's ever gonna get that kind of a girl.</v>

883
00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:03.420
<v Speaker 9>And I guess in him she finds stability.</v>

884
00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:03.980
<v Speaker 9>Sure.</v>

885
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.980
<v Speaker 9>And a nice a meet someone who's kind and you know and then she goes off and</v>

886
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:10.613
<v Speaker 9>gorilla fucked.</v>

887
00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:11.493
<v Speaker 9>Mm hmm.</v>

888
00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.740
<v Speaker 9>Oh yeah.</v>

889
00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:13.100
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

890
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:13.640
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

891
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.200
<v Speaker 9>That's really what it's all about.</v>

892
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.330
<v Speaker 9>Like if it were who at the end of the day.</v>

893
00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.220
<v Speaker 9>The real problem is our attitudes about sex that's at the end of the day.</v>

894
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:26.090
<v Speaker 9>That's where that's the only place it becomes a problem because if you're off</v>

895
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:30.500
<v Speaker 9>getting mass massaged nobody cares if you go someplace and three people massage</v>

896
00:38:30.501 --> 00:38:30.830
<v Speaker 9>you.</v>

897
00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.520
<v Speaker 9>Nobody gives a shit.</v>

898
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.340
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

899
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.850
<v Speaker 9>But if three people fuck you then we're like hey.</v>

900
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:36.590
<v Speaker 9>You're breaking the rules.</v>

901
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.483
<v Speaker 9>Yeah you know.</v>

902
00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah that's really like in the porn industry.</v>

903
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:41.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're getting tested every week.</v>

904
00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.990
<v Speaker 4>So you know it's it's kind of hard to make the excuse that you know it's more</v>

905
00:38:44.991 --> 00:38:49.210
<v Speaker 4>dangerous for your health because I think I think their population is actually</v>

906
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:50.044
<v Speaker 4>like it.</v>

907
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.970
<v Speaker 4>There's less instances of US studios than the general population are promiscuous</v>

908
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:56.650
<v Speaker 4>people and the general population.</v>

909
00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.560
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense.</v>

910
00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah kind of makes sense because we have to like how many people do you know get</v>

911
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:01.060
<v Speaker 6>tested every week.</v>

912
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.290
<v Speaker 9>You know Jamie Jamie is three times a week.</v>

913
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.333
<v Speaker 9>Fuck yeah.</v>

914
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.070
<v Speaker 9>Using my fork he's just paranoid.</v>

915
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:07.923
<v Speaker 9>No I'm just kidding.</v>

916
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Speaker 9>But yeah I would always think that.</v>

917
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 9>Well if she gets tested on Friday then we bang on the next following Thursday.</v>

918
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:18.990
<v Speaker 9>Who knows how many dicks have been around since then infected Charlie Sheen.</v>

919
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.490
<v Speaker 9>You know that's what could happen.</v>

920
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:22.773
<v Speaker 9>Poor Charlie.</v>

921
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.873
<v Speaker 9>Who saw that coming.</v>

922
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.850
<v Speaker 9>Yeah no kidding.</v>

923
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:25.683
<v Speaker 9>Crazy Charlie.</v>

924
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:26.800
<v Speaker 9>Isn't that interesting Charlie.</v>

925
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.200
<v Speaker 5>For a guy is such a victim.</v>

926
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.660
<v Speaker 9>He is a victim.</v>

927
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.170
<v Speaker 9>He's a victim of circumstance.</v>

928
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.760
<v Speaker 9>The crack in the dick were in the same room at the same time.</v>

930
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:41.783
<v Speaker 9>puns.</v>

931
00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:42.813
<v Speaker 9>Do you.</v>

932
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.170

936
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.050
<v Speaker 9>You know you're just off the fucking rails right.</v>

937
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.350
<v Speaker 9>Yeah just bisexual could be just needed.</v>

938
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.450
<v Speaker 9>Well there was a story a long time ago about a quarry game.</v>

939
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.690
<v Speaker 9>So it was Corey had Corey Feldman apparently said that Corey Haim got fucked by</v>

940
00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:10.120
<v Speaker 9>Charles she sort of alluded to it.</v>

941
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.880
<v Speaker 9>Like when they were when Corey Haim was really young.</v>

942
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.520

948
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.660
<v Speaker 6>We were surprised that Charlie Sheen got it.</v>

<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

<v Speaker 4>awful person like.</v>

962
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.500
<v Speaker 11>Well at one point in time what he did was the unthinkable because he was a</v>

963
00:40:47.501 --> 00:40:48.980
<v Speaker 11>superstar right.</v>

964
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:52.660
<v Speaker 11>Two and a half men giant sit com on the biggest it comes in the country.</v>

965
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.480
<v Speaker 11>He had been in Platoon and Wall Street.</v>

966
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 11>He was Michael Douglas's son.</v>

967
00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:01.330
<v Speaker 11>I mean it is Jesus or Martin Sheen son Michael Douglas playing.</v>

968
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.373
<v Speaker 5>They were different names.</v>

969
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.770
<v Speaker 5>I forget what I'm talking about when he had that like tiger blood meltdown.</v>

970
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.170
<v Speaker 5>Everyone thought it was so funny.</v>

971
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.300
<v Speaker 5>But it's like it's like he has kids.</v>

972
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:14.560
<v Speaker 9>Yeah but that's because he was doing the unthinkable he was owning it.</v>

973
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.860
<v Speaker 9>And in this country what we hate is when someone gets busted doing something and</v>

974
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.090
<v Speaker 9>tries and they go to rehab.</v>

975
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.103
<v Speaker 9>Yeah you know.</v>

976
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.060
<v Speaker 12>God forbid you know like you get a quitter</v>

977
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 12>no matter what you do.</v>

978
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:34.540
<v Speaker 9>You could get busted doing anything you know like Mel Gibson went to rehab</v>

979
00:41:34.541 --> 00:41:38.560
<v Speaker 9>because he was yelling at a Jew when he got pulled over who's yelling the cop</v>

980
00:41:38.561 --> 00:41:42.880
<v Speaker 9>calling him a Jew and he's like I got to go to rehab for hate and Jews like you</v>

981
00:41:42.881 --> 00:41:46.230
<v Speaker 9>went to rehab didn't go to rehab for that he did right.</v>

982
00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.213
<v Speaker 12>Yes you're hurting me.</v>

983
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.980
<v Speaker 9>Yeah I think they have a Jew hating rehab cop.</v>

984
00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:53.290
<v Speaker 9>I don't think the cop was even Jewish I was just drunk and crazy but it's like</v>

985
00:41:53.291 --> 00:41:53.920
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>

986
00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.920
<v Speaker 9>That's what led him like you gotta you gotta make amends.</v>

987
00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.620
<v Speaker 9>You gotta find something to get pulled together.</v>

988
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:01.120
<v Speaker 9>Gotta go to rehab to pull together.</v>

989
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.210
<v Speaker 9>That's the move in this country we demand that you go to rehab.</v>

990
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.810
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

991
00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.580
<v Speaker 9>We can't even do the kind of rehab at home.</v>

992
00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:07.600
<v Speaker 9>No not good enough.</v>

993
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:08.770
<v Speaker 9>Yeah I'm gonna go there.</v>

994
00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.600
<v Speaker 4>Like if you cheat on your wife.</v>

995
00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:11.770
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm a sex addict.</v>

996
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:12.973
<v Speaker 4>Gotta go to rehab.</v>

997
00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:15.143
<v Speaker 12>It a go.</v>

998
00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.920
<v Speaker 5>Powerful and I have all this money and women will fuck me and nope.</v>

999
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:18.580
<v Speaker 9>No.</v>

1000
00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:19.413
<v Speaker 9>Rehab addiction.</v>

1001
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.810
<v Speaker 9>Got it.</v>

1002
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:20.620
<v Speaker 9>Got a problem.</v>

1003
00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 9>Got a sickness got illness.</v>

1004
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:22.743
<v Speaker 9>Gotta go to rehab.</v>

1005
00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.190
<v Speaker 9>That's what it's like an Amy Winehouse song would make people go to rehab.</v>

1006
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.960
<v Speaker 9>Yeah well rehab is a fact.</v>

1007
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.190
<v Speaker 9>When did they invent rehab.</v>

1008
00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.053
<v Speaker 9>I really want to know.</v>

1009
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.870
<v Speaker 9>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

1010
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:32.703
<v Speaker 9>And.</v>

1011
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:33.873
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't.</v>

1012
00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Betty Ford wasn't I don't know.</v>

1013
00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.630
<v Speaker 4>She didn't she's the Betty Ford Clinic.</v>

1014
00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:39.483
<v Speaker 4>Was that the first one.</v>

1015
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:40.480
<v Speaker 9>Good question.</v>

1016
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.350
<v Speaker 9>I think you might have nailed it.</v>

1017
00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.890
<v Speaker 9>That might be it because that was what it used to be when I was a kid.</v>

1018
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.810
<v Speaker 9>It was always oh you went to Betty Ford.</v>

1019
00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:47.410
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:51.310
<v Speaker 9>I was like what you would say when someone had fucked up and just completely</v>

1021
00:42:51.311 --> 00:42:52.360
<v Speaker 9>blown it right.</v>

1022
00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.353
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:42:55.660 --> 00:43:00.160
<v Speaker 11>Do you ever get dudes that are former sex addicts like they have gone to sex</v>

1024
00:43:00.161 --> 00:43:04.240
<v Speaker 11>rehab and they've had counselors tell them that they need to stop and</v>

1025
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:07.780
<v Speaker 11>I don't know but I'm sure I have.</v>

1026
00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.770
<v Speaker 4>I've never talked about it talked to any guys about specifically but there is</v>

1027
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.900
<v Speaker 4>definitely a certain percentage of guys that think they are like addicted to me</v>

1028
00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.600
<v Speaker 4>and it could be kind of confusing because I think sometimes that's part of the</v>

1029
00:43:19.601 --> 00:43:21.310
<v Speaker 4>fantasy is that they're addicted to me.</v>

1030
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.760
<v Speaker 4>But there are some guys that legitimately have a problem with their spending and</v>

1031
00:43:28.001 --> 00:43:33.001
<v Speaker 4>their drug off habits and just how much this fetish world kind of consumes them.</v>

1032
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.890
<v Speaker 4>And they may make poor decisions and like especially if you get into the whole</v>

1033
00:43:38.891 --> 00:43:43.090
<v Speaker 4>like blackmail exposure fetish like oh yeah I had a guy one time</v>

1034
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.120
<v Speaker 4>I really felt bad for him actually.</v>

1035
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.140
<v Speaker 4>Nice guy weed cam.</v>

1036
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:53.190
<v Speaker 4>And like he would dress up you know and women's clothing like and not like</v>

1037
00:43:53.201 --> 00:43:58.201
<v Speaker 4>classic clothing just like outrageous kind of bimbo like tutus and just crazy</v>

1038
00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.370
<v Speaker 4>slutty makeup and then he would get a bunch of used condoms and put them in his</v>

1039
00:44:03.371 --> 00:44:08.371
<v Speaker 4>mouth oh shit and then take pictures and he would and he would want me to like</v>

1040
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.730
<v Speaker 4>you know pretend to blackmail him and threaten to send him and he would give me</v>

1041
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.760
<v Speaker 4>you'd give me like real people's like email address like ex-girlfriends and</v>

1042
00:44:17.861 --> 00:44:19.930
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that already are you.</v>

1043
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.810
<v Speaker 4>He was also one of the guys that would laugh when we make a video and release</v>

1044
00:44:22.811 --> 00:44:23.020
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1045
00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.620
<v Speaker 4>And so he didn't pay me a lot of money to make a video and release it.</v>

1046
00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:31.480
<v Speaker 2>And then like a week or so later I got an email from</v>

1047
00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.820
<v Speaker 2>a dominatrix that he saw in person and it was like a really serious e-mail and</v>

1048
00:44:36.821 --> 00:44:41.821
<v Speaker 2>she was just like hey you know I know you made this video for for this guy and I</v>

1049
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.980
<v Speaker 2>was you know I just want you to know that he really struggles with this fetish</v>

1050
00:44:44.981 --> 00:44:49.420
<v Speaker 2>and he's he's kind of suicidal and he's really freaking out about you know that</v>

1051
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:52.480
<v Speaker 2>you put this up even though he asked you to do it and I just want to kind of</v>

1052
00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.510
<v Speaker 2>reach out to you and ask if you would consider taking it down.</v>

1053
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.130
<v Speaker 2>And so I did.</v>

1054
00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:57.963
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>

1055
00:44:59.010 --> 00:44:59.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:01.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean give me a match.</v>

1057
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you're into Joe but like imagine like whatever you're into</v>

1058
00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:07.600
<v Speaker 4>sexually and of it like that feeling you get were almost not quite</v>

1059
00:45:07.601 --> 00:45:10.580
<v Speaker 4>uncontrollable but it just kind of where you lose it a little bit sexually.</v>

1060
00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.890
<v Speaker 4>Because you're just so like intoxicated.</v>

1061
00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:17.940
<v Speaker 4>Like that feeling for you know being exposed in this way where there's condoms</v>

1062
00:45:19.841 --> 00:45:22.660
<v Speaker 4>in your mouth and you're like dressed as a woman and stuff like that and then</v>

1063
00:45:22.661 --> 00:45:24.280
<v Speaker 4>you come and you're like Oh fuck what an I.</v>

1064
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:30.490
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys like really struggle with that where they get their their desire</v>

1065
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.720
<v Speaker 4>comes from this place of just something they actually really do not one really</v>

1066
00:45:34.721 --> 00:45:38.710
<v Speaker 4>like scares them and figure them out like it's just sex just so that's so</v>

1067
00:45:38.711 --> 00:45:43.711
<v Speaker 4>strange to have the the two contrasting sides sort of right next to each other.</v>

1068
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:44.830
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:46.480
<v Speaker 7>Pre and Post orgasm.</v>

1070
00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:47.020
<v Speaker 16>Right.</v>

1071
00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.890
<v Speaker 16>Why I feel like we all maybe kind of share that a little bit girls too.</v>

1072
00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.203
<v Speaker 16>Well I mean.</v>

1073
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:56.740
<v Speaker 16>Well I mean just the idea that I mean sex just normal sex is kind of weird and</v>

1074
00:45:56.741 --> 00:45:57.370
<v Speaker 16>kind of gross.</v>

1075
00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:01.450
<v Speaker 14>If you're not turned on you know like or like if you're like watching normal</v>

1076
00:46:01.451 --> 00:46:05.260
<v Speaker 14>porn like it looks really awesome and feels great when you're aroused and then</v>

1077
00:46:05.261 --> 00:46:06.340
<v Speaker 14>you comments like you.</v>

1078
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.493
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1079
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.350
<v Speaker 4>Who was I.</v>

1080
00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:09.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like going together you know.</v>

1081
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:10.203
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1082
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:13.370
<v Speaker 4>And that's just maybe two very lower degree.</v>

1083
00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.440
<v Speaker 4>But yeah you go into these weird fetishes and that difference is much more</v>

1084
00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:18.250
<v Speaker 4>defined.</v>

1085
00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.410
<v Speaker 7>Well there's definitely a difference when you're there.</v>

1086
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.070
<v Speaker 7>You know there's definitely a difference.</v>

1087
00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:27.090
<v Speaker 7>Like if having actual sex with someone and being aroused and then what it must</v>

1088
00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.260
<v Speaker 7>appear if you weren't horny at all.</v>

1089
00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:29.660
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.040
<v Speaker 7>You know.</v>

1091
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:30.340
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.050
<v Speaker 7>Especially if you look gross naked.</v>

1093
00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:32.560
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1094
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.180
<v Speaker 7>You know people look gross naked then and get fucked they just.</v>

1095
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:38.260
<v Speaker 7>And then when it's over the like Oh yeah.</v>

1096
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:41.740
<v Speaker 7>You look at it all and you like what the fuck am I what am I doing what is this.</v>

1097
00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:47.070
<v Speaker 7>What is this weird urge that your body's natural reward system sort of been</v>

1098
00:46:47.591 --> 00:46:48.550
<v Speaker 7>hijacked.</v>

1099
00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.060
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:53.650
<v Speaker 7>Just to get you to come in someone's mouth and then what is this.</v>

1101
00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:55.450
<v Speaker 7>Like what is going on here.</v>

1102
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:57.940
<v Speaker 4>And especially if you're a guy it's like it seems like you're here.</v>

1103
00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:01.350
<v Speaker 4>It was like cognitively impaired and your priorities are just almost yeah.</v>

1104
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:06.280
<v Speaker 7>You're 100 percent driving nice the way I've described it is like when a guy has</v>

1105
00:47:06.281 --> 00:47:10.450
<v Speaker 7>an erection it's like sitting in the backseat of a really long bus or some other</v>

1106
00:47:10.451 --> 00:47:13.360
<v Speaker 7>dude's driving but it's hard to talk to him because all the windows are rolled</v>

1107
00:47:13.361 --> 00:47:16.780
<v Speaker 7>down and the engine is really loud and you yell and you know where the fuck</v>

1108
00:47:16.781 --> 00:47:20.380
<v Speaker 7>you're going you're watching your life take place through a dirty windshield.</v>

1109
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.090
<v Speaker 7>Like where are we going.</v>

1110
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.920
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>

1111
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.250
<v Speaker 7>Is this so true.</v>

1112
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:28.420
<v Speaker 7>And then once you have an orgasm all the sudden when the clouds of confusion</v>

1113
00:47:28.421 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 7>part you wake up and you're at the front of the bus holding out the wheel.</v>

1114
00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:31.520
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.190
<v Speaker 7>I mean like what the heck is going on here.</v>

1116
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 7>That's literally what it feels like.</v>

1117
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:35.650
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.483
<v Speaker 7>To a guy.</v>

1119
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.700
<v Speaker 1>But that's how that's how there's 7 billion people on the planet like that.</v>

1120
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.720
<v Speaker 1>That switch that goes off where massive impairment of function of the thought.</v>

1121
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it just gets shot down all those fused you start blowing off circuits start</v>

1122
00:47:52.251 --> 00:47:53.084
<v Speaker 1>shutting off.</v>

1123
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 1>That's how people made sure the 7 billion people on the planet.</v>

1124
00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it's true.</v>

1125
00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Especially back when people had never figured out soap or wiping or anything.</v>

1126
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows what people smelled like 200 thousand years ago but there were</v>

1127
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:10.840
<v Speaker 1>people two hundred thousand years ago and they were having sex with each other.</v>

1128
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.340
<v Speaker 7>You got those pheromones going now.</v>

1129
00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 7>I mean barely.</v>

1130
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.280
<v Speaker 7>Probably puts you over the top barely allows you to.</v>

1131
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:22.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean the guys that we on by my underwear I wear it for a day but they want me</v>

1132
00:48:22.091 --> 00:48:22.960
<v Speaker 4>to wear it for a week.</v>

1133
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.140
<v Speaker 6>Do you lie and say Don't don't say no I don't.</v>

1134
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:27.243
<v Speaker 6>Of course you don't know.</v>

1135
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.840
<v Speaker 6>Did they ask you to do things in the underwear like fart.</v>

1136
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1137
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:33.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah I get that shit.</v>

1138
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:35.400
<v Speaker 6>Oh Jesus.</v>

1139
00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.233
<v Speaker 6>And masturbate.</v>

1140
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:41.710
<v Speaker 6>And anything that can secrete off my body if someone wants to know wants to eat.</v>

1141
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.780
<v Speaker 6>Oh God</v>

1142
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.620
<v Speaker 6>is there ever anything that people have asked you to do.</v>

1143
00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:48.473
<v Speaker 6>And he said no.</v>

1144
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:50.803
<v Speaker 6>Meet them.</v>

1145
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:51.783
<v Speaker 4>Yeah sure.</v>

1146
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:57.540
<v Speaker 4>Well because I'm kind of you know I'm always in control and like the female Dom</v>

1147
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 4>I won't do anything that depicts me as submissive.</v>

1148
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't get naked.</v>

1149
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:03.760
<v Speaker 4>I get pretty close.</v>

1150
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.810
<v Speaker 4>I get pretty scantily clad but I don't get completely naked.</v>

1151
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:11.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 4>That's that's about it.</v>

1154
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.550
<v Speaker 4>If it's I mean if it's a video that I can just do.</v>

1155
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.450
<v Speaker 4>Just me and the camera and I'm in control.</v>

1156
00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.413
<v Speaker 4>I'll probably do it.</v>

1157
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:25.000
<v Speaker 9>I have guys ever tried to get you to not be in control of guys ever tried to</v>

1158
00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:26.110
<v Speaker 9>switch it around on you.</v>

1159
00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:27.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:27.870
<v Speaker 4>Pretty rarely though.</v>

1161
00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.100
<v Speaker 4>I think most guys kind of get Yeah.</v>

1162
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:34.290
<v Speaker 4>They know what I'm about so they know it's kind of a lost cause to try otherwise</v>

1163
00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 4>but once in a while they know what you're about that's Larry cause you got a</v>

1164
00:49:38.111 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 4>reputation in the humiliation world.</v>

1165
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:40.803
<v Speaker 9>Exactly.</v>

1166
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:44.700
<v Speaker 9>So fucking strange.</v>

1167
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.660
<v Speaker 9>It's a strange existence.</v>

1168
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:51.690
<v Speaker 9>It really is fucking weird but it seems like it's a flourishing existence.</v>

1169
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.110
<v Speaker 9>That's what's strange about it is that there's obviously a certain percentage of</v>

1170
00:49:56.111 --> 00:49:59.720
<v Speaker 9>the population that wants to service yeah yeah.</v>

1171
00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.800
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like because I know I haven't been in the porn industry and it</v>

1172
00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:09.060
<v Speaker 4>seems like mainstream porn is losing a lot of money with piracy and whatnot.</v>

1173
00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:14.130
<v Speaker 9>I mean I'm sure they're still doing pretty well but they've lost most of it it's</v>

1174
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.030
<v Speaker 9>been the bottom's dropped out of it.</v>

1175
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:19.940
<v Speaker 9>The point where they make money now ironically is it really.</v>

1176
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.060
<v Speaker 9>Yeah that's where they make money.</v>

1177
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.510
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:23.343
<v Speaker 9>It's kind of funny.</v>

1179
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:24.970
<v Speaker 9>Thing that's ironic really.</v>

1180
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.640
<v Speaker 9>It's like Alanis Morissette Ironic.</v>

1181
00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.353
<v Speaker 9>It's odd.</v>

1182
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:32.380
<v Speaker 9>Yeah that's where the money coming in gets that necessary pay per view to pay</v>

1183
00:50:32.381 --> 00:50:33.610
<v Speaker 9>per view in hotels.</v>

1184
00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:36.700
<v Speaker 9>Yeah but who the fuck doesn't have a laptop like who's doing them.</v>

1185
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:41.790
<v Speaker 9>It's so like I've seen people even say like hey don't go to these free sites you</v>

1186
00:50:42.701 --> 00:50:46.600
<v Speaker 9>know you should support your local your performers and you know buy porn but</v>

1187
00:50:46.601 --> 00:50:48.690
<v Speaker 9>most people like whatever you know.</v>

1188
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:49.690
<v Speaker 9>Most people don't care.</v>

1189
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:54.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah it's business but I see a lot of like former mainstream porn girls like</v>

1190
00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:57.820
<v Speaker 4>doing what I do now.</v>

1191
00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.090
<v Speaker 4>So it kind seems like it's kind of the new thing.</v>

1192
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:04.660
<v Speaker 4>And there's something to be said about the more personal interaction and the</v>

1193
00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:06.050
<v Speaker 4>fact that there's no middle man.</v>

1194
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.210
<v Speaker 4>It's just it's me you know.</v>

1195
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:10.420
<v Speaker 6>When you email me you get me and write and control too.</v>

1196
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1197
00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.970
<v Speaker 6>Also that you don't have to worry about it.</v>

1198
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:16.990
<v Speaker 6>You know that's that's got to be a big aspect of it.</v>

1200
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:22.230
<v Speaker 11>Because if you're doing films and then you know you don't get to I guess maybe</v>

1201
00:51:22.231 --> 00:51:26.380
<v Speaker 11>you decide if you have that kind of power who you have sex with or what you do.</v>

1202
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:28.110
<v Speaker 11>But if you want to make more money right.</v>

1203
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.950
<v Speaker 11>To do other stuff you know.</v>

1204
00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah it's got to be tricky.</v>

1205
00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah totally.</v>

1206
00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:34.623
<v Speaker 4>Yeah I might.</v>

1207
00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't do anything I don't I do.</v>

1208
00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:36.663
<v Speaker 4>So that's pretty sweet.</v>

1209
00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.660
<v Speaker 11>Yeah I think in that sense the like the porn business is probably going to go</v>

1210
00:51:40.661 --> 00:51:42.460
<v Speaker 11>sort of the way of the record business in that.</v>

1211
00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:46.450
<v Speaker 11>Like the record business was controlled by these big groups and they're kind of</v>

1212
00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.630
<v Speaker 11>they're worthless now because no one's selling records anymore.</v>

1213
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.080
<v Speaker 11>And sort of the porn business was like this big thing where like all these guys</v>

1214
00:51:54.081 --> 00:51:57.580
<v Speaker 11>who are the producers and the content creators like these companies these big</v>

1215
00:51:57.581 --> 00:52:00.220
<v Speaker 11>companies they were making millions and millions of dollars and the girls made</v>

1216
00:52:00.221 --> 00:52:00.880
<v Speaker 11>some money.</v>

1217
00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.350
<v Speaker 11>Yeah but they didn't make the bulk of the money.</v>

1218
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.080
<v Speaker 11>They were the ones that everybody was paying to see but most the money was being</v>

1219
00:52:05.081 --> 00:52:06.040
<v Speaker 11>made by the producers.</v>

1220
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.660
<v Speaker 11>Well that's fucking dried up and now the girls are kind of owning it themselves</v>

1221
00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:12.430
<v Speaker 11>now doing stuff like what you're doing.</v>

1222
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:17.470
<v Speaker 11>Yeah and like a lot of the other one I see like different people on Twitter they</v>

1223
00:52:17.471 --> 00:52:21.160
<v Speaker 11>offer like videos and stuff like private videos they'll do with people.</v>

1224
00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:21.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1226
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:26.770
<v Speaker 4>And I think I mean if a guy is even the slightest bit fanboy ish they like that</v>

1227
00:52:26.771 --> 00:52:29.350

<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1250

<v Speaker 4>You're probably right.</v>

1251
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.380
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly what you're picturing.</v>

1252
00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah but that's also honestly to the same dudes who go to comic book</v>

1253
00:53:31.151 --> 00:53:31.984
<v Speaker 1>conventions.</v>

1254
00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.600

1255
00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.580
<v Speaker 1>You know we could all be in that group.</v>

1256
00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah let's throw a few wrong turns or right turns.</v>

1257
00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Depending on your perspective.</v>

1258
00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1259
00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1260
00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:48.170
<v Speaker 1>We have a weird thing in this country particularly about sex and anything else</v>

1261
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.590
<v Speaker 1>where you're really into it.</v>

1262
00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It's it's OK you can be addicted to playing golf and everybody has somehow</v>

1263
00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.160
<v Speaker 1>there's Jamie he's on that golf course every day.</v>

1264
00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.043
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy fuck.</v>

1265
00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:01.750
<v Speaker 1>But if you're at home beaten off every day you're a freak.</v>

1266
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah you're a loser.</v>

1267
00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:06.920
<v Speaker 1>You know you could have gigs and gigs of porn and you just really love it.</v>

1268
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:11.590
<v Speaker 1>And you talk about the old days and you know you have like like you know like</v>

1269
00:54:11.591 --> 00:54:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson needs to watch like old Jack Dempsey films and learn technique.</v>

1270
00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:16.413
<v Speaker 1>You know like</v>

1271
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you can't be like that with porn because if you like that with porn you're a</v>

1272
00:54:21.461 --> 00:54:22.150
<v Speaker 1>fucking loser.</v>

1273
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah it's weird.</v>

1274
00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:23.980
<v Speaker 4>It is weird.</v>

1275
00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean as long as you're getting everything else done in life it's not</v>

1276
00:54:26.531 --> 00:54:29.080
<v Speaker 4>interfering in any excitable way I guess.</v>

1277
00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:32.300
<v Speaker 9>I mean even if it is getting in the way so is everything else.</v>

1278
00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.040
<v Speaker 9>People get addicted to those food people that are nuts about food.</v>

1279
00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:37.150
<v Speaker 9>People that love gambling.</v>

1280
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.720
<v Speaker 9>Yeah</v>

1281
00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:41.440
<v Speaker 11>that gets in the way everything gets in the way but we look at those things as</v>

1282
00:54:41.441 --> 00:54:46.441
<v Speaker 11>somehow or another being somehow or another being a better thing to be addicted</v>

1283
00:54:47.081 --> 00:54:47.420
<v Speaker 11>to.</v>

1284

1286
00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:50.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah I think you're right.</v>

1287
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:51.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1288
00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah we're a little fucked up about sex for sure.</v>

1289
00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:56.350
<v Speaker 11>A lot of fucked up sex but whatever.</v>

1290
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.890
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

1291
00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:59.860
<v Speaker 11>I mean that's how you pay the bills imagine a perfect world where everybody was</v>

1292
00:54:59.861 --> 00:55:00.460
<v Speaker 11>open minded.</v>

1293
00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.120
<v Speaker 11>Would you have to do you'd have to be working at Starbucks just like you told</v>

1294
00:55:03.121 --> 00:55:03.270

1295
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I know all these guys would be honest with their wives about what they're into</v>

1296
00:55:06.341 --> 00:55:08.170
<v Speaker 3>and then they never come to me for it.</v>

1297
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah so it's probably better that we live in a strange world.</v>
