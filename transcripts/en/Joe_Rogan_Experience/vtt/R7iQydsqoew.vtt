00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I keep getting reminded of,</v>

3
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.510
<v Speaker 1>that Bill Bradley story that you told,</v>

5
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>and kind of repeating the same thing Bill Bradley was,</v>

7
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>he was a terrible basketball player at to start big,</v>

8
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:11.581
<v Speaker 1>gangly,</v>

9
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:12.290
<v Speaker 1>slow,</v>

10
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.530
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

11
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>not terrible,</v>

12
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't good,</v>

13
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>but he had the most relentless pursuit of improvement of anybody that I've ever</v>

14
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:19.771
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

15
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>You can probably pick up the story,</v>

16
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

17
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Drew's dribbling the ball,</v>

18
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>constantly eight hours,</v>

20
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>nine hours a day,</v>

21
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>again over and over and over again.</v>

23
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of repetition,</v>

24
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

26
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>it's all part of this same pattern of doing the same thing over and over again.</v>

27
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you bring up music is a great story.</v>

29
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of another like Freddie Roach type thing.</v>

30
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>You take the,</v>

31
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

32
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>he's a white guy who happens to be tall,</v>

33
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>but he loves basketball.</v>

34
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>He's like nine years old.</v>

35
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And I know this myself because I love basketball and I was a kid,</v>

36
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>just the sound of the ball swishing through the net.</v>

37
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>He just loved that side of the,</v>

38
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.691
<v Speaker 1>the sound of that.</v>

39
00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.524
<v Speaker 1>The feel of it.</v>

40
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 1>So he had this sort of visceral love of the game,</v>

41
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>but he stunk at it.</v>

42
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>He was tall,</v>

43
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.571
<v Speaker 1>awkward,</v>

44
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:04.404
<v Speaker 1>slow.</v>

45
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he'd become good at it.</v>

46
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:11.121
<v Speaker 1>So he decided he was going to train himself from a very early age and I call it</v>

47
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:18.201
<v Speaker 1>they have a concept in called deliberate practice where you learned to practice</v>

50
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>what you're not good at because we often,</v>

51
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>if we're taking up archery or basketball,</v>

52
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>we find something that we're good at and we tend to just repeat that.</v>

53
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And then our practice becomes very one sided,</v>

54
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>deliberate practices to practice on what you're not good at.</v>

55
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I call it resistance practice,</v>

56
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>actually practicing it.</v>

57
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>What is painful in enjoying the pain?</v>

58
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's Bill Bradley.</v>

59
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>He put these special glasses on his head that prevented him from looking down so</v>

60
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:48.871
<v Speaker 1>he could,</v>

61
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>he would dribble on a court for 10 hours or 10 hours,</v>

62
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>three or four hours,</v>

63
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>and he couldn't look down at his feet,</v>

64
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>which trained him to dribble.</v>

65
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.501
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst thing.</v>

66
00:01:58.501 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>You can have fear always looking down.</v>

67
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>You're not able to see where what's going on on the court.</v>

68
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>So he did.</v>

69
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>He did that.</v>

70
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.200
<v Speaker 1>He went on a cruise with his parents across to England and he didn't,</v>

71
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to build a practice there.</v>

72
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:16.071
<v Speaker 1>He brought his basketball and below deck there with these incredibly long alleys</v>

73
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>that would go from one end of the shift to the other that were very narrow.</v>

74
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>He would put on his special glasses and he would dribble back and forth in this</v>

75
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>narrow area so that he could dribble with absolute complete control.</v>

76
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.210
<v Speaker 1>He devised all of these other exercises where he could train himself to see</v>

77
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.760
<v Speaker 1>almost behind himself or at least way over to the side on and on and on until he</v>

78
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>became so good that by the time he got into college at Princeton and then later</v>

79
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>he played for the New York Knicks and the 70s with all the great championship</v>

80
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>teams.</v>

81
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>People would look at bill and they go,</v>

82
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:49.854
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

83
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>this guy is a born.</v>

84
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>He was born with a basketball in his hand.</v>

85
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>He's naturally gifted.</v>

86
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>He is so graceful.</v>

87
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>He has eyes in the back of his head.</v>

88
00:02:58.231 --> 00:02:59.064
<v Speaker 1>He can make a pass.</v>

89
00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.741
<v Speaker 1>Walt Frazier,</v>

90
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>without even looking.</v>

91
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>They didn't realize that he had gone through the most insanely rigorous,</v>

92
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>painful,</v>

93
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.600
<v Speaker 1>deliberate form of practice ever invented by a single human athlete at a very</v>

94
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>early age.</v>

95
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.983
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

96
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.460
<v Speaker 1>and it made,</v>

97
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>it made the game fun for him.</v>

98
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>It was sure it was a lot of pain,</v>

99
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>but by the time he got good and he was in high school,</v>

100
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>all the girls were admiring him.</v>

101
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

102
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>he's got invited to go to Princeton.</v>

103
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

104
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>it paid off and he got a huge level of pleasure and the game became incredibly</v>

105
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

106
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.620
<v Speaker 1>But it was all based on these insane moments and periods of,</v>

107
00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>of pain that he put himself through.</v>
