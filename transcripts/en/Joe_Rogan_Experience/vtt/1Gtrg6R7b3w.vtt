<v Speaker 1>What's hilarious folks?</v>

9
00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:12.694
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you this.</v>

10
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I did a podcast earlier today and he said,</v>

11
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:15.271
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

12
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it's your second for the day.</v>

13
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.991
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

14
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>impressive endurance.</v>

15
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how fucking ridiculous that is for you to say,</v>

16
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>this is a guy who walked across an article.</v>

17
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>How many days did it take you?</v>

18
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>54 days by yourself.</v>

19
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:32.590
<v Speaker 1>By myself checking the fucking frozen Tundra it,</v>

20
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>that was an endurance feat of its own.</v>

21
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:34.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Just that's a real endurance feed.</v>

23
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sitting down talking to people.</v>

24
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

25
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 1>You talked already for two hours.</v>

26
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:40.744
<v Speaker 1>How do you do it?</v>

27
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.281
<v Speaker 1>Two more hours.</v>

28
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:42.791
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

29
00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:43.624
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

31
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

32
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.660
<v Speaker 1>To what the fuck were you doing?</v>

33
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Just just getting back.</v>

34
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:48.611
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

35
00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:48.971
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

36
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 1>still practically have the snow on my shoes.</v>

38
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:51.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I got back about a month ago.</v>

40
00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.650
<v Speaker 1>54 day journey.</v>

41
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>First person in history to cross the entire continent.</v>

42
00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Solo unsupported.</v>

43
00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So no resupplies throughout the thing.</v>

44
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:00.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

45
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.761
<v Speaker 1>no aid,</v>

46
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:01.541
<v Speaker 1>no wind kites,</v>

47
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:01.841
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

48
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Just me dragging a 375 pound sled across Antarctica.</v>

49
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it only took you 54 days.</v>

50
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>it's so big.</v>

52
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>When you look at an article on a map,</v>

53
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>like how long do you think it would take you to walk across America?</v>

54
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Well you got,</v>

55
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>so we usually look at Antarctica to map this hilarious.</v>

56
00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I have show people a picture of Antarctica.</v>

57
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:21.821
<v Speaker 1>You're a smart guy.</v>

58
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>You probably noticed,</v>

59
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 1>but usually people see it on a map projection because then it gets flat.</v>

60
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

61
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>It's actually circular.</v>

62
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.350
<v Speaker 1>so I went from the edge of the raw and I shelf to the Ra via the south pole to</v>

64
00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 1>the Ross ice shelf.</v>

65
00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 1>So basically kind of a diagonal across,</v>

66
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>through the center and then back to the other ice shelf.</v>

67
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.440
<v Speaker 1>What do the flat earthers think about?</v>

68
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You are traversing this,</v>

69
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.633
<v Speaker 1>this area.</v>

70
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>This is what you did.</v>

71
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>This is how you,</v>

72
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.831
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

73
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:45.341
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

74
00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

75
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.280
<v Speaker 1>We went to the center of the fucking earth basically.</v>

76
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

77
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.920
<v Speaker 1>The top of the pole yet bottom of the earth,</v>

78
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>standing down there holding everyone up on my shoulders.</v>

80
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.221
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

81
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 1>So you were at the South Pole and then you trucked over to the,</v>

82
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>to the ice shelf in their side.</v>

83
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.020
<v Speaker 1>It's funny you say about the flat earthers though because all jokes aside,</v>

84
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I be getting a lot of trolling on my Instagram page from the flat earthers I've</v>

85
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:06.481
<v Speaker 1>got guys go,</v>

86
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:07.314
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

87
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>oh I was doing this speech the other day.</v>

88
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>People are Super Nice.</v>

89
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Come up in the Q and a afterwards I want to shake my hand,</v>

90
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 1>take a picture,</v>

91
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.290

92
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 1>And this guy walks up and this real earnest look on his face and he's like,</v>

93
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 1>so I really wanted to ask you how was the whole?</v>

94
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.071
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

95
00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:21.904
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>

96
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.870
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

97
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>he know the hole at the center and I was like,</v>

98
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

99
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I can give me a little more.</v>

100
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:27.371
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

101
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>you know like when you got to the edge</v>

102
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

103
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.591
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

104
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:35.080
<v Speaker 1>like you're really asking this question right now.</v>

105
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Like we are talking about this.</v>

106
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't quite know where to go with it.</v>

107
00:02:37.781 --> 00:02:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

108
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

109
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.090
<v Speaker 1>there was actually,</v>

110
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I at least I didn't see the edge and the curvature kept going and I made such a</v>

111
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 1>strange thing to believe,</v>

112
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but people do it.</v>

113
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 1>People think people are trolling about that.</v>

114
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:51.250
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

115
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>It actually started out,</v>

116
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:53.800
<v Speaker 1>it's another four Chan thing,</v>

117
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

118
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that it's,</v>

119
00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:56.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

120
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there was probably somebody who believed it before that,</v>

121
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>but it started people trolling on</v>

122
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 2>four Chan and then eventually people just started actually going,</v>

123
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

124
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>you input it is flat.</v>

125
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>And then they started believing it and videos,</v>

126
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 2>youtube videos popped up.</v>

127
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 2>There's another youtube video of someone linked to me the other day and I</v>

128
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:11.771
<v Speaker 2>thought it had like,</v>

129
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I thought it had like a few hundred views.</v>

130
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 2>We had 28,000 views.</v>

131
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>There was all these guys debating like call and prove that there's not a wall.</v>

132
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.791
<v Speaker 2>The wall,</v>

133
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>like there would be like game of Thrones at the edge of the world.</v>

134
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 2>There's this whole conversation.</v>

135
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 2>I bet there's another 28,000 people.</v>

136
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 2>It's proved to call and never actually weren't.</v>

137
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.533
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

138
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 2>he's a new world order shill.</v>

139
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

140
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:31.031
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>

141
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 2>the other buddy wide was that we got up budge on the Instagram page.</v>

142
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm out there alone completely by myself,</v>

143
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to share the whole story through my Instagram to like share that</v>

144
00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 2>journey with people,</v>

145
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 2>inspire others to do whatever they want to do.</v>

146
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 2>And it kept being like,</v>

147
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 2>what mean he's not out there alone.</v>

148
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 2>He's taking pictures.</v>

149
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Was like the film crew as like guys,</v>

150
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 2>have you never heard of a tripod?</v>

151
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.210
<v Speaker 2>And if in a timer,</v>

152
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

153
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.460
<v Speaker 2>watched survivor man.</v>

154
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.001
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

155
00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:58.451
<v Speaker 2>So it's so,</v>

156
00:03:58.451 --> 00:03:58.931
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny.</v>

157
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Comments along those lines.</v>

158
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:00.660
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>

159
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 2>your sled was 300 and how many pounds?</v>

160
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 2>375 pounds of start.</v>

161
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 2>So basically,</v>

162
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

163
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 2>food and fuel was the main,</v>

164
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:08.261
<v Speaker 2>the main way.</v>

165
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:08.681
<v Speaker 2>So people,</v>

166
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I called my project the impossible first.</v>

167
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of what I named the project because several people would try it</v>

168
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:14.674
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

169
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 2>So not only walking,</v>

170
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 2>you're dragging this big ass heavy sled.</v>

171
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

172
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

173
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 2>And Dude,</v>

174
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

175
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 2>So people have tried this,</v>

176
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

177
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:24.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 2>going back a hundred years to sh Ernest Shackleton saying if it was possible.</v>

179
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 2>And then the last few years,</v>

180
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 2>some really experienced polar explorers have given it a shot and one guy</v>

181
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:34.610
<v Speaker 2>actually died less than a hundred miles from the finish shine.</v>

182
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

183
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 2>because of lack of nutrition and some challenges with the weather and things</v>

184
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:39.780
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

185
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

186
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 2>but people called it,</v>

187
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:41.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:42.191
<v Speaker 2>people after that,</v>

189
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

190
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.181
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible.</v>

191
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 2>And the reason people thought it was impossible because you can't get</v>

192
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:47.111
<v Speaker 2>resupplies,</v>

193
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 2>meaning if you feel your sled with food and a certain amount,</v>

194
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 2>you actually can't drag this led anymore.</v>

195
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 2>So the whole math equation really was figuring out just how much food and fuel I</v>

196
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:55.721
<v Speaker 2>could put in the sled.</v>

197
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 2>The fuel melts the water,</v>

198
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 2>so melts the ice into water essentially,</v>

199
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 2>and that equal to 375 pounds.</v>

200
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 2>And to be truth,</v>

201
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I could barely pull it on the first day.</v>

202
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I a one hour into getting dropped off.</v>

203
00:05:07.851 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm dropped off completely alone out there in Antarctica.</v>

204
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I planned this project for a year,</v>

205
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:12.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

207
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.451
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

208
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I get dropped off and after about one hour pulling 375 pound sled through the</v>

209
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:17.591
<v Speaker 2>snow,</v>

210
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 2>it's minus 25 degrees out.</v>

211
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.701
<v Speaker 2>I'm crying,</v>

212
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:20.321
<v Speaker 2>I'm crying,</v>

213
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally crying and the tears in my goggles are starting to freeze.</v>

214
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

215
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.941
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

216
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>So I pick up my satellite phone,</v>

217
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 2>I call home to my wife Jenna,</v>

218
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 2>who also creates and plans all these projects with me.</v>

219
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.293
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

220
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Babe,</v>

221
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

222
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 2>I think we named the project the right thing.</v>

223
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.111
<v Speaker 2>The impossible verse.</v>

224
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

225
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it might be impossible to keep going.</v>

226
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 2>So I'm one hour into a thousand mile journey.</v>

227
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Poetess sled told everyone I'm going to do this and I'm already having those</v>

228
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 2>doubts pull up.</v>

229
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.231
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

230
00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:45.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

231
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 2>fortunately I was able to get a little bit further that day and 54 days later</v>

232
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:50.141
<v Speaker 2>and made it to the end.</v>

233
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>But how far did you get in the first day?</v>

234
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:52.181
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

235
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 2>it's funny cause we show,</v>

236
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:53.951
<v Speaker 2>just show the map.</v>

237
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

238
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

239
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 2>it starts on the ice shelf,</v>

240
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 2>which is basically the frozen sea ice and there's an edge of that.</v>

241
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 2>That's where the continent starts.</v>

242
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a waypoint on my gps that marks that.</v>

243
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 2>So the plane that drops me off actually dropped me off on the ice shelf before</v>

244
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.490
<v Speaker 2>the continent starts.</v>

245
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 2>And my first way point was kind of like the actual start.</v>

246
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And so one hour in,</v>

247
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 2>I haven't even hit the real start.</v>

248
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.701
<v Speaker 2>So when she,</v>

249
00:06:12.701 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 2>when I call her on the phone,</v>

250
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

251
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.201
<v Speaker 2>cause she knows the route.</v>

252
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:15.531
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>

253
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>well how far are you from the first way point,</v>

254
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.260
<v Speaker 2>which is where the actual start.</v>

255
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

256
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.830
<v Speaker 2>it's 0.63 more miles.</v>

257
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

258
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 2>it's half a mile.</v>

259
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 2>You have a thousand more to go.</v>

260
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Like get to the first way point,</v>

261
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.763
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

262
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.331
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

263
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:29.691
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

264
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:30.021
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

265
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

266
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

267
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.641
<v Speaker 2>rallied myself,</v>

268
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 2>got to the first way point and then finally got in my tent that night and just</v>

269
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 2>kind of took a deep breath.</v>

270
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I think I was just overwhelmed by the magnitude of it.</v>

271
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:38.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

272
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 2>imagine being a speck in the middle of Antarctica alone,</v>

273
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 2>these crazy temperatures,</v>

274
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:42.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 2>all the excitement but fears of the journey ahead.</v>

276
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

277
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 2>and 375 pounds on my back when the sleds,</v>

278
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 2>when the snow's deep too loose snow makes 375 pounds,</v>

279
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 2>even even heavier than if it's like light,</v>

280
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

281
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 2>icier consolidated.</v>

282
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

283
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:57.381
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

284
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 2>it was a rough start to say the least.</v>

285
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Did you do any sort of test run pulling the sled anywhere else?</v>

286
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

287
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 2>so the training element of it was pretty cool.</v>

288
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

289
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

290
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.041
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

291
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I actually said a few other world records previous to this and the mountains and</v>

292
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 2>things we could talk about if you want.</v>

293
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:12.231
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

294
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

295
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 2>the last year I really committed to this project,</v>

296
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:16.034
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

297
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.361
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

298
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 2>yet decided to obviously start training specifically for this.</v>

299
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

300
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 2>I needed to put on about 20 pounds of muscle.</v>

301
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually six foot one 65.</v>

302
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:24.201
<v Speaker 2>Pretty Lean.</v>

303
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I'd race triathlon professionally for a number of years and realized I needed to</v>

304
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 2>be a bit bigger because I was going to lose so much weight.</v>

305
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

306
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Speaker 2>and I found an amazing coach in Portland,</v>

307
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Oregon where I live.</v>

308
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 2>This guy named Mike McCastle.</v>

309
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever heard of him,</v>

310
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:37.124
<v Speaker 2>but I know you've had,</v>

311
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.460
<v Speaker 2>you've had David Goggins on your show.</v>

312
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I take it.</v>

313
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.831
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

314
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

315
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Mike actually surpassed David's pullup record.</v>

316
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Mike did 5,804 pull ups in 20 hours.</v>

317
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.801
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

318
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I think Goggins at about 4,000,</v>

319
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 2>which are both insane to me because I can do like another thousand.</v>

320
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>

321
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Mike was wearing a 30 pound weight.</v>

322
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:56.774
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

323
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:57.703
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

324
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Just to add insult to injury,</v>

325
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

326
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Mike McCastle absolute absolute legends.</v>

327
00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

328
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.171
<v Speaker 1>a minute,</v>

329
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:04.004
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

330
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 1>5,000 fucking Chin ups with a weight vest on,</v>

331
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.740
<v Speaker 1>dude that barely can do 10 love.</v>

332
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm right there with you at like pull ups are not.</v>

333
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I've got some other physical strikes,</v>

334
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 1>but the pullup department is not,</v>

335
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:19.230
<v Speaker 1>not my strong suit is fucking insane.</v>

336
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.113
<v Speaker 1>Get this too.</v>

337
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Just cause I got to,</v>

338
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I got a big up my band for a second.</v>

339
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 1>That's his fourth world right here.</v>

340
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Also pulled a f two 50 truck,</v>

341
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>20 miles across death valley.</v>

342
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.923
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

343
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>in a harness.</v>

344
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to look for the best guy to teach me how to pull heavy Shang.</v>

345
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

346
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 1>you got the guy,</v>

347
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I found the guy,</v>

348
00:08:36.871 --> 00:08:37.191
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

349
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:38.150
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

350
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.270
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy out.</v>

351
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Does it just make you feel like such a pussy?</v>

352
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>And the greatest thing about Mike,</v>

353
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.541
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

355
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>strong jacked dude,</v>

356
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 1>but like super soft spoken.</v>

357
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

358
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.991
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

359
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:51.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

360
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I did this pope's.</v>

361
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>So it was cool.</v>

362
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

363
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

364
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I basically</v>

365
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.310
<v Speaker 2>fucked with that record so hard he could die and like come back to life and live</v>

366
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 2>a whole nother live and no one's ever going to do it.</v>

367
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

368
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.701
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

369
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:06.271
<v Speaker 2>my training,</v>

370
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:06.520
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

371
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 2>he was the guy went to him train out of this gym in Portland,</v>

372
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

373
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.801
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

374
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 2>where he trains out of and he just,</v>

375
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 2>he got me bigger,</v>

376
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 2>he got me stronger.</v>

377
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 2>But he also did all sorts of bad ass crazy stuff.</v>

378
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a physical challenge,</v>

379
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's more of a mental challenge in anything.</v>

380
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 2>So he had me,</v>

381
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 2>my hands in ice buckets,</v>

383
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 2>doing planks to get my heart rate jacked up and then he'd be like,</v>

384
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 2>get out of the water.</v>

385
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Then I pulled my hands out of the ice buckets.</v>

386
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you not be a seated squat against the wall?</v>

387
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 2>But then he would hand me Legos and so my hands are frozen.</v>

388
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 2>My feet are in ice buckets now in a plank.</v>

389
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:36.811
<v Speaker 2>My heart rates,</v>

390
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:36.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 2>one 90 and he's like,</v>

392
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 2>put this Lego set together.</v>

393
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 2>So the deck dexterity in my fingers,</v>

394
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 2>the mental acuity to pull this all together.</v>

395
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 2>There is this guy,</v>

396
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 2>what a fucking savage this guy is.</v>

397
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 2>He and he did that for veteran suicides.</v>

398
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

399
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.061
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

400
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:51.511
<v Speaker 2>So he did,</v>

401
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 2>he's got really,</v>

402
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 2>really important missions behind all of his projects.</v>

403
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:56.520
<v Speaker 2>He calls him 12 labors in over his life.</v>

404
00:09:56.521 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to set 12 route world records and various things.</v>

405
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.200
<v Speaker 2>People that are just,</v>

406
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 2>they're just designed different.</v>

407
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

408
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

409
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Speaker 2>So he's the man.</v>

410
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 2>But like this crazy training he came up with,</v>

411
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 2>for me that was like the ice,</v>

412
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 2>the water,</v>

413
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 2>the mental acuity.</v>

414
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 2>All of this was like,</v>

415
00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:13.021
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

416
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

417
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be in Antarctica if your tent blows away,</v>

418
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 2>when you're pulling it up,</v>

419
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>

420
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Like the stakes are that high 50,</v>

421
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 2>60 mile per hour winds like absolutely crazy.</v>

422
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

423
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 2>so should we ever have an issue like that where you thought the could blow away?</v>

424
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

425
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

426
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you have it.</v>

427
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 2>There's a clip on my Instagram.</v>

428
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I posted a few days ago of me of me setting up the tent in a minus 80 degrees</v>

429
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.333
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

430
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 2>60 mile per hour winds.</v>

431
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

432
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty gnarly,</v>

433
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:39.811
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

434
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was one time when the 10 almost did blow away from me yet.</v>

435
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.261
<v Speaker 2>There's this one,</v>

436
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 2>there's one other one.</v>

437
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.030
<v Speaker 2>This is me getting into looking like an absolute disaster.</v>

438
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:48.151
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

439
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 2>I get help with audio,</v>

440
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 2>but that's me.</v>

441
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.713
<v Speaker 2>That's me.</v>

442
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.081
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

443
00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:03.081
<v Speaker 3>You're pulling eyesight got caught on a massive storm and I was just so hard to</v>

444
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:06.361
<v Speaker 3>get the tent up.</v>

445
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know if I was gonna be able to get it up where I was going to have to</v>

446
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:09.270
<v Speaker 3>just keep walking.</v>

447
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.563
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

448
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 3>hopefully these tent poles hold,</v>

449
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.713
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

450
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 3>that was really intense.</v>

451
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.310
<v Speaker 2>How do you stay warm in that tent?</v>

452
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 2>So it average temperature is about minus 25 minus 30.</v>

453
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.581
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

454
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:30.370
<v Speaker 2>and Antarctica,</v>

455
00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:30.841
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

456
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 2>when the wind jacks up,</v>

457
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.371
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

458
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's the other cup of me setting up the tip,</v>

459
00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 2>but if you get a chance to see that it's,</v>

460
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 2>it's about Kimmy about minus 80 outside,</v>

462
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 2>which it's hard to wrap your mind around that.</v>

463
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:44.280
<v Speaker 2>But I've tried to put it in perspective by saying I could take a cup of boiling</v>

464
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:46.290
<v Speaker 2>water and throw it in an air and immediately turns to ice.</v>

465
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>

466
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.190
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

467
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.750
<v Speaker 2>that's the temperature would dealing with,</v>

468
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:49.201
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

469
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:50.410
<v Speaker 2>This is me trying to,</v>

470
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:51.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

471
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 2>keep the tent poles together.</v>

472
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Usually you have someone else to hold onto it,</v>

473
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:54.371
<v Speaker 2>but I'm alone.</v>

474
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely alone out there.</v>

475
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 2>So this is me struggling with my tent,</v>

476
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 2>just trying to keep it up.</v>

477
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I've got it tied down to my sled.</v>

478
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 2>They're just battling battling the winds and the state.</v>

479
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:05.831
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

480
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:06.461
<v Speaker 2>the stakes are high.</v>

481
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:07.031
<v Speaker 2>If that blows away,</v>

482
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a spare 10.</v>

483
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I've got no extra weight in my sled to hold spare stuff.</v>

484
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

485
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:12.281
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

486
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 2>it's do or die quite literally in a moment like that have a patch kit.</v>

487
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple of things repaired,</v>

488
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:18.701
<v Speaker 2>his sewing kit,</v>

489
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:19.331
<v Speaker 2>a patch kit,</v>

490
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:19.931
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

491
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 2>But if the tent itself or the temples,</v>

492
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

493
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 4>pretty much done.</v>

494
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:29.971
<v Speaker 4>And also you have to set up your tripod and film and then press stop and go back</v>

495
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:30.650
<v Speaker 4>and send it.</v>

496
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.470
<v Speaker 4>How are you keeping these batteries juiced up?</v>

497
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:32.911
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

498
00:12:32.911 --> 00:12:33.161
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

499
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 4>this is the film crew man that was following me around that right of the plateau</v>

500
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 4>film group there near the Ice Wall.</v>

501
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.310
<v Speaker 2>The uh,</v>

502
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

503
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

504
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 2>it was basically that had to keep the batteries warm by keeping them right</v>

505
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 2>against my skin.</v>

506
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 2>So I keep the batteries right against my skin and my body weight would keep it</v>

507
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 2>warm.</v>

508
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.150
<v Speaker 2>And the second I wanted to take it out,</v>

509
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I pulled out real quick hit play.</v>

510
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 2>And then it would usually last a minute or 30 enough to get a little clip or</v>

511
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:55.151
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

512
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:55.990
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't just let it run,</v>

513
00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:57.330
<v Speaker 2>but then it would completely freeze.</v>

514
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Even a full battery would be on zero battery by pretty quickly using solar</v>

515
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 2>panels to charge it.</v>

516
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:03.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

517
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 2>So one crazy cool thing about Antarctica and that time of year is it's 24 hours</v>

518
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 2>a day light.</v>

519
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 2>And so the sun never sets.</v>

520
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 2>So even when I'm on my tent in the middle of the night,</v>

521
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking your plugs to kind of pretend like it's nighttime,</v>

522
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 2>but 24 hours a day light.</v>

523
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 2>So solar panels,</v>

524
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm keeping everything charged.</v>

525
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Camera's phone,</v>

526
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:19.361
<v Speaker 2>batteries,</v>

527
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:19.890
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

528
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.730
<v Speaker 4>And Are you traveling with or are you using gps?</v>

529
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

530
00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:26.220
<v Speaker 2>so I had some way points.</v>

531
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.310
<v Speaker 2>The GPS waypoints that kind of led my path to the South Pole,</v>

532
00:13:29.311 --> 00:13:29.791
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

533
00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:31.200
<v Speaker 2>But most actually using a compass.</v>

534
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:34.770
<v Speaker 2>So I look at my gps maybe once every week or something like that.</v>

535
00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Just cause the bearing,</v>

536
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.380
<v Speaker 2>the juice factor,</v>

537
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.840
<v Speaker 2>it's actually just easier because,</v>

538
00:13:38.841 --> 00:13:42.750
<v Speaker 2>so I basically had like a harness on front of me that would have my gps or my</v>

539
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.010
<v Speaker 2>compass kind of off my chest more or less because some of the clips we saw the</v>

540
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:47.551
<v Speaker 2>sun's out.</v>

541
00:13:47.551 --> 00:13:49.950
<v Speaker 2>But actually more than half of the time the clouds would come in.</v>

542
00:13:49.951 --> 00:13:51.840
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be just complete and utter whiteout.</v>

543
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even see one step in front of me.</v>

544
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.930
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd actually have to just stare down at my compass,</v>

545
00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.080
<v Speaker 2>keep it on this bearing.</v>

546
00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:00.120
<v Speaker 2>And so imagine you can't see anything,</v>

547
00:14:00.121 --> 00:14:01.470
<v Speaker 2>can't see one step in front of you.</v>

548
00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm pulling it,</v>

549
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.360
<v Speaker 2>300 pound sled,</v>

551
00:14:03.361 --> 00:14:05.010
<v Speaker 2>1213 hours per day,</v>

552
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.810
<v Speaker 2>not listening to anything really complete dead silence and just staring at this</v>

553
00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:11.190
<v Speaker 2>compass bearing all day long.</v>

554
00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:12.024
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

555
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.660
<v Speaker 4>going crazy at all.</v>

556
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

557
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.850
<v Speaker 2>the mental side of it was by far the most interesting side of it for me.</v>

558
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

559
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:21.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

560
00:14:21.391 --> 00:14:23.040
<v Speaker 2>have a lifelong endurance athlete,</v>

561
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:26.340
<v Speaker 2>but really kind of an exploration into the mind is what it was for me and why I</v>

562
00:14:26.341 --> 00:14:27.390
<v Speaker 2>was curious about it.</v>

563
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.190
<v Speaker 2>So spending all this time in silence.</v>

564
00:14:29.191 --> 00:14:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I've done,</v>

565
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.600
<v Speaker 2>are you familiar with,</v>

566
00:14:30.601 --> 00:14:31.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

567
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.730
<v Speaker 2>a vipassana meditation,</v>

568
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.593
<v Speaker 2>these tips?</v>

569
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.440
<v Speaker 2>So I've done a couple of these 10 days silent meditation retreats before this,</v>

570
00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:38.340
<v Speaker 2>which is 10 days,</v>

571
00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:39.031
<v Speaker 2>no reading,</v>

572
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:39.810
<v Speaker 2>no writing,</v>

573
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:40.860
<v Speaker 2>no eye contact,</v>

574
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

575
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.590
<v Speaker 2>kind of dove into that piece of it.</v>

576
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:47.310
<v Speaker 2>But 54 days alone in Antarctica and complete silence was,</v>

577
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:49.440
<v Speaker 2>was next level of that for sure.</v>

578
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:50.611
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

579
00:14:50.611 --> 00:14:50.851
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

580
00:14:50.851 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>that is so fucking</v>

581
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:53.710
<v Speaker 4>impressive.</v>

582
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.543
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

583
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 4>can't believe that you did that.</v>

584
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.710
<v Speaker 4>Now when you're looking down and it's an utter whiteout and you're looking at</v>

585
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:03.680
<v Speaker 4>your compass and you're dragging this shit behind you,</v>

586
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:04.783
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

587
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 4>are you doing anything in your mind?</v>

588
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 4>Are you like singing songs?</v>

589
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.083
<v Speaker 4>Are you,</v>

590
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.860
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

591
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.693
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

592
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of different things,</v>

593
00:15:13.291 --> 00:15:16.320
<v Speaker 2>but really what ended up happening is I started to be able to trigger these flow</v>

594
00:15:16.321 --> 00:15:16.771
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

595
00:15:16.771 --> 00:15:17.604
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

596
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

597
00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:22.530
<v Speaker 2>as a lifelong professional athlete through different capacities in my life.</v>

598
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:22.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

599
00:15:22.771 --> 00:15:23.591
<v Speaker 2>I've tapped into that.</v>

600
00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:23.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

601
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I was a swimmer when I was a little kid,</v>

602
00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:26.430
<v Speaker 2>so swimming laps in a pool.</v>

603
00:15:26.431 --> 00:15:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I would like kind of just happen to this like timeless space where you</v>

604
00:15:30.091 --> 00:15:30.151
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

605
00:15:30.151 --> 00:15:33.480
<v Speaker 2>maybe 30 minutes would go by and in two minutes or something like that.</v>

606
00:15:33.481 --> 00:15:35.040
<v Speaker 2>But I never really knew how I got there.</v>

607
00:15:35.041 --> 00:15:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Just so it's sometimes tap into it,</v>

608
00:15:36.511 --> 00:15:37.261
<v Speaker 2>sometimes not,</v>

609
00:15:37.261 --> 00:15:37.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

610
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:38.191
<v Speaker 2>the zone flow,</v>

611
00:15:38.191 --> 00:15:38.401
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

612
00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:39.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call that.</v>

613
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.860
<v Speaker 2>But in Antarctica I went in with this sort of a tension about intention of</v>

614
00:15:43.861 --> 00:15:45.600
<v Speaker 2>exploring that space in my mind.</v>

615
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.990
<v Speaker 2>And so as I got more and more into these wideouts into these compass,</v>

616
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.400
<v Speaker 2>staring at this compass,</v>

617
00:15:50.401 --> 00:15:52.080
<v Speaker 2>staring at this expansive landscape,</v>

618
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I started to find ways to actually trigger that flow state in my mind.</v>

619
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.070
<v Speaker 2>So it got to the point where I could for several days at a time,</v>

620
00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:00.390
<v Speaker 2>be in this deep flow state.</v>

621
00:16:00.391 --> 00:16:01.230
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

622
00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:03.990
<v Speaker 2>my day was about 17 hours every day between getting up,</v>

623
00:16:03.991 --> 00:16:04.801
<v Speaker 2>boiling my water,</v>

624
00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:05.640
<v Speaker 2>getting out of my tent,</v>

625
00:16:05.641 --> 00:16:06.600
<v Speaker 2>and those crazy conditions,</v>

626
00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:07.650
<v Speaker 2>packing my sled,</v>

627
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.940
<v Speaker 2>dragging it for 13 hours,</v>

628
00:16:08.941 --> 00:16:10.560
<v Speaker 2>setting my tent back up and these storms.</v>

629
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.220
<v Speaker 2>But I got into this sort of sequence of being so present with each step,</v>

630
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.390
<v Speaker 2>each next sequence that it ended up being in this really timeless spaceless</v>

631
00:16:18.391 --> 00:16:23.391
<v Speaker 2>place in my mind of true high performance that was almost like the most deepest,</v>

632
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.121
<v Speaker 2>peaceful,</v>

633
00:16:24.121 --> 00:16:26.160
<v Speaker 2>meditative state that I can possibly imagine.</v>

634
00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:26.401
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

635
00:16:26.401 --> 00:16:28.020
<v Speaker 2>It was very profound and beautiful,</v>

636
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

637
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.310
<v Speaker 2>to get there in my mind.</v>

638
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.293
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

639
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Are you boiling this water in your tent?</v>

640
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.363
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

641
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

642
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.543
<v Speaker 2>so my 10,</v>

643
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.241
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

644
00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:37.021
<v Speaker 2>So it kind of a,</v>

645
00:16:37.021 --> 00:16:39.310
<v Speaker 2>a slightly different white gas fuels stove.</v>

646
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.830
<v Speaker 2>So not the canisters where you could throw away,</v>

647
00:16:40.831 --> 00:16:42.450
<v Speaker 2>but like gas that you could refill the stove,</v>

648
00:16:42.451 --> 00:16:44.220
<v Speaker 2>but his stove with fuel.</v>

649
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

650
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.720
<v Speaker 2>basically the way my tent was,</v>

651
00:16:45.721 --> 00:16:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you saw the outer layer of the tent there.</v>

652
00:16:47.311 --> 00:16:51.300
<v Speaker 2>There's actually an inner part that's a tent so that there's a vestibule where</v>

653
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.030
<v Speaker 2>basically there's snow inside the doorway but not outside,</v>

654
00:16:54.031 --> 00:16:54.481
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

655
00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:57.000
<v Speaker 2>So I would shovel that snow from inside of the tent,</v>

656
00:16:57.001 --> 00:17:00.570
<v Speaker 2>vestibule into my pot and be able to melt the water that way.</v>

657
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.021
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

658
00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:04.320
<v Speaker 2>and drank about six liters of water every single day.</v>

659
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

660
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.323
<v Speaker 2>when I was out there.</v>

661
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of snow,</v>

662
00:17:08.071 --> 00:17:08.641
<v Speaker 2>a lot of antiques,</v>

663
00:17:08.641 --> 00:17:09.600
<v Speaker 2>a few hours to melt that.</v>

664
00:17:09.601 --> 00:17:12.840
<v Speaker 2>But people don't realize this in order cause actually the largest desert in the</v>

665
00:17:12.841 --> 00:17:13.350
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

666
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

667
00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.240
<v Speaker 2>so it's actually very dry.</v>

668
00:17:15.241 --> 00:17:16.620
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't snow very often.</v>

669
00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:18.210
<v Speaker 2>But when it does of course never melt.</v>

670
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:20.490
<v Speaker 2>And the South Pole was at 9,300 feet.</v>

671
00:17:20.491 --> 00:17:24.270
<v Speaker 2>So not only am I in this desert but I'm at altitude doing this thing.</v>

672
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.143
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

673
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.650
<v Speaker 4>did you train it out to two?</v>

674
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:33.650
<v Speaker 4>Did use like one of those tents to sleep in or,</v>

675
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.061
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

676
00:17:34.061 --> 00:17:36.520
<v Speaker 2>so there's this gym that Mike and I train out of,</v>

677
00:17:36.521 --> 00:17:37.241
<v Speaker 2>it's called evolution,</v>

678
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:38.680
<v Speaker 2>healthcare and fitness in Portland.</v>

679
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.340
<v Speaker 2>They actually have an altitude room there so that it's not even a tent,</v>

680
00:17:42.341 --> 00:17:43.390
<v Speaker 2>but they actually have a full,</v>

681
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.040
<v Speaker 2>a full room where you can,</v>

682
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

683
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.450
<v Speaker 2>got rowing machines.</v>

684
00:17:46.451 --> 00:17:47.290
<v Speaker 2>It's got treadmills.</v>

685
00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:49.090
<v Speaker 2>It's got all that simulated up to about 14.</v>

686
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.303
<v Speaker 2>How big is the room?</v>

687
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.890
<v Speaker 2>It's about 400 square feet.</v>

688
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 2>High ceilings,</v>

689
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:53.881
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

690
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not like huge big enough.</v>

691
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:55.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

692
00:17:55.911 --> 00:17:56.850
<v Speaker 2>it's like a proper room.</v>

693
00:17:56.851 --> 00:17:59.970
<v Speaker 2>I've been in some of those tents before when I was racing triathlon many years</v>

694
00:17:59.970 --> 00:17:59.971
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

695
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were starting to sleep in those tents,</v>

696
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:04.700
<v Speaker 2>but black people have a hard time and then they get warm and stuff like that and</v>

697
00:18:04.701 --> 00:18:06.240
<v Speaker 2>a lot fighters use them as well.</v>

698
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

699
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

700
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.431
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

701
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty cool to have a full room that you can actually,</v>

702
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

703
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.060
<v Speaker 2>be in and move in properly,</v>

704
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

705
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.781
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

706
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:14.490
<v Speaker 2>to stimulate some of the high intensity stuff.</v>

707
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

708
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.060
<v Speaker 2>And so it would take you hours every day to make your water?</v>

709
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:18.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

710
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I would say I was boiling water for about three,</v>

711
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:21.600
<v Speaker 2>four hours per day.</v>

712
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 2>So about hour or two in the morning,</v>

713
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.150
<v Speaker 2>hour or two in the evening.</v>

714
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

715
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot of energy to boil,</v>

716
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:25.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

717
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 2>frozen snow when it's that cold out.</v>

718
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

719
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.070
<v Speaker 2>so you had to care.</v>

720
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I had to carry a lot of fuel.</v>

721
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:32.300
<v Speaker 2>That was the other really heavy component in the sled.</v>

722
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of hours of fuel.</v>

723
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

724
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.390
<v Speaker 2>So I took about,</v>

725
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

726
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 2>17 liters of fuel,</v>

727
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:39.871
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I have,</v>

728
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:41.250
<v Speaker 2>six gallons or something like that.</v>

729
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.830
<v Speaker 2>How'd you know that that was going to be enough?</v>

730
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.001
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

731
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Speaker 2>I did some practicing beforehand.</v>

732
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

733
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

734
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:48.751
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

735
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:53.280
<v Speaker 2>in 2016 I did another world record project where I climbed the tallest mountain</v>

736
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:54.540
<v Speaker 2>on each of the seven continents,</v>

737
00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:56.850
<v Speaker 2>the seven summits as well as went to the north and South Pole,</v>

738
00:18:56.851 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 2>but much smaller polar expeditions a week,</v>

739
00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

740
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 2>basically across crossing the last degree of latitude.</v>

741
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 2>And so when those expeditions off those on Everest,</v>

742
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:04.610
<v Speaker 2>during that time,</v>

743
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Denali,</v>

744
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.440
<v Speaker 2>etc. All of that in 139 days.</v>

745
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

746
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>but I did that and that kind of helped me get a sense of it.</v>

747
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 2>But honestly it was also best guess based on talking to people,</v>

748
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 2>different experts in the field,</v>

749
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

750
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.310
<v Speaker 2>diving into that.</v>

751
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:19.320
<v Speaker 2>But you never know is it going to be enough or too little?</v>

752
00:19:19.321 --> 00:19:20.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm here on the side of too much.</v>

753
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:21.783
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

754
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.340
<v Speaker 2>when you finally got to the end,</v>

755
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:24.300
<v Speaker 2>how much did you have left?</v>

756
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.680
<v Speaker 2>So my final push,</v>

757
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:26.101
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

758
00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:31.101
<v Speaker 2>I woke up on the morning of Christmas Eve 24th of December this past year and it</v>

759
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 2>looked,</v>

760
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I was 77 miles from the finish.</v>

761
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.880
<v Speaker 2>And I had been going at that point,</v>

762
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:36.601
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of the trip,</v>

763
00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I was only going nine,</v>

764
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:38.370
<v Speaker 2>10 miles per day.</v>

765
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:38.971
<v Speaker 2>Towards the end,</v>

766
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I started going about 20,</v>

767
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 2>25 miles per day.</v>

768
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.551
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

769
00:19:41.551 --> 00:19:42.180
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

770
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm about three days out.</v>

771
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.240
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought to myself,</v>

772
00:19:45.241 --> 00:19:47.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe if I could push really hard these next two days,</v>

773
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I could do it in two days,</v>

774
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:50.430
<v Speaker 2>like two 15 plus hour days.</v>

775
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Like really get into it and started looking at my fuel and food supplies and</v>

776
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 2>like they were pretty low.</v>

777
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

778
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.131
<v Speaker 2>I had enough fuel,</v>

779
00:19:57.131 --> 00:19:57.391
<v Speaker 2>a few,</v>

780
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:58.590
<v Speaker 2>a few liters of fuel,</v>

781
00:19:58.591 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 2>but I actually want to had about a day or two of food,</v>

782
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.490
<v Speaker 2>like real substantial food left.</v>

783
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

784
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 2>and so I woke up and I was like,</v>

785
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:05.791
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

786
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 2>let's go for this.</v>

787
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.540
<v Speaker 2>And in the actually deepest talk about flow states,</v>

788
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.460
<v Speaker 2>that was the deepest flow state of my life.</v>

789
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I woke up in one hour and that day it's Christmas morning.</v>

790
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Now I wake up and I'm just locked in and I just came.</v>

791
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I didn't tell anyone back home,</v>

792
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 2>didn't tell my wife who was tracking me.</v>

793
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.930
<v Speaker 2>They had this gps tracker where they could follow me,</v>

794
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:22.770
<v Speaker 2>but I was just in my mind,</v>

795
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

796
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:23.970
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

797
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 2>not not three days,</v>

798
00:20:25.081 --> 00:20:25.771
<v Speaker 2>not two days.</v>

799
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:27.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm going straight for it.</v>

800
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:32.570
<v Speaker 2>And so I did a final 32 hour continuous push on day 54 77 miles straight,</v>

801
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 2>drag of my sled all the way to get to the finish line in one continuous push.</v>

802
00:20:37.981 --> 00:20:38.641
<v Speaker 2>No music,</v>

803
00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:39.241
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>

804
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Just like in my head in this,</v>

805
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:42.760
<v Speaker 2>in this crazy flow state of,</v>

806
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.130
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

807
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.090
<v Speaker 2>high performance.</v>

808
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

809
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:46.411
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

810
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:46.860
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

811
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 2>it was a crazy final push to get there,</v>

812
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:51.130
<v Speaker 2>but made it right before the food and fuel ran out.</v>

813
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.063
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

814
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>

815
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no one there of course,</v>

816
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 2>like you crossed the finish side.</v>

817
00:20:57.041 --> 00:20:57.281
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

818
00:20:57.281 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Speaker 2>done this.</v>

819
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 2>No one in the world has ever done this.</v>

820
00:20:59.081 --> 00:20:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Applause.</v>

821
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.393
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

822
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

823
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.220
<v Speaker 2>And so what do you do when you get to the end?</v>

824
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:03.971
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>

825
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:04.211
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

826
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:04.721
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

827
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Come get me.</v>

828
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:05.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

829
00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

830
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 2>How long does it take for them to come get you?</v>

831
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 2>It took me a week to get out of Antarctica.</v>

832
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:10.451
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

833
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:13.440
<v Speaker 2>It took actually me four days to get a,</v>

834
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.120
<v Speaker 2>but there was a crazy other component to this,</v>

835
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 2>which is no one in the world had ever done this before.</v>

836
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:19.361
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

837
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.400
<v Speaker 2>a few really talented people,</v>

838
00:21:21.401 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 2>some of the best explorers in the world had tried recently.</v>

839
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:24.490
<v Speaker 2>One guy died.</v>

840
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

841
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.390
<v Speaker 2>and it just so happened there's a really specific season where you can attempt</v>

842
00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:28.691
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

843
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:31.810
<v Speaker 2>But another guy was attempting this at the exact same time as me.</v>

844
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm a British,</v>

845
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 2>a British guy who's a equivalent of a navy seal,</v>

846
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:36.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

847
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 2>British special forces.</v>

848
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 2>The living most experienced guy in Antarctica is actually pulled 3000 plus miles</v>

849
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 2>and an article now on various expeditions.</v>

850
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 2>And so we got dropped off one mile away from each other to begin this thing.</v>

851
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

852
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 2>obviously I was the first,</v>

853
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 2>I did win this race head to head and at the finish line I waited for him for a</v>

854
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 2>few days cause I wanted to congratulate him cause he did ultimately finish.</v>

855
00:21:58.031 --> 00:21:59.020
<v Speaker 2>But you can only imagine.</v>

856
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I would feel going back to that first hour where I was like,</v>

857
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible.</v>

858
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 2>It was also like,</v>

859
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible and bow the,</v>

860
00:22:04.001 --> 00:22:04.571
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

861
00:22:04.571 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 2>this navy seal dude who knows more about Antarctica to me,</v>

862
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.253
<v Speaker 2>he's often going,</v>

863
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I can see him at a distance just like leaving me in the dust.</v>

864
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

865
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.500
<v Speaker 2>but fortunately after day six I caught up to him,</v>

866
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

867
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I waved to him and this weird like passing of the torch moment,</v>

868
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 2>like I was passing him and then I never saw him again till I finished and I</v>

869
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:23.890
<v Speaker 2>finished about 70 miles ahead of him,</v>

870
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:25.030
<v Speaker 2>about two and a half days ahead of them.</v>

871
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.950
<v Speaker 2>That's got to suck for him.</v>

872
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Or I got this mother Fucker,</v>

873
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I brought it home for America,</v>

874
00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:32.141
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

875
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:32.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

876
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:33.551
<v Speaker 2>appreciate that.</v>

877
00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:33.981
<v Speaker 2>We all,</v>

878
00:22:33.981 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 2>we all appreciate that,</v>

879
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.071
<v Speaker 2>but still,</v>

880
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:37.180
<v Speaker 2>that's going suck for him.</v>

881
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:37.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

882
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 2>So I actually,</v>

883
00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 2>even though I finished and the first thing I could have kind of wanted to do,</v>

884
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had,</v>

885
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had a shower.</v>

886
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

887
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.040
<v Speaker 2>I actually to save weight so I could get as much food and fuel.</v>

888
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.770
<v Speaker 2>My sled,</v>

889
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:48.760
<v Speaker 2>I brought no extra clothes,</v>

890
00:22:48.761 --> 00:22:49.810
<v Speaker 2>no extra pair of underwear,</v>

891
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 2>like literally no extra pair of underwear.</v>

892
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to paradise.</v>

893
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.820
<v Speaker 2>So where are you shitting out there?</v>

894
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to know this.</v>

895
00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Let's just get it on the table.</v>

896
00:22:57.581 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I let,</v>

897
00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 2>thank you for asking.</v>

898
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.063
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

899
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I basically,</v>

900
00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I described that vestibule situation.</v>

901
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:05.270
<v Speaker 2>So one side I cook in,</v>

902
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

903
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.150
<v Speaker 2>If the wind is calm,</v>

904
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I get out of my tent,</v>

905
00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 2>dig a hole and you know,</v>

906
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.840
<v Speaker 2>go shit and a whole basically.</v>

907
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.250
<v Speaker 2>But when it's real windy,</v>

908
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:12.881
<v Speaker 2>like those storms,</v>

909
00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 2>I just watched like you're going to get frostbite if you try to,</v>

910
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:14.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

911
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.491
<v Speaker 2>bend over,</v>

912
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:17.290
<v Speaker 2>pull your pants down when it's minus 80 out.</v>

913
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.760
<v Speaker 2>So in the vest if you will,</v>

914
00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:19.320
<v Speaker 2>of my tent,</v>

915
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 2>not the side I'm cooking on,</v>

916
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:22.810
<v Speaker 2>but the other side where I'm still inside covered,</v>

917
00:23:22.811 --> 00:23:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I dig a hole in there and that was my morning routine.</v>

918
00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Get up at 6:00 AM,</v>

919
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:29.770
<v Speaker 2>start boiling my water on one side of my tent and it's not glamorous.</v>

920
00:23:29.771 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not a pretty thing.</v>

921
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 2>And to make up,</v>

922
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:32.801
<v Speaker 2>actually to me,</v>

923
00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:34.750
<v Speaker 2>this is very cool but also not glamorous.</v>

924
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

925
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 2>within one degree of latitude of the south pole.</v>

926
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 2>So the last degree of ladders at 89 degrees to south pole at 90 degrees.</v>

927
00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:45.380
<v Speaker 2>It's basically 69 miles or 60 nautical miles circumference around the South Pole</v>

928
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.080
<v Speaker 2>and article being as pristine as it is,</v>

929
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:50.420
<v Speaker 2>they have all these laws about environmental conservation,</v>

930
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:51.500
<v Speaker 2>which to me is amazing.</v>

931
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Being someone who just loves and has a great steward of the land,</v>

932
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.920
<v Speaker 2>they actually say you can't even leave your human waste in holes here even</v>

933
00:23:57.921 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 2>though there's nobody out there.</v>

934
00:23:58.881 --> 00:23:59.181
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

935
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:01.430
<v Speaker 2>we want this to be completely protected area.</v>

936
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 2>And so yes,</v>

937
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 2>usually my sled was getting lighter most of the time cause I was eating food</v>

938
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 2>everyday and burning fuel.</v>

939
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:10.370
<v Speaker 2>But in that last degree of latitude to the south pole and crossing it,</v>

940
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.600
<v Speaker 2>I was shitting in a bag,</v>

941
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.890
<v Speaker 2>wrapping it up and putting it in my sled and having to carry it with me.</v>

942
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.570
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>

943
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

944
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

945
00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:19.840
<v Speaker 2>It shows disciplines</v>

946
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.870
<v Speaker 5>should I was something a lot of people have been like,</v>

947
00:24:23.871 --> 00:24:24.441
<v Speaker 5>hey yeah,</v>

948
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:25.274
<v Speaker 5>I put it in a bag.</v>

949
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.070
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you crazy asshole.</v>

950
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.870
<v Speaker 5>Who cares if I dig a shit up there.</v>

951
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.701
<v Speaker 2>It was tempting,</v>

952
00:24:32.701 --> 00:24:33.061
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

953
00:24:33.061 --> 00:24:35.370
<v Speaker 2>so I grew up in the gold out in the outdoors.</v>

954
00:24:35.371 --> 00:24:37.080
<v Speaker 2>It just as leave no trace principles that I,</v>

955
00:24:37.081 --> 00:24:37.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

956
00:24:37.291 --> 00:24:37.981
<v Speaker 2>I really love.</v>

957
00:24:37.981 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 2>And in particularly in article,</v>

958
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:40.470
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about Antarctica,</v>

959
00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:43.800
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those places where imagine you've traveled far and wide and your</v>

960
00:24:43.801 --> 00:24:44.970
<v Speaker 2>life and there's some few places,</v>

961
00:24:44.971 --> 00:24:46.890
<v Speaker 2>at least in my mind where you just,</v>

962
00:24:46.891 --> 00:24:49.420
<v Speaker 2>you can't put it into words until you've stepped off there.</v>

963
00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.041
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

964
00:24:50.041 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 2>this is my second time in an article.</v>

965
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.493
<v Speaker 2>Both times,</v>

966
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:52.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

967
00:24:52.711 --> 00:24:54.900
<v Speaker 2>this big cargo ship basically lands you on the continent.</v>

968
00:24:54.901 --> 00:24:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Then you get an a smaller plane to get dropped off to where I needed to start on</v>

969
00:24:57.361 --> 00:24:58.111
<v Speaker 2>the edge of the continent.</v>

970
00:24:58.111 --> 00:25:00.420
<v Speaker 2>But both times stepping off the plane,</v>

971
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm just shit eating grin ear to ear on my face because I just am like,</v>

972
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:05.341
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

973
00:25:05.341 --> 00:25:06.360
<v Speaker 2>what is this place?</v>

974
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Even the second time seeing it,</v>

975
00:25:07.591 --> 00:25:08.101
<v Speaker 2>I felt that I'd like,</v>

976
00:25:08.101 --> 00:25:10.860
<v Speaker 2>my cheeks were sore because I was just smiling.</v>

977
00:25:10.861 --> 00:25:13.470
<v Speaker 2>So big of just pristine beauty.</v>

978
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.970
<v Speaker 2>The blank canvas.</v>

979
00:25:14.971 --> 00:25:15.151
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

980
00:25:15.151 --> 00:25:15.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

981
00:25:15.451 --> 00:25:16.650
<v Speaker 2>you look out on the land and you're like,</v>

982
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.070
<v Speaker 2>human footprints haven't touched 98% of the continents,</v>

983
00:25:20.071 --> 00:25:20.671
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

984
00:25:20.671 --> 00:25:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's untouched.</v>

985
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.610
<v Speaker 2>And so shitting in a bag,</v>

986
00:25:23.611 --> 00:25:27.450
<v Speaker 2>if I had to do that to do my part to keep it that way,</v>

987
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

988
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.000
<v Speaker 2>I did you drag?</v>

989
00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

990
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.400
<v Speaker 2>at the end it was about three.</v>

991
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I reuse the bag.</v>

992
00:25:33.491 --> 00:25:34.324
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

993
00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.430
<v Speaker 2>one per day for that section is about hundred 20 miles.</v>

994
00:25:38.431 --> 00:25:38.761
<v Speaker 2>It took me,</v>

995
00:25:38.761 --> 00:25:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

996
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.740
<v Speaker 2>a week or so to cover that distance.</v>

997
00:25:40.741 --> 00:25:41.390
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

998
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

999
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:42.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1000
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.420
<v Speaker 2>added,</v>

1001
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.700
<v Speaker 2>added weight to my sled rather than subtracting during.</v>

1002
00:25:44.701 --> 00:25:47.640
<v Speaker 2>That was the middle part of the journey right around the 30th and 40th day.</v>

1003
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Now how did you calculate your nutrition?</v>

1004
00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.420
<v Speaker 2>The nutrition journey was actually fascinating and to be honest,</v>

1005
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.201
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

1006
00:25:55.201 --> 00:25:55.561
<v Speaker 2>people said,</v>

1007
00:25:55.561 --> 00:25:55.930
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1008
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.330
<v Speaker 2>how come other people die trying?</v>

1009
00:25:57.331 --> 00:25:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Or why did other people not be able to do it?</v>

1010
00:25:58.951 --> 00:26:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Because one other guy ran out of food.</v>

1011
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.490
<v Speaker 2>And so when I was looking at this journey,</v>

1012
00:26:02.491 --> 00:26:02.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1013
00:26:02.701 --> 00:26:02.821
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1014
00:26:02.821 --> 00:26:03.050
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1015
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.530
<v Speaker 2>we were calling it the impossible first.</v>

1016
00:26:04.531 --> 00:26:04.681
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1017
00:26:04.681 --> 00:26:06.900
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to make the impossible possible?</v>

1018
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.780
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that the nutrition piece of it was going to be huge.</v>

1019
00:26:09.781 --> 00:26:10.614
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

1020
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.690
<v Speaker 2>my dad's an organic farmer in Hawaii,</v>

1021
00:26:12.691 --> 00:26:15.960
<v Speaker 2>like whole food health and nutrition has been a big part of my personal journey.</v>

1022
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.390
<v Speaker 2>And so I found a company that was really in it with me.</v>

1023
00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:22.020
<v Speaker 2>So this company called standard process,</v>

1024
00:26:22.021 --> 00:26:23.730
<v Speaker 2>there are whole food supplement company.</v>

1025
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:29.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm really involved in Chiropractic and acupuncture and they presented them with</v>

1026
00:26:29.251 --> 00:26:29.731
<v Speaker 2>this and I said,</v>

1027
00:26:29.731 --> 00:26:29.911
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1028
00:26:29.911 --> 00:26:30.780
<v Speaker 2>what do you guys think?</v>

1029
00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Like is there a way to like figure this out?</v>

1030
00:26:33.061 --> 00:26:33.421
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1031
00:26:33.421 --> 00:26:35.460
<v Speaker 2>well we have 20 of the top doctors,</v>

1032
00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:36.161
<v Speaker 2>nutritionists,</v>

1033
00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:37.200
<v Speaker 2>food scientists,</v>

1034
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:37.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1035
00:26:37.771 --> 00:26:40.410
<v Speaker 2>on our staff and this innovation center around nutrition,</v>

1036
00:26:40.411 --> 00:26:41.970
<v Speaker 2>like come in the lab with us.</v>

1037
00:26:41.971 --> 00:26:44.670
<v Speaker 2>And so they'd never done this with an athlete before,</v>

1038
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 2>but they were intrigued.</v>

1039
00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 2>And so I actually went and did a year's long worth of,</v>

1040
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:48.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1041
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:49.850
<v Speaker 2>a hundred plus blood test,</v>

1042
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.910
<v Speaker 2>vo two Max test,</v>

1043
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:53.130
<v Speaker 2>all this fitness testing all around my physiology.</v>

1044
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:57.210
<v Speaker 2>And they created ultimately a custom food solution as I a bar form essentially</v>

1045
00:26:57.211 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 2>called the column Bar.</v>

1046
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.030
<v Speaker 2>That was all whole food ingredients.</v>

1047
00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:00.451
<v Speaker 2>It was no,</v>

1048
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:00.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1049
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 2>chemical to rivers or anything.</v>

1050
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:02.160
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1051
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1052
00:27:02.341 --> 00:27:03.360
<v Speaker 2>coconut oil,</v>

1053
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:03.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1054
00:27:03.631 --> 00:27:04.171
<v Speaker 2>seeds,</v>

1055
00:27:04.171 --> 00:27:04.771
<v Speaker 2>nuts,</v>

1056
00:27:04.771 --> 00:27:04.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1057
00:27:04.951 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 2>all these different pieces of macronutrients as well as micronutrient blends</v>

1058
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:08.851
<v Speaker 2>that I needed,</v>

1059
00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 2>but custom tailored to my physiology.</v>

1060
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1061
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:12.961
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I mean.</v>

1062
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:14.160
<v Speaker 2>That was the bulk of what I ate.</v>

1063
00:27:14.161 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I ate 7,000 calories per day.</v>

1064
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I was burning 10,000,</v>

1065
00:27:18.061 --> 00:27:19.080
<v Speaker 2>so even at 7,000,</v>

1066
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I was losing about a pound of day,</v>

1067
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 2>a way of weight almost,</v>

1068
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:22.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1069
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.061
<v Speaker 2>to my body.</v>

1070
00:27:23.061 --> 00:27:24.420
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I needed to get bigger.</v>

1071
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.870
<v Speaker 2>But these column bars just burned super efficiently and my body,</v>

1072
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:30.090
<v Speaker 2>like it was just the perfect blend of everything.</v>

1073
00:27:30.091 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 2>So eating the same thing every single day for 54 days might have gotten a little</v>

1074
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:33.271
<v Speaker 2>bit boring,</v>

1075
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 2>but my body was just,</v>

1076
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.670
<v Speaker 2>it was actually pretty dialed in.</v>

1077
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.773
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1078
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.230
<v Speaker 6>Now when they did this and they,</v>

1079
00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.440
<v Speaker 6>they made these custom bars for you,</v>

1080
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.540
<v Speaker 6>did they know how,</v>

1081
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:43.821
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1082
00:27:43.821 --> 00:27:46.970
<v Speaker 6>how did you know how many calories you're going to be burning where you're</v>

1083
00:27:46.971 --> 00:27:48.710
<v Speaker 6>pulling this 300 pound sled?</v>

1084
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.570
<v Speaker 6>Was it dependent upon the conditions?</v>

1085
00:27:50.571 --> 00:27:54.460
<v Speaker 6>Like if the snow was more packed or IC,</v>

1086
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.120
<v Speaker 6>it be difficult.</v>

1087
00:27:56.121 --> 00:27:57.770
<v Speaker 6>If it was some soft,</v>

1088
00:27:57.771 --> 00:27:58.260
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1089
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.750
<v Speaker 2>100% so I mean we had to use our best guests,</v>

1090
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

1091
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.250
<v Speaker 2>we had to just say,</v>

1092
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.360
<v Speaker 2>let you use our best gas.</v>

1093
00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I had guys had a bunch of smart people smarter than me.</v>

1094
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:06.211
<v Speaker 2>We're in this room,</v>

1095
00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:06.961
<v Speaker 2>all these doctors,</v>

1096
00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:08.160
<v Speaker 2>these PhDs around this.</v>

1097
00:28:08.161 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Speaker 2>And we had to make some assumptions and ultimately they were like,</v>

1098
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:11.221
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1099
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 2>you're going to burn 10,000 calories.</v>

1100
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's get you 10,000 calories in these bars.</v>

1101
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.860
<v Speaker 2>And we started running the weight on the sled and we're like,</v>

1102
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.420
<v Speaker 2>that'll be a 500 pound sled.</v>

1103
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Like we can't carry that.</v>

1104
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's this equation of like,</v>

1105
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 2>can you make this led light enough to pull if we can get the nutrition right,</v>

1106
00:28:25.531 --> 00:28:27.210
<v Speaker 2>how efficiently does that burn in your body?</v>

1107
00:28:27.211 --> 00:28:28.710
<v Speaker 2>How much can your stomach absorb?</v>

1108
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 2>You're hungry the whole time.</v>

1109
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.141
<v Speaker 2>More or less?</v>

1110
00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1111
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>

1112
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1113
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I was ready for a big fucking meal.</v>

1114
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:35.463
<v Speaker 2>I got done.</v>

1115
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 2>What's the first thing you ate?</v>

1116
00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1117
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1118
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.880
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I ate when I got back was a big burger.</v>

1119
00:28:41.881 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 2>But you might call me lame for saying this,</v>

1120
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:45.210
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just going to say,</v>

1121
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:46.044
<v Speaker 2>cause it's the truth.</v>

1122
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.550
<v Speaker 2>What I craved was salad man.</v>

1123
00:28:47.551 --> 00:28:48.990
<v Speaker 2>What I craved was just something,</v>

1124
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:50.641
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1125
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I've been eating like this freeze dried field.</v>

1126
00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:54.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like chunk of Colombar,</v>

1127
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:55.111
<v Speaker 2>which got me through,</v>

1128
00:28:55.111 --> 00:28:57.480
<v Speaker 2>but it was like something green and alive.</v>

1129
00:28:57.481 --> 00:29:00.330
<v Speaker 2>And so I like this big salad with avocado and sadly,</v>

1130
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1131
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.410
<v Speaker 2>I had a big burger too.</v>

1132
00:29:01.411 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Speaker 2>But then of course I eat,</v>

1133
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:04.110
<v Speaker 2>my stomach has shrunk,</v>

1134
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:04.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1135
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I eat this big meal and I'm like,</v>

1136
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 2>oh my stomach of hurts.</v>

1137
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 2>But mostly I was like,</v>

1138
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm back in the real world baby.</v>

1139
00:29:10.981 --> 00:29:11.610
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

1140
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.530
<v Speaker 2>it was everything I could get my hands.</v>

1141
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:14.341
<v Speaker 2>I went to a buffet,</v>

1142
00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 2>it just was like my stomach was hurting,</v>

1143
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:15.930
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

1144
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stop.</v>

1145
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:21.921
<v Speaker 2>And I just started eating like whatever croissants and bread was all the things.</v>

1146
00:29:22.231 --> 00:29:22.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1147
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:23.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1148
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.810
<v Speaker 6>imagine your body would like you probably craving all that life.</v>

1149
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 6>Why live things green?</v>

1150
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.521
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1151
00:29:30.521 --> 00:29:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Vegetables and fruit.</v>

1152
00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:33.401
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to say,</v>

1153
00:29:33.401 --> 00:29:34.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I'm from Portland,</v>

1154
00:29:34.541 --> 00:29:34.991
<v Speaker 2>Oregon,</v>

1155
00:29:34.991 --> 00:29:35.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1156
00:29:35.261 --> 00:29:39.070
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty green part of the world up there in the Pacific northwest and not</v>

1157
00:29:39.071 --> 00:29:39.870
<v Speaker 2>even just the,</v>

1158
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:40.960
<v Speaker 2>the food component,</v>

1159
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 2>an art.</v>

1160
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.940
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing alive out there.</v>

1161
00:29:42.941 --> 00:29:44.750
<v Speaker 2>There's no animals on the coast.</v>

1162
00:29:44.751 --> 00:29:44.921
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>

1163
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:46.950
<v Speaker 2>But like in the interior and I see any animals.</v>

1164
00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:47.771
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a bird.</v>

1165
00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see nothing.</v>

1166
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1167
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 2>And so not only have,</v>

1168
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I think as humans we're kind of wired to see things living.</v>

1169
00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean even here in La,</v>

1170
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:56.890
<v Speaker 2>a bit of a concrete jungle,</v>

1171
00:29:56.891 --> 00:29:58.210
<v Speaker 2>but like you see trees on this tree,</v>

1172
00:29:58.211 --> 00:29:59.044
<v Speaker 2>you see the ocean,</v>

1173
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.010
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1174
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what a Nazi,</v>

1175
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.040
<v Speaker 2>anything alive for 54 days.</v>

1176
00:30:03.041 --> 00:30:03.461
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1177
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:03.671
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1178
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I want to like smell trees,</v>

1179
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:06.940
<v Speaker 2>fresh air and the trees.</v>

1180
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I want to eat a salad.</v>

1181
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:08.321
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1182
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Like that's where I'm like my mind got to is kind of coming back to reality in</v>

1183
00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:12.800
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>

1184
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.161
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1185
00:30:13.161 --> 00:30:16.610
<v Speaker 6>So when they're constructing these bars for you,</v>

1186
00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.880
<v Speaker 6>and this is all based on your body and like what burns well with you,</v>

1187
00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.720
<v Speaker 6>how do they like in terms of like how many cat,</v>

1188
00:30:26.721 --> 00:30:31.721
<v Speaker 6>what's the best food in terms of weight versus calories and is there some foods</v>

1189
00:30:32.541 --> 00:30:34.520
<v Speaker 6>that are heavier but don't have as many calories?</v>

1190
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1191
00:30:34.961 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 2>so I think I'm going to get the numbers pretty close to right here,</v>

1192
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Speaker 2>but I think per hour fat of course of the macronutrients we got protein,</v>

1193
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:43.930
<v Speaker 2>fat and carbs.</v>

1194
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1195
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1196
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1197
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.530
<v Speaker 2>fat is the most calorie dense of the mall.</v>

1198
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 2>You have to make sure these things don't freeze solid.</v>

1199
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.411
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1200
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:51.244
<v Speaker 2>So that was one of the,</v>

1201
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 2>it was minus 25 and my sled every single day.</v>

1202
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:56.800
<v Speaker 2>So it had to actually be edible while frozen essentially.</v>

1203
00:30:56.801 --> 00:30:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Cause it'd be too hard to rewarm them.</v>

1204
00:30:58.391 --> 00:31:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Cause this was a food I was eating outside of my sled.</v>

1205
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.610
<v Speaker 2>So what actually frozen too frozen too.</v>

1206
00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:05.020
<v Speaker 2>But actually where we,</v>

1207
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 2>where the work around happened,</v>

1208
00:31:06.311 --> 00:31:07.690
<v Speaker 2>where they kind of their mastermind was,</v>

1209
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:07.991
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

1210
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:12.040
<v Speaker 2>you actually need this macro nutrient plan to be about 40 or 45% fats because I</v>

1211
00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 2>needed high fat food,</v>

1212
00:31:13.211 --> 00:31:13.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1213
00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1214
00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.550
<v Speaker 2>to stay alive out there.</v>

1215
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.430
<v Speaker 2>And so they basically pumped it full of coconut oil,</v>

1216
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.630
<v Speaker 2>which ultimately,</v>

1217
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:20.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1218
00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.371
<v Speaker 2>does it,</v>

1219
00:31:20.371 --> 00:31:20.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1220
00:31:20.531 --> 00:31:21.730
<v Speaker 2>you see coconut on the shelf,</v>

1221
00:31:21.731 --> 00:31:22.451
<v Speaker 2>it's not a liquid.</v>

1222
00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a solid,</v>

1223
00:31:23.321 --> 00:31:25.000
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't freeze like rock solid.</v>

1224
00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:27.640
<v Speaker 2>So having that much coconut oil in it allowed it to,</v>

1225
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:31.180
<v Speaker 2>we actually had to get it shipped down frozen because if it didn't freeze it</v>

1226
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:31.570
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>

1227
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:32.950
<v Speaker 2>it actually kind of got like flat.</v>

1228
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:34.450
<v Speaker 2>And so they put it in these freeze dried packs,</v>

1229
00:31:34.451 --> 00:31:35.500
<v Speaker 2>shipped it down to Chile,</v>

1230
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:37.450
<v Speaker 2>had to do this whole customs thing to import it.</v>

1231
00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:38.021
<v Speaker 2>It was like a whole,</v>

1232
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:39.550
<v Speaker 2>like crazy logistical mess.</v>

1233
00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1234
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 2>but got that done and it actually held up so that it was enough fat in there</v>

1235
00:31:43.271 --> 00:31:45.370
<v Speaker 2>that I could actually bite off chunks of this rather than,</v>

1236
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:45.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1237
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of stories of guys and he's cold places breaking teeth on Clif</v>

1238
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 2>bars and you know,</v>

1239
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.741
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

1240
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:51.330
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1241
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:51.701
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1242
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:52.950
<v Speaker 2>the column bars were,</v>

1243
00:31:52.951 --> 00:31:53.211
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

1244
00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:55.030
<v Speaker 2>were at good Goodwell frozen.</v>

1245
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's mostly</v>

1246
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.060
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of fats and seeds and</v>

1247
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:04.961
<v Speaker 2>seasoned nuts.</v>

1248
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:06.460
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing is that they,</v>

1249
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:06.970
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1250
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.480
<v Speaker 2>they're their bread and butter at this company.</v>

1251
00:32:08.481 --> 00:32:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Standard processes,</v>

1252
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 2>they're a supplement company,</v>

1253
00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:11.201
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1254
00:32:11.201 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's all whole food derivative.</v>

1255
00:32:12.521 --> 00:32:14.170
<v Speaker 2>So organic farm,</v>

1256
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 2>basically a vitamins.</v>

1257
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And so they actually intermixed like probiotics and magnesium and like beat</v>

1258
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:24.670
<v Speaker 2>extract and all these sorts of plant derivatives as well to give me the Fido</v>

1259
00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:25.421
<v Speaker 2>nutrients I need.</v>

1260
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:26.470
<v Speaker 2>That's not giving me the calories,</v>

1261
00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:27.304
<v Speaker 2>but that's giving me the,</v>

1262
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.750
<v Speaker 2>and I stayed healthy the whole time and I got super worn down.</v>

1263
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I got super skinny,</v>

1264
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:30.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1265
00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:31.750
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff.</v>

1266
00:32:31.751 --> 00:32:33.370
<v Speaker 2>But I actually stayed,</v>

1267
00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:33.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1268
00:32:33.491 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I never got sick,</v>

1269
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:34.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1270
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:35.561
<v Speaker 2>I still healthy.</v>

1271
00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:35.840
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

1272
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.651
<v Speaker 6>was my other question.</v>

1273
00:32:36.651 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 6>Like what was the plan if you did get sick it was just to wait it out</v>

1274
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.873
<v Speaker 2>in the tent,</v>

1275
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:41.960
<v Speaker 2>waited out in the tent.</v>

1276
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:42.441
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1277
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:42.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1278
00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:43.520
<v Speaker 2>there there's,</v>

1279
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.620
<v Speaker 2>there is a contact with anything though.</v>

1280
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1281
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.963
<v Speaker 2>So I had,</v>

1282
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.141
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple of things.</v>

1283
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:50.060
<v Speaker 2>One is I had my gps,</v>

1284
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.100
<v Speaker 2>which I was paying a satellite every 10 but I mean is a life form so no,</v>

1285
00:32:54.101 --> 00:32:54.934
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1286
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1287
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:55.371
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1288
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:56.204
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1289
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1290
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.320
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1291
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1292
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.311
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1293
00:32:58.311 --> 00:32:59.480
<v Speaker 2>So that part of it,</v>

1294
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.680
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing out there.</v>

1295
00:33:00.681 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 2>So basically if you get a bacteria,</v>

1296
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 2>you've brought it out there.</v>

1297
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.560
<v Speaker 2>So they actually idea was more or less to get out there healthy rather than you</v>

1298
00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:08.900
<v Speaker 2>can stay pretty healthy in terms of bacteria and stuff.</v>

1299
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Of course you can get pretty worn down and sick and the cold or flu like</v>

1300
00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:16.620
<v Speaker 2>symptoms or that something you had when you land.</v>

1301
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.211
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1302
00:33:17.211 --> 00:33:17.541
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's,</v>

1303
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:19.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's nothing out there and are you,</v>

1304
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.630
<v Speaker 2>were you concerned about that?</v>

1305
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Because like I would imagine like the anticipation leading up to it is a little</v>

1306
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:27.770
<v Speaker 2>stressful and sometimes your immune system can get run down.</v>

1307
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh a hundred percent.</v>

1308
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:29.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1309
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.200
<v Speaker 2>of course it,</v>

1310
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:31.034
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1311
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.880
<v Speaker 2>it's fun to recount the epic parts of these journeys are my other,</v>

1312
00:33:34.881 --> 00:33:35.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1313
00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:38.570
<v Speaker 2>world records climbing Everest or this summit day or this push or whatever.</v>

1314
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.310
<v Speaker 2>But anything that's this long duration,</v>

1315
00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:41.540
<v Speaker 2>this was 54 days.</v>

1316
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:41.991
<v Speaker 2>The world record,</v>

1317
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

1318
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.300
<v Speaker 2>2006 was 139 days.</v>

1319
00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Like the boring answer is like,</v>

1320
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:46.251
<v Speaker 2>how did you do it?</v>

1321
00:33:46.251 --> 00:33:46.521
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1322
00:33:46.521 --> 00:33:46.791
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1323
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:50.030
<v Speaker 2>like I washed my hands really code when I went to the airport and I didn't eat</v>

1324
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:51.480
<v Speaker 2>this like food off the street and I,</v>

1325
00:33:51.481 --> 00:33:51.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1326
00:33:51.741 --> 00:33:52.670
<v Speaker 2>staying healthy,</v>

1327
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 2>you can't get that right.</v>

1328
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1329
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.030
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

1330
00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:56.864
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1331
00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.580
<v Speaker 2>imagine you were on the flight headed out there and some dude next to sneezing.</v>

1332
00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1333
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1334
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.151
<v Speaker 2>Mother,</v>

1335
00:34:02.151 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

1336
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:03.920
<v Speaker 2>There was a couple of times,</v>

1337
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:04.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1338
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 2>when I raised triathlon many years ago,</v>

1339
00:34:06.171 --> 00:34:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I think I raised in something like 25 countries over the world,</v>

1340
00:34:08.721 --> 00:34:10.790
<v Speaker 2>different places and there are three or four times I can remember,</v>

1341
00:34:10.791 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 2>like I remember one time I flew to the Philippines.</v>

1342
00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:15.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a place called Subic Bay gearing up for this big race.</v>

1343
00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:16.341
<v Speaker 2>And sure enough,</v>

1344
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:17.270
<v Speaker 2>the night before the race,</v>

1345
00:34:17.271 --> 00:34:18.830
<v Speaker 2>just like diarrhea,</v>

1346
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:20.990
<v Speaker 2>like crazy puke in my brains out.</v>

1347
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.860
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1348
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I jumped into,</v>

1349
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I jump into the swim swim in the ocean,</v>

1350
00:34:24.471 --> 00:34:24.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1351
00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a milestone and feeling like shit.</v>

1352
00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:26.241
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1353
00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:26.331
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1354
00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try through all the Philippines.</v>

1355
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I got to do this race,</v>

1356
00:34:29.181 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1357
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Sure enough on the bike.</v>

1358
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I get on my bike and my bike,</v>

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:45.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1377

1380
00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:51.490
<v Speaker 2>while you're pulling a 375 pounds sled in it and article.</v>

1381
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.921
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1382
00:34:52.921 --> 00:34:53.661
<v Speaker 2>Was that a pretty well,</v>

1383
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:56.450
<v Speaker 2>but that is not a pretty bad place with the one pair of underwear that it gets</v>

1384
00:34:56.451 --> 00:34:56.990
<v Speaker 2>even more.</v>

<v Speaker 2>stay unhealthy was,</v>

1387
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.470
<v Speaker 2>was super key to all of this.</v>

00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 2>but there's a photo of my Instagram that's kind of shows a little bit of the</v>

1443
00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:14.940
<v Speaker 2>before and the after body shot,</v>

1444
00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:15.421
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1445
00:36:15.421 --> 00:36:16.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1446
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:16.321
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1447
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:16.591
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1448
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I was very lean,</v>

1449
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 2>but it was honestly,</v>

1450
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 2>it was also scary.</v>

1451
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Like in the end I think I held up pretty well.</v>

1452
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:23.340
<v Speaker 2>But you're out there by yourself,</v>

1453
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:24.390
<v Speaker 2>you've got no context.</v>

1454
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 2>And so I started looking down at my legs halfway through this journey.</v>

1455
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1456
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1457
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.261
<v Speaker 2>There I am.</v>

1458
00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:31.740
<v Speaker 2>So before and after that much of a difference.</v>

1459
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1460
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:32.971
<v Speaker 2>it's a little,</v>

1461
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:33.804
<v Speaker 2>the light's not great.</v>

1462
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 2>You definitely look a lot more lean.</v>

1463
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 2>More,</v>

1464
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even say a lot more lean.</v>

1465
00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1466
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.670
<v Speaker 2>So it's about 20 pounds different.</v>

1467
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 2>But my mind's playing tricks on me more than anything.</v>

1468
00:36:44.251 --> 00:36:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I looked down at my waist about halfway through and I was like,</v>

1469
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1470
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm falling apart here.</v>

1471
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:52.200
<v Speaker 2>And I actually started getting in my own head about am I losing too much weight?</v>

1472
00:36:52.201 --> 00:36:52.591
<v Speaker 2>Am I not?</v>

1473
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:53.730
<v Speaker 2>But when I,</v>

1474
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 2>when I actually weighed myself afterwards,</v>

1475
00:36:55.261 --> 00:36:56.041
<v Speaker 2>like 20 pounds,</v>

1476
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:57.840
<v Speaker 2>like we thought it could have been as much as 40 pounds.</v>

1477
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:58.610
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1478
00:36:58.610 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 2>only losing 20 pounds.</v>

1479
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 2>All things considered like,</v>

1480
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:00.961
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1481
00:37:00.961 --> 00:37:01.291
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

1482
00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't look that other than that really cool beard that I grew up.</v>

1483
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.153
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1484
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.030
<v Speaker 2>so you were ready to get going?</v>

1485
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:08.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1486
00:37:08.191 --> 00:37:08.561
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

1487
00:37:08.561 --> 00:37:09.570
<v Speaker 2>we have planned for that.</v>

1488
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.291
<v Speaker 2>We have planned for that.</v>

1489
00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:10.711
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

1490
00:37:10.711 --> 00:37:11.491
<v Speaker 2>I started out,</v>

1491
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I started out about one 65 I put myself up to one 85 to leave and I finished at</v>

1492
00:37:15.391 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 2>one 65 so actually finished way more near my sort of natural,</v>

1493
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.100
<v Speaker 2>fairly lean weight for my height.</v>

1494
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Perfect plan.</v>

1495
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.280
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

1496
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of things to be wrong,</v>

1497
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:28.260
<v Speaker 2>but kind of planned out for things going wrong.</v>

1498
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:28.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1499
00:37:28.561 --> 00:37:29.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>

1500
00:37:29.451 --> 00:37:30.121
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably like this,</v>

1501
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:32.670
<v Speaker 2>this was in one one way as a solo effort.</v>

1502
00:37:32.671 --> 00:37:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was out there by myself walking across this,</v>

1503
00:37:34.621 --> 00:37:37.470
<v Speaker 2>but this was a massive team effort from these guys.</v>

1504
00:37:37.471 --> 00:37:38.131
<v Speaker 2>Get behind me,</v>

1505
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:39.180
<v Speaker 2>all these doctors,</v>

1506
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:39.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1507
00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:41.610
<v Speaker 2>all the different people I have supporting me,</v>

1508
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:41.791
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1509
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:42.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1510
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:44.520
<v Speaker 2>my wife and then what she does with all of the media and the,</v>

1511
00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:46.320
<v Speaker 2>our nonprofit and it was the Benny things.</v>

1512
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.360
<v Speaker 2>A lot of pieces go into making this thing happen.</v>

1513
00:37:48.361 --> 00:37:49.740
<v Speaker 2>So it was a team effort for sure.</v>

1514
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Big Time.</v>

1515
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.230
<v Speaker 2>That is so amazing.</v>

1516
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Now at the end you get there,</v>

1517
00:37:54.721 --> 00:37:55.554
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>

1518
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.640
<v Speaker 2>But there's no one there.</v>

1519
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.271
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do?</v>

1520
00:37:57.271 --> 00:37:58.200
<v Speaker 2>You make a phone call?</v>

1521
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1522
00:37:59.400 --> 00:37:59.851
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

1523
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:00.684
<v Speaker 2>Come get me.</v>

1524
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.300
<v Speaker 2>They know where you are because they're tracking you,</v>

1525
00:38:03.301 --> 00:38:03.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1526
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1527
00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:07.110
<v Speaker 2>So what was kind of crazy was that crazy last push,</v>

1528
00:38:07.111 --> 00:38:07.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1529
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:10.770
<v Speaker 2>It's this 32 hour nonstop push,</v>

1530
00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1531
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:11.971
<v Speaker 2>till the end.</v>

1532
00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 2>And so what happened is it's Christmas Day when I start this push.</v>

1533
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 2>And so my whole family,</v>

1534
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:16.651
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1535
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:17.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually,</v>

1536
00:38:17.221 --> 00:38:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I have five older sisters,</v>

1537
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.980
<v Speaker 2>big family,</v>

1538
00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:20.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1539
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:20.401
<v Speaker 2>I'm the,</v>

1540
00:38:20.401 --> 00:38:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm the baby of the bunch and they're all together and Hood River Oregon at my</v>

1541
00:38:23.521 --> 00:38:25.830
<v Speaker 2>sister's house and they're thinking cool.</v>

1542
00:38:25.831 --> 00:38:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Colin's like getting close to end of his project.</v>

1543
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:30.960
<v Speaker 2>We'll track him and everyday they track me on my gps at ping the satellites</v>

1544
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:31.590
<v Speaker 2>every 10 minutes.</v>

1545
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:31.981
<v Speaker 2>So people,</v>

1546
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:32.820
<v Speaker 2>all my Instagram followers,</v>

1547
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 2>anyone could actually follow the progress in real time.</v>

1548
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 2>And they were used to seeing me stop at about 1212 hours into the day.</v>

1549
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 2>So 12 hours into the day happens and they're like,</v>

1550
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:41.861
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1551
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:42.730
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's going another hour,</v>

1552
00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:43.541
<v Speaker 2>13 hours,</v>

1553
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:44.440
<v Speaker 2>14 hours,</v>

1554
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.340
<v Speaker 2>15 hours.</v>

1555
00:38:45.341 --> 00:38:45.731
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1556
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

1557
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:47.381
<v Speaker 2>16 hours.</v>

1558
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:48.760
<v Speaker 2>My whole family is not normally together,</v>

1559
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:50.230
<v Speaker 2>but they're all together cause it's Christmas Day.</v>

1560
00:38:50.231 --> 00:38:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

1561
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.150
<v Speaker 2>18 hours into this push.</v>

1562
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I finally stop and pet up away point because what happened was I ran out of</v>

1563
00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:57.490
<v Speaker 2>water even though I said I'm not stopping.</v>

1564
00:38:57.491 --> 00:38:57.910
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1565
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I only had three liters of water after 18 hours,</v>

1566
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I need more water so I at least have to put my tent up to boil water inside.</v>

1567
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.830
<v Speaker 2>So what I do,</v>

1568
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:06.731
<v Speaker 2>it's now midnight.</v>

1569
00:39:06.731 --> 00:39:08.160
<v Speaker 2>I started at 6:00 AM it's now midnight up.</v>

1570
00:39:08.161 --> 00:39:09.070
<v Speaker 2>We going to 18 hours.</v>

1573

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:25.990
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1585
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.141
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1586
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:26.221
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1587
00:39:26.221 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1588
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not stopping.</v>

1589
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually just boiling water for an hour to continue back out for another</v>

1590
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:31.930
<v Speaker 2>like 14 hours to finish this thing.</v>

1591
00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:32.291
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1592
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:33.124
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1593
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.450
<v Speaker 2>The weather must be really good.</v>

1594
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:34.691
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

1595
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:35.471
<v Speaker 2>you're feeling so good.</v>

1596
00:39:35.471 --> 00:39:36.190
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1597
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.460
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1598
00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.960
<v Speaker 2>actually it's a the worst weather of the entire trip because this massive ground</v>

1599
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:41.471
<v Speaker 2>blizzard blue,</v>

1600
00:39:41.471 --> 00:39:41.680
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1601
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 2>like our 16 of this push.</v>

1602
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:45.160
<v Speaker 2>It was nice just this ground blizzard,</v>

1603
00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:45.371
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1604
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:46.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not actually snowing,</v>

1605
00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 2>but it feels like it's knowing cause it's so windy that the snow was blowing</v>

1606
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 2>around everywhere.</v>

1607
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.790
<v Speaker 2>But I was locked in such a deep flow state in my mind that even setting my tent</v>

1608
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:55.810
<v Speaker 2>up in this crazy storm,</v>

1609
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:57.940
<v Speaker 2>even getting inside 18 hour push,</v>

1610
00:39:57.941 --> 00:39:58.774
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

1611
00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

1612
00:39:59.110 --> 00:39:59.861
<v Speaker 2>I've got this.</v>

1613
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:01.000
<v Speaker 2>And it felt like for me,</v>

1614
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:02.410
<v Speaker 2>when I reflect on that moment,</v>

1615
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1616
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Jenna even says this,</v>

1617
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:04.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1618
00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 2>she talked to me every night and there there's clips of me crying.</v>

1619
00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:08.290
<v Speaker 2>There's clips of me having doubts,</v>

1620
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:08.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1621
00:40:08.411 --> 00:40:09.780
<v Speaker 2>there was ups and downs to this whole thing.</v>

1622
00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:10.450
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

1623
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:14.230
<v Speaker 2>you sounded the most lucid I've ever heard you and she's watching me high</v>

1624
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:14.941
<v Speaker 2>performing or things.</v>

1625
00:40:14.941 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

1626
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 2>you were locked in.</v>

1627
00:40:16.661 --> 00:40:17.770
<v Speaker 2>And so instead of her going like,</v>

1628
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe you should sleep and like get some rest.</v>

1629
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:20.260
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

1630
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:20.861
<v Speaker 2>I trust you.</v>

1631
00:40:20.861 --> 00:40:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1632
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.551
<v Speaker 2>I believe you,</v>

1633
00:40:21.551 --> 00:40:22.301
<v Speaker 2>like go for it.</v>

1634
00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 2>She could just hear it in my voice.</v>

1635
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1636
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.040
<v Speaker 2>and it was a crazy thing and I it for me,</v>

1637
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1638
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:33.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm 33 years old now and it really felt like a culmination of my entire life and</v>

1639
00:40:33.361 --> 00:40:37.120
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ways like from the swim practices as a little kid too,</v>

1640
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:37.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1641
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I got burned in this crazy fire that I overcame and talking about that if you</v>

1642
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:40.830
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

1643
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1644
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:41.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1645
00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:42.131
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

1646
00:40:42.131 --> 00:40:42.731
<v Speaker 2>triathlon,</v>

1647
00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:43.261
<v Speaker 2>professional,</v>

1648
00:40:43.261 --> 00:40:45.780
<v Speaker 2>we all have these moments with the meditation practice,</v>

1649
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1650
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:46.871
<v Speaker 2>the family,</v>

1651
00:40:46.871 --> 00:40:47.441
<v Speaker 2>the support,</v>

1652
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:47.750
<v Speaker 2>like suck.</v>

1653
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 2>All of these things were stacking on each other to kind of lead to this final</v>

1654
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:52.180
<v Speaker 2>culminating moment.</v>

1655
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.930
<v Speaker 2>And I had to pull on lessons from each phase of my life to be that locked in.</v>

1656
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.430
<v Speaker 2>But I found myself just,</v>

1657
00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:57.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1658
00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.320
<v Speaker 2>kind of in that moment,</v>

1659
00:40:59.321 --> 00:41:00.370
<v Speaker 2>in that flow state,</v>

1660
00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1661
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.370
<v Speaker 2>being able to get up out of that hour 18 and say to them,</v>

1662
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:03.761
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1663
00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:05.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm going back out and this crazy ground blizzard.</v>

1664
00:41:05.711 --> 00:41:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I got another 14 hours to go to finish this thing.</v>

1665
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:08.584
<v Speaker 2>And so that was,</v>

1666
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:08.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1667
00:41:08.891 --> 00:41:10.930
<v Speaker 2>32 hours and 77 miles later,</v>

1668
00:41:10.931 --> 00:41:12.790
<v Speaker 2>the final push to the end.</v>

1669
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Now what did you wear in terms of like a base layer and we was there concern</v>

1670
00:41:18.751 --> 00:41:21.390
<v Speaker 4>about you sweating while you're pulling all that weight,</v>

1671
00:41:21.391 --> 00:41:23.850
<v Speaker 4>especially initially when it was 375 pounds.</v>

1672
00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1673
00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:25.140
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1674
00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.810
<v Speaker 2>one of the famous lines that,</v>

1675
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:27.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1676
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:30.530
<v Speaker 2>people who have been in the polar environments will say is if you sweat,</v>

1677
00:41:30.531 --> 00:41:31.130
<v Speaker 2>you die.</v>

1678
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1679
00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.061
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1680
00:41:32.061 --> 00:41:35.030
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe a little bit hyperbole but it's not far from the truth,</v>

1681
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:38.870
<v Speaker 2>which is you start sweating and you stopped for even 30 seconds.</v>

1682
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 2>You're clothes are literally freezing to your body.</v>

1683
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:45.800
<v Speaker 2>And so it was this crazy kind of kind of balance of being able to pull this</v>

1684
00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 2>sled,</v>

1685
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.910
<v Speaker 2>get your heart rate elevated enough to keep your body warm but not too warm that</v>

1686
00:41:49.911 --> 00:41:50.744
<v Speaker 2>you were sweating.</v>

1687
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Speaker 2>And so any second I would start sweating,</v>

1688
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I would strip layers off.</v>

1689
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 2>So there was times,</v>

1690
00:41:54.981 --> 00:41:56.240
<v Speaker 2>especially when there was no wind,</v>

1691
00:41:56.241 --> 00:41:58.070
<v Speaker 2>it's still be ambient temperature minus 20,</v>

1692
00:41:58.071 --> 00:41:58.970
<v Speaker 2>minus 25,</v>

1693
00:41:58.971 --> 00:42:02.480
<v Speaker 2>but I would just have like a thin gore tex jacket on and one base layer.</v>

1694
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.110
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1695
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were in Marino.</v>

1696
00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Marino actually itches my skin,</v>

1697
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:07.671
<v Speaker 2>although it's really good.</v>

1698
00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 2>But for me I'm a little bit allergic to it.</v>

1699
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:09.681
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1700
00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:11.150
<v Speaker 2>so I work synthetic fabric,</v>

1701
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 2>have a synthetic that completely mimics Marino in terms of the way when it's</v>

1702
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:16.011
<v Speaker 2>moist,</v>

1703
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 2>he still stay warm.</v>

1704
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1705
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.780
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

1706
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.211
<v Speaker 2>Marina.</v>

1707
00:42:18.211 --> 00:42:18.801
<v Speaker 2>I honestly,</v>

1708
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Marino is amazing fabric for that reason.</v>

1709
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:21.031
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1710
00:42:21.031 --> 00:42:21.771
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately for me,</v>

1711
00:42:21.771 --> 00:42:22.101
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1712
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 2>it just irritates my skin.</v>

1713
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:23.631
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1714
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:27.170
<v Speaker 2>funny that you could suffer close,</v>

1715
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.960
<v Speaker 2>go maybe feel that.</v>

1716
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1717
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:31.431
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1718
00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1719
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.510
<v Speaker 2>so I used to synthetic but it's crazy.</v>

1720
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.341
<v Speaker 2>Are you using like what,</v>

1721
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:34.660
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1722
00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.020
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1723
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1724
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I was using mountain hardware base layers.</v>

1725
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1726
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.080
<v Speaker 2>and then actually my outer layer,</v>

1727
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:41.420
<v Speaker 2>so this Norwegian company called Bergen's of Norway,</v>

1728
00:42:41.421 --> 00:42:42.260
<v Speaker 2>they don't sponsor me,</v>

1729
00:42:42.261 --> 00:42:43.094
<v Speaker 2>but they actually,</v>

1730
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:43.971
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

1731
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:46.670
<v Speaker 2>the Norwegians know a thing or two about being in the polar environment.</v>

1732
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:50.090
<v Speaker 2>And so they've designed a really good jacket and pant that sexually really</v>

1733
00:42:50.091 --> 00:42:51.110
<v Speaker 2>breathable and really good.</v>

1734
00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 2>And then I suit sewed a for rough,</v>

1735
00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:53.751
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1736
00:42:53.751 --> 00:42:54.381
<v Speaker 2>onto the edge.</v>

1737
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:55.640
<v Speaker 2>So a wolf,</v>

1738
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 2>a wolf,</v>

1739
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:56.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1740
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1741
00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.290
<v Speaker 2>for rough on the outer side of the foot.</v>

1742
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Wolffia Wolf Wolf for thought.</v>

1743
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:03.690
<v Speaker 2>You were saying Whoa,</v>

1744
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:03.921
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1745
00:43:03.921 --> 00:43:04.371
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1746
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:05.410
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like wolf.</v>

1747
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.590
<v Speaker 2>You know more about this than me.</v>

1748
00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the output of know your audience.</v>

1749
00:43:08.751 --> 00:43:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing.</v>

1750
00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.610
<v Speaker 2>I have not a big hunter myself.</v>

1751
00:43:10.611 --> 00:43:11.061
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

1752
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:12.050
<v Speaker 2>never had done that,</v>

1753
00:43:12.051 --> 00:43:12.651
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that.</v>

1754
00:43:12.651 --> 00:43:13.041
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1755
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1756
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.173
<v Speaker 2>that's a wolf.</v>

1757
00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1758
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.130
<v Speaker 2>they know how to survive in the cold.</v>

1759
00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:16.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1760
00:43:16.281 --> 00:43:17.001
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1761
00:43:17.001 --> 00:43:19.160
<v Speaker 2>So the base layer is a synthetic.</v>

1762
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:21.260
<v Speaker 2>What is the material that it's made out of?</v>

1763
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.191
<v Speaker 2>The base layer is,</v>

1764
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:22.371
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1765
00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:22.680
<v Speaker 2>it's a thing.</v>

1766
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a synthetic.</v>

1767
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a poly,</v>

1768
00:43:24.681 --> 00:43:25.670
<v Speaker 2>polypropylene,</v>

1769
00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:26.893
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1770
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:27.771
<v Speaker 2>When it sweats,</v>

1771
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:28.604
<v Speaker 2>it dries quickly.</v>

1772
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:29.880
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1773
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.591
<v Speaker 2>it dries quickly.</v>

1774
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:32.510
<v Speaker 2>But the idea was just to not get it wet,</v>

1775
00:43:32.511 --> 00:43:34.850
<v Speaker 2>so basically stripped down as much as possible.</v>

1776
00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1777
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:38.720
<v Speaker 2>but like literally I'd go from that and then of course I needed to eat and drink</v>

1778
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:39.501
<v Speaker 2>every whatever,</v>

1779
00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:40.900
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes or whatever,</v>

1780
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:42.040
<v Speaker 2>actually more like every hour.</v>

1781
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.883
<v Speaker 2>So I'd stop.</v>

1782
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 2>So I'd stop in the front of my sled.</v>

1783
00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I had a huge puffy down jacket,</v>

1784
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:48.650
<v Speaker 2>like a massive like Michelin man,</v>

1785
00:43:48.651 --> 00:43:49.910
<v Speaker 2>huge Buffy down jacket.</v>

1786
00:43:49.911 --> 00:43:53.960
<v Speaker 2>So even if you're stopping for a minute to drink water before even trying to do</v>

1787
00:43:53.961 --> 00:43:54.290
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1788
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.621
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1789
00:43:54.621 --> 00:43:58.220
<v Speaker 2>put the big jacket on because that's how cold or how cold you can get</v>

1790
00:43:58.221 --> 00:43:59.630
<v Speaker 2>immediately from stopping.</v>

1791
00:43:59.631 --> 00:43:59.811
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1792
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:01.730
<v Speaker 2>it's just so much colder than when pulling the sled.</v>

1793
00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Your heart rate stays up and keeps you pretty warm.</v>

1794
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Imagining like your,</v>

1795
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.340
<v Speaker 2>your hands and your feet to that would be a real issue,</v>

1796
00:44:07.341 --> 00:44:07.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1797
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:08.660
<v Speaker 2>The small digits.</v>

1798
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:08.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1799
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1800
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1801
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.360
<v Speaker 2>frostbites real for sure.</v>

1802
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Hands outside of the clubs.</v>

1803
00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:15.650
<v Speaker 2>That's why some of this stuff I was doing in the training of get my hands with a</v>

1804
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:16.311
<v Speaker 2>dexterity,</v>

1805
00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:16.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1806
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:18.230
<v Speaker 2>you have to tie all these knots with big gloves,</v>

1807
00:44:18.231 --> 00:44:18.830
<v Speaker 2>mittens on.</v>

1808
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:21.200
<v Speaker 2>You can't take your gloves off for any sizable period of time.</v>

1809
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1810
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.300
<v Speaker 2>if you look back on a lot of my photos,</v>

1811
00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I've actually got tape on my face over across my nose and my cheeks.</v>

1812
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:30.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's because I started getting tiny little bits of frostbite,</v>

1813
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:30.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1814
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:31.050
<v Speaker 2>on the bottoms,</v>

1815
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.861
<v Speaker 2>my nose and on,</v>

1816
00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 2>on my cheeks because I'd wear a full face mask buff everything.</v>

1817
00:44:34.891 --> 00:44:35.724
<v Speaker 2>But even,</v>

1818
00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1819
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.960
<v Speaker 2>tiny little,</v>

1820
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:37.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1821
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:37.880
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1822
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1823
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 2>needle prick of wind on your face throughout the day and that cold it's going to</v>

1824
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:43.380
<v Speaker 2>turn into a cold injury.</v>

1825
00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 2>And so I started getting a few cold injuries on my face.</v>

1826
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:46.403
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>

1827
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:46.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1828
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:47.840
<v Speaker 2>too bad you're looking at Greece,</v>

1829
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 2>your face up or anything like mostly the,</v>

1830
00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 2>the tape.</v>

1831
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1832
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.450
<v Speaker 2>and then so I had a little bit of like Vaseline or like chap stick type of stuff</v>

1833
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:55.370
<v Speaker 2>on some of the batteries.</v>

1834
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 2>The one thing actually that I did that I had never done before,</v>

1835
00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:00.011
<v Speaker 2>we're actually worked well,</v>

1836
00:45:00.011 --> 00:45:00.811
<v Speaker 2>it was a tip that I got,</v>

1837
00:45:00.811 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 2>which was my fingers started cracking really,</v>

1838
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:04.320
<v Speaker 2>really bad from the cold.</v>

1839
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:07.140
<v Speaker 2>And so they were like really painful and actually was pouring,</v>

1840
00:45:07.141 --> 00:45:08.910
<v Speaker 2>putting super glue into all of those,</v>

1841
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:11.370
<v Speaker 2>basically little micro cuts on my fingers,</v>

1842
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 2>which when someone told me that as a trick,</v>

1843
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:13.771
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1844
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:14.250
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1845
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.610
<v Speaker 2>But turns out it's actually really good trick.</v>

1846
00:45:16.611 --> 00:45:20.100
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of super gluing these cuts on my fingers back together.</v>

1847
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:20.611
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1848
00:45:20.611 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 2>and that actually worked reasonably well.</v>

1849
00:45:22.171 --> 00:45:22.741
<v Speaker 2>All things kids.</v>

1850
00:45:22.741 --> 00:45:22.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1851
00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I was all things considered is the operative word,</v>

1852
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

1853
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1854
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.430

1855
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.660

1856
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:31.890
<v Speaker 2>So I'm wearing,</v>

1857
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm wearing a goggles.</v>

1858
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1859
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:34.981
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1860
00:45:34.981 --> 00:45:35.730
<v Speaker 2>funny enough,</v>

1861
00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:36.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1862
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.051
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple of,</v>

1863
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:37.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1864
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:37.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1865
00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:37.710
<v Speaker 2>fancier,</v>

1866
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.150
<v Speaker 2>nicer ski goggles with me.</v>

1867
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1868
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1871
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:42.750
<v Speaker 2>there's the tape on my face right there.</v>

1872
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1873
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.251
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1874
00:45:44.251 --> 00:45:44.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1875
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:45.281
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1876
00:45:45.281 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1877
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.370
<v Speaker 2>that's actually just like the normal KT tape,</v>

1878
00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:49.620
<v Speaker 2>like a physio tape that you'd see like athletes wearing.</v>

1879
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.030
<v Speaker 2>And I just had it in my repair kit.</v>

1880
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:52.200
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't meant for this purpose,</v>

1881
00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:52.621
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

1882
00:45:52.621 --> 00:45:56.100
<v Speaker 2>what do I have that I could put on my face to block it a little bit better?</v>

1883
00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1884
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 2>but I had those goggles on some of the time,</v>

1885
00:45:58.831 --> 00:46:01.620
<v Speaker 2>but actually the goggle that I wore the most was one that you would might use</v>

1886
00:46:01.621 --> 00:46:02.670
<v Speaker 2>for motocross.</v>

1887
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1888
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:06.570
<v Speaker 2>cause it has like a plastic face mask over the front of it.</v>

1889
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1890
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:07.891
<v Speaker 2>cause the wind,</v>

1891
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:08.730
<v Speaker 2>when it was blowing,</v>

1892
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:09.960
<v Speaker 2>it would just kind of blow around.</v>

1893
00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:12.090
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes I had this flea stripped over my face,</v>

1894
00:46:12.091 --> 00:46:13.200
<v Speaker 2>but it blow too much.</v>

1895
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1896
00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.630
<v Speaker 2>and so I had this more plastic face masks,</v>

1897
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:15.961
<v Speaker 2>gas,</v>

1898
00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:16.221
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

1899
00:46:16.221 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

1900
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 2>that's when you can see lookout frozen.</v>

1901
00:46:18.781 --> 00:46:19.471
<v Speaker 2>It's frozen.</v>

1902
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:20.690
<v Speaker 2>It is on the inside.</v>

1903
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1904
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:23.670
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1905
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.931
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

1906
00:46:23.931 --> 00:46:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And then like this neoprene mask underneath.</v>

1907
00:46:26.101 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 2>So I had like double facemask double tape,</v>

1908
00:46:28.861 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 2>like anything to just,</v>

1909
00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:30.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1910
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:31.590
<v Speaker 2>keep me,</v>

1911
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:35.970
<v Speaker 2>keep me more suspected that it was so high above sea level there.</v>

1912
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1913
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:37.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1914
00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:38.550
<v Speaker 2>So you've got whatever it is,</v>

1915
00:46:38.551 --> 00:46:39.181
<v Speaker 2>9,000,</v>

1916
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:40.800
<v Speaker 2>300 feet at the South Pole.</v>

1917
00:46:40.801 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically just like elevated ground,</v>

1918
00:46:43.561 --> 00:46:44.610
<v Speaker 2>but it seems flat.</v>

1919
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.241
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1920
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:45.480
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1921
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I started at sea level.</v>

1922
00:46:46.651 --> 00:46:47.010
<v Speaker 2>So you've got,</v>

1923
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not only add,</v>

1924
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.510
<v Speaker 2>like I'm actually going uphill all the way to the south coast.</v>

1925
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.520
<v Speaker 2>So the first 40 sub days I pulled that sled up hill completely.</v>

1926
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.280
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>

1927
00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't think freaks me out.</v>

1928
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1929
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Like when you were freaking out an hour in and you hadn't even actually land</v>

1930
00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:06.690
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

1931
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1932
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 2>What does,</v>

1933
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.990
<v Speaker 2>what thoughts were going through your head?</v>

1934
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.461
<v Speaker 2>Were you thinking,</v>

1935
00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:11.671
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1936
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I need to get someone to fucking rescue me.</v>

1937
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.393
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1938
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.331
<v Speaker 2>it definitely,</v>

1939
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:15.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1940
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.950
<v Speaker 2>that those moments of doubt,</v>

1941
00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:17.310
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1942
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 2>this is on Everest.</v>

1943
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:19.363
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1944
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:20.933
<v Speaker 2>we get to this.</v>

1945
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1946
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:22.591
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1947
00:47:22.591 --> 00:47:23.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1948
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:23.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1949
00:47:23.461 --> 00:47:24.390
<v Speaker 2>what was going through my head was,</v>

1950
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.160
<v Speaker 2>was these moments of doubt for sure.</v>

1951
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1952
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:27.960
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things for me,</v>

1953
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:28.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1954
00:47:28.741 --> 00:47:30.670
<v Speaker 2>to be honest with these projects that I've created,</v>

1955
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

1956
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 2>I love pushing my own limits.</v>

1957
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:33.131
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

1958
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:35.050
<v Speaker 2>I love finding the edges of my own potential,</v>

1959
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:35.920
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff.</v>

1960
00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:39.430
<v Speaker 2>But I also now really enjoy building these projects that I can share with other</v>

1961
00:47:39.431 --> 00:47:39.730
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1962
00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 2>I do this,</v>

1963
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I just nonprofit work where there's,</v>

1964
00:47:41.981 --> 00:47:42.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1965
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:45.640
<v Speaker 2>30,000 school kids tuning into this project and using this as curriculum in</v>

1966
00:47:45.641 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 2>their classrooms to learn about climate change,</v>

1967
00:47:47.411 --> 00:47:49.210
<v Speaker 2>to learn about whether atmospheric pressure.</v>

1968
00:47:49.211 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a really cool projects like that.</v>

1969
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:52.060
<v Speaker 2>And then just sharing it with the world at large,</v>

1970
00:47:52.061 --> 00:47:52.870
<v Speaker 2>people going like,</v>

1971
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:53.710
<v Speaker 2>this is impossible.</v>

1972
00:47:53.711 --> 00:47:53.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1973
00:47:53.861 --> 00:47:54.700
<v Speaker 2>how many guys do you know?</v>

1974
00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:56.290
<v Speaker 2>That was like one day I'm going to do this cool thing,</v>

1975
00:47:56.291 --> 00:47:57.550
<v Speaker 2>but they like never do it right.</v>

1976
00:47:57.551 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Speaker 2>And so actually going after that and sharing it away,</v>

1977
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:02.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like you might not want to walk across Antarctica,</v>

1978
00:48:02.411 --> 00:48:05.680
<v Speaker 2>but like you probably have some hope or some dream or some goal that you want to</v>

1979
00:48:05.681 --> 00:48:06.520
<v Speaker 2>accomplish in your life.</v>

1980
00:48:06.521 --> 00:48:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Like fucking go and do it.</v>

1981
00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Like get through it.</v>

1982
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:09.880
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>

1983
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:10.361
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>

1984
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:10.781
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

1985
00:48:10.781 --> 00:48:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1986
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I've started to think of myself less as an athlete and actually more of as an</v>

1987
00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:16.810
<v Speaker 2>artist and my canvas really is just endurance sports.</v>

1988
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.470
<v Speaker 2>But creating these art projects in the world that I can create and share with</v>

1989
00:48:20.471 --> 00:48:22.570
<v Speaker 2>people through storytelling to hopefully inspire them.</v>

1990
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:22.841
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>

1991
00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 2>So what was I thinking in that first hour was,</v>

1992
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:26.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1993
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:26.913
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1994
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't want my art project to blow up right in my face,</v>

1995
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:30.700
<v Speaker 2>but more so there was,</v>

1996
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 2>this was bigger than myself.</v>

1997
00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what kept me going forward.</v>

1998
00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Just like I can't let these kids in these public school classrooms think that I</v>

1999
00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 2>could after the first hour,</v>

2000
00:48:37.991 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 2>like at these other people that are their driving inspiration from this,</v>

2001
00:48:41.021 --> 00:48:43.210
<v Speaker 2>hopefully like I want to do this for this larger purpose.</v>

2002
00:48:43.211 --> 00:48:44.044
<v Speaker 2>And honestly,</v>

2003
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:44.440
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2004
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.320
<v Speaker 2>that's what really kept me going forward through the really hard times was that,</v>

2005
00:48:47.321 --> 00:48:47.501
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2006
00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:50.500
<v Speaker 2>that connection to a larger purpose of what I want to put out in the world and</v>

2007
00:48:50.501 --> 00:48:51.970
<v Speaker 2>that ripple effect of positivity.</v>

2008
00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:52.961
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

2009
00:48:52.961 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 2>And then of course you have a giant team that prepared and,</v>

2010
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2011
00:48:58.310 --> 00:48:58.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2012
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2013
00:48:58.980 --> 00:48:59.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2014
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:00.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot,</v>

2015
00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:01.270
<v Speaker 2>lot goes into it.</v>

2016
00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:02.440
<v Speaker 2>So get getting to that,</v>

2017
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 2>getting to that starting line and having that doubt.</v>

2018
00:49:04.481 --> 00:49:04.871
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

2019
00:49:04.871 --> 00:49:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2020
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.580
<v Speaker 2>on one level it's also,</v>

2021
00:49:06.581 --> 00:49:07.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a human element.</v>

2022
00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2023
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:09.670
<v Speaker 2>it'd be easy for me to come in here and tell the story.</v>

2024
00:49:09.671 --> 00:49:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2025
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:10.991
<v Speaker 2>you know what Joe,</v>

2026
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:13.210
<v Speaker 2>like I'm the biggest bad ass in the world.</v>

2027
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:15.760
<v Speaker 2>No one's walked across Antarctica and like I did it.</v>

2028
00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Even though these people died trying whatever.</v>

2029
00:49:17.361 --> 00:49:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Like those are the facts of the situation.</v>

2030
00:49:19.211 --> 00:49:19.961
<v Speaker 2>But like the truth is,</v>

2031
00:49:19.961 --> 00:49:20.201
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2032
00:49:20.201 --> 00:49:21.490
<v Speaker 2>like I'm human.</v>

2033
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Like I have the wave of human emotions.</v>

2034
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I've figured out how to tap into my mind in a way to do these things.</v>

2035
00:49:26.621 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 2>But like I still experience fear.</v>

2036
00:49:28.481 --> 00:49:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I steer x feeling experienced doubt.</v>

2037
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I still experienced the ups and downs,</v>

2038
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 2>but I have a way of actually being able to repo purpose or refocus that energy</v>

2039
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.001
<v Speaker 2>into positive,</v>

2040
00:49:37.001 --> 00:49:37.751
<v Speaker 2>forward momentum.</v>

2041
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what the differences,</v>

2042
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.540
<v Speaker 2>but I believe all of us,</v>

2043
00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:42.910
<v Speaker 2>all of us humans have the capacity to do this.</v>

2044
00:49:42.911 --> 00:49:43.631
<v Speaker 2>Like you're looking at me,</v>

2045
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:44.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a pretty like regular,</v>

2046
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:46.750
<v Speaker 2>like size of the regular looking guy.</v>

2047
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2048
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:47.921
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

2049
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:48.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2050
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 2>the muscle between my years is what separates a difference.</v>

2051
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:51.940
<v Speaker 2>And they allowed me to do this more than anything.</v>

2052
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:56.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't seem to have the darkness that I usually see and people that do things</v>

2053
00:49:56.111 --> 00:49:56.944
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

2054
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.083
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

2055
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.960
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of people that have done some fucked up things and they all have</v>

2056
00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:03.490
<v Speaker 2>some weird darkness.</v>

2057
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2058
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:05.344
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2059
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:07.000
<v Speaker 2>I hear what you're saying.</v>

2060
00:50:07.001 --> 00:50:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I think for me there's a lot of the strength comes from a dark moment in my</v>

2061
00:50:10.361 --> 00:50:10.810
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2062
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:11.643
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2063
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:12.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2064
00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:13.420
<v Speaker 2>right after college,</v>

2065
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:13.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2066
00:50:13.841 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I was traveling around the world at,</v>

2067
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:15.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2068
00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 2>I had no money as a kid growing up,</v>

2069
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:17.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2070
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2071
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:19.000
<v Speaker 2>we're working class background,</v>

2072
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.500
<v Speaker 2>painted houses every summer,</v>

2073
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:22.090
<v Speaker 2>but always dreamed of traveling the world.</v>

2074
00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:22.451
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

2075
00:50:22.451 --> 00:50:24.040
<v Speaker 2>one day I'm going to travel the world.</v>

2076
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 2>So I finished college buddies of mine are getting like real jobs and whatever</v>

2077
00:50:28.251 --> 00:50:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street and things like that.</v>

2078
00:50:29.421 --> 00:50:29.841
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2079
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:30.261
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2080
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I saved up $10,000 over the past six years.</v>

2081
00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:35.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a surfboard and a backpack and like go see the world with my</v>

2082
00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:36.741
<v Speaker 2>life savings.</v>

2083
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 2>And so I went and do that.</v>

2084
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm 21 years old,</v>

2085
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2086
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:40.491
<v Speaker 2>go to Fiji.</v>

2087
00:50:40.491 --> 00:50:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I served through Australia,</v>

2088
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 2>hitchhike through New Zealand.</v>

2089
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I ended up in Thailand and Europe at a time.</v>

2090
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2091
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:46.521
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2092
00:50:46.521 --> 00:50:47.260
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2093
00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2094
00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:48.080
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

2095
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.620
<v Speaker 2>so you're familiar with how much fire and fire dancing and various crazy to</v>

2096
00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Boucher's things that happen over there.</v>

2097
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:56.960
<v Speaker 2>So I'm on a beach in rural Thailand and I decided to jump this flaming jump</v>

2098
00:50:56.961 --> 00:50:57.320
<v Speaker 2>rope.</v>

2099
00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2100
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.440
<v Speaker 2>and unfortunately it goes terribly wrong for me.</v>

2101
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:05.090
<v Speaker 2>The rope wrapped around my legs and ignites my entire bio body on fire to my</v>

2102
00:51:05.091 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>

2103
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2104
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.831
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2105
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:08.270
<v Speaker 2>in an instant my life changed.</v>

2106
00:51:08.271 --> 00:51:08.451
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2107
00:51:08.451 --> 00:51:10.910
<v Speaker 2>fortunately for me the water's edge,</v>

2108
00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:12.530
<v Speaker 2>the ocean was 10 steps away,</v>

2109
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:15.590
<v Speaker 2>so kind of instinct takes over and I dive into the ocean,</v>

2110
00:51:15.591 --> 00:51:16.970
<v Speaker 2>which extinguish the flames.</v>

2111
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 2>My Body's on fire to my neck,</v>

2112
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:21.530
<v Speaker 2>but not before about 25% of my body is severely,</v>

2113
00:51:21.531 --> 00:51:22.460
<v Speaker 2>severely burned.</v>

2114
00:51:22.461 --> 00:51:23.810
<v Speaker 2>So my clothes were on fire.</v>

2115
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2116
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 2>but mostly we got severely burned,</v>

2117
00:51:26.031 --> 00:51:27.500
<v Speaker 2>was my legs and feet.</v>

2118
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:28.460
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm in a place,</v>

2119
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I want a beach.</v>

2120
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.530
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2121
00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:30.440
<v Speaker 2>there's no hospital in this.</v>

2122
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:31.161
<v Speaker 2>Since I'm on an island.</v>

2123
00:51:31.161 --> 00:51:32.090
<v Speaker 2>There was no hospital.</v>

2124
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Instead of an ambulance ride,</v>

2125
00:51:33.341 --> 00:51:34.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the back of a moped,</v>

2126
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:36.680
<v Speaker 2>driving down a dirt path.</v>

2127
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:36.981
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2128
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:37.111
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2129
00:51:37.111 --> 00:51:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a one room nursing station,</v>

2130
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.370
<v Speaker 2>literally like the size of the room.</v>

2131
00:51:40.371 --> 00:51:42.530
<v Speaker 2>We're sitting in there like this is our sort of hospital,</v>

2132
00:51:42.531 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 2>it's like one bed and I'm just completely devastated and sort of that they put</v>

2133
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:49.790
<v Speaker 2>me under eight surgeries over the next week in the middle of nowhere,</v>

2134
00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:52.670
<v Speaker 2>rural Thailand surgeries in a tiny little shack.</v>

2135
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.301
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2136
00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:56.720
<v Speaker 2>basically there's a cat running around my bed every time I come out of there,</v>

2137
00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2140
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:02.750

2149
00:52:06.951 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Normally.</v>

2150

<v Speaker 2>Like you're probably never gonna walk again normally.</v>

2151
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>on that to the second one,</v>

2157
00:52:14.421 --> 00:52:15.254
<v Speaker 2>it actually shows,</v>

2158
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2159
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2160
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:16.720
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2161
00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:16.941
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2162
00:52:16.941 --> 00:52:17.774
<v Speaker 2>what the legs.</v>

2163
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2164
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.843
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2165
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2166
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2167
00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:21.170
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

2168
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.411
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2169
00:52:21.411 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 2>that photo there with those legs.</v>

2170
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:25.100
<v Speaker 2>That's actually eight weeks after I was burned so that,</v>

2171
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:25.671
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

2172
00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:26.400
<v Speaker 2>that's like the,</v>

2173
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.460
<v Speaker 2>it starting to look a little bit better.</v>

2174
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2175
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.320
<v Speaker 2>all things considered there.</v>

2176
00:52:30.321 --> 00:52:32.660
<v Speaker 2>So as you can probably imagine,</v>

2177
00:52:32.661 --> 00:52:32.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2178
00:52:32.931 --> 00:52:34.550
<v Speaker 2>just the darkest time in my life,</v>

2179
00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:34.881
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

2180
00:52:34.881 --> 00:52:35.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2181
00:52:35.061 --> 00:52:35.421
<v Speaker 2>an APP,</v>

2182
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:35.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2183
00:52:35.571 --> 00:52:36.860
<v Speaker 2>I swam through college.</v>

2184
00:52:36.861 --> 00:52:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I know I thought of myself as a physically active person and here I am like</v>

2185
00:52:40.521 --> 00:52:41.061
<v Speaker 2>doctor saying,</v>

2186
00:52:41.061 --> 00:52:41.301
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2187
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:41.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2188
00:52:41.481 --> 00:52:42.440
<v Speaker 2>22 year old kid,</v>

2189
00:52:42.441 --> 00:52:44.030
<v Speaker 2>like you'll never walk again normally.</v>

2190
00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2191
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.120
<v Speaker 2>and to me that they're the hero in this story,</v>

2192
00:52:47.121 --> 00:52:49.940
<v Speaker 2>which is maybe why you don't see the darkness in my eyes and it's more of the</v>

2193
00:52:49.941 --> 00:52:50.390
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

2194
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:51.171
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2195
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:52.130
<v Speaker 2>my mother is really the,</v>

2196
00:52:52.131 --> 00:52:53.420
<v Speaker 2>the heroine of this tale,</v>

2197
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:53.941
<v Speaker 2>which is she,</v>

2198
00:52:53.941 --> 00:52:56.090
<v Speaker 2>she arrived to my bedside around day five,</v>

2199
00:52:56.091 --> 00:52:56.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2200
00:52:56.241 --> 00:52:57.500
<v Speaker 2>flies all the way over to Thailand,</v>

2201
00:52:57.501 --> 00:52:58.334
<v Speaker 2>finds me.</v>

2202
00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:58.911
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2203
00:52:58.911 --> 00:52:59.421
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>

2204
00:52:59.421 --> 00:52:59.991
<v Speaker 2>are you a parent?</v>

2205
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:00.201
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2206
00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:00.771
<v Speaker 2>Do you have kids?</v>

2207
00:53:00.771 --> 00:53:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2208
00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't have kids yet,</v>

2209
00:53:02.001 --> 00:53:05.630
<v Speaker 2>but I can only imagine as a parent what it's like to walk into a hospital room</v>

2210
00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:08.020
<v Speaker 2>and see your kid halfway around the world and this state,</v>

2211
00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 2>nothing you can do.</v>

2212
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 2>And she admits now that she was crying in the hallways,</v>

2213
00:53:12.351 --> 00:53:12.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2214
00:53:12.501 --> 00:53:15.140
<v Speaker 2>pleading with the doctors for good news,</v>

2215
00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:16.160
<v Speaker 2>like he's going to be all right,</v>

2216
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:16.341
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2217
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:17.174
<v Speaker 2>He's going to walk,</v>

2218
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.420
<v Speaker 2>she's crying every time she walked into my hospital room,</v>

2219
00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:23.720
<v Speaker 2>she walked in with a smile on her face and it's just air of positivity of being</v>

2220
00:53:23.721 --> 00:53:24.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2221
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:24.561
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2222
00:53:24.561 --> 00:53:25.740
<v Speaker 2>call like is bad.</v>

2223
00:53:25.741 --> 00:53:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you want to do when you get Outta here?</v>

2224
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Like let's set a goal.</v>

2225
00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Like let's get Outta here and do something positive.</v>

2226
00:53:30.781 --> 00:53:31.111
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2227
00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:31.490
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>

2228
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:32.430
<v Speaker 2>you are you crazy.</v>

2229
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Like the doctors say,</v>

2230
00:53:33.331 --> 00:53:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm never gonna walk again normally like my life is,</v>

2231
00:53:35.311 --> 00:53:35.731
<v Speaker 2>I know it,</v>

2232
00:53:35.731 --> 00:53:36.181
<v Speaker 2>it's over,</v>

2233
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:38.490
<v Speaker 2>you know this and this really dark place in my mind.</v>

2234
00:53:38.491 --> 00:53:41.550
<v Speaker 2>But she just kept at me day after day with this positivity,</v>

2235
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:41.701
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2236
00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:41.851
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2237
00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 2>And I finally was like close my eyes and I just pictured like,</v>

2238
00:53:44.581 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to be?</v>

2239
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:49.500
<v Speaker 2>And I close my eyes and I had this visualization and myself crossing a triathlon</v>

2240
00:53:49.501 --> 00:53:50.100
<v Speaker 2>finish line,</v>

2241
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.570
<v Speaker 2>which is not something I'd ever done before.</v>

2242
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I had swam in college but never biked to run competitively.</v>

2243
00:53:54.271 --> 00:53:54.601
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

2244
00:53:54.601 --> 00:53:55.434
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>

2245
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:55.921
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2246
00:53:55.921 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 2>the able bodied me sometime in the future is going to be not only walking again</v>

2247
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 2>but doing a triathlon race.</v>

2248
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:03.341
<v Speaker 2>And so I said it to her,</v>

2249
00:54:03.341 --> 00:54:03.541
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2250
00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:05.250
<v Speaker 2>my goal is to race a triathlon one day.</v>

2251
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.780
<v Speaker 2>And instead of her looking at me going like,</v>

2252
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2253
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.291
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2254
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:07.831
<v Speaker 2>set a goal,</v>

2255
00:54:07.831 --> 00:54:11.340
<v Speaker 2>but maybe something more realistic but it doesn't require you to be running.</v>

2256
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.971
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2257
00:54:11.971 --> 00:54:12.421
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

2258
00:54:12.421 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

2259
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:13.650
<v Speaker 2>let's learn about it.</v>

2260
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Pulls out her computer and just literally starts reading me like triathlon races</v>

2261
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:17.551
<v Speaker 2>are this,</v>

2262
00:54:17.551 --> 00:54:18.600
<v Speaker 2>they're this far there.</v>

2263
00:54:18.601 --> 00:54:19.500
<v Speaker 2>This distances.</v>

2264
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:19.891
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't know,</v>

2265
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I knew nothing about the sport other than just like popped into my mind.</v>

2266
00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:24.270
<v Speaker 2>It's something I thought I maybe wanted to do.</v>

2267
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2268
00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 2>and so that's what I focused on.</v>

2269
00:54:27.151 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I literally have this photo of me with the Thai doctor.</v>

2270
00:54:29.371 --> 00:54:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2271
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2272
00:54:30.001 --> 00:54:33.780
<v Speaker 2>my legs are bandage to my waist and the Thai doctors like looking at me crazy,</v>

2273
00:54:33.781 --> 00:54:36.900
<v Speaker 2>but I'm lifting these like 10 pound barbells in my head going,</v>

2274
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm training for a triathlon.</v>

2275
00:54:38.581 --> 00:54:38.791
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2276
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:39.600
<v Speaker 2>That guy's like,</v>

2279
00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2280
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.670
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

00:55:02.911 --> 00:55:04.920
<v Speaker 2>I wake up the first morning back in my parents' house,</v>

2302
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:05.710
<v Speaker 2>my mother's kitchen,</v>

2303
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:06.690
<v Speaker 2>the house I grew up in,</v>

2304
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.220
<v Speaker 2>and she looks at me and she goes,</v>

2305
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.121
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2306
00:55:09.121 --> 00:55:09.570
<v Speaker 2>Colin.</v>

2307
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Now I know you've got this big triathlon goal,</v>

2308
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.950
<v Speaker 2>but today your goal is to take your very first step.</v>

2309
00:55:13.951 --> 00:55:17.880
<v Speaker 2>And so she actually grabs a chair from our kitchen table and place it one step</v>

2310
00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:19.560
<v Speaker 2>in front of my wheelchair and she says,</v>

2311
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.590
<v Speaker 2>today you need to somehow figure out how to get out of that wheelchair,</v>

2312
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.140
<v Speaker 2>take one step and step into the chair in front of you.</v>

2313
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.460
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking at it like,</v>

2314
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is possible,</v>

2315
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.430
<v Speaker 2>but three hours later,</v>

2316
00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:29.941
<v Speaker 2>four hours later,</v>

2317
00:55:29.941 --> 00:55:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm still staring at this chair and I finally work up the courage and strength</v>

2318
00:55:32.821 --> 00:55:34.080
<v Speaker 2>to get out of this wheelchair,</v>

2319
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.810
<v Speaker 2>take the one step and get into that chair in front of me.</v>

2320
00:55:36.811 --> 00:55:39.780
<v Speaker 2>And is the problem that because of the burnt skin,</v>

2321
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not flexible,</v>

2322
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 2>you can move it and bend it.</v>

2323
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a good question.</v>

2324
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:47.490
<v Speaker 2>So basically what happened with the burn is it burned me so deep that two things</v>

2325
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:47.850
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2326
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.320
<v Speaker 2>One is there was ligament damage,</v>

2327
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:51.600
<v Speaker 2>so ligament damage to my ankles and knee joints.</v>

2328
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:52.940
<v Speaker 2>And then the way that this,</v>

2329
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:53.340
<v Speaker 2>the heat,</v>

2330
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.330
<v Speaker 2>the scarring in the skin is healing essentially over these mobile joints.</v>

2331
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.760
<v Speaker 2>They don't think I'm going to regain full flexibility,</v>

2332
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:00.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2333
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.370
<v Speaker 2>at full range of motion essentially in my leg.</v>

2334
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.660
<v Speaker 2>So they're not saying you'll never walk as,</v>

2335
00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:06.960
<v Speaker 2>and you won't be able to stand up at all.</v>

2336
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Although that was like extremely painful,</v>

2337
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.120
<v Speaker 2>but they just didn't think it'd be imagine walking around without being able to</v>

2338
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:14.520
<v Speaker 2>bend your knees or your ankles with like full mobility.</v>

2339
00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:15.271
<v Speaker 2>So it just was like,</v>

2340
00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:18.150
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be able to have that back basically.</v>

2341
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:19.261
<v Speaker 2>So sure enough,</v>

2342
00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I take that first step,</v>

2343
00:56:20.161 --> 00:56:21.150
<v Speaker 2>get in that chair the next day.</v>

2344
00:56:21.151 --> 00:56:22.530
<v Speaker 2>My mom doesn't take it easy on me.</v>

2345
00:56:22.531 --> 00:56:24.520
<v Speaker 2>She just moved chair five steps away the next day,</v>

2346
00:56:24.521 --> 00:56:26.140
<v Speaker 2>10 steps to let you know every day.</v>

2347
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:28.300
<v Speaker 2>A few more steps of,</v>

2348
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 2>and not to go on and on,</v>

2349
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:31.300
<v Speaker 2>but basically 18 months after,</v>

2350
00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2351
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.860
<v Speaker 2>getting released from that hospital,</v>

2352
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I find myself in Chicago.</v>

2353
00:56:34.421 --> 00:56:36.550

2381
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 2>And to my complete and utter surprise,</v>

2382
00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't just finish the race,</v>

2383
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:22.060
<v Speaker 2>but I actually won the entire Chicago triathlon,</v>

2384
00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:22.450
<v Speaker 2>PT,</v>

2385

<v Speaker 2>4,000 other people coming first place.</v>

2386
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.193
<v Speaker 2>So first,</v>

2387
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:27.963
<v Speaker 2>whenever.</v>

2388
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2389
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:31.960
<v Speaker 2>And what kind of training did you do to prepare yourself for that?</v>

2390
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:32.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2391
00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:32.831
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2392
00:57:32.831 --> 00:57:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2393
00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2394
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:33.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2395
00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I had been a collegiate swimmer,</v>

2396
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:36.220
<v Speaker 2>so I was a division one swimmer.</v>

2397
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I swam at Yale University.</v>

2398
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2399
00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:39.963
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>

2400
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:40.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2401
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.450
<v Speaker 2>the biking and running was completely new to me.</v>

2402
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Show you how to do it or did you just start running and biking?</v>

2403
00:57:46.631 --> 00:57:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2404
00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I literally walked into the spin class I guess,</v>

2405
00:57:48.711 --> 00:57:49.510
<v Speaker 2>but not like a,</v>

2406
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:51.100
<v Speaker 2>like a didn't actually ride a bike.</v>

2407
00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:54.520
<v Speaker 2>So I went to the spin class and like start like met a guy and he was like,</v>

2408
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:54.731
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2409
00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I've done one triathlon before.</v>

2410
00:57:56.501 --> 00:57:56.951
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

2411
00:57:56.951 --> 00:57:57.431
<v Speaker 2>I can hear you.</v>

2412
00:57:57.431 --> 00:57:59.740
<v Speaker 2>So he took me out on a couple of rides with his buddies.</v>

2413
00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I had this like steel frame bike.</v>

2414
00:58:01.631 --> 00:58:02.291
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know all of these,</v>

2415
00:58:02.291 --> 00:58:04.060
<v Speaker 2>like carbon wheels and aero helmet,</v>

2416
00:58:04.061 --> 00:58:04.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2417
00:58:04.211 --> 00:58:06.610
<v Speaker 2>all these fancy like triathlon type of things.</v>

2418
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Like didn't know much about it.</v>

2419
00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.210
<v Speaker 2>And literally for a summer,</v>

2420
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:11.680
<v Speaker 2>just kind of like asked people some questions.</v>

2421
00:58:11.681 --> 00:58:12.190
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

2422
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:13.360
<v Speaker 2>And what's funny about triathlon,</v>

2423
00:58:13.361 --> 00:58:15.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how familiar you are with this sport,</v>

2424
00:58:15.401 --> 00:58:16.550
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2425
00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:16.930
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

2426
00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:18.370
<v Speaker 2>in a race like the Chicago triathlon,</v>

2427
00:58:18.371 --> 00:58:18.521
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2428
00:58:18.521 --> 00:58:18.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2429
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:20.500
<v Speaker 2>for more than 4,000 participants.</v>

2430
00:58:20.501 --> 00:58:23.710
<v Speaker 2>And so unlike a marathon where everyone just starts at the same time,</v>

2431
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:27.100
<v Speaker 2>you actually have to start in waves like a hundred people every five minutes.</v>

2432
00:58:27.101 --> 00:58:32.101
<v Speaker 2>And I was the 39th wave of 53 and so I dive into Lake Michigan and there's</v>

2433
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:35.350
<v Speaker 2>people that already started like two hours before me and there's people starting</v>

2434
00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:36.490
<v Speaker 2>two hours after me.</v>

2435
00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:38.080
<v Speaker 2>And so when I finished the race,</v>

2436
00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:38.920
<v Speaker 2>you know I swim,</v>

2437
00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:39.431
<v Speaker 2>I bike,</v>

2438
00:58:39.431 --> 00:58:39.851
<v Speaker 2>I run,</v>

2439
00:58:39.851 --> 00:58:41.950
<v Speaker 2>it was Olympic distance triathlon so it was a mile swim,</v>

2440
00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:42.940
<v Speaker 2>25 miles pike,</v>

2441
00:58:42.941 --> 00:58:44.110
<v Speaker 2>6.2 mile run.</v>

2442
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I crossed the finish line.</v>

2443
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't still know I won the race because like people started before me,</v>

2444
00:58:49.211 --> 00:58:52.120
<v Speaker 2>people started after me and they take the cumulative time at the end.</v>

2445
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.060
<v Speaker 2>And so I like my grandma's there cause she lived in Chicago,</v>

2446
00:58:55.061 --> 00:58:56.200
<v Speaker 2>like gives me a big hug.</v>

2447
00:58:56.201 --> 00:58:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm so proud of you.</v>

2448
00:58:57.251 --> 00:59:00.070
<v Speaker 2>You were able to walk again and here you are finishing triathlon,</v>

2449
00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:01.090
<v Speaker 2>let's go get lunch.</v>

2450
00:59:01.091 --> 00:59:04.720
<v Speaker 2>And so I grabbed my wetsuit and my bike and my grandma and I sit down to have</v>

2451
00:59:04.721 --> 00:59:06.430
<v Speaker 2>lunch and as we're walking back to the car,</v>

2452

00:59:10.991 --> 00:59:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Like let's go see how I did.</v>

2458
00:59:12.311 --> 00:59:12.721
<v Speaker 2>And we won.</v>

2459
00:59:12.721 --> 00:59:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Drove her to like the scores table.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you won like the whole race.</v>

2480
00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.440
<v Speaker 2>It was just this surreal,</v>

2481
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:31.700
<v Speaker 2>surreal moment.</v>

2482
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2483
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.931
<v Speaker 2>if I live,</v>

2484
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:33.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2485
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2486
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.251
<v Speaker 2>it was wild,</v>

2487
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:35.240
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

2488
00:59:35.241 --> 00:59:35.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2489
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:36.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2490
00:59:36.111 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 2>for me in that moment what I thought back,</v>

2491
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:38.780
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2492
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.040
<v Speaker 2>it was cool to pat myself on the back.</v>

2493
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:40.161
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2494
00:59:40.161 --> 00:59:40.731
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2495
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Like I just did this crazy thing,</v>

2496
00:59:42.021 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 2>but it was more so going back to your initial question about the darkness versus</v>

2497
00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:46.131
<v Speaker 2>the light,</v>

2498
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:47.900
<v Speaker 2>at least in my journey was I was like,</v>

2499
00:59:47.901 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2500
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.450
<v Speaker 2>like this is a sliding doors moment.</v>

2501
00:59:50.451 --> 00:59:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Like what had happened had my mom not,</v>

2502
00:59:52.281 --> 00:59:52.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2503
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.940
<v Speaker 2>come in with this air of positivity and forced me to set this tangible goal.</v>

2504
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm certain my life would be nowhere where it was today,</v>

2505
00:59:59.300 --> 00:59:59.841
<v Speaker 2>but then it's not,</v>

2506
00:59:59.841 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't like,</v>

2507
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow,</v>

2508
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm some superhuman freak that can do these things.</v>

2509
01:00:03.111 --> 01:00:03.441
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2510
01:00:03.441 --> 01:00:03.651
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2511
01:00:03.651 --> 01:00:04.280
<v Speaker 2>humans,</v>

2512
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 2>all of us,</v>

2513
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.900
<v Speaker 2>we all have these reservoirs of untapped potential inside of us and can achieve</v>

2514
01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.210
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary things when we set our minds to it.</v>

2515
01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:12.620
<v Speaker 2>And so what it did for me,</v>

2516
01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.390
<v Speaker 2>it's just sparked this curiosity like,</v>

2517
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:14.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2518
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:16.760
<v Speaker 2>what else can I do if I set my mind to it?</v>

2519
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:17.900
<v Speaker 2>So sure enough,</v>

2520
01:00:17.901 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 2>it was a Sunday when I raised a Chicago triathlon,</v>

2521
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:21.800
<v Speaker 2>coincidentally,</v>

2522
01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:22.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2523
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.120
<v Speaker 2>met who became a huge mentor and influenced my life that afternoon.</v>

2524
01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:26.481
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2525
01:00:26.481 --> 01:00:29.660
<v Speaker 2>a guy named Brian Gelber who ended up being my first sponsor and he said to me,</v>

2526
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.550
<v Speaker 2>you won the Chicago triathlon today.</v>

2527
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you should maybe do something about that?</v>

2528
01:00:33.261 --> 01:00:33.591
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2529
01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:33.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2530
01:00:33.801 --> 01:00:35.630
<v Speaker 2>but I've got a job and I don't have any money.</v>

2531
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Like I would need a sponsor.</v>

2532
01:00:36.771 --> 01:00:37.280
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2533
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:37.610
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2534
01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:40.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll be your first sponsor if it's something you want to take seriously.</v>

2535
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 2>And so literally that was on a Sunday.</v>

2536
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:43.461
<v Speaker 2>Monday morning,</v>

2537
01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I walk in and quit my job immediately.</v>

2538
01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:48.830
<v Speaker 2>At two weeks later,</v>

2539
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:49.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm living in Australia,</v>

2540
01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:53.270
<v Speaker 2>trading triathlon fulltime and ended up racing triathlon professionally for the</v>

2541
01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 2>USA national team,</v>

2542
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2543
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.300
<v Speaker 2>all over the world for the next six years.</v>

2544
01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:59.870
<v Speaker 2>So it was this crazy moment.</v>

2545
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.710
<v Speaker 2>What happened ultimately with the injuries that you sustained from the fire?</v>

2546
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:05.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2547
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:05.721
<v Speaker 2>all things sincere.</v>

2548
01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:06.171
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

2549
01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 2>so that was January 14th,</v>

2550
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.631
<v Speaker 2>2008,</v>

2551
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:10.820
<v Speaker 2>so to just over 11 years ago now.</v>

2552
01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2553
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:13.040
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2554
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:13.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2555
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:14.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2556
01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I ultimately have been pretty all right.</v>

2557
01:01:16.641 --> 01:01:20.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've got some scars but it's pretty faint and was able to gain back most</v>

2558
01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:22.490
<v Speaker 2>of the full flexibility in my legs.</v>

2559
01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:25.040
<v Speaker 2>If you look at my left foot is where the worst worst burns.</v>

2560
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.330
<v Speaker 2>But where the rope really just like sat on my foot for a long time must have um,</v>

2561
01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:31.490
<v Speaker 2>that's still pretty thick with scar tissue.</v>

2562
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2563
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:32.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2564
01:01:32.151 --> 01:01:33.140
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in the mountains,</v>

2565
01:01:33.141 --> 01:01:33.861
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in places,</v>

2566
01:01:33.861 --> 01:01:34.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2567
01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 2>like climbing Mount Everest,</v>

2568
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:36.650
<v Speaker 2>like I did like pulling across Antarctica,</v>

2569
01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:40.310
<v Speaker 2>all the things I have to be really aware cause my skin regulates heat not in the</v>

2570
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>best way he and cold,</v>

2571
01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:42.320
<v Speaker 2>it's still just like,</v>

2572
01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:42.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2573
01:01:42.501 --> 01:01:43.720
<v Speaker 2>not like normal scans.</v>

2574
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>The scar tissue,</v>

2575
01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.770
<v Speaker 2>the scar tissue just is,</v>

2576
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.980
<v Speaker 2>it's just carries the heat a little bit different for some reason I guess.</v>

2577
01:01:48.981 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly why not as porous because it's exactly in the,</v>

2578
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually in the early days for the first five years,</v>

2579
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't get this so often anymore,</v>

2580
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:59.060
<v Speaker 2>but in the first literally five years of this,</v>

2581
01:01:59.061 --> 01:02:01.370
<v Speaker 2>if I bumped my legs until like a table or someone just,</v>

2582
01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:01.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2583
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.590
<v Speaker 2>bumped a chair and immediately know nothing like lightly,</v>

2584
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I would usually get a little cut there.</v>

2585
01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's just super fragile.</v>

2586
01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:06.981
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like,</v>

2587
01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:07.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2588
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.510
<v Speaker 2>glass skin kind of.</v>

2589
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:09.021
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2590
01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:09.311
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

2591
01:02:09.311 --> 01:02:11.570
<v Speaker 2>with not the same sort of flexibility that you'd normally have,</v>

2592
01:02:11.571 --> 01:02:11.901
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2593
01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:12.201
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

2594
01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:13.190
<v Speaker 2>11 years on now,</v>

2595
01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's pretty much 100%.</v>

2596
01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:16.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2597
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:18.800
<v Speaker 2>the things I've done with my legs and body in the last 10 years,</v>

2598
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:19.771
<v Speaker 2>I think proof,</v>

2599
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:21.540
<v Speaker 2>at least that my body is doing all right.</v>

2600
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:22.800
<v Speaker 2>So I feel extremely,</v>

2601
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>extremely fortunate to over cover it as,</v>

2602
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 2>as well as I did.</v>

2603
01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:26.431
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2604
01:02:26.431 --> 01:02:27.550
<v Speaker 2>more than anything I,</v>

2605
01:02:27.551 --> 01:02:28.231
<v Speaker 2>I attest that too,</v>

2606
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:28.681
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

2607
01:02:28.681 --> 01:02:28.771
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2608
01:02:28.771 --> 01:02:31.950
<v Speaker 2>the physical ability for my body to recover in the way it did.</v>

2609
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:32.670
<v Speaker 2>But I think that,</v>

2610
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:33.481
<v Speaker 2>at least for me,</v>

2611
01:02:33.481 --> 01:02:34.350
<v Speaker 2>started with the mine,</v>

2612
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.110
<v Speaker 2>started with that positivity of my mother and,</v>

2613
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:39.270
<v Speaker 2>and the duration of the many different things I've done done since then.</v>

2614
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.630
<v Speaker 2>And you said you sustained ligament damage to your joints and your knees?</v>

2615
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2616
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.441
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2617
01:02:43.441 --> 01:02:45.150
<v Speaker 2>So there was basically,</v>

2618
01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:45.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2619
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.901
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2620
01:02:45.901 --> 01:02:46.071
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2621
01:02:46.071 --> 01:02:46.501
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2622
01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2623
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:47.090
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

2624
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:47.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2625
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:47.851
<v Speaker 2>my anatomy,</v>

2626
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I have other skills with my full anatomy is not a,</v>

2627
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:51.391
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a doctor,</v>

2628
01:02:51.391 --> 01:02:52.224
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

2629
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2630
01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:53.341
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2631
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:55.560
<v Speaker 2>basically the ligaments particular on the backs of my knees,</v>

2632
01:02:55.561 --> 01:02:57.780
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know exactly what that ligament is that goes through,</v>

2633
01:02:57.810 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2634
01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:58.741
<v Speaker 2>through there.</v>

2635
01:02:58.741 --> 01:02:59.250
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2636
01:02:59.250 --> 01:02:59.521
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2637
01:02:59.521 --> 01:03:00.740
<v Speaker 2>that was really jammed up with,</v>

2638
01:03:00.741 --> 01:03:01.680
<v Speaker 2>with the scar tissue.</v>

2639
01:03:01.681 --> 01:03:05.640
<v Speaker 2>So I wasn't able for a long time to fully bend my knees and flex them in the</v>

2640
01:03:05.641 --> 01:03:06.091
<v Speaker 2>full way.</v>

2641
01:03:06.091 --> 01:03:06.924
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing,</v>

2642
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.351
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2643
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:07.891
<v Speaker 2>in the ankles,</v>

2644
01:03:07.891 --> 01:03:08.850
<v Speaker 2>whatever that ligament is,</v>

2645
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.890
<v Speaker 2>that goes sort of basically turn,</v>

2646
01:03:10.891 --> 01:03:11.081
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2647
01:03:11.081 --> 01:03:11.761
<v Speaker 2>not your Achilles,</v>

2648
01:03:11.761 --> 01:03:13.260
<v Speaker 2>but the other side of your foot.</v>

2649
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

2650
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:17.760
<v Speaker 2>That part was just so much scar tissue had formed a way the skin was healing</v>

2651
01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:18.211
<v Speaker 2>around that.</v>

2652
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:19.620
<v Speaker 2>And from the damage to the ligament,</v>

2653
01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.950
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't sort of being able to fluidly flex,</v>

2654
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2655
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.730
<v Speaker 2>in the way that you normally would see a foot.</v>

2656
01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:26.790
<v Speaker 2>So full they imagined point margin might be on a point your foot basically if</v>

2657
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:26.941
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2658
01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:27.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2659
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.320
<v Speaker 2>putting your leg forward out,</v>

2660
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:28.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2661
01:03:28.591 --> 01:03:30.000
<v Speaker 2>back like kicking like that.</v>

2662
01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:31.110
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2663
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:32.460
<v Speaker 2>for a long time and it was kind of a,</v>

2664
01:03:32.461 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 2>so it was kind of like dragging my feet around in that first year.</v>

2665
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2666
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:36.240
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2667
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.330
<v Speaker 2>so did you have to just push through the scar tissue and break it up?</v>

2668
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2669
01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a lot of,</v>

2670
01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:42.780
<v Speaker 2>a lot of obviously PT,</v>

2671
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:43.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

2672
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2673
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.653
<v Speaker 2>massage.</v>

2674
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.513
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2675
01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

2676
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.120
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a funny story.</v>

2677
01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:48.410
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

2678
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:49.141
<v Speaker 2>I haven't thought of this story.</v>

2679
01:03:49.141 --> 01:03:50.640
<v Speaker 2>They log type of,</v>

2680
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2681
01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2682
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.160
<v Speaker 2>if ever told this story actually.</v>

2683
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:53.731
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2684
01:03:53.731 --> 01:03:54.870
<v Speaker 2>so when I got burned,</v>

2685
01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:57.510
<v Speaker 2>I've been traveling by myself in Thailand or around the world,</v>

2686
01:03:57.511 --> 01:04:02.070
<v Speaker 2>but I actually met up with my childhood best friend named David Boyer who</v>

2687
01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:02.520
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

2688
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:02.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2689
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:04.890
<v Speaker 2>re married my sister and they have two kids.</v>

2690
01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:07.170
<v Speaker 2>So my childhood best friend turned into my brother in law,</v>

2691
01:04:07.171 --> 01:04:08.310
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty fun.</v>

2692
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.451
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2693
01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:09.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2694
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

2695
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2696
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:11.910
<v Speaker 2>he had been,</v>

2697
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:13.530
<v Speaker 2>he had actually been with me when I got burned.</v>

2698
01:04:13.531 --> 01:04:16.170
<v Speaker 2>So those first five days in the hospital before my mom got there,</v>

2699
01:04:16.171 --> 01:04:17.004
<v Speaker 2>he was with me.</v>

2700
01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2701
01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:17.760
<v Speaker 2>and was,</v>

2702
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.421
<v Speaker 2>it was a saint,</v>

2703
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:18.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2704
01:04:18.601 --> 01:04:21.780
<v Speaker 2>we're both these scared little 22 year old kids and he's like trying to do his</v>

2705
01:04:21.781 --> 01:04:23.730
<v Speaker 2>best to look after me and he's freaked out.</v>

2706
01:04:23.731 --> 01:04:25.020
<v Speaker 2>But when I get back to Portland,</v>

2707
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:25.861
<v Speaker 2>his mother,</v>

2708
01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:27.960
<v Speaker 2>who was kind of a second mother for me growing up,</v>

2709
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.100
<v Speaker 2>my name's Kate Boyer.</v>

2710
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2711
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:30.840
<v Speaker 2>she obviously was like,</v>

2712
01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:31.051
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2713
01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:32.070
<v Speaker 2>this could have been my son.</v>

2714
01:04:32.071 --> 01:04:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Just as you said it had been,</v>

2715
01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:33.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2716
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:33.811
<v Speaker 2>her son,</v>

2717
01:04:33.811 --> 01:04:33.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2718
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:35.700
<v Speaker 2>just kind of felt like protective of me.</v>

2719
01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:37.830
<v Speaker 2>So she comes over to my house one day and she goes,</v>

2720
01:04:37.831 --> 01:04:37.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2721
01:04:37.981 --> 01:04:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing some untraditional healing work.</v>

2722
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Would you be open to that?</v>

2723
01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:42.690
<v Speaker 2>And at this point was like,</v>

2724
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:43.740
<v Speaker 2>I'll take anything.</v>

2725
01:04:43.741 --> 01:04:44.670
<v Speaker 2>What do you guys mind?</v>

2726
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:45.331
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>

2727
01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:46.000

2733
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I was like saying yes to everything at this point.</v>

2734
01:04:53.461 --> 01:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm looking for any way to recover.</v>

2735
01:04:54.961 --> 01:04:55.261

2741
01:04:57.211 --> 01:04:58.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just light healing.</v>

2742
01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.390
<v Speaker 2>And so I go to this basement,</v>

2749
01:05:12.961 --> 01:05:15.910
<v Speaker 2>And then he's like looking really intensely at my foot and I sit there for like</v>

2750
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.990
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>

2751

2761
01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:24.581

2765
01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:32.491
<v Speaker 2>but what I mostly did was I put this force field of white light or right foot</v>

2766
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:33.520
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>

2768

<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty,</v>

2769
01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 2>I've down with some untraditional traditional stuff,</v>

2770
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:38.110
<v Speaker 2>but I was kind of like [inaudible] cool.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

2773
01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:40.811
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it.</v>

2774
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:41.111
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2775
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:41.950
<v Speaker 2>what's this bucket?</v>

2776
01:05:41.951 --> 01:05:42.670
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

2777
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:47.080
<v Speaker 2>this is the salt bucket that takes the negative energy away from your foot and</v>

2778
01:05:47.081 --> 01:05:50.560
<v Speaker 2>your leg and puts the negative energy in there as I'm bringing in this light and</v>

2779
01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>says pranic healing.</v>

2780
01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:52.180
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2781
01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 2>so you have this light blue forcefield over your left foot right now,</v>

2782
01:05:55.211 --> 01:05:56.890
<v Speaker 2>which was the worst burn part of my body.</v>

2783
01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:57.341
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2784
01:05:57.341 --> 01:05:57.641
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

2785
01:05:57.641 --> 01:06:01.120
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend not showering for the next couple of days as you might wash up</v>

2786
01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:01.954
<v Speaker 2>the force field.</v>

2787
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.170
<v Speaker 2>So jails.</v>

2788
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:07.310
<v Speaker 2>So I tell this story with the total smile,</v>

2789
01:06:07.311 --> 01:06:09.160
<v Speaker 2>a cheeky smile on my face because that's funny.</v>

2790
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:10.630
<v Speaker 2>I haven't thought of a story a lot of time,</v>

2791
01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:15.900
<v Speaker 2>but I will say that the next day I walked further than I had the rest of the</v>

2792
01:06:16.211 --> 01:06:16.511
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2793
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:17.950
<v Speaker 2>So you want to call that placebo,</v>

2794
01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:21.220
<v Speaker 2>you want to call it whatever I emotionally was it fully bought in on the Pranic</v>

2795
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:21.521
<v Speaker 2>healing.</v>

2796
01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:21.671
<v Speaker 2>I'll be,</v>

2797
01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:22.091
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2798
01:06:22.091 --> 01:06:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I am into very a lot of alternative modalities.</v>

2799
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:24.740
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2800
01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:25.573
<v Speaker 2>I wish it was true.</v>

2801
01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:28.230
<v Speaker 6>I wish it was true.</v>

2802
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:29.880
<v Speaker 6>I met a lady at the comedy store once,</v>

2803
01:06:29.881 --> 01:06:31.530
<v Speaker 6>told me she does reiki healing.</v>

2804
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.950
<v Speaker 6>She like Kinda rubbed her hands together and waved him in front of me.</v>

2805
01:06:34.951 --> 01:06:35.161
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

2806
01:06:35.161 --> 01:06:35.994
<v Speaker 6>what are you doing?</v>

2807
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.720
<v Speaker 6>She's like,</v>

2808
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:36.941
<v Speaker 6>do you,</v>

2809
01:06:36.941 --> 01:06:37.711
<v Speaker 6>do you feel that?</v>

2810
01:06:37.711 --> 01:06:37.911
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

2811
01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:38.701
<v Speaker 6>don't feel shit.</v>

2812
01:06:38.701 --> 01:06:39.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what you're talking.</v>

2813
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Rough.</v>

2814
01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.490
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

2815
01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.130
<v Speaker 2>that part,</v>

2816
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it worked or it didn't work,</v>

2817
01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:44.761
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2818
01:06:44.761 --> 01:06:47.050
<v Speaker 2>the combination of the amount of people with,</v>

2819
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2820
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.540
<v Speaker 2>in the hospital with the physical therapist,</v>

2821
01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:50.710
<v Speaker 2>with my mother at home,</v>

2822
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:53.080
<v Speaker 2>with Kate boy taking me to the pranic healing,</v>

2823
01:06:53.081 --> 01:06:56.980
<v Speaker 2>a culmination of all of those things somehow did unlock the,</v>

2824
01:06:56.981 --> 01:06:57.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2825
01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:59.550
<v Speaker 2>the scar tissue and allow me to make a full recovery or,</v>

2826
01:06:59.551 --> 01:07:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a lot of hard work for,</v>

2827
01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:01.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2828
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 2>a year plus to get back on my feet.</v>

2829
01:07:03.341 --> 01:07:04.210
<v Speaker 2>But I got there.</v>

2830
01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:04.501
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2831
01:07:04.501 --> 01:07:09.501
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there's something to be said for believing or at least having positive</v>

2832
01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:15.620
<v Speaker 6>thoughts about your healing and making sure that you look at it in terms of like</v>

2833
01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:16.650
<v Speaker 6>this can be done.</v>

2834
01:07:16.651 --> 01:07:17.070
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

2835
01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:17.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2836
01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:17.761
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2837
01:07:17.761 --> 01:07:18.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean very skeptical.</v>

2838
01:07:18.691 --> 01:07:19.380
<v Speaker 2>The salt man,</v>

2839
01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.630
<v Speaker 2>like I said that the salt man take it for what it is.</v>

2840
01:07:21.631 --> 01:07:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2841
01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:25.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling that story not as an advocate for product Kaylene necessary,</v>

2842
01:07:25.411 --> 01:07:27.390
<v Speaker 2>but I will say agreeing with what you just said,</v>

2843
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:28.890
<v Speaker 2>there is something about that.</v>

2844
01:07:28.891 --> 01:07:32.250
<v Speaker 2>There's something about being wrapped in the positivity that I was with my</v>

2845
01:07:32.251 --> 01:07:33.660
<v Speaker 2>mother in that moment of just being like,</v>

2846
01:07:33.661 --> 01:07:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2847

2848
01:07:34.981 --> 01:07:36.090
<v Speaker 2>let's figure this out together.</v>

2849
01:07:36.091 --> 01:07:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Like let's focus our mind on something.</v>

2850
01:07:38.191 --> 01:07:39.000
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of,</v>

2851

2853
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:40.651
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

2854
01:07:40.651 --> 01:07:40.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2857

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2858
01:07:42.001 --> 01:07:43.230
<v Speaker 2>people ask me this question like,</v>

2859
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.320
<v Speaker 2>are you a superhuman?</v>

2860
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:44.820
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2861
01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.031

2864
01:07:46.951 --> 01:07:50.910
<v Speaker 2>that's how I feel like we all have this capacity in our minds to unlock all</v>

2865
01:07:50.911 --> 01:07:51.481
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things.</v>

2866

2871
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:55.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2872
01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.310
<v Speaker 2>sit,</v>

2873
01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:57.660
<v Speaker 2>sit in a warehouse,</v>

2874
01:07:57.661 --> 01:07:58.351
<v Speaker 2>into a podcast,</v>

2875
01:07:58.351 --> 01:07:59.370
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is you want to do,</v>

2876
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:02.520
<v Speaker 2>she can fucking do amazing things like Ed,</v>

2877
01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:02.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2878
01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:04.350
<v Speaker 2>having that belief does,</v>

2879
01:08:04.351 --> 01:08:05.610
<v Speaker 2>does add up to that.</v>

2880
01:08:05.611 --> 01:08:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's step one in my opinion,</v>

2881
01:08:07.111 --> 01:08:07.980
<v Speaker 2>is visualizing that,</v>

2882
01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:08.740
<v Speaker 2>believing it.</v>

2883
01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:09.880
<v Speaker 6>On the flip side,</v>

2884
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:14.910
<v Speaker 6>having a negative self worth or a negative opinion of what you're about to do or</v>

2885
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 6>a negative thought about</v>

2886
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.580
<v Speaker 1>the future can also manifest all sorts.</v>

2887
01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Terrible results.</v>

2888
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:20.211
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2889
01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2890
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:21.763
<v Speaker 1>Gotta think mean.</v>

2891
01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Placebo effect is a real thing.</v>

2892
01:08:23.511 --> 01:08:24.051
<v Speaker 1>We know that,</v>

2893
01:08:24.051 --> 01:08:24.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2894
01:08:24.321 --> 01:08:28.460
<v Speaker 1>We know that if you really do believe that you're going to get better because of</v>

2895
01:08:28.461 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>some sugar pill they give you.</v>

2896
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:31.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a tangible result,</v>

2897
01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:33.530
<v Speaker 1>100% if you really believe.</v>

2898
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2899
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:35.180
<v Speaker 1>So if that salt guy,</v>

2900
01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>if the thing about all that stupid shit is,</v>

2901
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>if you believe it,</v>

2902
01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:40.680
<v Speaker 1>it actually has an effect.</v>

2903
01:08:40.690 --> 01:08:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

2904
01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of healers out there that at least on paper are totally full of</v>

2905
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:46.820
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2906
01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>But if you believe in these assholes,</v>

2907
01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:49.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2908
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.730
<v Speaker 1>they can have such difference.</v>

2909
01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It's very slippery.</v>

2910
01:08:52.281 --> 01:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>The human mind is such a slippery thing.</v>

2911
01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2912
01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:55.411
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

2913
01:08:55.411 --> 01:08:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll go back to my own experience and again,</v>

2914
01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2915
01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how a femoral are out there you want to get,</v>

2916
01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but I'm out there in Antarctica 54 days alone.</v>

2917
01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm telling you,</v>

2918
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this for this bigger purpose.</v>

2919
01:09:05.721 --> 01:09:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm feel like I'm tapped into that.</v>

2920
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.220
<v Speaker 1>And like legitimately there were moments,</v>

2921
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:10.971
<v Speaker 1>at least for me,</v>

2922
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:12.740
<v Speaker 1>whether I'm manifesting that in my mind,</v>

2923
01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:13.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>

2924
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.450
<v Speaker 1>that I am actually feeling energetically uplifted by the people pushing me on.</v>

2925
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Like there were days that were incredibly hard where I would sit there and I'd</v>

2926
01:09:20.271 --> 01:09:20.990
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

2927
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.381
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2928
01:09:21.381 --> 01:09:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can do this.</v>

2929
01:09:22.251 --> 01:09:22.641
<v Speaker 1>And I'm done.</v>

2930
01:09:22.641 --> 01:09:23.361
<v Speaker 1>Like boom.</v>

2931
01:09:23.361 --> 01:09:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Like I would get over,</v>

2932
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I would hit with this serve larger purpose,</v>

2933
01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:26.841
<v Speaker 1>that's larger outcome.</v>

2934
01:09:26.841 --> 01:09:27.770
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2935
01:09:27.771 --> 01:09:28.604
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not,</v>

2936
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a super religious person.</v>

2937
01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I was actually raised on a hippie commune.</v>

2938
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I come from a pretty untraditional background,</v>

2939
01:09:34.251 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 1>but like the energetic field,</v>

2940
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.930
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call that or if that's just the belief in something,</v>

2941
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:39.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2942
01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:40.310
<v Speaker 1>the power of that.</v>

2943
01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I felt the strength from those moments.</v>

2944
01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:45.470
<v Speaker 1>There was moments when my body's switched from kind of being negative.</v>

2945
01:09:45.471 --> 01:09:45.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

2946
01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:46.820
<v Speaker 1>another hard day out here.</v>

2947
01:09:46.821 --> 01:09:47.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

2948
01:09:47.241 --> 01:09:49.700
<v Speaker 1>it's minus 25 to tapping into those flow states.</v>

2949
01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:50.600
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

2950
01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:50.871
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2951
01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't have perfect words for that.</v>

2952
01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2953
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2954
01:09:53.271 --> 01:09:55.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to try to build my vocabulary around that.</v>

2955
01:09:55.641 --> 01:09:56.750
<v Speaker 1>But that energy,</v>

2956
01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it was derived from what you're saying.</v>

2957
01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.360
<v Speaker 1>If you start to believe it,</v>

2958
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:00.440
<v Speaker 1>if you can believe like,</v>

2959
01:10:00.441 --> 01:10:00.741
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2960
01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:01.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a larger purpose in this,</v>

2961
01:10:01.881 --> 01:10:02.241
<v Speaker 1>or hey,</v>

2962
01:10:02.241 --> 01:10:04.730
<v Speaker 1>this blue force fields and one foot,</v>

2963
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.970
<v Speaker 1>there is something that if you can originate that positivity in your mind that I</v>

2964
01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:10.430
<v Speaker 1>think can give us incredible amounts of strength,</v>

2965
01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:11.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2966
01:10:11.190 --> 01:10:12.770
<v Speaker 1>and then we can tap into something greater.</v>

2967
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2968
01:10:13.191 --> 01:10:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely something to what you were saying about the untapped</v>

2969
01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:18.260
<v Speaker 1>limits of the human potential and that there's,</v>

2970
01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.480
<v Speaker 1>most people barely scratched the surface of that.</v>

2971
01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And if you really firmly get into that zone and believe you can do things that</v>

2972
01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:27.224
<v Speaker 1>people just,</v>

2973
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:33.220
<v Speaker 1>they really don't have any idea what they can do if they have to because people</v>

2974
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:35.840
<v Speaker 1>are rarely pushed to their actual limits.</v>

2975
01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:36.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2976
01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2977
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2978
01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.870
<v Speaker 1>it's been said many times before I say it,</v>

2979
01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:39.251
<v Speaker 1>but at that,</v>

2980
01:10:39.251 --> 01:10:41.630
<v Speaker 1>that idea that growth happens outside the comfort zone.</v>

2981
01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:46.010
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I've personally thought about a lot in this space is,</v>

2982
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2983
01:10:46.581 --> 01:10:48.020
<v Speaker 1>I got severely burned in this fire.</v>

2984
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

2985
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2986
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I chose the jump the rope.</v>

2987
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:52.730
<v Speaker 1>So I was chose to be a knucklehead 22 year old kid on a beach in Thailand.</v>

2988
01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:53.451
<v Speaker 1>But like I wasn't like,</v>

2989
01:10:53.451 --> 01:10:53.691
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2990
01:10:53.691 --> 01:10:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I want to get severely burned today.</v>

2991
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Like that happened to me.</v>

2992
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2993
01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Which forced me through this intense,</v>

2994
01:11:00.261 --> 01:11:01.400
<v Speaker 1>tragic moment.</v>

2995
01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:02.301
<v Speaker 1>But from that,</v>

2996
01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I was able to learn of this sort of untapped potential inside of me because of</v>

2997
01:11:05.571 --> 01:11:06.051
<v Speaker 1>the outcome,</v>

2998
01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:07.340
<v Speaker 1>because of winning this triathlon.</v>

2999
01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:11.990
<v Speaker 1>But what I realized is that it's hard to choose that path often.</v>

3000
01:11:11.991 --> 01:11:14.550
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to push yourself outside of those boundaries,</v>

3001
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 2>but things that are,</v>

3002
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:15.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3003
01:11:15.691 --> 01:11:17.070
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote forced on you.</v>

3004
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3005
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.760
<v Speaker 2>let's look at something that half of this population essentially does give</v>

3006
01:11:20.761 --> 01:11:21.121
<v Speaker 2>birth,</v>

3007
01:11:21.121 --> 01:11:21.811
<v Speaker 2>like childbirth,</v>

3008
01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 2>natural childbirth,</v>

3009
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:22.831
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3010
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:26.490
<v Speaker 2>It's been happening since the beginning of time and that's an incredibly intense</v>

3011
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:29.130
<v Speaker 2>physical manifestation of the power of the human body.</v>

3012
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:29.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3013
01:11:29.341 --> 01:11:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't even imagine obviously what that would look like,</v>

3014
01:11:32.341 --> 01:11:33.870
<v Speaker 2>nor will I ever be able to experience that.</v>

3015
01:11:33.871 --> 01:11:35.730
<v Speaker 2>But that's incredibly powerful.</v>

3016
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Or times when people,</v>

3017
01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:37.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3018
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 2>are forced to go through a cancer diagnosis and have to go through radiation and</v>

3019
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 2>chemo and you know,</v>

3020
01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:44.520
<v Speaker 2>facing the mortality and all this sort of stuff,</v>

3021
01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:45.810
<v Speaker 2>people get through those.</v>

3022
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:50.040
<v Speaker 2>But oftentimes these tragedies have to be forced upon us for us to do them.</v>

3023
01:11:50.041 --> 01:11:52.020
<v Speaker 2>And so my exploration now with my,</v>

3024
01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:52.271
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>

3025
01:11:52.271 --> 01:11:52.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3026
01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.310
<v Speaker 2>creative artwork,</v>

3027
01:11:53.311 --> 01:11:53.701
<v Speaker 2>I call it,</v>

3028
01:11:53.701 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 2>with these expeditions,</v>

3029
01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:57.480
<v Speaker 2>these world record projects that push my body and mind,</v>

3030
01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 2>it's me choosing to step into those moments.</v>

3031
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:04.500
<v Speaker 2>It's me choosing to put my body in mind in these intense moments because of a</v>

3032
01:12:04.501 --> 01:12:05.670
<v Speaker 2>deep curiosity of like,</v>

3033
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:07.980
<v Speaker 2>what are the limits of human potential?</v>

3034
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:08.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3035
01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:09.450
<v Speaker 2>what are my limits?</v>

3036
01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:13.710
<v Speaker 2>What are our limits collectively and can my physical expression of this inspire</v>

3037
01:12:13.711 --> 01:12:14.790
<v Speaker 2>other people to innovate,</v>

3038
01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:17.910
<v Speaker 2>create and do amazing things in the world and in and other modalities and</v>

3039
01:12:17.911 --> 01:12:18.744
<v Speaker 2>canvases?</v>

3040
01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:19.001
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3041
01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:22.300
<v Speaker 6>that's one of the weird things about people doing extraordinary things like what</v>

3042
01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:26.530
<v Speaker 6>you did is that you absolutely will give other people fuel to accomplish things</v>

3043
01:12:26.531 --> 01:12:27.364
<v Speaker 6>in their life.</v>

3044
01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:30.430
<v Speaker 6>Inspiration is so critical for human beings.</v>

3045
01:12:30.431 --> 01:12:30.671
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3046
01:12:30.671 --> 01:12:35.671
<v Speaker 6>I draw upon it from so many different sources from David Goggins and a bunch of</v>

3047
01:12:36.281 --> 01:12:37.114
<v Speaker 6>my other friends,</v>

3048
01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:38.380
<v Speaker 6>my friend Cameron Hanes,</v>

3049
01:12:38.381 --> 01:12:41.350
<v Speaker 6>and a lot of other people that are endurance athletes and different people that</v>

3050
01:12:41.351 --> 01:12:43.690
<v Speaker 6>have been interviewed on this podcast.</v>

3051
01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.010
<v Speaker 6>But there's something that happens when you realize that people can do</v>

3052
01:12:48.011 --> 01:12:52.930
<v Speaker 6>extraordinary things that makes you believe in the potential,</v>

3053
01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:54.400
<v Speaker 6>not just in that person,</v>

3054
01:12:54.401 --> 01:12:55.234
<v Speaker 6>but also in yourself.</v>

3055
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.931
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3056
01:12:55.931 --> 01:12:56.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3057
01:12:56.201 --> 01:12:56.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3058
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:58.120
<v Speaker 2>God is a great example of that.</v>

3059
01:12:58.121 --> 01:12:58.990
<v Speaker 2>I've never met him,</v>

3060
01:12:58.991 --> 01:13:01.270
<v Speaker 2>but I know I've personally derived inspiration from that guy.</v>

3061
01:13:01.271 --> 01:13:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3062
01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:02.643
<v Speaker 2>he gets out there,</v>

3063
01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:02.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3064
01:13:02.831 --> 01:13:03.730
<v Speaker 2>you can't run a hundred miles.</v>

3065
01:13:03.731 --> 01:13:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll show you like I run a hundred miles,</v>

3066
01:13:05.471 --> 01:13:05.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3067
01:13:05.741 --> 01:13:07.480
<v Speaker 2>and he's pushing his by two extreme ways.</v>

3068
01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:07.781
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

3069
01:13:07.781 --> 01:13:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I love what he says about the 40% you know,</v>

3070
01:13:09.671 --> 01:13:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I think about it a little bit different in my mind,</v>

3071
01:13:11.261 --> 01:13:12.610
<v Speaker 2>but like what are those limits?</v>

3072
01:13:12.611 --> 01:13:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3073
01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.330
<v Speaker 2>don't know if it's 40% of people quit.</v>

3074
01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:15.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3075
01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.900
<v Speaker 2>people quit that I can't.</v>

3076
01:13:16.901 --> 01:13:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Voice comes up and you know,</v>

3077
01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:19.901
<v Speaker 2>he's proven it.</v>

3078
01:13:19.901 --> 01:13:21.970
<v Speaker 2>So as many other people have actually,</v>

3079
01:13:21.971 --> 01:13:23.530
<v Speaker 2>when you say I can actually,</v>

3080
01:13:23.531 --> 01:13:24.550
<v Speaker 2>when you don't stop,</v>

3081
01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.361
<v Speaker 2>you get stronger.</v>

3082
01:13:25.361 --> 01:13:27.790
<v Speaker 2>And for me in my own story and my own journey,</v>

3083
01:13:27.791 --> 01:13:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that final day that finally final 32 hour push proves it three days</v>

3084
01:13:32.591 --> 01:13:33.221
<v Speaker 2>before that,</v>

3085
01:13:33.221 --> 01:13:33.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3086
01:13:33.371 --> 01:13:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm videotaping all this.</v>

3087
01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to capture as much content to be able to share with people of this</v>

3088
01:13:37.091 --> 01:13:39.850
<v Speaker 2>crazy weird place that's an article by yourself.</v>

3089
01:13:39.851 --> 01:13:44.020
<v Speaker 2>And like day 49 day 40 50 like I'm literally crying into my goal.</v>

3090
01:13:44.021 --> 01:13:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Probean like I'm running out of food,</v>

3091
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm exhausted.</v>

3092
01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can keep doing this.</v>

3093
01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like worked.</v>

3094
01:13:49.841 --> 01:13:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3095
01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:51.520
<v Speaker 2>But sure enough,</v>

3096
01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't say I can't,</v>

3097
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:53.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3098
01:13:53.441 --> 01:13:53.901
<v Speaker 2>it's that for,</v>

3099
01:13:53.901 --> 01:13:57.300
<v Speaker 2>it was at 40% was that 50% that's that moment when I wanted to quit or I should</v>

3100
01:13:57.301 --> 01:13:58.134
<v Speaker 2>have quit.</v>

3101
01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.920
<v Speaker 2>But then the strongest,</v>

3102
01:13:59.921 --> 01:14:04.060
<v Speaker 2>most amazing moment of my entire athletic career that spans decades happens</v>

3103
01:14:04.061 --> 01:14:05.830
<v Speaker 2>three days later because I kept pushing.</v>

3104
01:14:05.831 --> 01:14:07.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I rested for three days and pulled that off.</v>

3105
01:14:07.841 --> 01:14:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I never took a rest day in 54 days.</v>

3106
01:14:10.211 --> 01:14:13.990
<v Speaker 2>I pulled my sled to 13 hours every single day and on the last day it was the</v>

3107
01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 2>strongest as possible.</v>

3108
01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.410
<v Speaker 2>So I think it proves if we can push through that,</v>

3109
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't moment.</v>

3110
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:18.761
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3111
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:19.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to work.</v>

3112
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.920
<v Speaker 2>That you can get there.</v>

3113
01:14:20.921 --> 01:14:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately,</v>

3114
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:22.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3115
01:14:22.151 --> 01:14:23.920
<v Speaker 2>we talk about 40% with Goggins.</v>

3116
01:14:23.921 --> 01:14:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I actually think a lot of people quit at 1% they're sitting behind their office,</v>

3117
01:14:27.131 --> 01:14:27.640
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3118
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3119
01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:30.550
<v Speaker 2>one day I want to travel overseas or you know,</v>

3120
01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I hate this job.</v>

3121
01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:32.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3122
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I've got this great business idea,</v>

3123
01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:33.971
<v Speaker 2>but I made it.</v>

3124
01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:34.360
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

3125
01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:34.951
<v Speaker 2>but I can't,</v>

3126
01:14:34.951 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 2>like I've got no money to start this business.</v>

3127
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:37.271
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten no this,</v>

3128
01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:42.271
<v Speaker 2>like when I first set off my first world record in 2016 2014 I sat with Jenna in</v>

3129
01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:43.061
<v Speaker 2>my house,</v>

3130
01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:45.130
<v Speaker 2>one bedroom apartment with a whiteboard and were like,</v>

3131
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna see if I can set the world record for the explorer's Grand Slam.</v>

3132
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Something fewer than 50 people in the world have ever done and I'm going to be</v>

3133
01:14:50.471 --> 01:14:53.250
<v Speaker 2>the fastest time ever is coming to not only climb Kilimanjaro in northwest South</v>

3134
01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:53.251
<v Speaker 2>Pole,</v>

3135
01:14:53.251 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 2>back to back.</v>

3136
01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.030
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't climbed a bunch of mountains.</v>

3137
01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Be Pretty easy to say I can't.</v>

3138
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:56.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3139
01:14:56.561 --> 01:14:57.370
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

3140
01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:58.780
<v Speaker 2>we have no money to do this.</v>

3141
01:14:58.781 --> 01:14:59.830
<v Speaker 2>We have no platform.</v>

3142
01:14:59.831 --> 01:15:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I have like 200 Instagram followers.</v>

3143
01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:01.791
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3144
01:15:01.791 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have like nothing,</v>

3145
01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.420
<v Speaker 2>but we just sat there were like no.</v>

3146
01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Instead of saying I can't,</v>

3147
01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.153
<v Speaker 2>let's say I can't,</v>

3148
01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.110
<v Speaker 2>what's the first step to that?</v>

3149
01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.360
<v Speaker 2>We literally get out our laptops and I'm like going to like,</v>

3150
01:15:10.361 --> 01:15:10.571
<v Speaker 2>we were like,</v>

3151
01:15:10.571 --> 01:15:13.930
<v Speaker 2>we want to build this big media campaign where lots of people follow and get</v>

3152
01:15:13.931 --> 01:15:14.411
<v Speaker 2>pressed.</v>

3153
01:15:14.411 --> 01:15:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Like we know nothing about.</v>

3154
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:16.380
<v Speaker 2>We have no background this week.</v>

3155
01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>

3156
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.660
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between marketing and PR?</v>

3157
01:15:19.661 --> 01:15:24.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are literally asking Google the most basic of all basic questions.</v>

3158
01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3159
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:27.011
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3160
01:15:27.011 --> 01:15:27.281
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3161
01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:28.510
<v Speaker 2>we continue to say like,</v>

3162
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:31.960
<v Speaker 2>let's get coffee with our one friend who knows something about this.</v>

3163
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.730
<v Speaker 2>We should probably get a website.</v>

3164
01:15:33.731 --> 01:15:35.410
<v Speaker 2>How does one build a website?</v>

3165
01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.120
<v Speaker 2>And it goes on and on like this.</v>

3166
01:15:37.121 --> 01:15:38.710
<v Speaker 2>How long ago did you start this journey?</v>

3167
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:39.603
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

3168
01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.630
<v Speaker 2>that was 24 when we,</v>

3169
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:42.010
<v Speaker 2>2014 when we dreamed that up.</v>

3170
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:42.420
<v Speaker 2>This will,</v>

3171
01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.110
<v Speaker 2>the world record was to see if I could years ago.</v>

3172
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:44.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3173
01:15:44.501 --> 01:15:46.840
<v Speaker 2>So just see if I could set the world record for something called the explorer's</v>

3174
01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:47.291
<v Speaker 2>Grand Slam.</v>

3175
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:49.600
<v Speaker 2>So let's come and tallest mountain on each of the seven continents,</v>

3176
01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:50.470
<v Speaker 2>seven summits.</v>

3177
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:51.490
<v Speaker 2>And before that,</v>

3178
01:15:51.491 --> 01:15:55.150
<v Speaker 2>had you done anything like that or did it just been athletics?</v>

3179
01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:56.260
<v Speaker 2>So I grew up in Portland,</v>

3180
01:15:56.261 --> 01:15:57.820
<v Speaker 2>so I grew up like in the outdoors,</v>

3181
01:15:57.821 --> 01:16:00.220
<v Speaker 2>but like I mean to go climb Everest and Denali sort of thing.</v>

3182
01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:00.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3183
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:02.710
<v Speaker 2>like the short answer is I'm going to climb a few mountains,</v>

3184
01:16:02.711 --> 01:16:02.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3185
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I'd never been in the snow before.</v>

3186
01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I'd worn crampons ice.</v>

3187
01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:05.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3188
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.790
<v Speaker 2>and I had zero experience,</v>

3189
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:10.000
<v Speaker 2>but like not even close to the experience that you would think one would need to</v>

3190
01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:10.570
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

3191
01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:12.300
<v Speaker 2>And to just break world records,</v>

3192
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:15.700
<v Speaker 2>not just be the fastest person to ever complete it.</v>

3193
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:15.851
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3194
01:16:15.851 --> 01:16:16.211
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3195
01:16:16.211 --> 01:16:19.210
<v Speaker 2>it ended up being 139 days straight through to climb all those mountains.</v>

3196
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know.</v>

3197
01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3198
01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I think we had a clip up a second ago if something on Everest.</v>

3199
01:16:23.561 --> 01:16:24.430
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

3200
01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.151
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

3201
01:16:25.151 --> 01:16:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean to do,</v>

3202
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.950
<v Speaker 2>to do all of that,</v>

3203
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:29.680
<v Speaker 2>it started from this place of not of,</v>

3204
01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.090
<v Speaker 2>of a believing I can.</v>

3205
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:31.451
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3206
01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3207
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:32.621
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>

3208
01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:34.500
<v Speaker 2>it's fun to talk about the epic adventure buddy.</v>

3209
01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:34.870
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

3210
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:35.141
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

3211
01:16:35.141 --> 01:16:38.290
<v Speaker 2>it's actually fun to talk about what happened behind the scenes of that because</v>

3212
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:39.341
<v Speaker 2>what actually happened,</v>

3213
01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:41.290
<v Speaker 2>like people applaud our success.</v>

3214
01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Now this is me.</v>

3215
01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:45.310
<v Speaker 2>This is you walking across the ladder,</v>

3216
01:16:45.311 --> 01:16:45.650
<v Speaker 2>that's you know,</v>

3217
01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:47.000
<v Speaker 2>about 300 foot hole,</v>

3218
01:16:47.001 --> 01:16:47.834
<v Speaker 2>a crevasse,</v>

3219
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.371
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3220
01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:51.610
<v Speaker 2>on the other side of it that you have to go through to on your way up the,</v>

3221
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:51.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3222
01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.380
<v Speaker 2>the Mount Everest climbing route.</v>

3223
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:55.720
<v Speaker 2>And so your crampons or clicking on the,</v>

3224
01:16:55.721 --> 01:16:56.160
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

3225
01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.930
<v Speaker 2>and you're hooking them on the ladder as you walk across.</v>

3226
01:16:58.931 --> 01:16:59.471
<v Speaker 2>And if you fall,</v>

3227
01:16:59.471 --> 01:16:59.950
<v Speaker 2>you die.</v>

3228
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:00.783
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3229
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:02.703
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3230
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:05.440
<v Speaker 2>So watch this again.</v>

3231
01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.060
<v Speaker 2>This is so awful.</v>

3232
01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.110
<v Speaker 2>It's so awful.</v>

3233
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

3234
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 2>cause</v>

3235
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.221
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3236
01:17:10.221 --> 01:17:13.700
<v Speaker 1>you're basically just walking this tight rope on.</v>

3237
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:14.743
<v Speaker 1>Let me hear it.</v>

3238
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Listen to that click folks,</v>

3239
01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I implore you to go to the Instagram page so you get the full freak out.</v>

3240
01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.640
<v Speaker 1>They're tied together to those ladders ties.</v>

3241
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3242
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Can he as can be it?</v>

3243
01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:28.700
<v Speaker 1>The 300 foot cavern over there?</v>

3244
01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.391
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

3245
01:17:29.391 --> 01:17:32.510
<v Speaker 1>All this cheese us.</v>

3246
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3247
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:36.900
<v Speaker 1>and you're looking down because you have a Gopro on it.</v>

3248
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:37.281
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3249
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 1>he cut the sound off at the end there,</v>

3250
01:17:38.691 --> 01:17:42.110
<v Speaker 1>but I go at the bear and I go because it's like there was 50 of those letters,</v>

3251
01:17:42.111 --> 01:17:44.390
<v Speaker 1>but I was cheering every fucking time I got cross.</v>

3252
01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3253
01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:45.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3254
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.921
<v Speaker 1>one more down.</v>

3255
01:17:45.921 --> 01:17:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

3256
01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3257
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 1>did that 50 times in the Khumbu actually</v>

3258
01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:50.720
<v Speaker 2>go through that section a couple of times.</v>

3259
01:17:50.721 --> 01:17:52.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a very dangerous section of the mountain.</v>

3260
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:53.150
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

3261
01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:54.470
<v Speaker 2>When about 50 of those ladders.</v>

3262
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:56.240
<v Speaker 2>So when you went through Everest,</v>

3263
01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.380
<v Speaker 2>did you see the bodies?</v>

3264
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:58.311
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3265
01:17:58.311 --> 01:18:01.220
<v Speaker 2>so I fortunately didn't see any bodies up there,</v>

3266
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:01.760
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

3267
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:02.490
<v Speaker 2>are unfortunate.</v>

3268
01:18:02.490 --> 01:18:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately.</v>

3269
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:03.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3270
01:18:03.321 --> 01:18:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3271
01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like trying to see that bias,</v>

3272
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:05.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3273
01:18:05.730 --> 01:18:08.630
<v Speaker 2>but the are they're more prevalent on the climbing around on the north side.</v>

3274
01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:09.890
<v Speaker 2>The day that I did summit,</v>

3275
01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:10.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3276
01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:11.413
<v Speaker 2>three people tied,</v>

3277
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:11.771
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3278
01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:12.800
<v Speaker 2>on the day that I summited.</v>

3279
01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:14.090
<v Speaker 2>So when I,</v>

3280
01:18:14.091 --> 01:18:14.301
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3281
01:18:14.301 --> 01:18:15.830
<v Speaker 2>when I so does set the,</v>

3282
01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3283
01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:17.391
<v Speaker 2>talk about Everest,</v>

3284
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:19.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean for me is major setbacks.</v>

3285
01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 2>It was the eighth of nine expeditions in this sequence.</v>

3286
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:25.130
<v Speaker 2>So I'd done a hundred days of other expeditions leading up to Everest to do this</v>

3287
01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:26.660
<v Speaker 2>explorer's grand slam world record.</v>

3288
01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to climb Everest.</v>

3289
01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm exhausted from a hundred days.</v>

3290
01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I just come from the North Pole before that Kilimanjaro,</v>

3291
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.821
<v Speaker 2>before that,</v>

3292
01:18:31.821 --> 01:18:32.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3293
01:18:32.061 --> 01:18:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Elbert's all these other mountains.</v>

3294
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:35.990
<v Speaker 2>And then I make my summit push on Everest.</v>

3295
01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not climbing with a guide or anything,</v>

3296
01:18:37.521 --> 01:18:40.850
<v Speaker 2>it's just myself and one Sherpa who I met climbing in Nepal the year previous</v>

3297
01:18:40.851 --> 01:18:41.960
<v Speaker 2>when I was training for this.</v>

3298
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:45.950
<v Speaker 2>And so it's just the two of us and we climb up into camp for so ever says,</v>

3299
01:18:45.951 --> 01:18:48.740
<v Speaker 2>you know for camps there's base camp and then there's camps progressively higher</v>

3300
01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 2>in the mountains so you can get your body a climatize and we get up into camp</v>

3301
01:18:51.891 --> 01:18:52.251
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

3302
01:18:52.251 --> 01:18:54.260
<v Speaker 2>have you read the book into thin air by Jon Krakauer?</v>

3303
01:18:54.261 --> 01:18:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Anything about it?</v>

3304
01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

3305
01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:55.340
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3306
01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.340
<v Speaker 2>there's a famous book that's written about it where 11 people die and right in</v>

3307
01:18:58.341 --> 01:19:01.520
<v Speaker 2>this moment it's called the death zone where you enter above 26,000 feet.</v>

3308
01:19:01.521 --> 01:19:03.410
<v Speaker 2>The human body basically can't survive for long.</v>

3309
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Even with supplemental oxygen and this massive snow storm and wind storm blows</v>

3310
01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:10.430
<v Speaker 2>in like kind of out of nowhere and we're trying to push for the summit.</v>

3311
01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:14.090
<v Speaker 2>It takes us two and a half hours just to set up our tent and get inside.</v>

3312
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:15.560
<v Speaker 2>And we know like it's over.</v>

3313
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Like we're not,</v>

3314
01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.500
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to summit Everest like in this storm,</v>

3315
01:19:18.501 --> 01:19:19.071
<v Speaker 2>there's no way.</v>

3316
01:19:19.071 --> 01:19:20.390
<v Speaker 2>So we just survive the night,</v>

3317
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:21.670
<v Speaker 2>wake up the next morning,</v>

3318
01:19:21.710 --> 01:19:24.440
<v Speaker 2>still getting pounded by this weather and actually have to climb back down the</v>

3319
01:19:24.441 --> 01:19:25.160
<v Speaker 2>mountain.</v>

3320
01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.480
<v Speaker 2>So climb back down the mountain all the way to camp two and they're like,</v>

3321
01:19:27.481 --> 01:19:27.890
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

3322
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:28.790
<v Speaker 2>well that's probably it.</v>

3323
01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't usually like spend a night out in the death zone and like make a</v>

3324
01:19:31.581 --> 01:19:33.740
<v Speaker 2>second attempt and you've already tried all these other mountains.</v>

3325
01:19:33.741 --> 01:19:35.210
<v Speaker 2>You're a hundred plus days in this journey.</v>

3326
01:19:35.211 --> 01:19:36.044
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3327
01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:36.411
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3328
01:19:36.411 --> 01:19:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I want to see if I can get back up there.</v>

3329
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3330
01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:42.340
<v Speaker 2>and this other guy who I met on another team had some supplemental auctions.</v>

3331
01:19:42.341 --> 01:19:43.880
<v Speaker 2>So I had to use some of my supplement auction.</v>

3332
01:19:43.881 --> 01:19:46.310
<v Speaker 2>So my supplies tours are limited now as well.</v>

3333
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:48.170
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>

3334
01:19:48.171 --> 01:19:48.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3335
01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.281
<v Speaker 2>he says to me,</v>

3336
01:19:49.281 --> 01:19:49.461
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3337
01:19:49.461 --> 01:19:50.271
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go up.</v>

3338
01:19:50.271 --> 01:19:50.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick,</v>

3339
01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:52.370
<v Speaker 2>but if you get back up to camp four,</v>

3340
01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:56.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple bottles of oxygen that you could use of mine if you,</v>

3341
01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.440
<v Speaker 2>if you somehow get back up there.</v>

3342
01:19:57.441 --> 01:19:58.274
<v Speaker 2>So sure enough,</v>

3343
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:01.310
<v Speaker 2>per sang [inaudible] name of the shirt palace climbing with amazing climber</v>

3344
01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:02.060
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

3345
01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:04.190
<v Speaker 2>We get back up to camp four and the death zone.</v>

3346
01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.540
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3347
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:07.060
<v Speaker 2>we decided we're going to go for the summit.</v>

3348
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:08.280
<v Speaker 2>We call back down to base camp.</v>

3349
01:20:08.281 --> 01:20:09.360
<v Speaker 2>What's the weather forecast?</v>

3350
01:20:09.361 --> 01:20:09.751
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

3351
01:20:09.751 --> 01:20:10.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3352
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:12.420
<v Speaker 2>it's the exact same forecast we told you before.</v>

3353
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.291
<v Speaker 2>It might hold,</v>

3354
01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:16.680
<v Speaker 2>in which case you'll be fine or it might turn into what you guys just survive.</v>

3355
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.830
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not near your tent and you're up on the summit ridge of Everest,</v>

3356
01:20:19.831 --> 01:20:21.780
<v Speaker 2>like it's going to get like pretty bad.</v>

3357
01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 2>And so we kind of go back and forth.</v>

3358
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:24.391
<v Speaker 2>Should we go for it?</v>

3359
01:20:24.391 --> 01:20:25.141
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't we go for it?</v>

3360
01:20:25.141 --> 01:20:26.400
<v Speaker 2>We just decided to go for it.</v>

3361
01:20:26.401 --> 01:20:27.810
<v Speaker 2>But this crazy thing happens,</v>

3362
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:30.360
<v Speaker 2>which is you may have read about this or heard of this if you know much about</v>

3363
01:20:30.361 --> 01:20:30.721
<v Speaker 2>ever is,</v>

3364
01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:34.680
<v Speaker 2>but basically no one climbed Everest in 2014 or 15 cars,</v>

3365
01:20:34.681 --> 01:20:38.310
<v Speaker 2>a huge avalanche killed 16 shorter's in 2014 that the mountain was closed in</v>

3366
01:20:38.311 --> 01:20:41.550
<v Speaker 2>2015 there was a huge earthquake in Nepal that shut the climbing season down.</v>

3367
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:43.380
<v Speaker 2>So no one's even climbed the mountain in two years.</v>

3368
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:45.360
<v Speaker 2>But all of a sudden because of these weather delays,</v>

3369
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I ended up there and there's a hundred people going for the summit on the exact</v>

3370
01:20:48.421 --> 01:20:49.254
<v Speaker 2>same day.</v>

3371
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:54.440
<v Speaker 2>So basically traffic jam on the worst fucking place to be in a traffic jam</v>

3372
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.673
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

3373
01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:56.910
<v Speaker 2>So put sang Bodie and I,</v>

3374
01:20:56.911 --> 01:20:57.211
<v Speaker 2>we go,</v>

3375
01:20:57.211 --> 01:20:57.511
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3376
01:20:57.511 --> 01:20:58.950
<v Speaker 2>let's figure out how to climb this thing.</v>

3377
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.233
<v Speaker 2>And we leave camp.</v>

3378
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.571
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3379
01:21:00.571 --> 01:21:03.360
<v Speaker 2>there's a photo that I took for leaving camp and there's all these lights going</v>

3380
01:21:03.361 --> 01:21:06.240
<v Speaker 2>up the side of the mountain and it's because there's one rope that everyone</v>

3381
01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 2>works to put in.</v>

3382
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's using the same rope and all of a sudden we're behind a hundred</v>

3383
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:11.370
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3384
01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:12.360
<v Speaker 2>And if you stand there,</v>

3385
01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:12.991
<v Speaker 2>wind chill.</v>

3386
01:21:12.991 --> 01:21:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Minus 40 degrees,</v>

3387
01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:15.270
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to get frostbite,</v>

3388
01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:16.890
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to not be able to make it.</v>

3389
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 2>And so per sang Bodie and I look at each term ago,</v>

3390
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:20.760
<v Speaker 2>let's unclipped from the rope.</v>

3391
01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.150
<v Speaker 2>And so we actually decided to,</v>

3392
01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:27.750
<v Speaker 2>we actually decided to unclip from the rope climb up all the way to the balcony</v>

3393
01:21:27.751 --> 01:21:28.091
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>

3394
01:21:28.091 --> 01:21:28.980
<v Speaker 2>the south call.</v>

3395
01:21:28.981 --> 01:21:30.780
<v Speaker 2>The death zone area was mentioning before,</v>

3396
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3397
01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:36.060
<v Speaker 2>up to about 28,000 feet on rope because we actually think it's more dangerous to</v>

3398
01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:40.880
<v Speaker 2>climb roped next to all the behind all the people than it is to risk of fall.</v>

3399
01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:42.060
<v Speaker 2>You don't know those people.</v>

3400
01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:43.410
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3401
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:43.941
<v Speaker 2>and people work.</v>

3402
01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3403
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.950
<v Speaker 2>you're on Everest at 28,000 feet.</v>

3404
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.860
<v Speaker 2>People are walking,</v>

3405
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:47.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3406
01:21:47.071 --> 01:21:49.140
<v Speaker 2>one step per minute sometimes.</v>

3407
01:21:49.141 --> 01:21:49.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3408
01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:49.561
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3409
01:21:49.561 --> 01:21:50.790
<v Speaker 2>it is brutal.</v>

3410
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:51.211
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3411
01:21:51.211 --> 01:21:51.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3412
01:21:51.391 --> 01:21:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking maybe two steps every 30 seconds,</v>

3413
01:21:54.271 --> 01:21:57.270
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like you saying bolt like pasties people.</v>

3414
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3415
01:21:57.571 --> 01:21:57.901
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

3416
01:21:57.901 --> 01:21:59.280
<v Speaker 2>this gives an example of like,</v>

3417
01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:00.600
<v Speaker 2>so you're it like the world,</v>

3418
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.160
<v Speaker 2>the worst place in the world to be,</v>

3419
01:22:02.161 --> 01:22:02.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3420
01:22:02.431 --> 01:22:02.671
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3421
01:22:02.671 --> 01:22:02.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3422
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:03.780
<v Speaker 2>in a traffic jam.</v>

3423
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:05.040
<v Speaker 2>As you can see here for this photo,</v>

3424
01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I posted,</v>

3425
01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:06.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3426
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.943
<v Speaker 2>that day.</v>

3427
01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.033
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3428
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:08.791
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>

3429
01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:11.130
<v Speaker 2>I get up to this edge and it finally,</v>

3430
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:11.791
<v Speaker 2>it's too steep.</v>

3431
01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:14.470
<v Speaker 2>It's too dangerous for us to be unclipped from the rope any longer.</v>

3432
01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:14.761
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>

3433

3436
01:22:18.241 --> 01:22:19.620
<v Speaker 2>so we're in much better place than ever.</v>

3443
01:22:29.641 --> 01:22:33.480
<v Speaker 2>I undo my gloves real quick to put this big jacket on over me to warm myself up.</v>

3444
01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:36.480

3461
01:22:56.851 --> 01:22:59.430

<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>

3464
01:23:00.591 --> 01:23:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't recommend this thought process,</v>

3465
01:23:01.891 --> 01:23:02.251
<v Speaker 2>but I go,</v>

3466
01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:04.920
<v Speaker 2>well if I'm going to lose my hand anyways,</v>

3467
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.700
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be cooler to lose my hand?</v>

3468
01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:08.290
<v Speaker 2>But also have summited Everest.</v>

3469
01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:12.700
<v Speaker 2>So how black was it?</v>

3470
01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a lack like black,</v>

3471
01:23:14.591 --> 01:23:15.424
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>

3472
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 2>like black.</v>

3473
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:18.183
<v Speaker 2>He was black.</v>

3474
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Did you take a picture of it?</v>

3475
01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:19.720
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3476
01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.430
<v Speaker 2>so the sun had was just still,</v>

3477
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.750
<v Speaker 2>the sun was just below the horizon.</v>

3478
01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:23.531
<v Speaker 2>So it was like dusk.</v>

3479
01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:25.420
<v Speaker 2>And I look down at this point and on the sun comes up.</v>

3480
01:23:25.421 --> 01:23:28.080
<v Speaker 2>So I jammed my hand back in this club and I don't say anything to per sang</v>

3481
01:23:28.081 --> 01:23:28.361
<v Speaker 2>bought him,</v>

3482
01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:29.710
<v Speaker 2>like let's keep pushing for the summit.</v>

3483
01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So we go for the next three hours and the whole time I'm on I'm like,</v>

3484
01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:32.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3485
01:23:32.561 --> 01:23:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm such an idiot.</v>

3486
01:23:33.551 --> 01:23:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to lose my hand,</v>

3487
01:23:35.021 --> 01:23:36.520
<v Speaker 2>my hand's prospect and this and that.</v>

3488
01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:39.670
<v Speaker 2>And so we'd get up and we're about 30 minutes blow Mount Everest summit and</v>

3489
01:23:39.671 --> 01:23:40.870
<v Speaker 2>should be a beautiful moment for me.</v>

3490
01:23:40.871 --> 01:23:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Like since a little kid I dream like summiting Everest would be like the</v>

3491
01:23:43.781 --> 01:23:45.700
<v Speaker 2>greatest accomplishment of my life on my God.</v>

3492
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.500
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking like just in this dark place,</v>

3493
01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.660
<v Speaker 2>but also haven't taken a single photo basically.</v>

3494
01:23:49.661 --> 01:23:49.991
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3495
01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:50.141
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

3496
01:23:50.141 --> 01:23:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Got To get like a photo or a video of,</v>

3497
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:53.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3498
01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:54.730
<v Speaker 2>the famous Mount Everest summit.</v>

3499
01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.370
<v Speaker 2>So I pull up my GoPro to shoot a video.</v>

3500
01:23:57.850 --> 01:23:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I shoot this short little video,</v>

3501
01:23:59.081 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 2>which kind of shows this crazy exposure that I'm on one side,</v>

3502
01:24:02.411 --> 01:24:04.450
<v Speaker 2>5,000 feet down into China on one side,</v>

3503
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:06.970
<v Speaker 2>5,000 feet in Nepal and this tiny little knife edge ridge.</v>

3504
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:09.130
<v Speaker 2>And of course I have to adjust my gloves again.</v>

3505
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:13.300
<v Speaker 2>This is from the summit and I pull my,</v>

3506
01:24:13.301 --> 01:24:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I pull my GoPro out,</v>

3507
01:24:14.411 --> 01:24:15.760
<v Speaker 2>have to mess with my gloves,</v>

3508
01:24:16.150 --> 01:24:17.080
<v Speaker 2>put it back in,</v>

3509
01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:19.080
<v Speaker 2>and I look at my hand,</v>

3510
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:20.500
<v Speaker 2>I start going away from my arms in the air,</v>

3511
01:24:20.501 --> 01:24:21.340
<v Speaker 2>go per se,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3529
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:55.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the summit of Mount Everest.</v>

3530
01:24:58.790 --> 01:25:00.230
<v Speaker 2>No words can describe.</v>

3531
01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.013
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3535
01:25:09.411 --> 01:25:10.244
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a lot of this,</v>

3536
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:12.080
<v Speaker 2>this podcast bit about mindset,</v>

3537
01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.520
<v Speaker 2>which is one of my favorite topics.</v>

3538
01:25:13.521 --> 01:25:13.910
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

3539
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:14.750
<v Speaker 2>just like we said,</v>

3540
01:25:14.751 --> 01:25:17.870
<v Speaker 2>you could convince yourself that the salt man is fixing your foot.</v>

3541
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:18.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3542
01:25:18.181 --> 01:25:19.014
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3543
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.903
<v Speaker 2>I'm on Everest,</v>

3544
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:21.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm at 28,000 feet.</v>

3545
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:23.660
<v Speaker 2>My brain's not working very well.</v>

3546
01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.880
<v Speaker 2>I know that the weather's coming in bad,</v>

3547
01:25:25.881 --> 01:25:28.670
<v Speaker 2>that people are going to get maybe frostbite based on the forecast.</v>

3548
01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.440
<v Speaker 2>And I looked down and I see my hands black.</v>

3549
01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:31.491
<v Speaker 2>Where does my mind go?</v>

3550
01:25:31.491 --> 01:25:31.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3551
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:32.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>

3552
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh let me think about this.</v>

3553
01:25:33.651 --> 01:25:37.070
<v Speaker 2>My hand warmer must've broken open and this I'm like my hand and now it was</v>

3554
01:25:37.071 --> 01:25:37.880
<v Speaker 2>weird cause I was like,</v>

3555
01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel my hand getting cold.</v>

3556
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:41.600
<v Speaker 2>My hand like it was fine,</v>

3557
01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:43.220
<v Speaker 2>but I'm on Everest in my hands.</v>

3558
01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:43.491
<v Speaker 2>Black.</v>

3559
01:25:43.491 --> 01:25:44.210
<v Speaker 2>That means,</v>

3560
01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3561
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:45.463
<v Speaker 2>in my brain I'm like,</v>

3562
01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:46.221
<v Speaker 2>I have frostbite.</v>

3563
01:25:46.221 --> 01:25:46.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like,</v>

3564
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:48.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing where you can take your mind.</v>

3565
01:25:48.651 --> 01:25:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of this stuff,</v>

3566
01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:50.720
<v Speaker 2>the positivity of this.</v>

3567
01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:52.250
<v Speaker 2>My mom went to the negative immediately.</v>

3568
01:25:52.251 --> 01:25:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Like your hand's gone.</v>

3569
01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:55.060
<v Speaker 2>It's frozen off like the end.</v>

3570
01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3571
01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:58.140
<v Speaker 2>so what happened to the people that died?</v>

3572
01:25:58.141 --> 01:25:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Were they on the rope?</v>

3573
01:25:59.480 --> 01:25:59.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3574
01:25:59.841 --> 01:26:03.680
<v Speaker 2>so unfortunately that day the weather actually did get pretty bad in the day.</v>

3575
01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:06.410
<v Speaker 2>So fortunate I was able to get down before the weather got too bad.</v>

3576
01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3577
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.551
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3578
01:26:07.551 --> 01:26:07.851
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3579
01:26:07.851 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 2>the people that died that day,</v>

3580
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3581
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:12.140
<v Speaker 2>one slipped and fell down these ropes over on Lhotse,</v>

3582
01:26:12.141 --> 01:26:13.280
<v Speaker 2>which is the adjacent mountain,</v>

3583
01:26:13.281 --> 01:26:15.800
<v Speaker 2>but sharing some of the same ropes on the same route.</v>

3584
01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3585
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:18.350
<v Speaker 2>and then two people died from altitude sickness.</v>

3586
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:21.830
<v Speaker 2>So basically either running out of oxygen up there and not be able to get back</v>

3587
01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:22.491
<v Speaker 2>down to their tent.</v>

3588
01:26:22.491 --> 01:26:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I think those people actually did get carried back down to their tents that</v>

3589
01:26:25.071 --> 01:26:26.690
<v Speaker 2>night and then died in the tents that night.</v>

3590
01:26:26.691 --> 01:26:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Some it's called cerebral edema,</v>

3591
01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:29.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3592
01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.330
<v Speaker 2>which is basically your brain fills with fluid from being at the high altitude</v>

3593
01:26:32.331 --> 01:26:33.590
<v Speaker 2>and not getting enough oxygen.</v>

3594
01:26:33.591 --> 01:26:34.580
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>

3595
01:26:34.581 --> 01:26:35.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a killer up there.</v>

3596
01:26:35.511 --> 01:26:35.841
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3597
01:26:35.841 --> 01:26:37.760
<v Speaker 2>one of the crazy things about being up there is,</v>

3598
01:26:37.761 --> 01:26:38.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3599
01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.110
<v Speaker 2>you read about it,</v>

3600
01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:41.750
<v Speaker 2>but you really can't rescue somebody very easily up there.</v>

3601
01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:41.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3602
01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:45.420
<v Speaker 2>took to carry a human body down into the rescue them is,</v>

3603
01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.940
<v Speaker 2>is nearly impossible.</v>

3604
01:26:46.941 --> 01:26:48.560
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of always thought in my mind,</v>

3605
01:26:48.561 --> 01:26:49.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3606
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:51.110
<v Speaker 2>if I saw somebody lying on the ground,</v>

3607
01:26:51.111 --> 01:26:51.561
<v Speaker 2>like I would,</v>

3608
01:26:51.561 --> 01:26:51.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3609
01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:53.660
<v Speaker 2>some in the energy to pick them up.</v>

3610
01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:57.260
<v Speaker 2>And I was actually coming back from the summit and I was on the South Summit,</v>

3611
01:26:57.261 --> 01:26:59.630
<v Speaker 2>so just below the [inaudible] art 28,000,</v>

3612
01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:01.250
<v Speaker 2>800 feet or something like that.</v>

3613
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.370
<v Speaker 2>And this a Brazilian woman who I'd met in base camp,</v>

3614
01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:04.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3615
01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:08.060
<v Speaker 2>named Tyce who I've become friends with your in Nepal for a couple months,</v>

3616
01:27:08.061 --> 01:27:09.140
<v Speaker 2>you start talking to people,</v>

3617
01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:10.220
<v Speaker 2>getting friends with other climbers,</v>

3618
01:27:10.221 --> 01:27:10.880
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3619
01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.950
<v Speaker 2>And I see her lying on the ground with her head,</v>

3620
01:27:12.951 --> 01:27:15.650
<v Speaker 2>like leaned back in her oxygen mask off to the side and I'm like,</v>

3621
01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.311
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

3622
01:27:16.311 --> 01:27:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the moment that I'm most feared.</v>

3623
01:27:18.171 --> 01:27:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Like somebody who I know is lying here on the side of the mountain and I think</v>

3624
01:27:21.561 --> 01:27:22.250
<v Speaker 2>to myself,</v>

3625
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I've got to pick her up.</v>

3626
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:27.260
<v Speaker 2>I've got to pick her up and somehow like carry her down this mountain and I lean</v>

3627
01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:31.730
<v Speaker 2>over to grab her and I try with all my might to do anything and I realized I</v>

3628
01:27:31.731 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 2>can't move her six inches.</v>

3629
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm completely exhausted.</v>

3630
01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Muscles aren't working.</v>

3631
01:27:36.321 --> 01:27:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Brain's not working.</v>

3632
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:38.001
<v Speaker 2>So I do.</v>

3633
01:27:38.001 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I can think to do is I just wrapped her in my arms and I say Tice</v>

3634
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:42.950
<v Speaker 2>like if you can hear me,</v>

3635
01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 2>it's Collin,</v>

3636
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you need to get up,</v>

3637
01:27:44.631 --> 01:27:46.280
<v Speaker 2>you need to get your oxygen mask on,</v>

3638
01:27:46.281 --> 01:27:48.230
<v Speaker 2>you need to start moving like please get up,</v>

3639
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:48.890
<v Speaker 2>please get up.</v>

3640
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 2>No response.</v>

3641
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.260
<v Speaker 2>She was climbing with a Sherpa,</v>

3642
01:27:51.261 --> 01:27:53.450
<v Speaker 2>another guide right next to her and they were like,</v>

3643
01:27:53.451 --> 01:27:55.310
<v Speaker 2>look like we're having trouble with her oxygen mask,</v>

3644
01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:56.550
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to fix it like it's coming.</v>

3645
01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:56.841
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3646
01:27:56.841 --> 01:27:59.220
<v Speaker 2>And I was like just kind of going through this intense moment,</v>

3647
01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:00.110
<v Speaker 2>like what do I do?</v>

3648
01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:00.741
<v Speaker 2>How can I help?</v>

3649
01:28:00.741 --> 01:28:01.730
<v Speaker 2>And it's as weird as,</v>

3650
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:02.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3651
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not proud of it necessary to say it,</v>

3652
01:28:04.461 --> 01:28:06.200
<v Speaker 2>but like there was nothing I could do.</v>

3653
01:28:06.230 --> 01:28:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just the most helpless feeling in the world.</v>

3654
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Where you want to help the common person,</v>

3655
01:28:10.881 --> 01:28:10.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3656
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:11.340
<v Speaker 2>a friend,</v>

3657
01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean this person had to be a friend,</v>

3658
01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:14.900
<v Speaker 2>but if any human being is lying on the ground in the snow,</v>

3659
01:28:14.901 --> 01:28:15.320
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3660
01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I want to help this person get down this mountain.</v>

3661
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:18.021
<v Speaker 2>And I was just,</v>

3662
01:28:18.021 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm so close to,</v>

3663
01:28:18.921 --> 01:28:19.820
<v Speaker 2>on my limit up there,</v>

3664
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:20.241
<v Speaker 2>the summit,</v>

3665
01:28:20.241 --> 01:28:21.110
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing I could do.</v>

3666
01:28:21.111 --> 01:28:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately.</v>

3667
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3668
01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:24.770
<v Speaker 2>she was not one of the people that passed away that day.</v>

3669
01:28:24.771 --> 01:28:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Her,</v>

3670
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.280
<v Speaker 2>her team did get her oxygen mask on her and she actually made it to the summit</v>

3671
01:28:28.281 --> 01:28:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and back down safely.</v>

3672
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:30.831
<v Speaker 2>She went up,</v>

3673
01:28:30.831 --> 01:28:32.060
<v Speaker 2>she ended up going up from there,</v>

3674
01:28:32.061 --> 01:28:33.510
<v Speaker 2>which to me is like another quote,</v>

3675
01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.760
<v Speaker 2>crazy part of that story.</v>

3676
01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:38.150
<v Speaker 2>But it was an interesting lesson for me in like,</v>

3677
01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:38.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3678
01:28:38.601 --> 01:28:39.440
<v Speaker 2>you hear these stories,</v>

3679
01:28:39.441 --> 01:28:40.610
<v Speaker 2>you can't move bodies up there,</v>

3680
01:28:40.611 --> 01:28:41.810
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing you can do the rescue.</v>

3681
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:45.980
<v Speaker 2>And people have been criticized for not doing these crazy rescues when things</v>

3682
01:28:45.981 --> 01:28:46.970
<v Speaker 2>have gone wrong up there.</v>

3683
01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:48.830
<v Speaker 2>But it really hit home for me like how,</v>

3684
01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:52.760
<v Speaker 2>how hard it would be to move somebody down that mountain from that altitude.</v>

3685
01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:53.720
<v Speaker 2>And so when you're up there,</v>

3686
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:54.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3687
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:54.731
<v Speaker 2>unlike,</v>

3688
01:28:54.731 --> 01:28:55.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3689
01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:55.521
<v Speaker 2>Antarctica,</v>

3690
01:28:55.521 --> 01:28:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I was actually alone in Everest.</v>

3691
01:28:57.021 --> 01:28:57.441
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3692
01:28:57.441 --> 01:28:58.610
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty crowded day.</v>

3693
01:28:58.611 --> 01:29:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Like you're essentially alone up there.</v>

3694
01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Like if you can't putting one foot in front of the other up in the death zone,</v>

3695
01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:04.260
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>

3696
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.060
<v Speaker 2>not a whole lot that you can do.</v>

3697
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3698
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:08.100
<v Speaker 2>so the three people that died up,</v>

3699
01:29:08.101 --> 01:29:09.210
<v Speaker 2>did they leave them there?</v>

3700
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure with those specific people because sometimes they will,</v>

3701
01:29:13.710 --> 01:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>you can get it like a large team of people to slowly lower people down.</v>

3702
01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:17.491
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3703
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:21.090
<v Speaker 2>in a weird way it's actually easier to lower a dead body than it is to lower a</v>

3704
01:29:21.091 --> 01:29:22.530
<v Speaker 2>live person because a dead potty,</v>

3705
01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:25.770
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to worry about breaking bones and things like that if you're</v>

3706
01:29:25.771 --> 01:29:27.630
<v Speaker 2>lowing someone over rocks and things like that.</v>

3707
01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:30.720
<v Speaker 2>So I actually believe those parties are no longer there,</v>

3708
01:29:30.721 --> 01:29:31.980
<v Speaker 2>but there are quite a few bodies,</v>

3709
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:32.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3710
01:29:32.161 --> 01:29:34.110
<v Speaker 2>still on the mountain in particularly the north side,</v>

3711
01:29:34.111 --> 01:29:34.651
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese,</v>

3712
01:29:34.651 --> 01:29:35.940
<v Speaker 2>so you can climb it from two sides.</v>

3713
01:29:35.941 --> 01:29:36.774
<v Speaker 2>The Nepal side,</v>

3714
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.330
<v Speaker 2>which is more commonly climb where I climbed or the Tibet side,</v>

3715
01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:43.140
<v Speaker 2>the Tibet side is known for having a lot more of the body is still actually on</v>

3716
01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:44.970
<v Speaker 2>the climbing route for sure.</v>

3717
01:29:45.090 --> 01:29:45.923
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3718
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:47.250
<v Speaker 2>but for me on that,</v>

3719
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean that day in a crazy way continues on because I got back down to camp four</v>

3720
01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:55.140
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking I'm going to sleep for the night rest and come back down.</v>

3721
01:29:55.141 --> 01:29:57.420
<v Speaker 2>The mountain usually takes a few days to get back down the mountain.</v>

3722
01:29:57.421 --> 01:29:58.254
<v Speaker 2>At this point,</v>

3723
01:29:58.500 --> 01:29:58.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3724
01:29:58.681 --> 01:30:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I've only got one more mountain to climb to come finish my world record the</v>

3725
01:30:01.561 --> 01:30:05.190
<v Speaker 2>explorer's Grand Slam and I was about two months ahead of schedule.</v>

3726
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:07.140
<v Speaker 2>So if I had climbed Denali in the next two months,</v>

3727
01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.090
<v Speaker 2>North America's tallest mountain up in Alaska,</v>

3728
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I was going to set this world,</v>

3729
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:11.760
<v Speaker 2>this world record that I was.</v>

3730
01:30:11.761 --> 01:30:13.800
<v Speaker 2>And so I called back home to Jenna and I was like,</v>

3731
01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I made it like I made it.</v>

3732
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:16.920
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3733
01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.960
<v Speaker 2>earlier in the day when my hands had gotten frozen,</v>

3734
01:30:18.961 --> 01:30:21.180
<v Speaker 2>I had actually had a heated boot warmers.</v>

3735
01:30:21.181 --> 01:30:22.620
<v Speaker 2>And so I turned the heat in,</v>

3736
01:30:22.621 --> 01:30:24.120
<v Speaker 2>my boot warmers up as hot as possible.</v>

3737
01:30:24.121 --> 01:30:24.391
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

3738
01:30:24.391 --> 01:30:25.520
<v Speaker 2>if my hand is prospecting,</v>

3739
01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:26.520
<v Speaker 2>what could my feet look like?</v>

3740
01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:28.500
<v Speaker 2>So I took crank those up as hot as possible.</v>

3741
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:29.731
<v Speaker 2>And so Jen is like,</v>

3742
01:30:29.731 --> 01:30:30.121
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3743
01:30:30.121 --> 01:30:31.020
<v Speaker 2>like how are you doing?</v>

3744
01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:31.741
<v Speaker 2>Like you all right.</v>

3745
01:30:31.741 --> 01:30:33.840
<v Speaker 2>We've heard some reports over social media.</v>

3746
01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:35.280
<v Speaker 2>That's been a really hard day up there.</v>

3747
01:30:35.290 --> 01:30:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3748
01:30:35.710 --> 01:30:35.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3749
01:30:35.971 --> 01:30:36.181
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3750
01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:36.721
<v Speaker 2>I'm all right.</v>

3751
01:30:36.721 --> 01:30:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Like no frostbite,</v>

3752
01:30:37.651 --> 01:30:38.341
<v Speaker 2>no injuries.</v>

3753
01:30:38.341 --> 01:30:39.174
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm good.</v>

3754
01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:39.871
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like,</v>

3755
01:30:39.871 --> 01:30:40.620
<v Speaker 2>well actually,</v>

3756
01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:41.453
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3757
01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:41.701
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3758
01:30:41.701 --> 01:30:42.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3759
01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:43.500
<v Speaker 2>I burned my feet and she's like,</v>

3760
01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:43.651
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3761
01:30:43.651 --> 01:30:44.311
<v Speaker 2>frostbite.</v>

3762
01:30:44.311 --> 01:30:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Like how bad is it?</v>

3763
01:30:45.241 --> 01:30:45.720
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3764
01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:46.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3765
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:47.280
<v Speaker 2>not frostbite.</v>

3766
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:48.750
<v Speaker 2>I actually burned too,</v>

3767
01:30:48.751 --> 01:30:51.630
<v Speaker 2>like silver dollar circles in the bottom two,</v>

3768
01:30:51.631 --> 01:30:54.210
<v Speaker 2>both of my feet from turning my boot warmers up too much.</v>

3769
01:30:54.211 --> 01:30:54.930
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

3770
01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:55.260
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

3771
01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.190
<v Speaker 2>let me get this straight.</v>

3772
01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3773
01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:57.630
<v Speaker 2>you climb Everest,</v>

3774
01:30:57.631 --> 01:30:58.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't get frostbite,</v>

3775
01:30:58.621 --> 01:30:59.610
<v Speaker 2>but you burn yourself.</v>

3776
01:30:59.611 --> 01:30:59.971
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

3777
01:30:59.971 --> 01:31:00.301
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3778
01:31:00.301 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 2>your feet fire,</v>

3779
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:03.990
<v Speaker 2>like just a bad situation.</v>

3780
01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3781
01:31:05.010 --> 01:31:06.930
<v Speaker 2>but then she goes on and she was like,</v>

3782
01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:08.191
<v Speaker 2>she literally said,</v>

3783
01:31:08.191 --> 01:31:08.851
<v Speaker 2>the next thing you said to me,</v>

3784
01:31:08.851 --> 01:31:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I will literally never forget in my life,</v>

3785
01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:11.364
<v Speaker 2>but she goes,</v>

3786
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.121
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3787
01:31:12.121 --> 01:31:12.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3788
01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:13.261
<v Speaker 2>you're in your tent,</v>

3789
01:31:13.261 --> 01:31:13.441
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3790
01:31:13.441 --> 01:31:14.610
<v Speaker 2>You took your boots off and everything.</v>

3791
01:31:14.611 --> 01:31:15.331
<v Speaker 2>You're curled up in there.</v>

3792
01:31:15.331 --> 01:31:15.571
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3793
01:31:15.571 --> 01:31:15.751
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3794
01:31:15.751 --> 01:31:16.201
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

3795
01:31:16.201 --> 01:31:17.034
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3796
01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:17.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3797
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I actually need you to put your boots back on.</v>

3798
01:31:19.890 --> 01:31:20.580
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3799
01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:21.450
<v Speaker 2>excuse me?</v>

3800
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:22.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I just like,</v>

3801
01:31:23.130 --> 01:31:23.551
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

3802
01:31:23.551 --> 01:31:23.851
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3803
01:31:23.851 --> 01:31:27.150
<v Speaker 2>So we've been doing some calculating back home and it just so happens that if</v>

3804
01:31:27.151 --> 01:31:29.580
<v Speaker 2>you can get to the summit of Denali in the next,</v>

3805
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:30.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3806
01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:30.780
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

3807
01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:31.291
<v Speaker 2>you can set,</v>

3808
01:31:31.291 --> 01:31:33.150
<v Speaker 2>not one but two world records.</v>

3809
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:33.960
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3810
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3811
01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.610
<v Speaker 2>that sounds nice,</v>

3812
01:31:35.611 --> 01:31:38.580
<v Speaker 2>but like I'm on the summit of below the summit of Everest,</v>

3813
01:31:38.581 --> 01:31:39.600
<v Speaker 2>how the hell is that going to work?</v>

3814
01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:40.170
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

3815
01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:40.740
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3816
01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.210
<v Speaker 2>put your boots back on down now,</v>

3817
01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.770
<v Speaker 2>climb all the way back to base camp.</v>

3818
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.000
<v Speaker 2>There's no time for you to sleep.</v>

3819
01:31:45.001 --> 01:31:47.430
<v Speaker 2>But then in a helicopter is going to take you to Katmandu.</v>

3820
01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:48.510
<v Speaker 2>No time for a hotel,</v>

3821
01:31:48.511 --> 01:31:49.380
<v Speaker 2>no time for a shower,</v>

3822
01:31:49.381 --> 01:31:50.940
<v Speaker 2>but an evening flights going to take you to Dubai,</v>

3823
01:31:50.941 --> 01:31:51.990
<v Speaker 2>to Seattle to anchorage.</v>

3824
01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:53.940
<v Speaker 2>And instead of having three weeks to climb Denali,</v>

3825
01:31:54.090 --> 01:31:54.930
<v Speaker 2>you'll have three days.</v>

3826
01:31:54.931 --> 01:31:56.040
<v Speaker 2>But if you can do all of that,</v>

3827
01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.830
<v Speaker 2>you'll set another world record like ready go.</v>

3828
01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:04.240
<v Speaker 2>So I was in disbelief,</v>

3829
01:32:04.241 --> 01:32:04.590
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3830
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3831
01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.260
<v Speaker 2>knowing better than to disobey not only my amazing wife,</v>

3832
01:32:08.261 --> 01:32:11.770
<v Speaker 2>but the planner and logistics expert in running the backer and all of this,</v>

3833
01:32:11.771 --> 01:32:13.540
<v Speaker 2>I assure enough put my boots back on,</v>

3834
01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:15.220
<v Speaker 2>wipe the slate clean and found myself,</v>

3835
01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:16.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3836
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:16.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3837
01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:18.460
<v Speaker 2>just a hundred hours after standing on the summit of Everest,</v>

3838
01:32:18.461 --> 01:32:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I found myself over in Alaska trying to push up to the summit to,</v>

3839
01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:22.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3840
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.070
<v Speaker 2>to try to set the two world records and not just the one.</v>

3841
01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

3842
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:31.360
<v Speaker 4>what kind of recover does your body need when you exert yourself like that?</v>

3843
01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:32.200
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3844
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:32.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3845
01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:33.790
<v Speaker 4>climbing Everest.</v>

3846
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:38.440
<v Speaker 4>I would think that your body's must be you to be in some kind of state of shock</v>

3847
01:32:38.441 --> 01:32:38.930
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

3848
01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:39.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean completely.</v>

3849
01:32:39.711 --> 01:32:40.011
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3850
01:32:40.011 --> 01:32:43.070
<v Speaker 2>there's some clips of me on Denali and those next few days where I'm just</v>

3851
01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.450
<v Speaker 2>absolutely trashed,</v>

3852
01:32:44.451 --> 01:32:45.284
<v Speaker 2>like I'm like,</v>

3853
01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.400
<v Speaker 2>like barely eyes up.</v>

3854
01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to push for the summit.</v>

3855
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:48.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to this.</v>

3856
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:50.690
<v Speaker 2>The one benefit I would say there is one,</v>

3857
01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:51.980
<v Speaker 2>most of it's not a benefit,</v>

3858
01:32:51.981 --> 01:32:52.290
<v Speaker 2>but I'll,</v>

3859
01:32:52.290 --> 01:32:53.540
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep it in the positive.</v>

3860
01:32:53.541 --> 01:32:57.110
<v Speaker 2>The one benefit is usually in the high altitude mountaineering you need to</v>

3861
01:32:57.170 --> 01:32:59.960
<v Speaker 2>climatize so your body creates more red blood cells when you go up into the</v>

3862
01:32:59.961 --> 01:33:02.960
<v Speaker 2>thinner air to allow you to breathe oxygen better at the higher altitudes.</v>

3863
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:06.350
<v Speaker 2>A mountain like Denali normally takes three weeks to climb because you're coming</v>

3864
01:33:06.351 --> 01:33:08.360
<v Speaker 2>from sea level and to get up to 20,000 feet,</v>

3865
01:33:08.361 --> 01:33:09.560
<v Speaker 2>you can't just get dropped off there.</v>

3866
01:33:09.561 --> 01:33:11.990
<v Speaker 2>If you or I right now got dropped off on the summit of Denali,</v>

3867
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:13.790
<v Speaker 2>we would pass out in a matter of minutes.</v>

3868
01:33:13.791 --> 01:33:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3869
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:17.570
<v Speaker 2>But because I'm coming from Everest at 29,000 feet,</v>

3870
01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:20.060
<v Speaker 2>it puts Denali into perspective,</v>

3871
01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:22.940
<v Speaker 2>not from a technical mountaineering standpoint cause it's still very dangerous</v>

3872
01:33:22.941 --> 01:33:25.850
<v Speaker 2>and very challenging mountain and a lot of ways a harder mountain to climb Mount</v>

3873
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:26.683
<v Speaker 2>Everest technically,</v>

3874
01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.550
<v Speaker 2>but 20,000 feet,</v>

3875
01:33:28.551 --> 01:33:32.390
<v Speaker 2>my body can handle the rapidest sent a little bit better if I can muster the</v>

3876
01:33:32.391 --> 01:33:33.224
<v Speaker 2>energy to do it.</v>

3877
01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:37.130
<v Speaker 2>The physiology of my body is actually in a better place to climb higher faster,</v>

3878
01:33:37.131 --> 01:33:37.960
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>

3879
01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:38.171
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3880
01:33:38.171 --> 01:33:38.921
<v Speaker 4>it does make sense.</v>

3881
01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:41.890
<v Speaker 4>But then so when you're,</v>

3882
01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 4>when you're done with this,</v>

3883
01:33:43.001 --> 01:33:43.300
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3884
01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 4>how long did it take you to just feel like a normal person again?</v>

3885
01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:46.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3886
01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:47.700
<v Speaker 2>so I was on Denali.</v>

3887
01:33:47.701 --> 01:33:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I ended up summiting in in three days and setting.</v>

3888
01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.370
<v Speaker 2>So the explorer's Grand Slam was the seven summits plus in north and South Pole.</v>

3889
01:33:53.371 --> 01:33:56.580
<v Speaker 2>But the second world record was just the seven summits by themselves.</v>

3890
01:33:56.581 --> 01:33:57.840
<v Speaker 2>So even though I went to the polls,</v>

3891
01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I still set the speed record for the seven summits as well.</v>

3892
01:34:00.391 --> 01:34:01.111
<v Speaker 2>So seven summits,</v>

3893
01:34:01.111 --> 01:34:05.700
<v Speaker 2>131 days and the explorer's Grand Slam 139 and then I returned,</v>

3894
01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:06.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3895
01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.590
<v Speaker 2>to Alaska and then home to Portland.</v>

3896
01:34:07.591 --> 01:34:11.100
<v Speaker 2>And honestly it was a good six months until I felt normal again.</v>

3897
01:34:11.150 --> 01:34:11.900
<v Speaker 2>It at least,</v>

3898
01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:12.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3899
01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:12.750
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

3900
01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely,</v>

3901
01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.371
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3902
01:34:14.371 --> 01:34:17.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm only about five weeks out from Antarctica at right now and I,</v>

3903
01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really taken a lot of rest and recovery have been on the road,</v>

3904
01:34:21.151 --> 01:34:23.460
<v Speaker 2>still doing various things and uh,</v>

3905
01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:23.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3906
01:34:23.761 --> 01:34:24.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm nowhere near recovery.</v>

3907
01:34:24.751 --> 01:34:26.190
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take a long time to get back.</v>

3908
01:34:26.191 --> 01:34:26.521
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>

3909
01:34:26.521 --> 01:34:27.870
<v Speaker 2>these exertions I love them.</v>

3910
01:34:27.871 --> 01:34:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I love pushing my body,</v>

3911
01:34:28.951 --> 01:34:29.970
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3912
01:34:29.971 --> 01:34:30.201
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3913
01:34:30.201 --> 01:34:32.940
<v Speaker 2>the cycle of high performance is also knowing how to recover,</v>

3914
01:34:32.941 --> 01:34:33.691
<v Speaker 2>recover well,</v>

3915
01:34:33.691 --> 01:34:35.820
<v Speaker 2>good nutritional that and it takes a long time.</v>

3916
01:34:35.821 --> 01:34:38.640
<v Speaker 2>That one took six months and I would imagine this Antarctica recovery is going</v>

3917
01:34:38.641 --> 01:34:39.720
<v Speaker 2>to take a long time as well.</v>

3918
01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:44.430
<v Speaker 4>Now when you say it took six months or are you monitoring your physiological</v>

3919
01:34:44.431 --> 01:34:45.031
<v Speaker 4>levels,</v>

3920
01:34:45.031 --> 01:34:48.300
<v Speaker 4>what are you monitoring and how do you find out like where you're at?</v>

3921
01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:48.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3922
01:34:48.831 --> 01:34:51.460
<v Speaker 2>So I started to do a lot of bloodwork.</v>

3923
01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Actually early on in my triathlon career.</v>

3924
01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:53.901
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3925
01:34:53.901 --> 01:34:54.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3926
01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:54.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3927
01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.530
<v Speaker 2>actually early on in my professional triathlon cry mentioned I moved to</v>

3928
01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Australia not long after,</v>

3929
01:34:58.761 --> 01:34:59.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3930
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:01.370
<v Speaker 2>turning pro and coming out of the gate with this win.</v>

3931
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.420
<v Speaker 2>And I had the opportunity to go train with some of the best triathletes in the</v>

3932
01:35:05.421 --> 01:35:05.991
<v Speaker 2>world was actually,</v>

3933
01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:06.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3934
01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.390
<v Speaker 2>a couple of world champion is a group of 15 of us,</v>

3935
01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:09.770
<v Speaker 2>a couple of world champions,</v>

3936
01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:10.880
<v Speaker 2>so female Ironman,</v>

3937
01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:11.714
<v Speaker 2>world champion,</v>

3938
01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.070
<v Speaker 2>a couple of Olympic medalist,</v>

3939
01:35:13.071 --> 01:35:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean some of the top people in the world.</v>

3940
01:35:14.181 --> 01:35:16.940
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just like up and coming professional triathlete.</v>

3941
01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.910
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's so cool that I'm like training with the best guys.</v>

3942
01:35:19.911 --> 01:35:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3943
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:20.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3944
01:35:20.651 --> 01:35:21.201
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

3945
01:35:21.201 --> 01:35:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3946
01:35:21.570 --> 01:35:24.280
<v Speaker 2>a guy that just gets into the UFC and all of a sudden he's training with the,</v>

3947
01:35:24.281 --> 01:35:24.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3948
01:35:24.471 --> 01:35:24.591
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3949
01:35:24.591 --> 01:35:25.550
<v Speaker 2>the top contenders,</v>

3950
01:35:25.551 --> 01:35:26.150
<v Speaker 2>the title guys.</v>

3951
01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:27.710
<v Speaker 2>And like I wanted to really roll hard with them.</v>

3952
01:35:27.711 --> 01:35:31.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I was training super hard to try to keep up with the guys,</v>

3953
01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:31.970
<v Speaker 2>the best guys.</v>

3954
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:36.470
<v Speaker 2>And I had an amazing month and then I completely fell apart because their level</v>

3955
01:35:36.471 --> 01:35:37.130
<v Speaker 2>of training,</v>

3956
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:40.400
<v Speaker 2>we're true worldclass level and I'm starting out was just too much for me.</v>

3957
01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.170
<v Speaker 2>And so when crashed my entire system,</v>

3958
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:46.520
<v Speaker 2>my testosterone drops to that level of a 90 year old man.</v>

3959
01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:46.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3960
01:35:46.731 --> 01:35:47.091
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3961
01:35:47.091 --> 01:35:50.000
<v Speaker 2>had no testosterone in my body and you know,</v>

3962
01:35:50.001 --> 01:35:51.830
<v Speaker 2>went through some serious overtraining,</v>

3963
01:35:51.831 --> 01:35:52.521
<v Speaker 2>which as you know,</v>

3964
01:35:52.521 --> 01:35:53.060
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

3965
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:53.900
<v Speaker 2>that's no joke.</v>

3966
01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.153
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3967
01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:57.110
<v Speaker 2>learn that lesson the hard way.</v>

3968
01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the darkest moments of my athletic career,</v>

3969
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:02.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's also been a net benefit for me as I've gone,</v>

3970
01:36:02.751 --> 01:36:02.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3971
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:05.510
<v Speaker 2>that was back in 2011 or whatever.</v>

3972
01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:06.210
<v Speaker 2>And these products,</v>

3973
01:36:06.210 --> 01:36:08.510
<v Speaker 2>these world record projects had been in the last couple of years.</v>

3974
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:09.830
<v Speaker 2>And so I learned from that,</v>

3975
01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:10.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3976
01:36:10.071 --> 01:36:14.180
<v Speaker 2>taking it way too much and not learning how to recover to implementing things in</v>

3977
01:36:14.181 --> 01:36:14.320
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3978
01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.100
<v Speaker 2>so your question about what did I monitor?</v>

3979
01:36:16.101 --> 01:36:16.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3980
01:36:16.281 --> 01:36:18.410
<v Speaker 2>resting heart rate is one that I monitored a lot.</v>

3981
01:36:18.411 --> 01:36:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Heart rate variability as well.</v>

3982
01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:20.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3983
01:36:20.690 --> 01:36:22.430
<v Speaker 2>as well as certain blood levels,</v>

3984
01:36:22.431 --> 01:36:24.590
<v Speaker 2>of course around the whole endocrine system,</v>

3985
01:36:24.591 --> 01:36:26.060
<v Speaker 2>the testosterone levels,</v>

3986
01:36:26.061 --> 01:36:26.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3987
01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:26.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3988
01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.520
<v Speaker 2>different hormone levels and things like that.</v>

3989
01:36:28.521 --> 01:36:29.450
<v Speaker 2>So coming back,</v>

3990
01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.370
<v Speaker 2>I do blood work ahead of time,</v>

3991
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:34.760
<v Speaker 2>then come back just it with standard process with the nutrition company that had</v>

3992
01:36:34.761 --> 01:36:35.600
<v Speaker 2>all this blood work on me.</v>

3993
01:36:35.601 --> 01:36:38.600
<v Speaker 2>So when I left Antarctica before flying home beef,</v>

3994
01:36:38.650 --> 01:36:38.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3995
01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.600
<v Speaker 2>next place I had to go actually was to New York to do the today show,</v>

3996
01:36:41.601 --> 01:36:44.420
<v Speaker 2>which was a whole weird thing after being alone in Antarctica to have this type</v>

3997
01:36:44.421 --> 01:36:45.440
<v Speaker 2>of TV cameras your face,</v>

3998
01:36:45.441 --> 01:36:47.540
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other like weird twilight zone moment.</v>

3999
01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.250
<v Speaker 2>But before I even did that,</v>

4000
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:52.490
<v Speaker 2>I flew to Charlotte where their nutrition innovation center is and did all my</v>

4001
01:36:52.491 --> 01:36:52.971
<v Speaker 2>blood work.</v>

4002
01:36:52.971 --> 01:36:56.030
<v Speaker 2>And so we can have basically this longitudinal study of my blood work to</v>

4003
01:36:56.031 --> 01:36:56.864
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>

4004
01:36:57.230 --> 01:36:59.720
<v Speaker 2>And so I monitor all of that and figure out what I'm deficient in,</v>

4005
01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:00.351
<v Speaker 2>what I need,</v>

4006
01:37:00.351 --> 01:37:01.430
<v Speaker 2>where my heart rate's at.</v>

4007
01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4008
01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:02.781
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

4009
01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:02.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4010
01:37:02.961 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 2>basically a lot of inflammation in my body and needing to kind of rid my body of</v>

4011
01:37:05.811 --> 01:37:06.830
<v Speaker 2>that and fully recover.</v>

4012
01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:09.930
<v Speaker 6>So when you're coming back from all these summits and all these,</v>

4013
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.610
<v Speaker 6>this time at altitude,</v>

4014
01:37:11.850 --> 01:37:16.850
<v Speaker 6>what has actually happened to your body that causes you to be really depleted</v>

4015
01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:18.570
<v Speaker 6>for six months?</v>

4016
01:37:18.571 --> 01:37:18.971
<v Speaker 6>Like what,</v>

4017
01:37:18.971 --> 01:37:19.380
<v Speaker 6>what's,</v>

4018
01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:23.130
<v Speaker 6>what's happening other than the fact that you were at high altitude,</v>

4019
01:37:23.131 --> 01:37:24.000
<v Speaker 6>low oxygen,</v>

4020
01:37:24.001 --> 01:37:25.200
<v Speaker 6>like what's taking place?</v>

4021
01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:28.250
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that happened to high altitude that you don't really think</v>

4022
01:37:28.251 --> 01:37:28.911
<v Speaker 2>about too much,</v>

4023
01:37:28.911 --> 01:37:30.860
<v Speaker 2>which is your body's not getting,</v>

4024
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:34.790
<v Speaker 2>so the air actually has just as much oxygen in it as it does at sea level.</v>

4025
01:37:34.791 --> 01:37:36.110
<v Speaker 2>But the air is less dense.</v>

4026
01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.970
<v Speaker 2>So that means as you breathe in the air,</v>

4027
01:37:37.971 --> 01:37:40.400
<v Speaker 2>you're literally getting less oxygen into your blood.</v>

4028
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:41.300
<v Speaker 2>It's less dense,</v>

4029
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:42.163
<v Speaker 2>it's less dense,</v>

4030
01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.330
<v Speaker 2>less nitrogen and the pressure changes,</v>

4031
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.811
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4032
01:37:44.811 --> 01:37:46.850
<v Speaker 2>So at the high altitude is actually the pressure that's changing.</v>

4033
01:37:46.851 --> 01:37:48.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not less oxygen,</v>

4034
01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:49.400
<v Speaker 2>there's just as much oxygen,</v>

4035
01:37:49.401 --> 01:37:50.510
<v Speaker 2>but in a less dense form.</v>

4036
01:37:50.511 --> 01:37:52.160
<v Speaker 2>So in the same volume of breath,</v>

4037
01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:54.790
<v Speaker 2>you're getting less actual o two into your blood.</v>

4038
01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 2>What you going to higher altitude,</v>

4039
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.233
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

4040
01:37:57.250 --> 01:37:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4041
01:37:57.690 --> 01:37:58.730
<v Speaker 2>carbon dioxide.</v>

4042
01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

4043
01:37:59.380 --> 01:37:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4044
01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:00.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a doctor.</v>

4045
01:38:00.421 --> 01:38:01.254
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

4046
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:03.210
<v Speaker 2>all I know is you're getting less oxygen.</v>

4047
01:38:04.230 --> 01:38:05.430
<v Speaker 2>You're getting less oxygen in your body.</v>

4048
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:08.760
<v Speaker 2>So what ends up happening is your muscles of course need oxygen to perform.</v>

4049
01:38:09.210 --> 01:38:10.530
<v Speaker 2>So normally if I'm in a,</v>

4050
01:38:10.531 --> 01:38:10.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4051
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.840
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in my most elite physical shape,</v>

4052
01:38:12.841 --> 01:38:12.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4053
01:38:12.991 --> 01:38:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I have resting heart rate during a professional triathlon career,</v>

4054
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:16.860
<v Speaker 2>like 35 getting out of bed,</v>

4055
01:38:16.861 --> 01:38:17.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4056
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:19.740
<v Speaker 2>38 low enough that if you weren't a professional athlete and you went to a</v>

4057
01:38:19.741 --> 01:38:20.910
<v Speaker 2>doctor with a heart rate at 35,</v>

4058
01:38:20.911 --> 01:38:21.241
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>

4059
01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:21.691
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

4060
01:38:21.691 --> 01:38:22.381
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to die.</v>

4061
01:38:22.381 --> 01:38:23.101
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong with you.</v>

4062
01:38:23.101 --> 01:38:26.430
<v Speaker 2>But like that's also a key marker of elite performance.</v>

4063
01:38:26.431 --> 01:38:26.641
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4064
01:38:26.641 --> 01:38:27.474
<v Speaker 2>that of course.</v>

4065
01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4066
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:29.340
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

4067
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:33.900
<v Speaker 2>what happens is your body can't PR your body's getting so little auction,</v>

4068
01:38:33.901 --> 01:38:35.370
<v Speaker 2>even as your blood is a climatizing,</v>

4069
01:38:35.371 --> 01:38:37.890
<v Speaker 2>you're sleeping with a resting heart rate at altitude on Everest,</v>

4070
01:38:37.930 --> 01:38:39.750
<v Speaker 2>like 9,000 beats per minute.</v>

4071
01:38:40.050 --> 01:38:40.883
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4072
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:41.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4073
01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:42.840
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty elevated heart rate,</v>

4074
01:38:42.841 --> 01:38:44.190
<v Speaker 2>24 hours a day.</v>

4075
01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:44.461
<v Speaker 2>And for,</v>

4076
01:38:44.461 --> 01:38:44.941
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

4077
01:38:44.941 --> 01:38:46.740
<v Speaker 2>for 139 days straight.</v>

4078
01:38:46.741 --> 01:38:48.630
<v Speaker 2>So essentially you're just your heart.</v>

4079
01:38:48.631 --> 01:38:51.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just like Cookeaqua even at rest.</v>

4080
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.390
<v Speaker 2>And so what that does to your body in terms of,</v>

4081
01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:54.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4082
01:38:54.581 --> 01:38:56.100
<v Speaker 2>it throws your hormones around it.</v>

4083
01:38:56.101 --> 01:38:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you lose body weight,</v>

4084
01:38:57.571 --> 01:38:58.171
<v Speaker 2>body fat,</v>

4085
01:38:58.171 --> 01:38:59.670
<v Speaker 2>body composition changes,</v>

4086
01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.950
<v Speaker 2>all of those things really shift and happen,</v>

4087
01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:02.251
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4088
01:39:02.251 --> 01:39:03.480
<v Speaker 2>in a pretty intense way.</v>

4089
01:39:03.481 --> 01:39:04.350
<v Speaker 2>So coming back,</v>

4090
01:39:04.351 --> 01:39:06.210
<v Speaker 2>like actually just getting your heart rate back down,</v>

4091
01:39:06.211 --> 01:39:06.910
<v Speaker 2>getting your,</v>

4092
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:07.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4093
01:39:07.271 --> 01:39:11.760
<v Speaker 2>a parasympathetic nervous system to just relax and stress free and all that kind</v>

4094
01:39:11.761 --> 01:39:11.980
<v Speaker 2>of stuff.</v>

4095
01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.050
<v Speaker 2>It takes a while for sure.</v>

4096
01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:16.740
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do to help yourself recover when you come back?</v>

4097
01:39:16.741 --> 01:39:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's specific kinds of food that you eat or supplements that you take.</v>

4098
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4099
01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:21.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4100
01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I'll start with a few different things that I find to be the work.</v>

4101
01:39:24.271 --> 01:39:24.481
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4102
01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:25.530
<v Speaker 2>one sleep.</v>

4103
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.831
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4104
01:39:25.831 --> 01:39:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that sleep in our culture in general is really underrated.</v>

4105
01:39:29.311 --> 01:39:29.761
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

4106
01:39:29.761 --> 01:39:30.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4107
01:39:30.031 --> 01:39:32.460
<v Speaker 2>if you go in the corporate world and everyone's like,</v>

4108
01:39:32.461 --> 01:39:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I pulled this all night or I work,</v>

4109
01:39:33.931 --> 01:39:34.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4110
01:39:34.081 --> 01:39:35.580
<v Speaker 2>120 hours a week,</v>

4111
01:39:35.581 --> 01:39:36.750
<v Speaker 2>I this I that or whatever.</v>

4112
01:39:36.751 --> 01:39:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4113
01:39:37.290 --> 01:39:37.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4114
01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you a story about pushing through the night and going 32 hours</v>

4115
01:39:40.111 --> 01:39:40.321
<v Speaker 2>straight.</v>

4116
01:39:40.321 --> 01:39:42.540
<v Speaker 2>There was a time and a place for big pushes without sleep.</v>

4117
01:39:42.541 --> 01:39:46.410
<v Speaker 2>But like we are not built to do that sustainably in any way,</v>

4118
01:39:46.411 --> 01:39:46.981
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

4119
01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:47.791
<v Speaker 2>So in my training,</v>

4120
01:39:47.791 --> 01:39:48.870
<v Speaker 2>when I'm training for these things,</v>

4121
01:39:48.871 --> 01:39:49.890
<v Speaker 2>I prioritize sleep,</v>

4122
01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.420
<v Speaker 2>I prioritize taking a nap,</v>

4123
01:39:51.421 --> 01:39:52.650
<v Speaker 2>the same thing when I'm recovering.</v>

4124
01:39:52.651 --> 01:39:55.140
<v Speaker 2>So really making sure I get that sleep is the most for me,</v>

4125
01:39:55.141 --> 01:39:56.430
<v Speaker 2>the most natural way to recover.</v>

4126
01:39:56.431 --> 01:39:58.350
<v Speaker 2>And top of that soft tissue work.</v>

4127
01:39:58.351 --> 01:40:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge believer in massage as well as chiropractor.</v>

4128
01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4129
01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I've been going to a chiropractor since I was a little kid and to me that makes</v>

4130
01:40:05.101 --> 01:40:07.110
<v Speaker 2>a big difference just to have everything in alignment,</v>

4131
01:40:07.111 --> 01:40:07.831
<v Speaker 2>everything kind of,</v>

4132
01:40:07.831 --> 01:40:08.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4133
01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 2>working well,</v>

4134
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4135
01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:10.440
<v Speaker 2>officially in my body.</v>

4136
01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:10.951
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4137
01:40:10.951 --> 01:40:11.191
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

4138
01:40:11.191 --> 01:40:11.371

<v Speaker 2>definitely reducing inflammation.</v>

4142
01:40:13.891 --> 01:40:14.371
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

4143
01:40:14.371 --> 01:40:15.510
<v Speaker 2>gut health is huge.</v>

4144
01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:15.811
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4145
01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:17.130
<v Speaker 2>so getting those probiotics,</v>

4146
01:40:17.131 --> 01:40:18.090

01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:18.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's easy to have,</v>

4149
01:40:19.351 --> 01:40:19.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4150
01:40:19.501 --> 01:40:22.020

4151
01:40:22.021 --> 01:40:22.560
<v Speaker 2>observe,</v>

4152
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.760
<v Speaker 2>absorbed properly.</v>

4153
01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:25.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think we all in various states,</v>

4154
01:40:25.621 --> 01:40:25.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:40:26.701 --> 01:40:26.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4157
01:40:26.921 --> 01:40:28.560
<v Speaker 2>in the standard American Diet for sure.</v>

4158
01:40:28.561 --> 01:40:30.090
<v Speaker 2>We're leads to that for a lot of people.</v>

4159
01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:30.601
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4160
01:40:30.601 --> 01:40:32.460
<v Speaker 2>so getting that nutrition clean and right.</v>

4161
01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:32.941
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4162
01:40:32.941 --> 01:40:33.211
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

4163
01:40:33.211 --> 01:40:33.631
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

4164
01:40:33.631 --> 01:40:33.931
<v Speaker 2>rest,</v>

4165
01:40:33.931 --> 01:40:34.381
<v Speaker 2>recovery,</v>

4166
01:40:34.381 --> 01:40:35.130
<v Speaker 2>nutrition.</v>

4167
01:40:35.130 --> 01:40:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4168
01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:35.911
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

4169
01:40:35.911 --> 01:40:36.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4170
01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely been taking,</v>

4171
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:38.860
<v Speaker 2>taken a lot of supplements through my life.</v>

4172
01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:41.670
<v Speaker 2>I err more towards the whole food supplements these days,</v>

4173
01:40:41.671 --> 01:40:42.410
<v Speaker 2>but I find,</v>

4174
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4175
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:45.060
<v Speaker 2>things like Tumeric that really reduce inflammation.</v>

4176
01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4177
01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:46.621
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

4178
01:40:46.621 --> 01:40:46.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4179
01:40:46.801 --> 01:40:48.570
<v Speaker 2>magnesium definitely helps a lot.</v>

4180
01:40:48.571 --> 01:40:49.980
<v Speaker 2>So there's a few things that I,</v>

4181
01:40:49.981 --> 01:40:50.910
<v Speaker 2>that I take daily,</v>

4182
01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:51.691
<v Speaker 2>but a really,</v>

4183
01:40:51.691 --> 01:40:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I think sleep and a clean diet will goes a long way.</v>

4184
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4185
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4186
01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4187
01:40:56.590 --> 01:40:57.820
<v Speaker 2>mess with some cryo before.</v>

4188
01:40:57.821 --> 01:40:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I find that to be pretty,</v>

4189
01:40:58.941 --> 01:40:59.441
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>

4190
01:40:59.441 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do that a lot,</v>

4191
01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:01.540
<v Speaker 2>but I've done that in the last couple of years,</v>

4192
01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:01.931
<v Speaker 2>a bit.</v>

4193
01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:03.280
<v Speaker 2>So various things.</v>

4194
01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4195
01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:04.210
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

4196
01:41:04.210 --> 01:41:04.510
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

4197
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.811
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

4198
01:41:04.811 --> 01:41:05.051
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

4199
01:41:05.051 --> 01:41:07.060
<v Speaker 2>nutrition is the key to recovery.</v>

4200
01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:10.180
<v Speaker 2>And what kind of foods do you do when you say eating clean?</v>

4201
01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4202
01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.540
<v Speaker 2>a particular way of eating.</v>

4203
01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:14.523
<v Speaker 2>I'm uh,</v>

4204
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:15.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm recently,</v>

4205
01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:16.533
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4206
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:18.220
<v Speaker 2>doing more of a pescatarian diet.</v>

4207
01:41:18.221 --> 01:41:18.631
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

4208
01:41:18.631 --> 01:41:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I've mostly cut out meat,</v>

4209
01:41:19.811 --> 01:41:20.740
<v Speaker 2>although that's very,</v>

4210
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I was raised that way.</v>

4211
01:41:21.971 --> 01:41:24.190
<v Speaker 2>My parents have been vegetarians forever.</v>

4212
01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4213
01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:25.930
<v Speaker 2>well I should say pescatarian,</v>

4214
01:41:25.931 --> 01:41:26.280
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

4215
01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.340
<v Speaker 2>they eat some fish.</v>

4216
01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4217
01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:28.440
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

4218
01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:28.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4219
01:41:28.691 --> 01:41:29.261
<v Speaker 2>no chicken,</v>

4220
01:41:29.261 --> 01:41:29.681
<v Speaker 2>no beef,</v>

4221
01:41:29.681 --> 01:41:30.340
<v Speaker 2>none of that.</v>

4222
01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4223
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:30.971
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

4224
01:41:30.971 --> 01:41:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I've actually,</v>

4225
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:33.490
<v Speaker 2>even in Antarctica there was some,</v>

4226
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:34.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4227
01:41:34.170 --> 01:41:35.260
<v Speaker 2>in my freeze dried meals,</v>

4228
01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:35.531
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

4229
01:41:35.531 --> 01:41:35.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4230
01:41:35.681 --> 01:41:37.240
<v Speaker 2>beef and chicken and stuff like that.</v>

4231
01:41:37.241 --> 01:41:40.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's not something I've out my dad freeze dried meals as well as bringing</v>

4232
01:41:40.331 --> 01:41:41.710
<v Speaker 2>those column bars with the main thing.</v>

4233
01:41:41.711 --> 01:41:44.560
<v Speaker 2>But every dinner I had one freeze tribe meal at the end of the day.</v>

4234
01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:45.880
<v Speaker 2>That was an extra thousand calories.</v>

4235
01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:47.861
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4236
01:41:47.861 --> 01:41:48.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4237
01:41:48.061 --> 01:41:49.190
<v Speaker 2>It was a company who was Al Pioneer,</v>

4238
01:41:49.191 --> 01:41:50.830
<v Speaker 2>but same thing as a mountain house basically.</v>

4239
01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4240
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:54.070
<v Speaker 2>so it was rice noodles mixed with chicken or beef.</v>

4241
01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:55.180
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4242
01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:55.511
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4243
01:41:55.511 --> 01:41:56.370
<v Speaker 2>when I say he can clean,</v>

4244
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I mostly mean just like eating a whole food stuff,</v>

4245
01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.313
<v Speaker 2>like not eating,</v>

4246
01:41:59.410 --> 01:42:01.450
<v Speaker 2>not eating processed crap,</v>

4247
01:42:01.451 --> 01:42:02.380
<v Speaker 2>refined sugars,</v>

4248
01:42:02.381 --> 01:42:02.981
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>

4249
01:42:02.981 --> 01:42:03.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4250
01:42:03.191 --> 01:42:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4251
01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm a normal human being,</v>

4252
01:42:04.661 --> 01:42:08.050
<v Speaker 2>so I'm guilty of that as anyone from time to time of just grabbing the easiest,</v>

4253
01:42:08.051 --> 01:42:08.884
<v Speaker 2>closest thing.</v>

4254
01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4255
01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:10.331
<v Speaker 2>but like I said,</v>

4256
01:42:10.331 --> 01:42:10.750
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>

4257
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:12.120
<v Speaker 2>my dad's an organic farmer.</v>

4258
01:42:12.130 --> 01:42:12.500
<v Speaker 2>My mom,</v>

4259
01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:15.970
<v Speaker 2>my stepdad started a chain of natural foods grocery stores when I was a kid.</v>

4260
01:42:15.971 --> 01:42:17.230
<v Speaker 2>So I was really raised around,</v>

4261
01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:17.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4262

<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

4264
01:42:18.191 --> 01:42:21.130
<v Speaker 2>in a sort of hippie co op days of the natural foods movement,</v>

4265
01:42:21.131 --> 01:42:24.520
<v Speaker 2>which of course now with Amazon owning whole foods is to do a lot more to the</v>

4266
01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:25.354
<v Speaker 2>mainstream.</v>

4267
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4268
01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:26.441

01:42:32.141 --> 01:42:33.160
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things,</v>

4278
01:42:33.161 --> 01:42:33.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4283
01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:37.990
<v Speaker 2>particularly when I need to recover.</v>

4284
01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

4285
01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you mess with CBD at all?</v>

4286
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:41.051
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4287
01:42:41.051 --> 01:42:41.884
<v Speaker 2>it's not something I've,</v>

4288
01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I've done a lot of,</v>

4289
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:43.261
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4290
01:42:43.261 --> 01:42:44.470
<v Speaker 2>I hear amazing things.</v>

4291
01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely not opposed to it at all.</v>

4292
01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4293
01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:47.831
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

4294
01:42:47.831 --> 01:42:48.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4295
01:42:48.101 --> 01:42:48.491
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

4296
01:42:48.491 --> 01:42:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I haven't tried.</v>

4297
01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:50.440
<v Speaker 2>What's your experience been with that?</v>

4298
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:53.220
<v Speaker 6>I've been experimented with it for the last couple of years.</v>

4299
01:42:53.221 --> 01:42:57.120
<v Speaker 6>It has a pretty profound effect on alleviating soreness,</v>

4300
01:42:57.121 --> 01:42:58.740
<v Speaker 6>especially joint soreness.</v>

4301
01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:01.790
<v Speaker 6>And it also makes you feel good though.</v>

4302
01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:04.680
<v Speaker 6>The word is that it alleviates anxiety,</v>

4303
01:43:04.681 --> 01:43:06.150
<v Speaker 6>which I don't suffer a lot of,</v>

4304
01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:08.580
<v Speaker 6>but it makes me feel relaxed.</v>

4305
01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:09.170
<v Speaker 6>Did you,</v>

4306
01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:11.340
<v Speaker 6>do you take it orally or do you use it topically?</v>

4307
01:43:11.670 --> 01:43:12.540
<v Speaker 6>I take a look.</v>

4308
01:43:12.541 --> 01:43:13.374
<v Speaker 6>A dropper.</v>

4309
01:43:13.530 --> 01:43:16.290
<v Speaker 6>The dropper I'd take like whatever they say to take.</v>

4310
01:43:16.291 --> 01:43:17.670
<v Speaker 6>I took like five times more than that.</v>

4311
01:43:19.230 --> 01:43:20.190
<v Speaker 6>Did you take it at night?</v>

4312
01:43:20.191 --> 01:43:23.010
<v Speaker 6>Like they're gonna take it during the morning and I take it at night as well.</v>

4313
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:27.540
<v Speaker 6>I just always feel like I'm running my body at red line,</v>

4314
01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.670
<v Speaker 6>running my brain at red line so much.</v>

4315
01:43:29.671 --> 01:43:30.840
<v Speaker 6>So whatever they say you need,</v>

4316
01:43:30.841 --> 01:43:33.150
<v Speaker 6>I just double it for almost everything.</v>

4317
01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 2>And do you feel like,</v>

4318
01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:35.920
<v Speaker 2>obviously it doesn't have the THC effects of it,</v>

4319
01:43:35.921 --> 01:43:37.230
<v Speaker 2>but do you feel like in it,</v>

4320
01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:37.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4321
01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:38.370
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

4322
01:43:38.370 --> 01:43:39.790
<v Speaker 2>You're not clear headed clear mind.</v>

4323
01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:40.101
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4324
01:43:40.101 --> 01:43:43.430
<v Speaker 6>and my THC tolerance is so high it doesn't really,</v>

4325
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.890
<v Speaker 6>but some forms of it,</v>

4326
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.310
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4327
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:51.260
<v Speaker 6>have a small amount of THC and I think there may be some sort of synergistic</v>

4328
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:54.260
<v Speaker 6>that that happens with the THC combined.</v>

4329
01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:58.400
<v Speaker 6>The CBD that helps people even more because a lot of people,</v>

4330
01:43:58.401 --> 01:43:58.670
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4331
01:43:58.670 --> 01:43:59.840
<v Speaker 6>that have pain,</v>

4332
01:44:00.230 --> 01:44:01.460
<v Speaker 6>particularly chronic pain,</v>

4333
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:06.490
<v Speaker 6>they experience a lot of relief from THC from just smoking or vaporizing it or</v>

4334
01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 6>using edibles.</v>

4335
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.560
<v Speaker 6>So I think that the,</v>

4336
01:44:09.561 --> 01:44:09.711
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4337
01:44:09.711 --> 01:44:13.460
<v Speaker 6>the CBD with a little bit of THC might have a better effect.</v>

4338
01:44:13.461 --> 01:44:14.090
<v Speaker 6>A lot of fighters say,</v>

4339
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:14.360
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4340
01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:14.850
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

4341
01:44:14.850 --> 01:44:15.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4342
01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:15.231
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4343
01:44:15.231 --> 01:44:17.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in trying the CVD for sure.</v>

4344
01:44:17.211 --> 01:44:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Something I should definitely try it.</v>

4345
01:44:18.431 --> 01:44:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that it gives you like a sustained,</v>

4346
01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.250
<v Speaker 2>like as it relief when it's in your body,</v>

4347
01:44:22.251 --> 01:44:25.700
<v Speaker 2>like a masking relief or do you feel like it actually is like curing the root</v>

4348
01:44:25.701 --> 01:44:27.530
<v Speaker 2>cause of that inflammation or anxiety?</v>

4349
01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.910
<v Speaker 6>It's masking it all.</v>

4350
01:44:28.911 --> 01:44:31.820
<v Speaker 6>I think it's alleviating the inflammation.</v>

4351
01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:32.600
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

4352
01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.640
<v Speaker 6>it's a very healthy thing for your body to eat.</v>

4353
01:44:34.641 --> 01:44:34.860
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

4354
01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:35.271
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4355
01:44:35.271 --> 01:44:35.541
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4356
01:44:35.541 --> 01:44:36.100
<v Speaker 6>obviously,</v>

4357
01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:36.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4358
01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.840
<v Speaker 6>there's a bunch of different oils that will alleviate inflammation,</v>

4359
01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:43.040
<v Speaker 6>different essential fatty acids and fish oils are very good for him.</v>

4360
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:43.940
<v Speaker 6>Information,</v>

4361
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:47.300
<v Speaker 6>I think anything that you can take that helps your body mitigate inflammation.</v>

4362
01:44:47.301 --> 01:44:49.500
<v Speaker 6>Inflammation seems to be a gigantic problem without,</v>

4363
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.040
<v Speaker 6>with just not with pain just with paint.</v>

4364
01:44:52.041 --> 01:44:53.420
<v Speaker 6>But I think also with anxiety,</v>

4365
01:44:53.421 --> 01:44:54.254
<v Speaker 6>I think it's,</v>

4366
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:57.410
<v Speaker 6>it's entirely possible that feelings of discomfort,</v>

4367
01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:57.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4368
01:44:57.930 --> 01:44:58.580
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4369
01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.001
<v Speaker 6>like when you,</v>

4370
01:44:59.001 --> 01:45:00.770
<v Speaker 6>when you see people that are anxious,</v>

4371
01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:02.390
<v Speaker 6>they're often look bloated.</v>

4372
01:45:02.391 --> 01:45:02.750
<v Speaker 6>To me,</v>

4373
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:03.583
<v Speaker 6>they often look like,</v>

4374
01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:07.190
<v Speaker 6>I think it's just an overall sense of unwellness,</v>

4375
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.851
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4376
01:45:07.851 --> 01:45:12.851
<v Speaker 6>And I think that poor diet exacerbates that and a good diet can alleviate some</v>

4377
01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:15.380
<v Speaker 6>of those symptoms.</v>

4378
01:45:15.381 --> 01:45:17.660
<v Speaker 6>And I think that CBD is a big part of that.</v>

4379
01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.581
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>

4380
01:45:18.581 --> 01:45:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4381
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:19.271
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4382
01:45:19.271 --> 01:45:19.511
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4383
01:45:19.511 --> 01:45:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4384
01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested to try that for sure.</v>

4385
01:45:21.161 --> 01:45:23.410
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely that inflammation.</v>

4386
01:45:23.411 --> 01:45:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Even for me coming back from Antarctica and this quarter of recovery phase.</v>

4387
01:45:26.171 --> 01:45:28.720
<v Speaker 2>What's weird is like you saw how lean I got then,</v>

4388
01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:32.920
<v Speaker 2>but my body I think cause it was so depleted of food source is now actually</v>

4389
01:45:33.250 --> 01:45:36.520
<v Speaker 2>almost trying to put fat back on my body like of kind of storing that.</v>

4390
01:45:36.521 --> 01:45:37.780
<v Speaker 2>So actually my body comes to some,</v>

4391
01:45:37.781 --> 01:45:40.450
<v Speaker 2>feels weird to me right now because my body is like just like trying to figure</v>

4392
01:45:40.451 --> 01:45:43.540
<v Speaker 2>out where the hell I'm at and I think a lot of that comes from that chronic</v>

4393
01:45:43.541 --> 01:45:47.140
<v Speaker 2>inflammation and certainly just those elevated cortisol levels of just being so</v>

4394
01:45:47.170 --> 01:45:48.820
<v Speaker 2>jacked up and red line like you said,</v>

4395
01:45:48.821 --> 01:45:52.780
<v Speaker 2>just like so wired because of finding ways to kind of mitigate that I think is</v>

4396
01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.550
<v Speaker 2>crucial and I should try it.</v>

4397
01:45:54.610 --> 01:45:56.930
<v Speaker 2>What form would you recommend trying that perform</v>

4398
01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:57.181
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

4399
01:45:57.181 --> 01:45:57.751
<v Speaker 4>I like to draw.</v>

4400
01:45:57.751 --> 01:46:02.040
<v Speaker 4>I like it because like there's gel tabs are fine,</v>

4401
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:05.150
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's unnecessary about is absorbing that the coal,</v>

4402
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:06.570
<v Speaker 4>the cover scope,</v>

4403
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:08.760
<v Speaker 4>the stuff just go right to the oil.</v>

4404
01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.320
<v Speaker 4>I just think it's the best way to do it,</v>

4405
01:46:10.321 --> 01:46:10.561
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a,</v>

4406
01:46:10.561 --> 01:46:13.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of curcumin and Tumeric as well.</v>

4407
01:46:13.531 --> 01:46:16.700
<v Speaker 4>I think those are really good to try and Ashwagandha or any of the like the</v>

4408
01:46:16.710 --> 01:46:17.360
<v Speaker 4>mushroom,</v>

4409
01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.170
<v Speaker 4>the mushroom teas and stuff like that.</v>

4410
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:21.060
<v Speaker 4>This stuff actually that I have right here,</v>

4411
01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.430
<v Speaker 4>that just wasn't a plant while lion's mane,</v>

4412
01:46:23.431 --> 01:46:24.241
<v Speaker 4>mushroom elixir.</v>

4413
01:46:24.241 --> 01:46:25.080
<v Speaker 4>I love this stuff.</v>

4414
01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4415
01:46:25.650 --> 01:46:25.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4416
01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:26.610
<v Speaker 4>I take this,</v>

4417
01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:27.473
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4418
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:28.321
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

4419
01:46:28.321 --> 01:46:33.321
<v Speaker 4>I make a tea out of this mess with like the courthouse steps and the Ashwagandha</v>

4420
01:46:33.811 --> 01:46:34.051
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>

4421
01:46:34.051 --> 01:46:35.910
<v Speaker 4>They kind of reduce some of the good cortisol,</v>

4422
01:46:35.911 --> 01:46:38.760
<v Speaker 4>like emotional or hormonal balances type of stuff.</v>

4423
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:39.540
<v Speaker 4>Quarter sepsis.</v>

4424
01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:40.470
<v Speaker 4>Fantastic too.</v>

4425
01:46:40.471 --> 01:46:42.300
<v Speaker 4>For endurance to 100%.</v>

4426
01:46:42.301 --> 01:46:42.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4427
01:46:42.571 --> 01:46:43.950
<v Speaker 4>we have a PR on it.</v>

4428
01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:47.560
<v Speaker 4>We have an audit product called shroom tech sport that is core to subs,</v>

4429
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 4>a B vitamins and a bunch adaptogens.</v>

4430
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 4>It really</v>

4431
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:50.610
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

4432
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Really has a big impact on me in terms of like how hard I can push in the gym.</v>

4433
01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I take it about an hour or so before it out.</v>

4434
01:46:58.620 --> 01:46:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4435
01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Let your body absorb it and it just,</v>

4436
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.670
<v Speaker 1>it just really has a real effect.</v>

4437
01:47:02.690 --> 01:47:04.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give me a jittery thing either.</v>

4438
01:47:04.670 --> 01:47:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4439
01:47:05.190 --> 01:47:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It just gives me more energy.</v>

4440
01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of take it an hour before it kind of primes your body for that more</v>

4441
01:47:09.810 --> 01:47:10.591
<v Speaker 1>oxygen uptake.</v>

4442
01:47:10.591 --> 01:47:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Is that Kinda the idea behind Cortis apps?</v>

4443
01:47:12.451 --> 01:47:13.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've been told anyway.</v>

4444
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:16.650
<v Speaker 1>It came out of a high altitude herders.</v>

4445
01:47:16.651 --> 01:47:17.484
<v Speaker 1>They noticed that.</v>

4446
01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4447
01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:21.570
<v Speaker 1>When there the cattle were eating certain mushrooms,</v>

4448
01:47:21.571 --> 01:47:23.760
<v Speaker 1>they had more energy and so then they,</v>

4449
01:47:23.761 --> 01:47:24.171
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4450
01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:25.860
<v Speaker 1>that's how they started experimenting with this stuff.</v>

4451
01:47:25.861 --> 01:47:27.750
<v Speaker 1>They actually grow it on caterpillars.</v>

4452
01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:28.350
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4453
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4454
01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:30.510
<v Speaker 1>so strange man.</v>

4455
01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:31.590
<v Speaker 1>See if he can find it.</v>

4456
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Cordyceps mushrooms grown on caterpillar picturing like this room of</v>

4457
01:47:36.301 --> 01:47:38.950
<v Speaker 1>caterpillars with like carrying around mushrooms on their back.</v>

4458
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:40.890
<v Speaker 1>It's real freaky.</v>

4459
01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:42.090
<v Speaker 1>It's really freaky.</v>

4460
01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:43.980
<v Speaker 1>But apparently the way they farm it,</v>

4461
01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:44.970
<v Speaker 1>that's the way they farm it.</v>

4462
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.680
<v Speaker 1>They actually grow it on Caterpillar.</v>

4463
01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:47.971
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

4464
01:47:47.971 --> 01:47:48.804
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4465
01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

4466
01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.580
<v Speaker 1>It's expensive shit,</v>

4467
01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:52.260
<v Speaker 1>but like there it is.</v>

4468
01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

4469
01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Look how fucking strange.</v>

4470
01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:55.134
<v Speaker 1>So those,</v>

4471
01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:56.011
<v Speaker 1>that the bottom there,</v>

4472
01:47:56.011 --> 01:47:58.620
<v Speaker 1>that's the caterpillars and the mushroom growing out of their heads or something</v>

4473
01:47:58.621 --> 01:47:58.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4474
01:47:58.980 --> 01:47:59.611
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

4475
01:47:59.611 --> 01:48:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that snip that shit off the caterpillars.</v>

4476
01:48:04.170 --> 01:48:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Fucking weird man.</v>

4477
01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4478
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Well apparently it works well.</v>

4479
01:48:08.491 --> 01:48:09.001
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

4480
01:48:09.001 --> 01:48:09.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4481
01:48:09.271 --> 01:48:09.600
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4482
01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4483
01:48:10.021 --> 01:48:13.680
<v Speaker 1>there's so many bad at mean Paul Stamets who's been on the podcast before and I</v>

4484
01:48:13.681 --> 01:48:14.910
<v Speaker 1>can't wait to get them back on again,</v>

4485
01:48:14.911 --> 01:48:18.930
<v Speaker 1>but he's a mycologist and it was one of the best podcasts that I've ever done in</v>

4486
01:48:18.931 --> 01:48:23.931
<v Speaker 1>terms of like really explaining the benefits of different fungi and different</v>

4487
01:48:24.271 --> 01:48:29.271
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and how many different nutritional benefits you can derive from them.</v>

4488
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4489
01:48:30.010 --> 01:48:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4490
01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't agree more just the,</v>

4491
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:32.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4492
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:34.890
<v Speaker 1>the whole food nutrition from many different levels.</v>

4493
01:48:35.170 --> 01:48:36.003
<v Speaker 1>It's mushroom,</v>

4494
01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Tumeric,</v>

4495
01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:38.160
<v Speaker 1>this full plant derivatives.</v>

4496
01:48:38.161 --> 01:48:38.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4497
01:48:38.401 --> 01:48:39.540
<v Speaker 1>to me they go,</v>

4498
01:48:39.541 --> 01:48:41.100
<v Speaker 1>they go a long way in their pure form.</v>

4499
01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:41.700
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

4500
01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:42.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4501
01:48:42.151 --> 01:48:42.821
<v Speaker 1>What about what,</v>

4502
01:48:42.821 --> 01:48:43.621
<v Speaker 1>what do you drink?</v>

4503
01:48:43.621 --> 01:48:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you drink a lot of water?</v>

4504
01:48:44.941 --> 01:48:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you drink fruit juices,</v>

4505
01:48:46.171 --> 01:48:47.160
<v Speaker 1>vegetable juices?</v>

4506
01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Mostly,</v>

4507
01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.141
<v Speaker 1>mostly water.</v>

4508
01:48:49.141 --> 01:48:50.190
<v Speaker 1>To be perfectly honest,</v>

4509
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4510
01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4511
01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I do usually start the day with a smoothie of some kind.</v>

4512
01:48:55.021 --> 01:48:55.980
<v Speaker 1>So usually it's got,</v>

4513
01:48:55.981 --> 01:48:56.850
<v Speaker 1>it's got fruit in it.</v>

4514
01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4515
01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:59.131
<v Speaker 1>obviously fruit.</v>

4516
01:48:59.131 --> 01:49:00.150
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing I put in there,</v>

4517
01:49:00.151 --> 01:49:00.271
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4518
01:49:00.271 --> 01:49:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I've been using this stuff that it's actually the company standard process is</v>

4519
01:49:04.891 --> 01:49:05.820
<v Speaker 1>just coming out with it,</v>

4520
01:49:05.821 --> 01:49:06.211
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

4521
01:49:06.211 --> 01:49:07.140
<v Speaker 1>let me try it ahead of time.</v>

4522
01:49:07.141 --> 01:49:11.130
<v Speaker 1>At Starbucks is slow release glucose so it's a protein powder but instead of</v>

4523
01:49:11.131 --> 01:49:14.220
<v Speaker 1>giving to that glucose spike like you would from a refined sugar or something</v>

4524
01:49:14.221 --> 01:49:14.581
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

4525
01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:16.920
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a long burn long-chain glucose.</v>

4526
01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:17.371
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4527
01:49:17.371 --> 01:49:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the full chemistry of that,</v>

4528
01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:22.590
<v Speaker 1>but I find it makes a big difference rather than kind of just getting that sugar</v>

4529
01:49:22.591 --> 01:49:23.640
<v Speaker 1>spike early in the day.</v>

4530
01:49:23.641 --> 01:49:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It actually kind of gives this slow release of energy.</v>

4531
01:49:25.591 --> 01:49:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And I was using that was actually in the column bars as well.</v>

4532
01:49:28.171 --> 01:49:30.900
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked that particularly for endurance because you know,</v>

4533
01:49:30.901 --> 01:49:33.750
<v Speaker 1>if you start like taking the goop packets or something like that,</v>

4534
01:49:33.751 --> 01:49:35.340
<v Speaker 1>you get that spike of a hundred calories.</v>

4535
01:49:35.341 --> 01:49:36.780
<v Speaker 1>You get that like quick like boom,</v>

4536
01:49:36.781 --> 01:49:39.330
<v Speaker 1>burst of energy replies replenished at your glucose stores.</v>

4537
01:49:39.630 --> 01:49:41.520
<v Speaker 1>But this I feel like just as a much slower,</v>

4538
01:49:41.521 --> 01:49:42.360
<v Speaker 1>cleaner burn.</v>

4539
01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.370
<v Speaker 1>And it lasts a longer for technically,</v>

4540
01:49:44.371 --> 01:49:44.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4541
01:49:44.581 --> 01:49:44.930
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

4542
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:45.990
<v Speaker 1>for anaerobic stuff.</v>

4543
01:49:45.991 --> 01:49:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe you need kind of that explosive power</v>

4544
01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:48.671
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>

4545
01:49:48.671 --> 01:49:48.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4546
01:49:48.851 --> 01:49:49.810
<v Speaker 2>different things for that.</v>

4547
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:52.030
<v Speaker 2>But for some of the like low heart rate zone one,</v>

4548
01:49:52.031 --> 01:49:55.360
<v Speaker 2>zone two like long grinding type of stuff that I do in the mountains or pulling</v>

4549
01:49:55.361 --> 01:49:56.021
<v Speaker 2>the sled or whatever,</v>

4550
01:49:56.021 --> 01:49:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I find it's really good for stuff like that.</v>

4551
01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.590
<v Speaker 6>Now what scares me about people like you is how old are you now?</v>

4552
01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:03.453
<v Speaker 6>33.</v>

4553
01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:04.450
<v Speaker 6>You're very young.</v>

4554
01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.250
<v Speaker 6>I'll take that.</v>

4555
01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:06.870
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>

4556
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:08.050
<v Speaker 6>this is what I'm worried.</v>

4557
01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:13.140
<v Speaker 6>I'm worried that you've already done so much crazy shit that you have to push</v>

4558
01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:20.340
<v Speaker 6>past the craziest shit you've already done and you've already been on Everest.</v>

4559
01:50:20.771 --> 01:50:23.950
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like you were kind of like you weren't on death's door,</v>

4560
01:50:23.951 --> 01:50:25.270
<v Speaker 6>but you open the front gate,</v>

4561
01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:26.651
<v Speaker 6>the front gate.</v>

4562
01:50:26.651 --> 01:50:27.480
<v Speaker 6>You were on the lawn.</v>

4563
01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:27.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4564
01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:28.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4565
01:50:28.110 --> 01:50:29.080
<v Speaker 6>You're on death's lawn.</v>

4566
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.740
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

4567
01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:30.573
<v Speaker 6>You know.</v>

4568
01:50:30.650 --> 01:50:30.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4569
01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:31.461
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

4570
01:50:31.461 --> 01:50:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean you never said that people were literally died that day.</v>

4571
01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:34.693
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4572
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4573
01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.010
<v Speaker 6>did he do to try to do next?</v>

4574
01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:37.401
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>

4575
01:50:37.401 --> 01:50:38.450
<v Speaker 6>this is the question like,</v>

4576
01:50:38.451 --> 01:50:38.690
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4577
01:50:38.690 --> 01:50:40.440
<v Speaker 6>do you have some crazy shit in your head right now?</v>

4578
01:50:40.441 --> 01:50:40.731
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>

4579
01:50:40.731 --> 01:50:40.971
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

4580
01:50:40.971 --> 01:50:42.190
<v Speaker 6>now I'm going to the moon with a fucking,</v>

4581
01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:44.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4582
01:50:44.031 --> 01:50:44.631
<v Speaker 2>it's bloody,</v>

4583
01:50:44.631 --> 01:50:45.411
<v Speaker 2>it's two fold.</v>

4584
01:50:45.411 --> 01:50:46.730
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting intersection.</v>

4585
01:50:46.731 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>

4586
01:50:47.741 --> 01:50:48.530
<v Speaker 2>That you call me,</v>

4587
01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:49.131
<v Speaker 2>call me young.</v>

4588
01:50:49.131 --> 01:50:50.420
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that all day long,</v>

4589
01:50:50.421 --> 01:50:52.730
<v Speaker 2>but 51 so you are younger to me,</v>

4590
01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:55.190
<v Speaker 2>but I guess in terms of an athlete terms,</v>

4591
01:50:55.191 --> 01:50:55.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4592
01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:56.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4593
01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:56.953
<v Speaker 2>you're in the,</v>

4594
01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:58.310
<v Speaker 2>you're in the Pete.</v>

4595
01:50:58.311 --> 01:50:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4596
01:50:58.470 --> 01:51:00.890
<v Speaker 2>the peak for endurance athletes and it's fun to be here.</v>

4597
01:51:00.891 --> 01:51:04.340
<v Speaker 2>But I also think it's a moment in time where a little bit of,</v>

4598
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.971
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>

4599
01:51:04.971 --> 01:51:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I'll say I won't give myself too much credit,</v>

4600
01:51:06.741 --> 01:51:09.320
<v Speaker 2>but a little bit of wisdom meets also athletic performance.</v>

4601
01:51:09.321 --> 01:51:11.330
<v Speaker 2>A moment in time where I've had enough experience,</v>

4602
01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:12.141
<v Speaker 2>enough setbacks,</v>

4603
01:51:12.141 --> 01:51:15.770
<v Speaker 2>ups and downs and success of course with the world records and things I have,</v>

4604
01:51:15.771 --> 01:51:19.220
<v Speaker 2>but to really take stock of what's important to me and what I've realized more</v>

4605
01:51:19.221 --> 01:51:23.150
<v Speaker 2>and more is I'm super curious about pushing the limits of my own potential</v>

4606
01:51:23.151 --> 01:51:24.680
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent we've talked about that.</v>

4607
01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:25.513
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

4608
01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:28.820
<v Speaker 2>But I actually don't think of myself so much as a risk taker or an adrenaline</v>

4609
01:51:28.821 --> 01:51:30.760
<v Speaker 2>junkie when say serious.</v>

4610
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:32.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just bullshitting.</v>

4611
01:51:32.721 --> 01:51:32.930
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

4612
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:33.231
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

4613
01:51:33.231 --> 01:51:34.011
<v Speaker 2>when I think about it,</v>

4614
01:51:34.011 --> 01:51:35.240
<v Speaker 2>like these things are,</v>

4615
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:36.860
<v Speaker 2>are really methodical.</v>

4616
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:37.723
<v Speaker 2>There's sign out,</v>

4617
01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:38.170
<v Speaker 2>know their,</v>

4618
01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:39.003
<v Speaker 2>their practice,</v>

4619
01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:39.611
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

4620
01:51:39.611 --> 01:51:40.760
<v Speaker 2>And it's not to say there's not risk.</v>

4621
01:51:40.761 --> 01:51:42.650
<v Speaker 2>You saw me trying to set up my tent that tent flies away.</v>

4622
01:51:42.651 --> 01:51:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm screwed.</v>

4623
01:51:43.491 --> 01:51:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm in a bad way.</v>

4624
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4625
01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:45.261
<v Speaker 2>what would you do?</v>

4626
01:51:45.261 --> 01:51:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Would you run after it?</v>

4627
01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:46.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4628
01:51:46.641 --> 01:51:49.880
<v Speaker 2>you'd sell no chance of catching up for that thing thing is gone.</v>

4629
01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4630
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.721
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4631
01:51:50.721 --> 01:51:50.921
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4632
01:51:50.921 --> 01:51:51.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4633
01:51:51.081 --> 01:51:51.561
<v Speaker 2>you hit the,</v>

4634
01:51:51.561 --> 01:51:53.240
<v Speaker 2>you hit the ejector button on the call,</v>

4635
01:51:53.241 --> 01:51:53.871
<v Speaker 2>the plane of hope,</v>

4636
01:51:53.871 --> 01:51:55.040
<v Speaker 2>they can find your type of thing.</v>

4637
01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:56.680
<v Speaker 2>And even that's like in our storm,</v>

4638
01:51:56.690 --> 01:51:58.370
<v Speaker 2>like that unlikely they're going to get there.</v>

4639
01:51:58.670 --> 01:51:59.271
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>

4640
01:51:59.271 --> 01:52:01.670
<v Speaker 2>what I'm honestly most excited about next,</v>

4641
01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:02.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4642
01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:02.631
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

4643
01:52:02.631 --> 01:52:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I have some other projects that I'm marinating in my mind.</v>

4644
01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Do I have other expeditions?</v>

4645
01:52:05.631 --> 01:52:05.871
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4646
01:52:05.871 --> 01:52:06.260
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

4647
01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:06.701
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

4648
01:52:06.701 --> 01:52:07.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4649
01:52:07.190 --> 01:52:09.380
<v Speaker 2>they're not fully crystallized enough to announce right here,</v>

4650
01:52:09.381 --> 01:52:10.071
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

4651
01:52:10.071 --> 01:52:10.491
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4652
01:52:10.491 --> 01:52:11.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4653
01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:11.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4654
01:52:11.301 --> 01:52:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I've got some ideas but more so like I'm excited about,</v>

4655
01:52:14.170 --> 01:52:14.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4656
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:15.470
<v Speaker 2>sharing what I've learned.</v>

4657
01:52:15.471 --> 01:52:15.861
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

4658
01:52:15.861 --> 01:52:18.560
<v Speaker 2>that wisdom meets high performance of actually having an ability.</v>

4659
01:52:18.561 --> 01:52:18.741
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

4660
01:52:18.741 --> 01:52:19.280
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

4661
01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:20.031
<v Speaker 2>when I started this,</v>

4662
01:52:20.031 --> 01:52:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

4663
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4664
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:23.780
<v Speaker 2>my friends following me on Instagram and I'm starting to have ability to share</v>

4665
01:52:23.781 --> 01:52:24.231
<v Speaker 2>this story.</v>

4666
01:52:24.231 --> 01:52:25.340
<v Speaker 2>People are asking for me to,</v>

4667
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4668
01:52:25.770 --> 01:52:26.391
<v Speaker 2>take interviews.</v>

4669
01:52:26.391 --> 01:52:26.491
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4670
01:52:26.491 --> 01:52:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing a book right now.</v>

4671
01:52:27.741 --> 01:52:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Lots of my learnings going into that kind of stuff of really,</v>

4672
01:52:30.141 --> 01:52:32.270
<v Speaker 2>really having an ability to pass this on.</v>

4673
01:52:32.271 --> 01:52:33.104
<v Speaker 2>Because for me,</v>

4674
01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:35.270
<v Speaker 2>as fun as it is for me to push my own limits,</v>

4675
01:52:35.271 --> 01:52:35.721
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

4676
01:52:35.721 --> 01:52:36.680
<v Speaker 2>what really inspires me.</v>

4677
01:52:36.681 --> 01:52:38.520
<v Speaker 2>What really fires me up is when,</v>

4678
01:52:38.521 --> 01:52:40.430
<v Speaker 2>when I get emails or notes from people like,</v>

4679
01:52:40.431 --> 01:52:41.090
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

4680
01:52:41.090 --> 01:52:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I watched across Antarctica.</v>

4681
01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been to the gym in five years.</v>

4682
01:52:44.121 --> 01:52:46.970
<v Speaker 2>And like I've gone every day since then or I'm trail running now.</v>

4683
01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Or like I started that business,</v>

4684
01:52:48.651 --> 01:52:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I never said I was going to star or whatever.</v>

4685
01:52:50.391 --> 01:52:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And so having an ability to have a moment in time when I can share some of my</v>

4686
01:52:54.081 --> 01:52:54.561
<v Speaker 2>learnings.</v>

4687
01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:54.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4688
01:52:54.771 --> 01:52:56.810
<v Speaker 2>with the world in meaningful different contents.</v>

4689
01:52:56.811 --> 01:52:57.080
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4690
01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.310
<v Speaker 2>that really excites me.</v>

4691
01:52:58.311 --> 01:52:58.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4692
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:59.870
<v Speaker 2>I love the opportunity to do that,</v>

4693
01:52:59.871 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

4694
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:02.060
<v Speaker 2>like for sure there's some other,</v>

4695
01:53:02.061 --> 01:53:04.070
<v Speaker 2>there's some other events on the horizon as well,</v>

4696
01:53:04.071 --> 01:53:04.910
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

4697
01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:05.361
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

4698
01:53:05.361 --> 01:53:07.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not just about one upping the next thing.</v>

4699
01:53:07.671 --> 01:53:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a,</v>

4700
01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:12.590
<v Speaker 2>a losing proposition in the long run of always trying to do the bigger,</v>

4701
01:53:12.591 --> 01:53:12.891
<v Speaker 2>badder,</v>

4702
01:53:12.891 --> 01:53:13.521
<v Speaker 2>craziest thing.</v>

4703
01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Because when the stakes are,</v>

4704
01:53:14.931 --> 01:53:15.471
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

4705
01:53:15.471 --> 01:53:17.090
<v Speaker 2>the razors line between life and death,</v>

4706
01:53:17.091 --> 01:53:18.380
<v Speaker 2>you keep one upping yourself enough.</v>

4707
01:53:18.381 --> 01:53:18.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4708
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:19.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

4709
01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't make it to the end of a long life,</v>

4710
01:53:20.781 --> 01:53:21.381
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

4711
01:53:21.381 --> 01:53:22.640
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not trying to have that be the end.</v>

4712
01:53:22.770 --> 01:53:22.951
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4713
01:53:22.951 --> 01:53:23.611
<v Speaker 6>it sounds like,</v>

4714
01:53:23.611 --> 01:53:25.380
<v Speaker 6>I know you've already broken world records.</v>

4715
01:53:25.381 --> 01:53:25.710
<v Speaker 6>You've,</v>

4716
01:53:25.710 --> 01:53:26.450
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

4717
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:27.090
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

4718
01:53:27.090 --> 01:53:31.290
<v Speaker 6>you're in this weird place where you've accomplished so much that in order to</v>

4719
01:53:31.291 --> 01:53:32.460
<v Speaker 6>accomplish other things,</v>

4720
01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.830
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to take it to the next level,</v>

4721
01:53:35.250 --> 01:53:38.010
<v Speaker 6>it really has to be truly life threatening.</v>

4722
01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any recommendations?</v>

4723
01:53:39.891 --> 01:53:44.891
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to come on the next one will say move into the next stage of life</v>

4724
01:53:45.651 --> 01:53:46.650
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't involve risky.</v>

4725
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.751
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4726
01:53:47.751 --> 01:53:48.650
<v Speaker 2>You seem like a nice guy.</v>

4727
01:53:48.651 --> 01:53:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anything to happen to you.</v>

4728
01:53:49.610 --> 01:53:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4729
01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Give me,</v>

4730
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:51.141
<v Speaker 2>give me some wisdom.</v>

4731
01:53:51.141 --> 01:53:51.741
<v Speaker 2>You've got a couple of,</v>

4732
01:53:51.741 --> 01:53:53.270
<v Speaker 2>almost a couple of decades on me.</v>

4733
01:53:53.271 --> 01:53:53.521
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

4734
01:53:53.521 --> 01:53:56.150
<v Speaker 2>if you were whispering in the ear of your 33 year old self,</v>

4735
01:53:56.151 --> 01:53:56.691
<v Speaker 2>how about this?</v>

4736
01:53:56.691 --> 01:53:57.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4737
01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:57.481
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

4738
01:53:57.481 --> 01:53:58.700
<v Speaker 2>you've had an interesting path.</v>

4739
01:53:58.701 --> 01:54:00.560
<v Speaker 2>If you're whispering in the ear of your 33 self,</v>

4740
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:03.530
<v Speaker 2>what would be some advice that you would give yourself that you'd be happy that</v>

4741
01:54:03.531 --> 01:54:05.360
<v Speaker 2>you lived out over the next 20 years?</v>

4742
01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4743
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:08.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean obviously life experience.</v>

4744
01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:10.270
<v Speaker 6>When you have life experience,</v>

4745
01:54:10.450 --> 01:54:11.530
<v Speaker 6>learn those lessons.</v>

4746
01:54:11.531 --> 01:54:12.760
<v Speaker 6>Become a better person,</v>

4747
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:14.200
<v Speaker 6>be better at communicating,</v>

4748
01:54:14.201 --> 01:54:15.520
<v Speaker 6>be better at everything you do.</v>

4749
01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:20.050
<v Speaker 6>But the problem with what you're doing and it's not a problem,</v>

4750
01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:20.780
<v Speaker 6>but in,</v>

4751
01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:22.120
<v Speaker 6>in this context,</v>

4752
01:54:22.210 --> 01:54:27.070
<v Speaker 6>is that you're pushing these incredible endurance records in nature and</v>

4753
01:54:27.071 --> 01:54:28.810
<v Speaker 6>particularly in cold weather.</v>

4754
01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:34.300
<v Speaker 6>And this is what's stunning about these things is that you're risking your life.</v>

4755
01:54:34.630 --> 01:54:35.441
<v Speaker 6>It's not that,</v>

4756
01:54:35.441 --> 01:54:36.910
<v Speaker 6>it's just difficult.</v>

4757
01:54:37.150 --> 01:54:40.720
<v Speaker 6>Like running in ultra marathon is incredibly difficult,</v>

4758
01:54:40.721 --> 01:54:40.901
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4759
01:54:40.901 --> 01:54:41.620
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

4760
01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:43.930
<v Speaker 6>But what you're doing is not just incredibly difficult.</v>

4761
01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:46.870
<v Speaker 6>You're doing it in these incredibly harsh environments and particularly in</v>

4762
01:54:46.871 --> 01:54:47.590
<v Speaker 6>Antarctica,</v>

4763
01:54:47.590 --> 01:54:49.930
<v Speaker 6>you don't have any relief.</v>

4764
01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:51.070
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing.</v>

4765
01:54:51.070 --> 01:54:52.000
<v Speaker 6>No one's going to help you.</v>

4766
01:54:52.001 --> 01:54:52.481
<v Speaker 6>Like you said,</v>

4767
01:54:52.481 --> 01:54:53.370
<v Speaker 6>your tent blows away.</v>

4768
01:54:53.371 --> 01:54:54.040
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

4769
01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:55.990
<v Speaker 6>you might very well be fucked,</v>

4770
01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:57.213
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4771
01:54:57.780 --> 01:54:59.320
<v Speaker 6>You are right.</v>

4772
01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:04.800
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what you could do that would one up that this is the problem is</v>

4773
01:55:06.041 --> 01:55:06.874
<v Speaker 6>like you're,</v>

4774
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000
<v Speaker 6>you're one up margin of error is you're in this very strange sort of</v>

4775
01:55:13.001 --> 01:55:14.020
<v Speaker 6>stratosphere</v>

4776
01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:14.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4777
01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Of one attitude.</v>

4778
01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

4779
01:55:16.530 --> 01:55:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's um,</v>

4780
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:18.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4781
01:55:18.211 --> 01:55:21.000
<v Speaker 2>we take a page out of the Bruce Springsteen glory days song and just,</v>

4782
01:55:21.001 --> 01:55:21.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4783
01:55:21.211 --> 01:55:24.000
<v Speaker 2>kick might kick my feet up and talk about the glory days for the rest of the</v>

4784
01:55:24.001 --> 01:55:24.600
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

4785
01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:25.920
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do that.</v>

4786
01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:26.940
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

4787
01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.111
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4788
01:55:28.111 --> 01:55:28.891
<v Speaker 6>don't listen to me,</v>

4789
01:55:28.891 --> 01:55:29.130
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

4790
01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:30.210
<v Speaker 6>Do whatever you want to do.</v>

4791
01:55:30.211 --> 01:55:31.200
<v Speaker 6>Obviously you're going to,</v>

4792
01:55:31.201 --> 01:55:32.100
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to listen to me,</v>

4793
01:55:32.101 --> 01:55:33.900
<v Speaker 6>but you could do,</v>

4794
01:55:33.901 --> 01:55:38.310
<v Speaker 6>you hit apply this sort of mental fortitude that you've demonstrated in this</v>

4795
01:55:38.311 --> 01:55:41.550
<v Speaker 6>ability to push the things you could apply it to anything.</v>

4796
01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:42.960
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have to.</v>

4797
01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:47.370
<v Speaker 6>This physical feats of risking death and in frigid cold temperatures in the</v>

4798
01:55:47.371 --> 01:55:51.540
<v Speaker 6>middle of the fucking nowhere are literally at the bottom of the planet earth</v>

4799
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:52.491
<v Speaker 2>that I know and,</v>

4800
01:55:52.491 --> 01:55:53.201
<v Speaker 2>and that's to me,</v>

4801
01:55:53.201 --> 01:55:54.034
<v Speaker 2>that's actually,</v>

4802
01:55:54.190 --> 01:55:55.840
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's exciting because for me,</v>

4803
01:55:56.290 --> 01:55:56.711
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

4804
01:55:56.711 --> 01:56:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Are there some other physical expression that I want to have in the world?</v>

4805
01:56:00.250 --> 01:56:00.731
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

4806
01:56:00.731 --> 01:56:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I know I have some ideas like I said,</v>

4807
01:56:02.590 --> 01:56:02.801
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4808
01:56:02.801 --> 01:56:04.900
<v Speaker 2>and it's not necessarily trying to one up the next thing,</v>

4809
01:56:04.901 --> 01:56:07.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's also why it's exciting to me.</v>

4810
01:56:07.330 --> 01:56:09.940
<v Speaker 2>The lessons that I try to learn that I try to share with other people,</v>

4811
01:56:09.941 --> 01:56:10.391
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

4812
01:56:10.391 --> 01:56:11.530
<v Speaker 2>our universal lessons,</v>

4813
01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:12.101
<v Speaker 2>but they also,</v>

4814
01:56:12.101 --> 01:56:15.970
<v Speaker 2>if I referred them back to my own self are also universal lessons in my own</v>

4815
01:56:15.971 --> 01:56:16.271
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

4816
01:56:16.271 --> 01:56:16.781
<v Speaker 2>So like you said,</v>

4817
01:56:16.781 --> 01:56:17.021
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

4818
01:56:17.021 --> 01:56:17.231
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4819
01:56:17.231 --> 01:56:19.390
<v Speaker 2>like what's the next thing I'm super passionate about?</v>

4820
01:56:19.391 --> 01:56:19.571
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

4821
01:56:19.571 --> 01:56:23.110
<v Speaker 2>I have the confidence to sit with a white board with no money,</v>

4822
01:56:23.111 --> 01:56:23.861
<v Speaker 2>no resources,</v>

4823
01:56:23.861 --> 01:56:24.521
<v Speaker 2>no background,</v>

4824
01:56:24.521 --> 01:56:28.480
<v Speaker 2>and incredibly supportive fiance at the time now wife who's like down to like</v>

4825
01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:31.090
<v Speaker 2>ride or die with me and go into this with me like,</v>

4826
01:56:31.330 --> 01:56:32.410
<v Speaker 2>and we created what we did.</v>

4827
01:56:32.410 --> 01:56:34.660
<v Speaker 2>We did something that people literally wrote about and said,</v>

4828
01:56:34.661 --> 01:56:35.500
<v Speaker 2>this is impossible.</v>

4829
01:56:35.501 --> 01:56:36.540
<v Speaker 2>People have died trying this.</v>

4830
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:37.930
<v Speaker 2>You can't do this and we've achieved it.</v>

4831
01:56:38.110 --> 01:56:39.010
<v Speaker 2>It gives me confidence,</v>

4832
01:56:39.011 --> 01:56:41.050
<v Speaker 2>not that I can do some other crazy physical thing,</v>

4833
01:56:41.051 --> 01:56:42.070
<v Speaker 2>but it gives me confidence like cool.</v>

4834
01:56:42.071 --> 01:56:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to start off,</v>

4835
01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I want to start a business that makes millions of dollars,</v>

4836
01:56:45.161 --> 01:56:45.581
<v Speaker 2>like cool.</v>

4837
01:56:45.581 --> 01:56:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Like let's figure out how to do that.</v>

4838
01:56:46.901 --> 01:56:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

4839
01:56:47.110 --> 01:56:48.820
<v Speaker 2>let's do the equivalent of writing into Google.</v>

4840
01:56:48.821 --> 01:56:50.560
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between PR and marketing?</v>

4841
01:56:50.561 --> 01:56:50.801
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4842
01:56:50.801 --> 01:56:51.820
<v Speaker 2>like let's do that.</v>

4843
01:56:51.821 --> 01:56:52.330
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4844
01:56:52.330 --> 01:56:52.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4845
01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:53.650
<v Speaker 2>as I,</v>

4846
01:56:53.650 --> 01:56:54.041
<v Speaker 2>as I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4848
01:56:54.311 --> 01:56:56.140
<v Speaker 2>do a ton of public speaking now write this book,</v>

4849
01:56:56.141 --> 01:56:59.170
<v Speaker 2>the things are things that I'm doing that's super fun to share those with the</v>

4850
01:56:59.171 --> 01:56:59.501
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

4851
01:56:59.501 --> 01:57:02.830
<v Speaker 2>So I'm having a lot of fun doing that and actually sharing the universal truths</v>

4852
01:57:02.831 --> 01:57:05.800
<v Speaker 2>and the wisdom that I've learned that I think can it be applied different ways.</v>

4853
01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.700
<v Speaker 2>But it also goes to now I get to have the fun of applying those in all of those</v>

4854
01:57:09.701 --> 01:57:11.680
<v Speaker 2>other different ways of my life.</v>

4855
01:57:11.681 --> 01:57:12.340
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

4856
01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:12.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4857
01:57:12.581 --> 01:57:12.971
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

4858
01:57:12.971 --> 01:57:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that the,</v>

4859
01:57:13.850 --> 01:57:14.211
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4860
01:57:14.211 --> 01:57:15.400
<v Speaker 2>the future is bright,</v>

4861
01:57:15.401 --> 01:57:16.390
<v Speaker 2>particularly if I don't,</v>

4862
01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think of myself as this endemic core outdoor athlete.</v>

4863
01:57:20.351 --> 01:57:22.060
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy to put me in that box.</v>

4864
01:57:22.061 --> 01:57:23.200
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy to say like,</v>

4865
01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:23.771
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

4866
01:57:23.771 --> 01:57:24.640
<v Speaker 2>so you climb mountains,</v>

4867
01:57:24.641 --> 01:57:26.440
<v Speaker 2>you're a mountain climber was like before years ago,</v>

4868
01:57:26.441 --> 01:57:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I had never really climbed mountains,</v>

4869
01:57:27.551 --> 01:57:28.870
<v Speaker 2>but I happen to do something about it.</v>

4870
01:57:28.871 --> 01:57:30.100
<v Speaker 2>So I've never been in the polar region.</v>

4871
01:57:30.101 --> 01:57:32.260
<v Speaker 2>That's why this British guy was looking at me like,</v>

4872
01:57:32.290 --> 01:57:32.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4873
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Hahaha,</v>

4874
01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:33.791
<v Speaker 2>young boy,</v>

4875
01:57:33.791 --> 01:57:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I've spent all this time in an article.</v>

4876
01:57:35.201 --> 01:57:36.160
<v Speaker 2>You'll never survive this.</v>

4877
01:57:36.161 --> 01:57:36.670
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

4878
01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:37.570
<v Speaker 2>not only just survive it,</v>

4879
01:57:37.571 --> 01:57:38.620
<v Speaker 2>but like I finished first,</v>

4880
01:57:38.621 --> 01:57:39.454
<v Speaker 2>like I beat him,</v>

4881
01:57:39.610 --> 01:57:41.680
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not beat them by two and a half days.</v>

4882
01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:43.973
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4883
01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:44.740
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

4884
01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sitting here going like,</v>

4885
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:46.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4886
01:57:46.091 --> 01:57:47.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by Antarctica.</v>

4887
01:57:47.171 --> 01:57:48.230
<v Speaker 2>What I like to go back someday.</v>

4888
01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:48.761
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

4889
01:57:48.761 --> 01:57:52.060
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not like calling a Brady the polar explorer only,</v>

4890
01:57:52.061 --> 01:57:52.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4891
01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:52.810
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

4892
01:57:52.810 --> 01:57:55.390
<v Speaker 2>what else can I explore that actually presses me?</v>

4893
01:57:55.391 --> 01:57:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4894
01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I love to learn.</v>

4895
01:57:56.681 --> 01:57:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I love to learn about the mind,</v>

4896
01:57:58.001 --> 01:57:58.900
<v Speaker 2>explore that.</v>

4897
01:57:58.930 --> 01:57:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4898
01:57:59.230 --> 01:58:01.120
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different ways to express that,</v>

4899
01:58:01.121 --> 01:58:04.180
<v Speaker 2>that I'm just excited for what the future holds in lots of different verticals.</v>

4900
01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:04.901
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4901
01:58:04.901 --> 01:58:05.201
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

4902
01:58:05.201 --> 01:58:07.030
<v Speaker 6>I think you could fucking do anything.</v>

4903
01:58:07.090 --> 01:58:10.450
<v Speaker 6>I think it's very clear what you've already accomplished.</v>

4904
01:58:10.451 --> 01:58:12.550
<v Speaker 6>You could literally do anything you want,</v>

4905
01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.110
<v Speaker 6>but I want to,</v>

4906
01:58:14.110 --> 01:58:15.340
<v Speaker 6>I want to see you live.</v>

4907
01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:15.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4908
01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:16.393
<v Speaker 6>me too.</v>

4909
01:58:16.810 --> 01:58:17.643
<v Speaker 6>How about this?</v>

4910
01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:22.800
<v Speaker 6>How about you break some crazy endurance running feats about that ultra marathon</v>

4911
01:58:23.470 --> 01:58:24.670
<v Speaker 6>because it feels a little bit safer.</v>

4912
01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:28.510
<v Speaker 6>The worst thing's going to happen to you to get really fucking tired.</v>

4913
01:58:28.710 --> 01:58:29.543
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

4914
01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:30.910
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

4915
01:58:30.910 --> 01:58:31.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe the next thing is,</v>

4916
01:58:31.991 --> 01:58:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe I'm not the funniest guy in the world.</v>

4917
01:58:33.521 --> 01:58:34.390
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about comedy?</v>

4918
01:58:34.391 --> 01:58:34.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4919
01:58:34.571 --> 01:58:35.351
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a big piece,</v>

4920
01:58:35.351 --> 01:58:35.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4921
01:58:35.621 --> 01:58:37.150
<v Speaker 2>should I get back out there on the stage?</v>

4922
01:58:37.190 --> 01:58:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

4923
01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:39.680
<v Speaker 6>if you can communicate and you can make people laugh,</v>

4924
01:58:39.710 --> 01:58:41.050
<v Speaker 6>you can make a group of people laugh.</v>

4925
01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:42.190
<v Speaker 6>Could do stand up comedy.</v>

4926
01:58:42.191 --> 01:58:46.000
<v Speaker 6>It's just a matter of taking steps and figuring it out and writing stuff out.</v>

4927
01:58:46.001 --> 01:58:46.811
<v Speaker 6>And I mean,</v>

4928
01:58:46.811 --> 01:58:50.110
<v Speaker 6>you've got all a lot of fucking stories for sure.</v>

4929
01:58:50.111 --> 01:58:50.351
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4930
01:58:50.351 --> 01:58:52.990
<v Speaker 6>I mean just how about getting on stage in front of people and telling people</v>

4931
01:58:52.991 --> 01:58:57.130
<v Speaker 6>that you're the first person that cross and article on foot 52 days?</v>

4932
01:58:57.131 --> 01:58:58.210
<v Speaker 6>Like what in the fuck.</v>

4933
01:58:58.320 --> 01:58:59.400
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of that.</v>

4934
01:58:59.401 --> 01:59:00.091
<v Speaker 2>I did enjoy that.</v>

4935
01:59:00.091 --> 01:59:01.230
<v Speaker 2>I love public speaking.</v>

4936
01:59:01.231 --> 01:59:02.041
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of that.</v>

4937
01:59:02.041 --> 01:59:02.821
<v Speaker 2>Corporations,</v>

4938
01:59:02.821 --> 01:59:03.130
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

4939
01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:03.740
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

4940
01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:04.530
<v Speaker 2>That's too easy.</v>

4941
01:59:04.530 --> 01:59:04.651
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4942
01:59:04.651 --> 01:59:05.071
<v Speaker 2>trust me,</v>

4943
01:59:05.071 --> 01:59:05.904
<v Speaker 2>I do it.</v>

4944
01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:06.571
<v Speaker 2>You could do that.</v>

4945
01:59:06.571 --> 01:59:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4946
01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:07.260
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

4947
01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:07.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4948
01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I have to say I gotta give a shout out.</v>

4949
01:59:09.210 --> 01:59:10.350
<v Speaker 2>You definitely don't remember this,</v>

4950
01:59:10.351 --> 01:59:14.280
<v Speaker 2>but I actually have met you once before about seven years ago in a tiny little</v>

4951
01:59:14.281 --> 01:59:15.120
<v Speaker 2>comedy club.</v>

4952
01:59:15.330 --> 01:59:18.000
<v Speaker 2>You did a bit out in Portland of small little venue.</v>

4953
01:59:18.001 --> 01:59:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you do way bigger venues now called the helium.</v>

4954
01:59:20.911 --> 01:59:21.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4955
01:59:21.121 --> 01:59:21.651
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

4956
01:59:21.651 --> 01:59:22.200
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

4957
01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:22.891
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

4958
01:59:22.891 --> 01:59:23.940
<v Speaker 2>at the time it was funny,</v>

4959
01:59:23.941 --> 01:59:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about when I was driving over,</v>

4960
01:59:25.141 --> 01:59:25.441
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4961
01:59:25.441 --> 01:59:25.621
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

4962
01:59:25.621 --> 01:59:26.101
<v Speaker 2>what's this bit?</v>

4963
01:59:26.101 --> 01:59:27.870
<v Speaker 2>And you were doing this bit about,</v>

4964
01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:29.550
<v Speaker 2>hey there Delilah.</v>

4965
01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Was that like a damn,</v>

4966
01:59:31.201 --> 01:59:32.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a long time ago.</v>

4967
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4968
01:59:34.111 --> 01:59:34.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what I most remember it.</v>

4969
01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:36.900
<v Speaker 2>But the reason I was there actually was,</v>

4970
01:59:36.901 --> 01:59:37.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4971
01:59:37.530 --> 01:59:39.510
<v Speaker 2>when I first started training for triathlon,</v>

4972
01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:39.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4973
01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:40.351
<v Speaker 2>professionally,</v>

4974
01:59:40.351 --> 01:59:42.960
<v Speaker 2>I started training with this guy named Phil Claude,</v>

4975
01:59:42.961 --> 01:59:44.940
<v Speaker 2>who was training a couple of UFC fighters that time.</v>

4976
01:59:44.941 --> 01:59:48.690
<v Speaker 2>You remember Mike Pierce who fought in this local guy,</v>

4977
01:59:48.990 --> 01:59:50.190
<v Speaker 2>poor guy as well.</v>

4978
01:59:50.191 --> 01:59:52.090
<v Speaker 2>And so I didn't know a lot about MMA.</v>

4979
01:59:52.091 --> 01:59:52.801
<v Speaker 2>I still certainly,</v>

4980
01:59:52.801 --> 01:59:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as well versed as you are,</v>

4981
01:59:54.181 --> 01:59:54.991
<v Speaker 2>but I got in this gym,</v>

4982
01:59:54.991 --> 01:59:55.591
<v Speaker 2>my coach was like,</v>

4983
01:59:55.591 --> 01:59:55.741
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4984
01:59:55.741 --> 01:59:57.390
<v Speaker 2>you're going to start training with these MMA guys.</v>

4985
01:59:57.391 --> 01:59:57.930
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

4986
01:59:57.930 --> 01:59:58.681
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

4987
01:59:58.681 --> 01:59:58.801
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4988
01:59:58.801 --> 02:00:00.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm a skinny little triathlete.</v>

4989
02:00:00.121 --> 02:00:01.020
<v Speaker 2>These guys are like,</v>

4990
02:00:01.021 --> 02:00:01.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4991
02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:02.820
<v Speaker 2>brawlers but I was,</v>

4992
02:00:02.850 --> 02:00:03.100
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4993
02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:03.921
<v Speaker 2>what does I impressed?</v>

4994
02:00:03.921 --> 02:00:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Like talk about a multisport true multisport,</v>

4995
02:00:06.151 --> 02:00:06.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4996
02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.470
<v Speaker 2>And all the different disciplines.</v>

4997
02:00:07.471 --> 02:00:08.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to tell you this obviously,</v>

4998
02:00:08.671 --> 02:00:10.800
<v Speaker 2>but I was blown away by how strong the word became.</v>

4999
02:00:10.801 --> 02:00:11.281
<v Speaker 2>Good buddies.</v>

5000
02:00:11.281 --> 02:00:12.031
<v Speaker 2>And Mike said to me,</v>

5001
02:00:12.031 --> 02:00:12.540
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

5002
02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:12.931
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

5003
02:00:12.931 --> 02:00:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to this comedy show.</v>

5004
02:00:14.161 --> 02:00:16.920
<v Speaker 2>This guy named Joe Rogan is going to be doing his comedy calm,</v>

5005
02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:18.031
<v Speaker 2>listen to him.</v>

5006
02:00:18.031 --> 02:00:18.361
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5007
02:00:18.361 --> 02:00:19.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5008
02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:19.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5009
02:00:19.351 --> 02:00:20.520
<v Speaker 2>you made me laugh back then.</v>

5010
02:00:20.521 --> 02:00:20.881
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5011
02:00:20.881 --> 02:00:21.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5012
02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:22.390
<v Speaker 2>mad respect and uh,</v>

5013
02:00:22.391 --> 02:00:22.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5014
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.761
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

5015
02:00:22.761 --> 02:00:23.281
<v Speaker 2>it was a fun,</v>

5016
02:00:23.281 --> 02:00:24.570
<v Speaker 2>fun to see into that world a little bit.</v>

5017
02:00:24.710 --> 02:00:25.131
<v Speaker 6>Thanks man.</v>

5018
02:00:25.131 --> 02:00:26.480
<v Speaker 6>I guarantee you could do that,</v>

5019
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:30.830
<v Speaker 6>but if you still want to do endurance things like please do something where</v>

5020
02:00:30.831 --> 02:00:31.640
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to die.</v>

5021
02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:32.473
<v Speaker 6>That's all right.</v>

5022
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5023
02:00:33.810 --> 02:00:34.601
<v Speaker 2>I made it back.</v>

5024
02:00:34.601 --> 02:00:35.440
<v Speaker 2>You're safe at salad.</v>

5025
02:00:35.441 --> 02:00:35.651
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

5026
02:00:35.651 --> 02:00:36.041
<v Speaker 2>the goal,</v>

5027
02:00:36.041 --> 02:00:36.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5028
02:00:36.311 --> 02:00:36.761
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

5029
02:00:36.761 --> 02:00:38.410
<v Speaker 2>the goal was not to keep one upping myself.</v>

5030
02:00:38.650 --> 02:00:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that's a</v>

5031
02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:43.230
<v Speaker 6>part of the danger of this kind of endeavor.</v>

5032
02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:44.160
<v Speaker 6>You means you,</v>

5033
02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.320
<v Speaker 6>you really have one upped me.</v>

5034
02:00:46.321 --> 02:00:48.150
<v Speaker 6>You've done some crazy one up in man.</v>

5035
02:00:48.630 --> 02:00:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

5036
02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:49.591
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

5037
02:00:49.591 --> 02:00:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I think that it,</v>

5038
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:51.450
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

5039
02:00:51.450 --> 02:00:54.870
<v Speaker 2>if I only thought of myself as a professional athlete and that was my identity</v>

5040
02:00:54.871 --> 02:00:55.591
<v Speaker 2>was tied up in that,</v>

5041
02:00:55.591 --> 02:00:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I think we see that across the spectrum of professional athletes in general,</v>

5042
02:00:59.170 --> 02:00:59.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5043
02:00:59.590 --> 02:01:00.570
<v Speaker 2>of people just going,</v>

5044
02:01:00.690 --> 02:01:00.901
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

5045
02:01:00.901 --> 02:01:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pro athlete and the second I'm not,</v>

5046
02:01:02.581 --> 02:01:05.580
<v Speaker 2>even if they banked millions of dollars as an NBA player or something like that,</v>

5047
02:01:05.581 --> 02:01:09.210
<v Speaker 2>their whole identity disappears with the feet of athleticism.</v>

5048
02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:12.270
<v Speaker 2>I read a really interesting article today that I was really compelled by</v>

5049
02:01:12.271 --> 02:01:12.601
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

5050
02:01:12.601 --> 02:01:16.050
<v Speaker 2>which was a story about Kevin Duran that was on espn.com this morning.</v>

5051
02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:19.620
<v Speaker 2>And it's about him and his business manager and a couple other guys that have</v>

5052
02:01:19.621 --> 02:01:20.640
<v Speaker 2>kind of gotten around him and like,</v>

5053
02:01:20.641 --> 02:01:20.881
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

5054
02:01:20.881 --> 02:01:23.130
<v Speaker 2>you're like one of the best basketball players in the world,</v>

5055
02:01:23.131 --> 02:01:23.964
<v Speaker 2>MVP.</v>

5056
02:01:24.090 --> 02:01:27.780
<v Speaker 2>But he's already thinking about all the various things that he's doing in his</v>

5057
02:01:27.781 --> 02:01:28.110
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

5058
02:01:28.110 --> 02:01:29.820
<v Speaker 2>And what I loved about that article was they were like,</v>

5059
02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:30.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5060
02:01:30.211 --> 02:01:32.910
<v Speaker 2>sports center back in the day used to be guys,</v>

5061
02:01:32.911 --> 02:01:33.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5062
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:34.051
<v Speaker 2>hitting home runs,</v>

5063
02:01:34.051 --> 02:01:34.680
<v Speaker 2>dunking basketballs,</v>

5064
02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.970
<v Speaker 2>which of course it still is that.</v>

5065
02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:37.410
<v Speaker 2>But they'll intersperse that with like,</v>

5066
02:01:37.530 --> 02:01:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Durant just made a,</v>

5067
02:01:38.710 --> 02:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5068
02:01:39.230 --> 02:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>venture investment in this company,</v>

5069
02:01:40.881 --> 02:01:44.420
<v Speaker 2>or like they're growing this watermelon water brand or they're this or that.</v>

5070
02:01:44.421 --> 02:01:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And so I think sports,</v>

5071
02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.870
<v Speaker 2>particularly with the growth of social media,</v>

5072
02:01:47.871 --> 02:01:48.590
<v Speaker 2>with storytime,</v>

5073
02:01:48.590 --> 02:01:49.131
<v Speaker 2>with media,</v>

5074
02:01:49.131 --> 02:01:49.701
<v Speaker 2>with content,</v>

5075
02:01:49.701 --> 02:01:51.710
<v Speaker 2>with all the other ways we can share the insights,</v>

5076
02:01:51.711 --> 02:01:52.880
<v Speaker 2>which isn't just the game,</v>

5077
02:01:52.881 --> 02:01:55.280
<v Speaker 2>which isn't just me and the arena pulling the sled,</v>

5078
02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:57.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually a way to connect with people.</v>

5079
02:01:57.081 --> 02:01:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Whether that's in the sense of Kevin Durant making incredible venture</v>

5080
02:01:59.901 --> 02:02:03.680
<v Speaker 2>investments in companies or that's with storytelling that actually reaches,</v>

5081
02:02:03.681 --> 02:02:03.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5082
02:02:03.891 --> 02:02:05.060
<v Speaker 2>universal truth with people.</v>

5083
02:02:05.061 --> 02:02:05.241
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5084
02:02:05.241 --> 02:02:09.050
<v Speaker 2>I've got a single mother from Nebraska reaching out to me and saying like,</v>

5085
02:02:09.051 --> 02:02:09.231
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5086
02:02:09.231 --> 02:02:11.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about mountains or the outdoors,</v>

5087
02:02:11.541 --> 02:02:14.630
<v Speaker 2>but like I'm going through some hard stuff like in the middle of the country.</v>

5088
02:02:14.630 --> 02:02:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Being a single mother in your story connects with me.</v>

5089
02:02:16.611 --> 02:02:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for giving me the inspiration to keep pushing forward.</v>

5090
02:02:19.101 --> 02:02:23.960
<v Speaker 2>So for me it extends beyond just this athlete in this arena because we have all</v>

5091
02:02:23.961 --> 02:02:27.260
<v Speaker 2>these other ways to storytell to create content to you know,</v>

5092
02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:29.330
<v Speaker 2>and be involved in businesses and things like that.</v>

5093
02:02:29.331 --> 02:02:30.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's where my mind's at next.</v>

5094
02:02:30.591 --> 02:02:33.830
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't fully crystallized into the most concrete of plans,</v>

5095
02:02:33.831 --> 02:02:37.070
<v Speaker 2>but the ability to explore all these different mediums and just having sort of</v>

5096
02:02:37.071 --> 02:02:40.190
<v Speaker 2>the sports be the catalyst for growth in that way is what I'm really passionate</v>

5097
02:02:40.191 --> 02:02:40.590
