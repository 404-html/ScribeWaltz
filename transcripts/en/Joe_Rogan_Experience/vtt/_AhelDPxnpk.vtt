00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:33.711
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

236
00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like if you,</v>

237
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.710
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go through with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for I feel bad for one way or the other,</v>

238
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:42.711
<v Speaker 1>either I feel bad for her because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>really is a man trapped in a woman's </v>

239
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 1>body and that must be really frustrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I feel bad for that.</v>

240
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.810
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>she's in this state of disarray where </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the option and you've got to go </v>

242
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.041
<v Speaker 1>through surgery and it just seems to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>like anybody that would need to do that </v>

243
00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:59.661
<v Speaker 1>for any reason just to actually change </v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to become something else and </v>

244
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:01.200
<v Speaker 1>become some different sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

246
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a deep dissatisfaction with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current life and you know,</v>

247
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 1>who's to say that maybe her solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't becoming a man to play rugby first</v>

248
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:13.080
<v Speaker 1>and then come back.</v>

249
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.080
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to know she's happier now mean </v>

250
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 1>that there'll be an interesting call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I knew a comedian in Seattle that</v>

251
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 1>was a man and became a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had the surgery,</v>

252
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.890

<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>

253
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.820
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hard on her.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Time to time.</v>

256
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>That's how she died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She fucked up.</v>

257
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 1>God was too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was at a club.</v>

258
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.800
<v Speaker 1>She fucking went down like a boxer named</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rita.</v>

259
00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking.</v>

262
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not joking.</v>

263
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>She used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to stay at brody,</v>

264
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:55.491

<v Speaker 1>at open mic and she had a womanly voice </v>

265
00:11:55.491 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>and when we were still on Nachos she'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>say pour them the fuck down.</v>

266
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 1>We would just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I robbed the bank.</v>

267
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 1>100 values from her and she put a gun to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my head.</v>

268
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 1>This bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was five foot two and she died maybe</v>

269
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:10.550
<v Speaker 1>two years after I moved out of Seattle </v>
<v Speaker 1>as brody when,</v>

270
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:15.630
<v Speaker 1>when she got she got the full operation.</v>

<v Speaker 1>part of the reason why he looked bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Michael bisping look good.</v>

349
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 1>He looks sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

350
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:12.770
<v Speaker 1>His standup was sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his conditioning sharpest.</v>

351
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Fucking his defense was sharp when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight went to the ground,</v>

352
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.300
<v Speaker 1>everything was good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

353
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.320
<v Speaker 1>he put it on mayhem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you saw like an evolution of him </v>

354
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 1>over the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.130
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see in the Jorge reverify,</v>

356
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.310
<v Speaker 1>see in this fight and the mayhem fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>really in the mayhem fight,</v>

357
00:16:31.311 --> 00:16:36.311
<v Speaker 1>you really see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's turned a serious fucking </v>

358
00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:36.311
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know Michael.</v>

359
00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:40.810
<v Speaker 1>But Michael Bisping's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I loved about the </v>

360
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.941
<v Speaker 1>fight after it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was upset at himself for the first </v>

361
00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:46.271
<v Speaker 1>round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he had this like flawless </v>

362
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:46.370
<v Speaker 1>performance and virtually shut out </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayhem,</v>

363
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the fight got stopped.</v>

364
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Once he got up to his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second round started,</v>

365
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.230
<v Speaker 1>he just shut him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just completely shut him down.</v>

366
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you see that you would think,</v>

367
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:58.910
<v Speaker 1>well he should be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't happy.</v>

368
00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:03.911
<v Speaker 1>And one of the first things he said was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was upset at his performance in </v>

369
00:17:03.911 --> 00:17:07.571
<v Speaker 1>the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't going to do if you ever fought </v>

370
00:17:07.571 --> 00:17:07.571
<v Speaker 1>the champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the first thing you said.</v>

371
00:17:07.571 --> 00:17:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So there's a guy who's not even not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulating them himself for,</v>

372
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this big rivalry with may hand.</v>

373
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 1>They went through a whole season of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate fighter together,</v>

374
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:19.991
<v Speaker 1>talk to all kinds of shit to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just fucked him up and he wasn't </v>

375
00:17:19.991 --> 00:17:21.160
<v Speaker 1>even being like congratulatory about it.</v>

376
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 1>He was concentrating on what he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do well,</v>

377
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.800
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to own them perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I see with him is his life</v>

378
00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:30.020
<v Speaker 1>has come full circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's come,</v>

379
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.660
<v Speaker 1>he's become completely moved his family </v>
<v Speaker 1>over from England.</v>

380
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 1>He's training down in Orange County.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his family with them,</v>

381
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:38.240
<v Speaker 1>which makes a big difference when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking training.</v>

382
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.660
<v Speaker 1>He already took the knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

383
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 1>he got that knock out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tennis and he caught himself,</v>

384
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:46.460
<v Speaker 1>found himself and he's ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's ready.</v>

385
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.510
<v Speaker 1>He's much better now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

386
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:52.511
<v Speaker 1>he's much better now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a better place if they say it's </v>

387
00:17:52.511 --> 00:17:52.511
<v Speaker 1>hard</v>

388
00:17:52.511 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 5>for a fighter to rebound from a loss </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

389
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very difficult.</v>

390
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can only imagine.</v>

391
00:17:55.261 --> 00:18:00.261
<v Speaker 5>I'm only speculating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but from what I've experienced watching </v>

392
00:18:00.261 --> 00:18:00.261
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

393
00:18:00.261 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 5>fighters will change from losses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Catch</v>

394
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.550
<v Speaker 1>fucking knock Gavigan tendus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll,</v>

395

<v Speaker 1>just getting beat up at the fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>pizza parlor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Changes a motherfucker want to knock out</v>

397
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 1>like that</v>

398
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.540
<v Speaker 5>came back strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dennis Kang and one of the big things is</v>

399
00:18:13.541 --> 00:18:16.450
<v Speaker 5>Dennis Kang caught him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember Dennis Kang tagged and with the</v>

400
00:18:16.451 --> 00:18:18.130
<v Speaker 5>right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dropped them a jumped on him,</v>

401
00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.920
<v Speaker 5>but he stayed calm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He used his guard,</v>

402
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.620
<v Speaker 5>he had a real good defensive guard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>locked them up.</v>

403
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.080
<v Speaker 5>And then the second run he beat the shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of him today.</v>

404
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.520
<v Speaker 5>Know people sleep on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's like I,</v>

406
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:34.901
<v Speaker 5>I see them sleeping on him and I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's because maybe you see a guy lose </v>

407
00:18:34.901 --> 00:18:36.370
<v Speaker 5>once and you think that's how the guy </v>

<v Speaker 1>himself for these fights.</v>

493
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.440
<v Speaker 1>So when it gets in like grueling fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the cost check five,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dehydration,</v>

<v Speaker 1>hydrate the fuck out of your body,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and I didn't weigh 1:40</v>

502

<v Speaker 1>for like a day.</v>

504
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd weigh in and I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rehydrate and fight that day.</v>

505
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 1>And I know what it feels like.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

657
00:29:17.241 --> 00:29:19.120
<v Speaker 3>because most of those trainees always </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the biggest fuck.</v>

658
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Tranny ain't going to have a two inch </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They always got a rope between their </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking legs.</v>

660
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:28.960
<v Speaker 3>So you don't think right there when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbed that laugh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

662
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.810
<v Speaker 3>I'd be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd felt like I was in danger because I </v>

663
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.810
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got tricked.</v>

664
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm getting tricked and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get tricked and all of a sudden the </v>

665
00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:40.570
<v Speaker 3>trick turns out to be a man.</v>

666
00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a dangerous situation when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>alone with a man.</v>

667
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.680
<v Speaker 3>So now you've got to wonder what the </v>

<v Speaker 3>You got to find out if that person just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up with a gun in your hand.</v>

671
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.840

<v Speaker 3>It's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can sell that in court.</v>

696
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.290
<v Speaker 3>I could sell that and caught a lumps.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Did he bring her home and shoot shooter?</v>

704
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.120
<v Speaker 3>If you shoot it within four or five </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>

705
00:31:22.121 --> 00:31:27.121
<v Speaker 3>this temporary insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of water is going to feel like </v>

<v Speaker 3>It might've been some sort of an assault</v>

710

<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the car as well.</v>

711
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 3>We don't know when he confronted them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could have been that the guy attacked</v>

712
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 3>him first and then he got pulled his gun</v>

<v Speaker 3>came back.</v>

717
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:54.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean all this guy had to do was pull </v>

<v Speaker 3>well now,</v>

732
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cops were the only ones that were able </v>

733
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:42.780
<v Speaker 3>to talk</v>

734
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and make a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right then they can be.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now you've got cameras.</v>

739
00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:49.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't do nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still.</v>

740
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me talk to you on this side.</v>

741
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:56.561
<v Speaker 1>It's a quarter to 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got this Puerto Rican chick that </v>

742
00:32:56.561 --> 00:32:58.691
<v Speaker 1>wants to suck my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She likes when I come over with my gun </v>

<v Speaker 1>We've got no paperwork here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

745
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he doesn't matter,</v>

747
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still have to account for a murder.</v>

748
00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:10.211
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with your theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'll have to account for a guy was </v>

749
00:33:10.211 --> 00:33:10.280
<v Speaker 1>shot a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>wrapped up.</v>

751
00:33:12.021 --> 00:33:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Are you thinking of with them and tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>the court the truth.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the strangest time in my life </v>

785
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:49.860
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like watching the government and </v>

786
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:49.950
<v Speaker 1>watching all these people scrambled to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get into position.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this feels so bizarre.</v>

789
00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I would see something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

790
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Like someone writing something down like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

791
00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:03.410
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to have the power to </v>

792
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:07.121
<v Speaker 1>kick people out of the country if </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another they do something to </v>

793
00:35:07.121 --> 00:35:07.121
<v Speaker 1>harm America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

794
00:35:07.121 --> 00:35:09.950
<v Speaker 1>you know how ridiculous that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's harming America.</v>

795
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:15.040
<v Speaker 1>They're coming up all these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy laws and the ability to detain </v>

796
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is really happening here?</v>

797
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's happening in America.</v>

798
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's happening is that </v>

799
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.880
<v Speaker 1>people are saying they're not happy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current government.</v>

800
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the only action that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the whole country.</v>

801
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:33.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's some fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing going on where we're being </v>

802
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.091
<v Speaker 1>constantly attacked by terrorists and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to figure out how to defend </v>

803
00:35:37.091 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and an ever changing world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's fucking terror attacks</v>

804
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.410
<v Speaker 6>and I don't say they're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're catching them all.</v>

805
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 6>I don't really think there's that many </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrorists out there.</v>

806
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:48.020
<v Speaker 6>I don't really think there's that many </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that fucking hate us and I think </v>

807
00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.811
<v Speaker 6>that number would be substantially less </v>
<v Speaker 6>if we weren't occupying another fucking </v>

808
00:35:50.811 --> 00:35:51.660
<v Speaker 6>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the bottom line is they're coming up</v>

809
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:53.650
<v Speaker 6>with all these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these does this,</v>

810
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.450
<v Speaker 6>these laws that are set up to control us</v>
<v Speaker 6>and to shackle us,</v>

811
00:35:57.451 --> 00:36:02.451
<v Speaker 6>to put us down in there protecting us </v>
<v Speaker 6>from what these laws are for what?</v>

812
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:07.910
<v Speaker 6>Where is this threat?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where's this threat in our country that </v>

813
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 6>you need to create these laws will.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only threat is to the power that be.</v>

814
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.120
<v Speaker 6>That's the only threat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The powers that be are the only ones who</v>

815
00:36:14.121 --> 00:36:15.570
<v Speaker 6>are being threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

816
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 6>It's not like we have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrorist attacks,</v>

817
00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:19.920
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a fucking.</v>

818
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.600
<v Speaker 6>That's a bullshit thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

819
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.000
<v Speaker 6>There's not that many fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrorists.</v>

820
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.710
<v Speaker 6>There's not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

823
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:36.981
<v Speaker 6>with band,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not doing this to protect us </v>

824
00:36:36.981 --> 00:36:36.981
<v Speaker 6>from terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're doing this to make it harder for</v>

825
00:36:36.981 --> 00:36:40.470
<v Speaker 6>people to get up and protest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what the fuck they're doing.</v>

826
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 6>It says this a spooky,</v>
<v Speaker 6>spooky time to watch this shit go down.</v>

827
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.480
<v Speaker 6>It's like this is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They warned us about the founding </v>

828
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:50.480
<v Speaker 6>fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is.</v>

829
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.390
<v Speaker 6>This is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Benjamin Franklin said,</v>

830
00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:53.850
<v Speaker 6>this is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like they predicted it.</v>

831
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.560
<v Speaker 6>They predicted that one day there would </v>
<v Speaker 6>become a point of ultimate corruption.</v>

832
00:36:58.561 --> 00:37:03.561
<v Speaker 6>You have to do everything you can and </v>
<v Speaker 6>keep these pieces in place in order to </v>

833
00:37:03.561 --> 00:37:03.561
<v Speaker 6>avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ultimately</v>

834
00:37:03.561 --> 00:37:08.200
<v Speaker 3>corruption is communist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To read deep communism is government </v>

835
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.400
<v Speaker 3>isn't three d water,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

838
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:24.870
<v Speaker 3>protecting us from how much money you </v>
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>

839
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.720
<v Speaker 3>Middle America running fucking scared </v>
<v Speaker 3>would see in the media running scared,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they really don't fucking know that.</v>

842
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.130
<v Speaker 3>They're scaring us into giving us us </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving up our rights.</v>

843
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want us to do,</v>

844
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.240
<v Speaker 3>give us our fucking rights by scaring </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

845
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't let me fuck an x ray,</v>

00:37:42.041 --> 00:37:44.350
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't catch a fucking whatever.</v>

847
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.120
<v Speaker 3>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always something.</v>

848
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:51.130
<v Speaker 3>These fall laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always fucking something every </v>

849
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:51.130
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

850
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that believe </v>

851
00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:55.810
<v Speaker 3>that the government would have tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a false flag event.</v>

852
00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the false flag event is an event that </v>

853
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.430
<v Speaker 3>like they'll do something on purpose in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to get us to realize,</v>

854
00:38:03.431 --> 00:38:05.710
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a threat we need to like beef up</v>

855
00:38:05.711 --> 00:38:07.510
<v Speaker 3>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's like shit that they've pulled</v>

856
00:38:07.511 --> 00:38:12.511
<v Speaker 3>since the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of people that don't </v>

857
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:13.780
<v Speaker 3>believe they can do that today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that it's too easy.</v>

858
00:38:13.781 --> 00:38:18.781
<v Speaker 3>The access to information is just too </v>
<v Speaker 3>easy to spread and that with the </v>

859
00:38:18.781 --> 00:38:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Internet it's so difficult to control </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

860
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.580
<v Speaker 3>They don't think they could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened to the occupy movement?</v>

861
00:38:21.581 --> 00:38:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I didn't believe I was still going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>when everyone,</v>

862
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.480
<v Speaker 3>olive garden they occupy or where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck are these people?</v>

863
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:33.870
<v Speaker 3>Where the fuck are they protesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>against American airline with a $20 </v>

864
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.900
<v Speaker 3>dollar luggages when people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American Airlines,</v>

865
00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 1>everybody's paying the 20 foot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>luggage were all these.</v>

866
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:43.651
<v Speaker 1>I don't think money would have occupied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's back Merrigan airline luggage </v>

867
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:51.841
<v Speaker 1>thing I can on every day for that fly </v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest or I fucking loved it.</v>

868
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I thought to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

869
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I think that all we got to do is bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways.</v>

870
00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Corporations back to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you want to open up </v>

871
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.530
<v Speaker 1>something of what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to open up one here too.</v>

872
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.400
<v Speaker 1>You've got to pay taxes for this one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then do whatever the fuck you want in </v>

873
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Beijing with Hindus or whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do.</v>

874
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's killed Middle America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've left Pittsburgh.</v>

875
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.720
<v Speaker 1>There's no more manufacturing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

876
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.510
<v Speaker 1>that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I want back.</v>

877
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can have some fucking job.</v>

878
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.470
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like ipods,</v>

879
00:39:23.471 --> 00:39:24.430
<v Speaker 1>like a or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>an iphone.</v>

881
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I would pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would pay like double the amount of </v>

882
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.260
<v Speaker 1>money for a Karma free iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was more,</v>

883
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:36.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that American workers is what it would </v>

884
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:36.300
<v Speaker 1>cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

885
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

886
00:39:36.551 --> 00:39:38.530
<v Speaker 1>here are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem with that logic,</v>

887
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.170
<v Speaker 1>the minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minerals to make those phones.</v>

888
00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:44.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to get an Africa and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen how they get those minerals.</v>

889
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

890
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.030
<v Speaker 1>that's at the end of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated shit that we have.</v>

891
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Technology at its root is a kid in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa working in a fucking mind,</v>

892
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.030
<v Speaker 1>pulling shit out of the ground with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of metal and a stick.</v>

893
00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

894
00:39:58.661 --> 00:39:59.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as,</v>

895
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.600
<v Speaker 1>as base as you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>child fucking slavery in Africa,</v>

896
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.750
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extracting minerals is super common.</v>

897
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:09.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

898
00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

899
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:15.151
<v Speaker 1>they had that advice special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they did on it when they went to </v>

900
00:40:15.151 --> 00:40:15.670
<v Speaker 1>the Congo and watch these guys and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

901
00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird to think that that's the only</v>

902
00:40:18.131 --> 00:40:18.940
<v Speaker 1>way you could do that.</v>

903
00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.150
<v Speaker 1>The only way you can get those minerals </v>
<v Speaker 1>is you've got to go there.</v>

904
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.240
<v Speaker 1>That's where they're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

905
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

906
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:28.900
<v Speaker 1>their sense of I want to have kids just </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have them doing chores because I </v>

907
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:32.140
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have a made in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like when I was young I had</v>

908
00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:34.240
<v Speaker 1>to like clean the living room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went to once a time.</v>

909
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of like having your kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a child labor,</v>

910
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're making them clean your house</v>

911
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.030
<v Speaker 1>chores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

912
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.040
<v Speaker 1>responsibility rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scrub bathrooms because kids have to </v>

913
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:47.650
<v Speaker 1>have responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to contribute.</v>

914
00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I am happy my parents made me do chores </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it taught me how to work hard.</v>

915
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Father taught me how to just hit it off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fucking work hard.</v>

916
00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I think my parents took advantage of me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was mowing lawns and shit and then</v>

917
00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking back on man,</v>

918
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I need that in my life right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to have kids just to clean this </v>

919
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.841

<v Speaker 3>Lindemann's fucking bathroom at my </v>

928
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:43.451
<v Speaker 3>mother's bar when I was sick and put ice</v>
<v Speaker 3>cubes in the fucking urinals and fucking</v>

929
00:41:43.971 --> 00:41:47.670
<v Speaker 3>stuck to the ice cube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't splatter back at you or is</v>

930
00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:52.671
<v Speaker 3>it just to make clay gamed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was an architect so most of my </v>

931
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:55.190
<v Speaker 3>jobs and I got summer jobs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was always on construction sites,</v>

932
00:41:55.430 --> 00:42:00.430
<v Speaker 3>so I've worked like real jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some real construction jobs and </v>

933
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

934
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.310
<v Speaker 3>after I graduated I had some that went </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the winter.</v>

935
00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:07.250
<v Speaker 3>We worked outside in the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you know,</v>

936
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:09.020
<v Speaker 3>it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are real jobs.</v>

937
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Those are my best days in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flat roofs back.</v>

938
00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:18.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the dead of the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day I took a shit in a bag and </v>

939
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:20.000
<v Speaker 3>crunched it up and gave it to one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>workers and told them it was a brown.</v>

940
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.330
<v Speaker 3>Like 10 minutes later he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this brown.</v>

941
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:23.760
<v Speaker 3>It smells like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're fucking.</v>

942
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.840
<v Speaker 3>I used to be a fucking roof and </v>
<v Speaker 3>estimating ruth.</v>

943
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:31.640
<v Speaker 3>When I got out of prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the halfway house.</v>

944
00:42:31.641 --> 00:42:36.641
<v Speaker 3>I was an estimator for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I started out as a fucking bloating </v>

945
00:42:36.641 --> 00:42:41.321
<v Speaker 3>the roofs in boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado in January and snow and you got</v>

946
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.990
<v Speaker 3>to get up there and shovel the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then cut it and throw it in and then.</v>

947
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.230
<v Speaker 3>Aw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geez.</v>

948
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.930
<v Speaker 3>We used to build Igloos to fucking put </v>
<v Speaker 3>rubber down on the roofs.</v>

949
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.370
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

950
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:57.371
<v Speaker 3>they work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about you still build </v>

951
00:42:57.371 --> 00:42:57.371
<v Speaker 3>Igloos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

952
00:42:57.371 --> 00:43:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's say you have to lay down a 40 </v>

953
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:03.380
<v Speaker 3>squares of rubber that day with </v>
<v Speaker 3>ballasted with rocks.</v>

954
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.160
<v Speaker 3>We would shovel the roof at after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking shoveling.</v>

955
00:43:07.161 --> 00:43:09.320
<v Speaker 3>We laid the insulation down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was snowing,</v>

956
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:14.590
<v Speaker 3>so three labors will be cutting the roof</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other three were building poles </v>

957
00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:18.491
<v Speaker 3>with a cover so the snow wouldn't land </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the insulation so we'd have to build </v>

958
00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:18.491
<v Speaker 3>shit when it's.</v>

959
00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:23.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a New Jersey and New York </v>

960
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:23.200
<v Speaker 3>City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the biggest metropolitan city.</v>

961
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 3>They get six inches of snow in the city </v>
<v Speaker 3>closes down.</v>

962
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:28.150
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was like blocking ice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>making like Colorado.</v>

963
00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.410
<v Speaker 3>They get a foot of snow and you're at </v>
<v Speaker 3>work at eight.</v>

964
00:43:30.411 --> 00:43:31.050

<v Speaker 3>I wasn't too good at stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always do the plows and I would just </v>

1113
00:50:05.151 --> 00:50:08.931
<v Speaker 3>take our fucking ski lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just take him to fuck off </v>

1114
00:50:08.931 --> 00:50:08.931
<v Speaker 3>because I had no choice.</v>

1115
00:50:08.931 --> 00:50:09.690
<v Speaker 3>I would just put my head down and go in </v>

<v Speaker 3>this was one of his eight houses and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would only use it one week a year.</v>

1160
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.540
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he wanted you to live in the house.</v>

1161
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:11.560
<v Speaker 3>So when he came to town there was no </v>

<v Speaker 3>that bad ass bitch.</v>

1261
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.320

<v Speaker 3>burt reynolds for awhile.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finance bitch.</v>

1264
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:28.270
<v Speaker 3>At that time with her brown and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>metcon,</v>

1265
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Charles Bronson was up there running </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit for awhile.</v>

1266
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:36.510
<v Speaker 3>When I first moved to Aspen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had Katie la was only one channel </v>

1267
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:37.360
<v Speaker 3>and all they did was play Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Majestic,</v>

1268
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:42.630
<v Speaker 3>isn't it hard to get into aspen though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the flying isn't a difficult </v>

1269
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:46.561
<v Speaker 3>flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they don't land in there at night </v>

1270
00:56:46.561 --> 00:56:46.561
<v Speaker 3>after 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

1271
00:56:46.561 --> 00:56:50.311
<v Speaker 3>They got strict rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now you could fly to aspen from la </v>

1272
00:56:50.311 --> 00:56:53.431
<v Speaker 3>direct real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the old days it was just Denver and </v>

1273
00:56:53.431 --> 00:56:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Colorado Springs or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>

1274
00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 3>like I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you fly into aspen as you're flying </v>

1275
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:01.501
<v Speaker 3>over woody creek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy that dumped his wife that </v>

1276
00:57:01.501 --> 00:57:02.980
<v Speaker 3>was a stewardess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he painted a finger on his roof.</v>

1277
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:07.270
<v Speaker 3>So when you fly over asking the daytime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always a roof the fucking finger</v>

1278
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 3>on it because his wife was a stewardess </v>
<v Speaker 3>for one of the airlines.</v>

1373
01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:32.891
<v Speaker 3>I listened to these numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was making $6 million every six </v>

1374
01:01:32.891 --> 01:01:36.971
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After two or three years he was making </v>

1375
01:01:36.971 --> 01:01:37.850
<v Speaker 3>so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a Jewish kid that went to Miami,</v>

1376
01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:43.010
<v Speaker 3>University of Miami to get a degree and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up hanging out with Cubans and </v>

1377
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.940
<v Speaker 3>Colombians and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made him a white guy.</v>

1378
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.070
<v Speaker 3>They just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to control the west coast.</v>

1379
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:48.650
<v Speaker 3>And he was making 6 million every six </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>

1380
01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't even can cleanse it fast enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he would come into your restaurant </v>

1381
01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:54.070
<v Speaker 3>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan,</v>

1382
01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give you 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>cash.</v>

1383
01:01:55.970 --> 01:02:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Call me when it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he would go to every restaurant in </v>

1384
01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:03.170
<v Speaker 3>this area and give him 25 grand and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>do me a favor.</v>

1385
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Call me when it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just going to come in and eat </v>

1386
01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:11.501
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just tell me when they're 25 grand and </v>

1387
01:02:11.501 --> 01:02:14.021
<v Speaker 3>the quicker the better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I come in here for three </v>

1388
01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:14.021
<v Speaker 3>hotdogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told me the 25 is gone,</v>

1389
01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:16.040
<v Speaker 3>you're doing me a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they busted him,</v>

1390
01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:19.440
<v Speaker 3>they just didn't bust him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you read the story that went to these</v>

1391
01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:24.441
<v Speaker 3>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that there's a movie that they </v>

1392
01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:24.540
<v Speaker 3>did years later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was his story where he had safe set</v>

1393
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 3>all the restaurants where you would come</v>
<v Speaker 3>to your restaurant.</v>

1394
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give you 25 grand a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They usually tell me when it's over,</v>

1395
01:02:30.931 --> 01:02:34.250
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to put a safe in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he started putting some.</v>

1396
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.330
<v Speaker 3>When the feds came up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found a million,</v>

1397
01:02:36.331 --> 01:02:37.420
<v Speaker 3>2 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these things.</v>

1398
01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.760

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:42.760
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

1400
01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.560
<v Speaker 3>They took them to Denver and Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The feds go,</v>

1401
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:47.670
<v Speaker 3>go back to the fucking house because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still another 10 million that we</v>

1402
01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:49.260
<v Speaker 3>haven't found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been listening to him.</v>

1403
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:52.710
<v Speaker 3>So they went back to the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't find it,</v>

1404
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.500
<v Speaker 3>couldn't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had hidden in a garbage can.</v>

1405

<v Speaker 3>morning and take his garbage and look at</v>

1408
01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:08.880
<v Speaker 3>the figures he would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did it from the scrapping.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

1485
01:06:36.041 --> 01:06:41.041
<v Speaker 1>Even possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens that just like covers </v>

1486
01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:41.041
<v Speaker 1>the house and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Die,</v>

1487
01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>you die because no left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're attracting like Tom and Jerry </v>

1488
01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>style where your windows shoveled out </v>
<v Speaker 1>away quick enough.</v>

1489
01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

1490
01:06:46.571 --> 01:06:47.490
<v Speaker 1>You Die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1491
01:06:47.491 --> 01:06:50.140
<v Speaker 1>You pretty much lived off of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in her house,</v>

1492
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1493
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even then you don't have any air </v>

1494
01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:55.770
<v Speaker 1>were where's your air coming in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get air.</v>

1495
01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:59.290
<v Speaker 1>You have to make like a pipe using </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks and then all that snow melts.</v>

1496
01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:01.960
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a fucking river that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to wash your house away.</v>

1497
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1498
01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Unless you start eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was in a really rural area </v>

1499
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:12.571
<v Speaker 1>where nobody lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why it's their subjects to </v>

1500
01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:15.271
<v Speaker 1>such giant snow dumps and they just had </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 feet like last week or so feet.</v>

1501
01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:23.310
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1502
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.470
<v Speaker 1>There's some spots in this world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are really hazardous.</v>

1503
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.470
<v Speaker 1>You could deal with some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing.</v>

1504
01:07:29.471 --> 01:07:31.000
<v Speaker 1>You live in California for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

1505
01:07:31.001 --> 01:07:36.001
<v Speaker 1>People completely forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They completely forget that there's </v>

1506
01:07:36.001 --> 01:07:36.910
<v Speaker 1>nature to consider like everybody's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out these last couple of days.</v>

1507
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:42.120
<v Speaker 1>The reason why this podcast started late</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because some truck flipped over on </v>

1508
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.220
<v Speaker 1>the highway because nobody knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive in the rain when it gets wet.</v>

1509
01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:48.130
<v Speaker 1>It's wet here and everybody just spazzes</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and on top of it,</v>

1510
01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:51.970
<v Speaker 1>the road is greasy as fuck because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it doesn't rain very often</v>

1511
01:07:51.971 --> 01:07:56.971
<v Speaker 1>when it does rain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it brings up all that oil from people's </v>

1512
01:07:56.971 --> 01:07:59.350
<v Speaker 1>cars and tires and all that and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that's on the car that everyone has</v>

1513
01:07:59.351 --> 01:08:01.810
<v Speaker 1>dirty cars or have film on the car </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1514
01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever rinses off as well.</v>

1515
01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:08.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wax and all kinds of other gem </v>

1516
01:08:08.731 --> 01:08:08.731
<v Speaker 1>challenged chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1517
01:08:08.731 --> 01:08:10.030
<v Speaker 1>but there were so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1518
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:15.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw God lose it last night and I was </v>

1519
01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>right behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got the here at 4:15</v>

1520
01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's a 25 minute ride from my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left at 3:00</v>

1521
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>on the clock as I was leaving and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow the whole way.</v>

1522
01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And then as I got closer to seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopters,</v>

1523
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.490
<v Speaker 1>helicopters don't show for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>

1524
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:31.690
<v Speaker 1>They show for something heavy duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a weird place.</v>

1525
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:37.450
<v Speaker 1>There's too many of us men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's too many fucking people living </v>

1526
01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:37.790
<v Speaker 1>in one place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all we need is one thing to go wrong.</v>

1527
01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1528
01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:43.451

<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit because right now </v>

<v Speaker 1>that that's worth it to me one way or </v>

1538
01:09:10.091 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 1>place like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it just makes life harder.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I fainted from reading.</v>

1554
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:46.500
<v Speaker 1>We've discussed this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The needles or the blood.</v>

1555
01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to the fucking statured will.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The sutures will include sutures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to put sutures in my knee.</v>

1557
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I fainted coming out from under my </v>
<v Speaker 1>titties.</v>

1558
01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:56.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got lucky.</v>

1559
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.950
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1560
01:09:57.951 --> 01:10:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I think I had an edible that day to last</v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

1561
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I smoked a little piece of hash and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>read fucking.</v>

1562
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I went online just to prepare for </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery and I thought it would tell me </v>

1563
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.941
<v Speaker 1>what vitamins to take and I'm reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this arthroscopic surgery and I </v>

1564
01:10:12.941 --> 01:10:13.460
<v Speaker 1>went fucking down on my fucking office.</v>

1565
01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:15.740
<v Speaker 1>What exactly are they saying is wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your knee?</v>

1566
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Meniscus tear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of arthritis and a little </v>

1567
01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:21.580
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The meniscus tearing.</v>

1568
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:25.410
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to extract the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they're going to clean up the Nunez</v>

1569
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.560
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1570
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:31.590
<v Speaker 1>That's not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like six weeks and you're pretty </v>

1571
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.590
<v Speaker 1>close to 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1572
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waited,</v>

1573
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I waited six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last time I did that and then was </v>

1574
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:40.781
<v Speaker 1>training six weeks later by Google </v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming right afterwards just to bike </v>

1575
01:10:40.781 --> 01:10:41.310
<v Speaker 1>is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swimming is.</v>

1576
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Swimming is decent cook too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I like about a bike is that </v>

1577
01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:46.450
<v Speaker 1>it's stationary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's constant.</v>

1578
01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:48.890
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry about side to </v>
<v Speaker 1>side motion and you're just,</v>

1579
01:10:48.891 --> 01:10:53.891
<v Speaker 1>you can just do it at a light pace where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stimulating the tendons and the </v>

1580
01:10:53.891 --> 01:10:58.241
<v Speaker 1>ligaments and the muscle tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not really taxing the knee </v>

1581
01:10:58.241 --> 01:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't do it hard.</v>

1582
01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.370
<v Speaker 1>It's basically your five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even.</v>

1583
01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Don't even start with dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1584
01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Start with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing a 45 on our load now.</v>

1585

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I'm just doing everything in </v>

1586

<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1587
01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.150
<v Speaker 1>You should get one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is fitbit?</v>

1588
01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:13.550
<v Speaker 1>You'll become addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It attracted.</v>

1589
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>We talked about</v>

1590
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.980
<v Speaker 7>this on the podcast today with most </v>
<v Speaker 7>people will know though,</v>

1591
01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 7>because we talked about it on the desk.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Squad one.</v>

1592
01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:19.950
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what it is,</v>

1593
01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:24.951
<v Speaker 7>it's this thing that you clip on and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>automatically tracks how many steps you </v>

1594
01:11:25.621 --> 01:11:27.360
<v Speaker 7>make.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How many stairs you walk?</v>

1595
01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.650
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it tracks,</v>

1596
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:33.651
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just like it's Bert Kreischer told us </v>

1597
01:11:33.651 --> 01:11:33.651
<v Speaker 7>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1598
01:11:33.651 --> 01:11:36.081
<v Speaker 7>He was the one who,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's the one that told us about it on </v>

1599
01:11:36.081 --> 01:11:37.881
<v Speaker 7>the Ice House chronicles and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so it's really neat is that it has like </v>

1600
01:11:37.881 --> 01:11:39.900
<v Speaker 7>a thing in it that you could also wear </v>
<v Speaker 7>when you sleep,</v>

1601
01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.080
<v Speaker 7>so it detects whenever you wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 7>so then it adds up how long you're </v>

1602
01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.950
<v Speaker 7>actually sleeping every night.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you'll be surprised.</v>

1603
01:11:46.951 --> 01:11:51.951
<v Speaker 7>You think like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh I got like 10 hours sleep when in </v>

1604
01:11:51.951 --> 01:11:54.111
<v Speaker 7>reality you didn't like half the time </v>
<v Speaker 7>you were still awake or you would wake </v>

1605
01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:55.080
<v Speaker 7>up and it's based on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1606
01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:57.330
<v Speaker 7>it detects like your heartbeat it </v>
<v Speaker 7>detects,</v>

1607
01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.330
<v Speaker 7>has a gyro stick open it or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck it's called,</v>

1608
01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:00.590
<v Speaker 7>where.</v>

1609
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.930
<v Speaker 7>So it tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it knows when you're walking and all the</v>

1610
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:04.800
<v Speaker 7>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1611
01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:09.801
<v Speaker 7>And then wirelessly broadcasts to this </v>
<v Speaker 7>website and it shows you in graphs like,</v>

1612
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:11.970
<v Speaker 7>like how much you did and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you try to,</v>

1613
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.610
<v Speaker 7>the more you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the more you are like a game,</v>

1614
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.770
<v Speaker 7>you try to beat it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like twitter addictive,</v>

1615
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.800
<v Speaker 7>like it's really interesting and I like </v>
<v Speaker 7>I just became friends on Bruckner </v>

<v Speaker 7>having a new facebook where it just </v>

<v Speaker 7>tracks your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your shit every night and I just did </v>

<v Speaker 7>like a big credible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1619
01:12:29.061 --> 01:12:31.120
<v Speaker 7>I did a little review it on that desk.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Squad dot TV and nurse links to buy.</v>

1620
01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.280
<v Speaker 8>I'll tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 8>bro.</v>

1621
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.520
<v Speaker 8>That new sleep apnea machine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they gave me the other one fucked up </v>

1622
01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.440
<v Speaker 8>that time to give me a new one where I </v>
<v Speaker 8>thought the old one was good.</v>

1623
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:40.900
<v Speaker 8>This new one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can take the card out,</v>

1624
01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:44.560
<v Speaker 8>put it into my computer and I could tell</v>
<v Speaker 8>you what nights I drank alcohol.</v>

1625
01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:49.710
<v Speaker 8>I don't drink alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can tell you that what nights I drank </v>

1626
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:49.710
<v Speaker 8>on because you can see it in your sleep </v>
<v Speaker 8>pattern.</v>

1627
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:54.750
<v Speaker 8>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I go from one to get one of these </v>

1628
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:56.720
<v Speaker 8>sessions and then the other thing it </v>
<v Speaker 8>tells you I can even tell when I smoked </v>

1629
01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.510
<v Speaker 8>a lot of weed that day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What was the difference?</v>

1630
01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:05.370
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 8>If I smoked too much weed and my wife </v>

1631
01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:05.370
<v Speaker 8>will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know you were snoring.</v>

1632
01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:07.260
<v Speaker 8>I went by ambulance at one and smoke 50 </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking join.</v>

1633
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:10.670
<v Speaker 5>That makes you snore more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something probably because you relaxed.</v>

1634
01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:13.630
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1635
01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:15.100
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're probably out there.</v>

1645
01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:41.650
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't even know the name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was trying to figure out if he should</v>

1646
01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:42.550
<v Speaker 5>have a theme,</v>

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.420
<v Speaker 5>and that podcast we had with Dane Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was amazing.</v>

1651
01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:53.870
<v Speaker 5>That was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that dude,</v>

1652
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:57.130
<v Speaker 5>Tj Miller apparently wants to talk to me</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

1653
01:13:57.130 --> 01:13:58.310
<v Speaker 5>I would talk to them about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1654
01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.260
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't hate that dude.</v>

1655

<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1656
01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1657
01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:06.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's a good idea to go on </v>

1658
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:09.211
<v Speaker 5>long rants about people working out </v>
<v Speaker 5>material that haven't been on stage for </v>

1659
01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:09.211
<v Speaker 5>a year though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

1660
01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 5>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just how feel,</v>

1661
01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:14.500
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joey,</v>

1662
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:19.530
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just checking on something which is </v>

1663
01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:19.710
<v Speaker 5>called listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1664
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it was about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>

1665
01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:26.021
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck if you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about everybody should bump Jane </v>

1666
01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.340
<v Speaker 5>Cook,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bumped them,</v>

1667
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:32.430
<v Speaker 5>dump,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bumped everybody at the laugh factory </v>

1668
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.830
<v Speaker 5>which happens on stage and while it does</v>
<v Speaker 5>happen all the time,</v>

1669
01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:34.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what I said to Dan really does stand</v>

1670
01:14:34.741 --> 01:14:39.741
<v Speaker 5>true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like really he doesn't have to do that </v>

1671
01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:40.120
<v Speaker 5>and it's a strong move to just come on </v>
<v Speaker 5>after everybody.</v>

1672
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.100
<v Speaker 5>It's a strong move to like let everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>else go on stage and then you go on last</v>

1673
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're the big star.</v>

1674
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:51.060
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like tell everybody like let them </v>

1675
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:51.060
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey Dane Cook is going to be on later.</v>

1676
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:52.460
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then these guys do their time.</v>

1677
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.520
<v Speaker 5>They will get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

1678
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.510
<v Speaker 5>it ain't that hard man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It ain't that hard to wait.</v>

1679
01:14:55.511 --> 01:14:58.570
<v Speaker 5>But it's a thing that we had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience where we're coming up.</v>

1680
01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:00.220
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a constant thing.</v>

1681
01:15:00.221 --> 01:15:05.221
<v Speaker 5>It always has been that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in La when a big guy shows </v>

1682
01:15:05.221 --> 01:15:09.541
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's Jerry Seinfeld or whoever </v>

1683
01:15:09.541 --> 01:15:09.541
<v Speaker 5>the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they show up,</v>

1684
01:15:09.541 --> 01:15:13.230
<v Speaker 5>they get on stage and part of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>thrill is that the audience members know</v>

1685
01:15:14.441 --> 01:15:19.441
<v Speaker 5>that if they come to the Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very likely one night that may be </v>

1686
01:15:19.441 --> 01:15:23.250
<v Speaker 5>Daniel Tosh or walk on walk on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if he's not on the schedule that </v>

1687
01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:24.850
<v Speaker 5>may be someone that you've seen on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll walk on stage and that's a part of</v>

1688
01:15:24.851 --> 01:15:25.420
<v Speaker 5>the thrill.</v>

1689
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.410
<v Speaker 5>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

1690
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:30.940
<v Speaker 5>the standup comic does the famous ones </v>
<v Speaker 5>in exchange,</v>

1691
01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:32.640
<v Speaker 5>they do these sets for free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1692
01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:37.650
<v Speaker 5>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for their ability to just go onstage </v>

1693
01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:39.810
<v Speaker 5>anytime they want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it does seem unfair to the people </v>

1694
01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:39.810
<v Speaker 5>that are coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I completely agree.</v>

1695
01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:40.220
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1696
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 5>it's unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no doubt about it.</v>

1697
01:15:41.681 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1698
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:44.830
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand,</v>

1699
01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.240
<v Speaker 5>I under,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand that the idea behind it </v>

1700
01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:50.240
<v Speaker 5>because every comic has had to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1701
01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:54.860
<v Speaker 5>I the only time I've ever bumped </v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody's when I show up the club and </v>

1702
01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:55.030
<v Speaker 5>then they asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you like to go on stage?</v>

1703
01:15:55.031 --> 01:15:56.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's not a big deal,</v>

1704
01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:58.360
<v Speaker 5>I'll go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to fuck anybody's night</v>

1705
01:15:58.361 --> 01:16:01.270
<v Speaker 5>up and then they'd go and check and make</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure everything's okay,</v>

1706
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.580
<v Speaker 5>but if there's any drama or bullshit at </v>
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

1707
01:16:03.581 --> 01:16:05.830
<v Speaker 5>I would way rather just go on last.</v>

1708
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:07.830
<v Speaker 5>Just put me on after everything's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

1709
01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.820
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't perform at the end.</v>

1710
01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:13.930
<v Speaker 5>Everybody is so terrified of someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong going on before them,</v>

1711
01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:16.180
<v Speaker 5>which is so silly because that's what </v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.900

<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck because I'm going to</v>

1719
01:16:34.901 --> 01:16:37.450
<v Speaker 5>get off stage and you're still going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be in the bar drinking.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Take that bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>break it over your fucking head so </v>

<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1823
01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:20.220
<v Speaker 5>you're not fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you fucking kidding me guy?</v>

1824
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:25.550
<v Speaker 5>You cannot do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's people that drink and don't </v>

1825
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.550
<v Speaker 5>say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's people that drink and giggle.</v>

1826
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:28.450
<v Speaker 5>That's just some people that some people</v>
<v Speaker 5>are not supposed to be.</v>

1827
01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:33.460
<v Speaker 5>I hope they recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most important thing is that they </v>

1828
01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.380
<v Speaker 5>recognize it because they think it's fun</v>
<v Speaker 5>until they see it,</v>

1829
01:21:34.381 --> 01:21:35.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fun to them.</v>

1830
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:40.700
<v Speaker 5>Like they just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how fun would it be if you stopped </v>

1831
01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:43.971
<v Speaker 5>being Joe Rogan and went into his face </v>
<v Speaker 5>for eight hours and then woke up with </v>

1832
01:21:43.971 --> 01:21:47.940
<v Speaker 5>fucking scars on your fucking pubic hair</v>
<v Speaker 5>on your face and a handcuff on.</v>

1833
01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.710
<v Speaker 5>It is amazing to me though when people </v>
<v Speaker 5>have such different reactions to certain</v>

1834
01:21:52.711 --> 01:21:53.910
<v Speaker 5>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1835
01:21:53.911 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 5>and that alcohol is really one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

1836
01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:59.580
<v Speaker 5>So it's like until I met Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't believe in blackouts.</v>

1837
01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.010
<v Speaker 5>I didn't believe it didn't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People tell me they blacked out,</v>

1838
01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.310
<v Speaker 5>like how convenient chips always tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>you that they suck your dick in your ass</v>

1839
01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.610
<v Speaker 5>all the next morning I blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

1840
01:22:08.611 --> 01:22:10.920
<v Speaker 5>You know what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My fucking ass.</v>

1841
01:22:10.921 --> 01:22:12.180
<v Speaker 5>Like a savage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

1842
01:22:12.181 --> 01:22:14.140
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember any.</v>

1843
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:15.450
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we did that.</v>

1844
01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.790
<v Speaker 5>Came on your fucking neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember?</v>

1845
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.350
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you speak in a rape man?</v>

1846
01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:21.540
<v Speaker 5>I saw that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The girl with the Dragon Tattoo.</v>

1847
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:24.450
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a bad ass bitch.</v>

1848
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that girl who plays it.</v>

1849
01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:28.040
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen her before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who she is,</v>

1850
01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:31.590
<v Speaker 5>but that girl can fucking act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a crazy movie,</v>

1851
01:22:31.591 --> 01:22:32.670
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whew.</v>

1852
01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:37.700
<v Speaker 5>There's some scenes in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It felt like a movie where they were </v>

1853
01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:40.551
<v Speaker 5>trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was in fact a book that they were </v>

1854
01:22:40.551 --> 01:22:41.160
<v Speaker 5>trying to condense down into movie form.</v>

1855
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 5>It was really hard because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously very,</v>

1856
01:22:43.111 --> 01:22:46.020
<v Speaker 5>very good located in involved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as you know,</v>

1857
01:22:46.021 --> 01:22:48.150
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't fail as a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking good.</v>

1858
01:22:48.151 --> 01:22:49.830
<v Speaker 5>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some bad ass scenes,</v>

1859
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:52.880
<v Speaker 5>but that check is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gina Carano movie.</v>

1860
01:22:52.881 --> 01:22:55.770
<v Speaker 5>No review.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard the reviews are spectacular.</v>

1861
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:59.190
<v Speaker 5>They said that rotten tomatoes gave it a</v>
<v Speaker 5>100 percent,</v>

1862
01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:04.970
<v Speaker 5>which is like nobody ever sees that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that it's temporary because the </v>

1863
01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:04.970
<v Speaker 5>cuts will come out and find out about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>asshole comes on as their shit all over </v>

1872
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:31.930

<v Speaker 5>created it,</v>

1873
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:32.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1874
01:23:32.321 --> 01:23:35.680
<v Speaker 5>he really knows what the fuck he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he really created this around her.</v>

1875
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:39.940
<v Speaker 5>You know of the world needs more ass </v>

<v Speaker 5>She's a bad motherfucker.</v>

1878
01:23:45.630 --> 01:23:48.080
<v Speaker 5>The Australian check with Kate </v>
<v Speaker 5>Beckinsale oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>bad ass bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That bitch is bad.</v>

1880
01:23:50.231 --> 01:23:53.130
<v Speaker 5>I've seen up close and personal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Toronto is so legit though.</v>

1881
01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.270
<v Speaker 5>Come around the world and you know what </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's like,</v>

1882
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:58.810
<v Speaker 5>really like now that Cyborg tested </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive.</v>

1883
01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:03.730
<v Speaker 5>It shows it shines a light on all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cyborgs,</v>

1884
01:24:03.731 --> 01:24:05.710
<v Speaker 5>past victories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you gotta you gotTa.</v>

1885
01:24:05.711 --> 01:24:06.580
<v Speaker 5>Look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1886
01:24:06.581 --> 01:24:10.030
<v Speaker 5>it's unfortunately cast doubt tasks down</v>
<v Speaker 5>in her old career,</v>

1887
01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:15.210
<v Speaker 5>especially since they released a video </v>
<v Speaker 5>that showed her first fight ever in her </v>

1888
01:24:15.210 --> 01:24:15.210
<v Speaker 5>first fight ever.</v>

1889
01:24:15.210 --> 01:24:17.140
<v Speaker 5>She was not built like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even remotely.</v>

1890
01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:22.280
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she changed and she changed pretty </v>

1891
01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:22.280
<v Speaker 5>radically and it doesn't seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>endogenous chemicals.</v>

1892
01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.550
<v Speaker 5>If you have an initial video of her from</v>
<v Speaker 5>a long time ago,</v>

1893
01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:26.860
<v Speaker 5>they chose a different body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different body types,</v>

1894
01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:27.910
<v Speaker 5>and that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1895
01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:28.760
<v Speaker 5>you're not a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1896
01:24:28.761 --> 01:24:30.070
<v Speaker 5>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How are you doing that man?</v>

1897
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:32.050
<v Speaker 5>So you've got to look at that man and </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

1898
01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:37.140
<v Speaker 5>this Gina Carano man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if she didn't know that would have been </v>

1899
01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.961
<v Speaker 5>imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gina Carano versus route Ronda Rousey </v>

1900
01:24:39.961 --> 01:24:41.860
<v Speaker 5>two of the hottest chicks to ever fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ever going at it.</v>

1901
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:45.530
<v Speaker 5>Do you know nuts that fucking fight?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would it be to stone cold?</v>

1902
01:24:45.531 --> 01:24:50.531
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna Hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the next one to tens that are </v>

1903
01:24:50.531 --> 01:24:53.311
<v Speaker 5>killers and they're throwing down Gina </v>
<v Speaker 5>Carano versus Ronda Rousey would get </v>

1904
01:24:53.311 --> 01:24:58.141
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like a fight that actually could </v>

1905
01:24:58.141 --> 01:24:58.141
<v Speaker 5>make it into the UFC.</v>

1906
01:24:58.141 --> 01:24:58.150
<v Speaker 5>Like that's a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're Dana white would be like,</v>

1907
01:24:58.151 --> 01:24:59.200
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>alright,</v>

1908
01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:04.740
<v Speaker 5>this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have this fight in the UFC is </v>

1909
01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:07.291
<v Speaker 5>like a special attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm just guessing it would do </v>

1910
01:25:07.291 --> 01:25:09.421
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would probably have like a big event </v>

1911
01:25:09.421 --> 01:25:09.421
<v Speaker 5>for strikeforce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

1912
01:25:09.421 --> 01:25:13.230
<v Speaker 5>could you imagine the kind of press you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can get when you get to chicks who are </v>

1913
01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:16.891
<v Speaker 5>super hot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who actually can fucking fight both of </v>

1914
01:25:16.891 --> 01:25:20.611
<v Speaker 5>them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She'll get the winter of those two </v>

1915
01:25:20.611 --> 01:25:23.530
<v Speaker 5>because it made sense to me today at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>movie did really well.</v>

1916
01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.150
<v Speaker 5>If she would have fought in June or July</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she wouldn't have done well then the</v>

1917
01:25:28.151 --> 01:25:29.140
<v Speaker 5>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

1918
01:25:29.141 --> 01:25:30.480
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stay away from everything.</v>

1919
01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:31.870
<v Speaker 5>Just let the movie come out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pop it.</v>

1920
01:25:32.050 --> 01:25:37.050
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden the fucking Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes up positive and she's back in the </v>

1921
01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:37.060
<v Speaker 5>fucking game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The movie big.</v>

1922
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.650
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's back in the fucking game now,</v>

1923
01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.870
<v Speaker 5>so she's going to probably get the </v>
<v Speaker 5>winter of tea,</v>

1924
01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:43.570
<v Speaker 5>take on a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1925
01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:44.870
<v Speaker 5>See what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would she,</v>

1926
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:47.660
<v Speaker 5>why would she want to fight if this </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie?</v>

1927
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:50.950
<v Speaker 5>Then she just goes off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1928
01:25:50.951 --> 01:25:53.200
<v Speaker 5>brain damages for keeps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't want to fight,</v>

1929
01:25:53.201 --> 01:25:54.450
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't be fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1930
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.730
<v Speaker 5>fighting is something you should only do</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you absolutely want to do.</v>

1931
01:25:57.731 --> 01:25:58.540
<v Speaker 5>Just that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If she,</v>

1932
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.580
<v Speaker 5>if she really has this call on the back </v>
<v Speaker 5>of her head,</v>

1933
01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:02.530
<v Speaker 5>she wants to get back in there and test </v>
<v Speaker 5>herself.</v>

1934
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:03.270
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's,</v>

1935

<v Speaker 5>kicked me in the stomach.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was only like 14.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just gave me a little little tap,</v>

2406
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:11.000
<v Speaker 5>but that was common,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>always be solid.</v>

2410
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:21.100
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the Koreans came over to teach tae</v>

2411
01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:23.010

<v Speaker 5>In the back of the legs if you get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Koreans were like super strict fluid </v>

2413
01:47:28.630 --> 01:47:30.090
<v Speaker 5>restriction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because of that there their team was</v>

2414
01:47:30.091 --> 01:47:31.470
<v Speaker 5>fucking monstrous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

2415

01:47:34.141 --> 01:47:36.930
<v Speaker 5>the real uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Americans got real good at it.</v>

2417
01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:41.930
<v Speaker 5>And then there was some other entries </v>
<v Speaker 5>from other parts of the world that were </v>

2418
01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:44.391
<v Speaker 5>like really high level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for awhile the Koreans just </v>

<v Speaker 5>You can't try out a friend.</v>

<v Speaker 5>My friend was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>took time off,</v>

2427
01:48:03.571 --> 01:48:08.571
<v Speaker 5>away from the school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was a big fucking deal because he </v>

<v Speaker 5>was going through like some serious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>serious fucking schoolwork.</v>

2429

<v Speaker 5>I couldn't believe how fucking hard he </v>

01:48:16.171 --> 01:48:21.171
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was really like inspiring because </v>

2433
01:48:21.171 --> 01:48:21.171
<v Speaker 5>this guy was always tired.</v>

2434
01:48:21.171 --> 01:48:25.760
<v Speaker 5>He was exhausted and yet he would still </v>
<v Speaker 5>find time to train and we were talking </v>

2435
01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:25.790
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2436
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:27.570
<v Speaker 5>back then he was a little bit ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

2437
01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:28.690
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2438
01:48:28.890 --> 01:48:32.940
<v Speaker 5>when I was hitting a national level of </v>
<v Speaker 5>my skills,</v>

2439
01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:38.090
<v Speaker 5>he was already there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he was like a little bit ahead of me </v>

2440
01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:38.090
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember talking to him,</v>

2441
01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:38.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are you doing this?</v>

2442
01:48:38.861 --> 01:48:41.100
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is incredible that you find time to</v>

2443
01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:44.910
<v Speaker 5>do all this school work and yet you </v>
<v Speaker 5>still find time to train.</v>

2444
01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:46.680
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I barely can do it.</v>

2445
01:48:46.681 --> 01:48:47.370
<v Speaker 5>I barely could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm so tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so tired.</v>

2447
01:48:48.961 --> 01:48:50.820
<v Speaker 5>He would like when he was training for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the nationals,</v>

2448
01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:55.940
<v Speaker 5>he would do his homework and then he </v>
<v Speaker 5>would put his backpack on with all of </v>

2449
01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:59.040
<v Speaker 5>his books and he would run up and down </v>
<v Speaker 5>the stairs in his,</v>

2450
01:48:59.041 --> 01:49:04.041
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in his dormitory where he stayed and it </v>

2451
01:49:04.041 --> 01:49:07.251
<v Speaker 5>was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how he would get like a lot of </v>

2452
01:49:07.251 --> 01:49:07.251
<v Speaker 5>his cardio training in it would just put</v>
<v Speaker 5>his books in his bag and run up and down</v>

2453
01:49:07.251 --> 01:49:07.380
<v Speaker 5>the stairs.</v>

2454
01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:09.870
<v Speaker 5>And he would tell me about like how </v>
<v Speaker 5>exhausted he was when he,</v>

2455
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:11.730
<v Speaker 5>when he would come to work out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>train.</v>

2456
01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:14.640
<v Speaker 5>But that fucking guy just kept chipping </v>
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>

2457
01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:16.890
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I learned a lot watching that dude.</v>

2458
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:21.920
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll learn that there's like levels of </v>

2459
01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:22.830
<v Speaker 5>commitment and discipline and for </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever reason,</v>

2460
01:49:22.930 --> 01:49:27.930
<v Speaker 5>a lot of Asian people instill that in </v>
<v Speaker 5>their children that like real intense </v>

2461
01:49:30.541 --> 01:49:32.020
<v Speaker 5>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2462
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:34.410
<v Speaker 5>proud of their kid when their kid </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes a doctor,</v>

2463
01:49:34.411 --> 01:49:36.630
<v Speaker 5>proud of their kid when the kid said </v>
<v Speaker 5>something really,</v>

2464
01:49:36.631 --> 01:49:38.810
<v Speaker 5>really difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>

2465
01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:40.140
<v Speaker 5>that's a mother fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2466
01:49:40.170 --> 01:49:41.400
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a to,</v>

2467
01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:42.880
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to have like that,</v>

2468
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:46.080
<v Speaker 5>that high expectations of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2469
01:49:46.081 --> 01:49:48.850
<v Speaker 5>you're really setting up for a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>stressful,</v>

2470
01:49:48.851 --> 01:49:53.851
<v Speaker 5>stressful life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I know he eventually stopped </v>

2471
01:49:53.851 --> 01:49:53.851
<v Speaker 5>competing because it was too much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2472
01:49:53.851 --> 01:49:55.510
<v Speaker 5>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he assumed his,</v>

2473
01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 5>his practice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2474
01:49:56.471 --> 01:49:58.990

2475
01:49:58.991 --> 01:50:00.700
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and studies to become a doctor.</v>

2476
01:50:00.890 --> 01:50:03.850
<v Speaker 5>And he got right back into that now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but became 100 percent of his focus.</v>

2477
01:50:03.851 --> 01:50:05.060
<v Speaker 5>But he did what he wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2478
01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:08.080
<v Speaker 5>he got there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he got where he wanted to get and then,</v>

2479
01:50:08.081 --> 01:50:13.081
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he realized his dream and that was just </v>

2480
01:50:13.081 --> 01:50:13.081
<v Speaker 5>back to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of work.</v>

2483
01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:16.930
<v Speaker 5>You don't look at the discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even with the Japanese,</v>

2484
01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:18.700
<v Speaker 5>with the Yakuza,</v>

2503
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:06.640
<v Speaker 5>but for me to cut a finger off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's just,</v>

2504
01:51:06.641 --> 01:51:08.680
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you do it with honor?</v>

2505
01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:11.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do it with like you come in and go,</v>

2506
01:51:11.501 --> 01:51:14.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry I fucked up out of my respect </v>
<v Speaker 5>for you.</v>

2507
01:51:14.411 --> 01:51:18.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to chop my fucking finger up </v>
<v Speaker 5>to my family.</v>

2508
01:51:18.071 --> 01:51:23.071
<v Speaker 5>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to a friend of mine who </v>

2509
01:51:23.071 --> 01:51:25.560
<v Speaker 5>had something going on where he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved with a bunch of a businessman </v>

2510
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:27.160
<v Speaker 5>and they.</v>

2511
01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:32.250
<v Speaker 5>One of them was this Japanese guy that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kept showing off the fact that his </v>

2512
01:51:32.250 --> 01:51:34.870
<v Speaker 5>finger was missing like cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would flaunt it.</v>

2513
01:51:35.170 --> 01:51:36.990
<v Speaker 5>The fact is in laugh about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fingers,</v>

2514
01:51:36.991 --> 01:51:41.991
<v Speaker 5>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>see that you see that like apparently </v>

2515
01:51:41.991 --> 01:51:43.750
<v Speaker 5>like I guess in Japan and must carry a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of weight.</v>

2516
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:48.830
<v Speaker 5>Someone sees someone sees you with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>finger that you probably chopped off </v>

2517
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:52.561
<v Speaker 5>yourself like Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy's willing to take shit to a </v>

2518
01:51:52.561 --> 01:51:53.650
<v Speaker 5>different level and they've been touting</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves up for 200 fucking years.</v>

2519
01:51:53.651 --> 01:51:58.651
<v Speaker 5>Like the bodysuit body body tax and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way they do this super painful super </v>

2520
01:51:58.651 --> 01:52:00.340
<v Speaker 5>fucking pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that shit is just.</v>

2521
01:52:00.570 --> 01:52:05.570
<v Speaker 5>It's a different approach than the </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditional method of tapping that tat </v>

2522
01:52:05.570 --> 01:52:07.960
<v Speaker 5>tat tat tat the way they do it very </v>
<v Speaker 5>different than like a needle,</v>

2523
01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:08.920
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

2524
01:52:08.921 --> 01:52:12.460
<v Speaker 5>a tattoo and modern tattoo needed where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they essentially just draw it.</v>

2525
01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:13.960
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like that back then.</v>

2526
01:52:15.090 --> 01:52:18.040
<v Speaker 1>That's how Steve got his tattoo and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>will just tie tattoos.</v>

2527
01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:23.300
<v Speaker 1>You went to the same person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That engine Lena Jelly did it and got </v>

2528
01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:23.300
<v Speaker 1>the exact same tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She well for awhile.</v>

2529
01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Every tattoo that she got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would get to.</v>

2530
01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:27.590
<v Speaker 1>He would recreate her tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fun.</v>

2531
01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:33.080
<v Speaker 1>It's taking it to the next level and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really loves her because these crazy I </v>

2532
01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:36.921

2533
01:52:36.921 --> 01:52:38.991

<v Speaker 1>The fact is people that are willing to </v>

2539
01:52:47.631 --> 01:52:52.631
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the goof of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that he's going to get every </v>

2540
01:52:52.631 --> 01:52:53.210
<v Speaker 1>tattoo that she gets.</v>

<v Speaker 1>His arm?</v>

2542
01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:55.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that would be funny.</v>

2543
01:52:55.701 --> 01:53:00.701
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he took it off when she took hers </v>

2544
01:53:00.701 --> 01:53:03.041
<v Speaker 1>off because she took hers off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually took off his shirt on when </v>

2545
01:53:03.041 --> 01:53:03.041
<v Speaker 1>we had him on one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that old podcast at my apartment.</v>

2546
01:53:03.041 --> 01:53:04.910
<v Speaker 1>He took off his shirt and showed us all </v>
<v Speaker 1>his tattoos.</v>

2547
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like perfect.</v>

2551
01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.450
<v Speaker 1>That's your choice though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really a questionable choice.</v>

2552
01:53:17.451 --> 01:53:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I could see getting Angelina's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tattoos on your body,</v>

2553

<v Speaker 1>for income if he decides to tour,</v>

<v Speaker 1>comedy store right next door.</v>

2577
01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that.</v>

2578
01:54:26.771 --> 01:54:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2579
01:54:27.471 --> 01:54:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I heard the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know who.</v>

2580
01:54:28.791 --> 01:54:33.791
<v Speaker 1>The guy was mad that some guy jumped off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the building right next to the comedy </v>

2581
01:54:33.791 --> 01:54:35.810
<v Speaker 1>store at that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hide Hotel or whatever it's called.</v>

2582
01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:40.870
<v Speaker 1>That was during the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the riots or the whatever the fuck </v>

2583
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:42.370
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an advertisement for mad men</v>

2584
01:54:42.371 --> 01:54:47.371
<v Speaker 1>on there where it's just a shadow of </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody falling down that building and </v>

2585
01:54:47.371 --> 01:54:49.730
<v Speaker 1>it's so creepy to look at because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shadow.</v>

2586
01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:51.710
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly where that guy killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

2587
01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they knew that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I do.</v>

2588
01:54:55.610 --> 01:54:57.190
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean,</v>

2589
01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.630
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2590
01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:03.720
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said something to them and </v>

2591
01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:03.720
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2592
01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

2593
01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think of that.</v>

2594
01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:07.820
<v Speaker 1>There was anyone that was thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the boycott,</v>

2595
01:55:07.821 --> 01:55:09.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They boycotted all the clubs.</v>

2596
01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:10.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

2597
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:13.730
<v Speaker 1>comedy clubs in La didn't pay anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they pay a little bit,</v>

2598
01:55:13.731 --> 01:55:16.310
<v Speaker 1>they pay a tiny bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but back then they didn't pay a God damn</v>

2599
01:55:16.311 --> 01:55:19.100
<v Speaker 1>thing and so guys were packing the place</v>
<v Speaker 1>and killing them.</v>

2600
01:55:19.101 --> 01:55:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Then all the clubs were making money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truck clubs or treats you like shit.</v>

2601
01:55:22.450 --> 01:55:24.830
<v Speaker 1>So the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only place where clubs get away with</v>

2602
01:55:24.831 --> 01:55:29.831
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have that sort of slave owner </v>

2603
01:55:29.831 --> 01:55:30.290
<v Speaker 1>mentality like some of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them do still to this day.</v>

2604
01:55:30.291 --> 01:55:33.650
<v Speaker 1>They think that you're doing some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an honor by performing there.</v>

2605
01:55:33.850 --> 01:55:35.780
<v Speaker 1>So how many stores really tighten their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship lately?</v>

2606
01:55:35.781 --> 01:55:38.750
<v Speaker 1>That they got a whole new staff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no one's the same anymore.</v>

2607
01:55:38.751 --> 01:55:41.130
<v Speaker 1>That it's completely like a normal club </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2608
01:55:41.131 --> 01:55:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

2609
01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>The comedy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last year</v>

2610
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.350
<v Speaker 7>they've just pretty much overhauled the </v>
<v Speaker 7>whole entire thing.</v>

2611
01:55:46.351 --> 01:55:48.150
<v Speaker 7>So now it's like a food.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2612
01:55:48.151 --> 01:55:51.450
<v Speaker 7>it's got food that people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 7>paid or getting spots.</v>

2613
01:55:51.670 --> 01:55:56.670
<v Speaker 7>The only thing that you don't see is you</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't see a lot of new comics going </v>

2614
01:55:56.670 --> 01:55:59.901
<v Speaker 7>through there a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's still kind of like the same like </v>

<v Speaker 7>but he's never there probably.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never see what does he see him once in</v>

<v Speaker 8>How many of those do you think he has?</v>

2867
02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:52.260
<v Speaker 8>She said she knew she wasn't the only </v>
<v Speaker 8>one.</v>

2868
02:06:53.190 --> 02:06:58.190
<v Speaker 8>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so they just do as a no questions </v>

2869
02:06:58.190 --> 02:07:00.730
<v Speaker 8>asked policy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no questions asked when I come to town </v>

<v Speaker 8>wheat for years because was going to </v>

<v Speaker 8>I mean that's why he's got to keep doing</v>

2872
02:07:07.681 --> 02:07:09.360
<v Speaker 8>these movies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And he's still in Russia.</v>

2873
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:12.060
<v Speaker 8>Those bad ones done some terrible ones.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bad ones now.</v>

2874
02:07:12.061 --> 02:07:17.061
<v Speaker 8>But I think now he's too old and he </v>
<v Speaker 8>enjoy his original original wife to </v>

<v Speaker 8>either heavy set black jake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's Kinda cute.</v>

<v Speaker 8>And why not?</v>

2879
02:07:28.190 --> 02:07:29.610
<v Speaker 8>I haven't seen a movie of his.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was good in a while.</v>

2880
02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:34.820
<v Speaker 8>It's unfortunate when you think about it</v>
<v Speaker 8>because he's the greatest actor of all </v>

2881
02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:34.820
<v Speaker 8>time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in my opinion.</v>

2882
02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:38.820
<v Speaker 8>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I shouldn't say the Gary Oldman's a bad </v>

2885
02:07:41.141 --> 02:07:44.950
<v Speaker 8>but you go back to like the raging bull </v>
<v Speaker 8>days or the Cape fear days.</v>

2886
02:07:45.130 --> 02:07:49.990
<v Speaker 8>Robert Deniro was a mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was amazing man.</v>

2887
02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:53.710
<v Speaker 8>And he was the first guy that really </v>
<v Speaker 8>would like change his body.</v>

2888
02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 8>He gained a fuck load of weight for </v>
<v Speaker 8>raging bull.</v>

2889
02:07:56.531 --> 02:08:01.531
<v Speaker 8>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he got in super good shape as a boxer </v>

2890
02:08:01.531 --> 02:08:02.050
<v Speaker 8>and then he gained a lot of weight to </v>
<v Speaker 8>play Ray Lamontagne,</v>

2891
02:08:02.051 --> 02:08:02.500

<v Speaker 8>in the,</v>

2892
02:08:02.501 --> 02:08:03.880
<v Speaker 8>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in the later years.</v>

2893
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:07.660
<v Speaker 8>That was a fucking amazing performance </v>
<v Speaker 8>drivers.</v>

<v Speaker 8>fellas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

3069
02:15:40.861 --> 02:15:42.920
<v Speaker 1>About a month ago to a mechanic isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

3070
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself,</v>

3071
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:47.550
<v Speaker 8>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how can I put down a movie?</v>

3072
02:15:47.551 --> 02:15:52.551
<v Speaker 8>I haven't seen a.</v>
<v Speaker 8>and let me just take the Charles Branch </v>

3073
02:15:52.551 --> 02:15:52.770
<v Speaker 8>and notion off.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It might be a good movie,</v>

3074
02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:54.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

3075
02:15:54.890 --> 02:15:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Just get mad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3076
02:15:57.790 --> 02:16:00.340
<v Speaker 8>he minutes in because that's the beauty </v>
<v Speaker 8>of the mechanic.</v>

3077
02:16:00.341 --> 02:16:02.290
<v Speaker 8>If you watch the original mechanic,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's the beginning.</v>

3078
02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:07.680
<v Speaker 8>It's the longest dragged out scene of </v>
<v Speaker 8>all time and it's one of the best hitch </v>

3079
02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:10.951
<v Speaker 8>you'll ever see on film where he breaks </v>
<v Speaker 8>into the guy's house and puts you to </v>

3080
02:16:10.951 --> 02:16:12.580
<v Speaker 8>sleep and peace to a pills and the Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

3081
02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:15.070
<v Speaker 8>and what he does is he puts the gas on a</v>
<v Speaker 8>shooter,</v>

3082
02:16:15.110 --> 02:16:17.380
<v Speaker 8>so it looks like a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He did a very.</v>

3083
02:16:17.381 --> 02:16:19.480
<v Speaker 8>And that's what I told people at the </v>
<v Speaker 8>mechanic,</v>

3084
02:16:19.481 --> 02:16:24.481
<v Speaker 8>wasn't about a guy blowing up things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was about a 51 year old man that has </v>

3085
02:16:24.481 --> 02:16:28.661
<v Speaker 8>to use his trades and he did everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He didn't want it to seem like he was </v>

3086
02:16:28.661 --> 02:16:29.250
<v Speaker 8>shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It wasn't a fucking act like,</v>

3087
02:16:29.290 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if he would look</v>

3088
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:35.040
<v Speaker 5>at your medical records,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you had a weak heart each shoot at </v>

3089
02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:35.040
<v Speaker 5>your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you would have to run.</v>

3090
02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:36.580
<v Speaker 5>That's how he killed Jeremiah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael Vincent's father in that movie.</v>

3091
02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:39.070
<v Speaker 5>I watched that thing with Jason Strand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

3092
02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:40.270
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3093
02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:43.010
<v Speaker 5>Fifteen minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It went right off.</v>

3094
02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:46.980
<v Speaker 5>It was a little too stylized and like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fight scenes like that.</v>

3095
02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:50.860
<v Speaker 5>Vincent was trotting slams much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jen might go.</v>

3096
02:16:50.861 --> 02:16:55.861
<v Speaker 5>Vincent was a cool mother fucker walking</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the room.</v>

3097
02:16:56.200 --> 02:17:01.200
<v Speaker 5>Microphone jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bronson was a cool motherfucker walking </v>

3098
02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.410
<v Speaker 5>into the scene and I think that guy that</v>
<v Speaker 5>played jam,</v>

3099
02:17:02.411 --> 02:17:05.380
<v Speaker 5>Michael vintage rolls are good fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a great actor,</v>

3100
02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:07.870
<v Speaker 5>but he overdid the role.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3101
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:09.820
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The role wasn't for a kid.</v>

3102
02:17:09.821 --> 02:17:14.821
<v Speaker 5>That was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was for a kid that was spoiled to </v>

3103
02:17:14.821 --> 02:17:18.661
<v Speaker 5>different vinyl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they played it crazy in this </v>

3104
02:17:18.661 --> 02:17:18.661
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know when you're spoiled,</v>

3105
02:17:18.661 --> 02:17:20.080

<v Speaker 5>is great and he's a good actor.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They didn't cover the spread,</v>

3205
02:21:52.521 --> 02:21:53.550
<v Speaker 5>but the under came</v>

3206
02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:58.980
<v Speaker 7>picker.</v>

<v Speaker 7>This clobbered.</v>

3209
02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:05.360
<v Speaker 7>This kicker wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't know you were supposed to go up </v>

3210
02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:05.360
<v Speaker 7>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what the full story is.</v>

3211
02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:08.460
<v Speaker 7>So at the last second he had to like run</v>
<v Speaker 7>and kick the ball,</v>

3212
02:22:08.461 --> 02:22:13.461
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was like on the sidelines they </v>

3213
02:22:13.461 --> 02:22:14.751
<v Speaker 7>couldn't find them or anything and he </v>
<v Speaker 7>missed it and I think that was like the </v>

3214
02:22:14.751 --> 02:22:16.380
<v Speaker 7>kick that made them lose the superbowl </v>
<v Speaker 7>or something like that.</v>

02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:25.170
<v Speaker 7>we didn't say anything bad to him </v>
<v Speaker 7>because he looked like he was suicidal.</v>

3218
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 7>It's like what some</v>

<v Speaker 3>A bunch of people are missing or 12 </v>

3356
02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:17.521
<v Speaker 3>people are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are dead.</v>

3357
02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:18.940

<v Speaker 3>last night.</v>

3358
02:28:18.941 --> 02:28:20.860
<v Speaker 3>They're exploding a holes in it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

3359
02:28:20.861 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 3>You can get to more places</v>

3360
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:23.270
<v Speaker 7>to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think there's 15.</v>

3361
02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:28.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cruise ship company started calling </v>

3362
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:31.281
<v Speaker 5>up the passengers saying that they would</v>
<v Speaker 5>offer them 30 percent off their next </v>

3363
02:28:32.221 --> 02:28:34.020

3365
02:28:38.340 --> 02:28:41.010
<v Speaker 5>into the ocean to save their lives with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their children.</v>

3366
02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:46.040

02:29:19.671 --> 02:29:23.400
<v Speaker 5>And he jumped off for four hours before </v>
<v Speaker 5>the last passenger got off.</v>

3384
02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:26.050
<v Speaker 5>This asshole was off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Took her.</v>

<v Speaker 5>a rock</v>

3390
02:29:39.250 --> 02:29:43.900

<v Speaker 7>that same path that he did every day for</v>

3391
02:29:43.901 --> 02:29:48.901
<v Speaker 7>years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he got bored and said there was one </v>

3392
02:29:48.901 --> 02:29:49.130
<v Speaker 7>part where you just wanted to do </v>

<v Speaker 7>to see where boats go every single day.</v>

3410
02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:37.021
<v Speaker 5>floating over an alien world and at any </v>
<v Speaker 5>point in time something can happen and a</v>

3411
02:30:37.091 --> 02:30:42.091
<v Speaker 5>whole could get punctured to that thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it sinks to the bottom of that </v>

02:30:42.091 --> 02:30:43.660
<v Speaker 5>era alien world where you can't live and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then what are you in?</v>

3413
