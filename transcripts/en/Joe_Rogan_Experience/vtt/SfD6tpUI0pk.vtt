00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now as a person who's governed state and</v>

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.460
<v Speaker 1>you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when someone gets an</v>

3
00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>when Obama gets an office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promises all of these things,</v>

5
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>gets an office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes almost everything.</v>

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the hurdles?</v>

7
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the differences between the</v>

8
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>hurdles of someone who governs a state</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus someone who governs the United</v>

9
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.080
<v Speaker 1>States?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much more difficult is it to</v>

10
00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:29.990
<v Speaker 1>change things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the United States is like</v>

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Speaker 1>a gigantic ship that takes so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort to shift even slightly that these</v>

12
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 1>presidents get out of office eight years</v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

13
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>exhausted looking like they've aged 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and very little gets done.</v>

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

15
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I think there is a silver bullet to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and I hope I'm tying into what</v>

16
00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think there's a silver bullet</v>

17
00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:53.860
<v Speaker 2>to the system and that would be term</v>
<v Speaker 2>limits.</v>

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that for the most part of</v>

19
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they get in office,</v>

20
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 2>the main concern is to stay in off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

21
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 2>And if you had term limits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that people would do the right</v>

22
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:11.191
<v Speaker 2>thing as opposed to whatever it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to meet Bruce and for the Senate</v>

23
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Congress Senate anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

24
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supreme Court's,</v>

25
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:17.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another topic,</v>

26
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 2>but certainly elected office</v>

28
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>agreed that we have it for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

29
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Why not have it for all elected offices?</v>

30
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm the best example of term</v>
<v Speaker 2>limits.</v>

31
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the opportunity to serve for two</v>

32
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:32.800
<v Speaker 2>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my estimation,</v>

34
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I press the limits term one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not to the point where I wasn't</v>

35
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 2>going to get reelected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I get reelected I started</v>

36
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 2>off by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 2>let's examine the drug war in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

38
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I started off by saying that marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be legalized taking on what I</v>

39
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:56.690
<v Speaker 2>thought at the time was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it still remains so as one of those</v>

40
00:01:56.691 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>really fixable things in our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

41
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 2>that would make the world a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

42
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because of term limits,</v>

43
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:08.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was emboldened because I,</v>

44
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.160
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting out of office and there</v>

45
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 2>was no return.</v>

46
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>what are your thoughts on all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>recreational drugs,</v>

48
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>not just marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more controversial ones like</v>

49
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe cocaine or Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lsd,</v>

50
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>

51
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 2>So when I was governor of New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a um,</v>

52
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

53
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I went to Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon and judges in Portland,</v>

54
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were judges that wanted to meet</v>

55
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 2>with me in Portland and so I went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet with these judges and I didn't know</v>

56
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was going to be about,</v>

57
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 2>but it was six judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland,</v>

58
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Oregon State district judges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I'm getting the wrong label,</v>

59
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 2>but what they said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

60
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>governor Johnson,</v>

61
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're here to tell you,</v>

62
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 2>we completely agree with everything it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you're saying,</v>

63
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 2>but we would like to share with you some</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories here that,</v>

64
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can pass on to others that</v>

65
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>will allow others to better understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drug issue.</v>

66
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 2>They said that they're really horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug out there as methamphetamine,</v>

67
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 2>that people that use methamphetamine</v>
<v Speaker 2>really have their behavior altered and</v>

68
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 2>not in a good way.</v>

69
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 2>So it's really the bogeyman drug out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

70
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 2>They said I'm methamphetamine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the best example that we can think of</v>

71
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 2>of a prohibition drug?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It exists because it's cheap and it's</v>

72
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>easy to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they said was was that,</v>

73
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not suggesting the following,</v>

74
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 2>but if cocaine were legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people would be using cocaine</v>

75
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 2>instead of methamphetamine without the</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative behavioral consequence,</v>

76
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 2>and that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the government were to tell the</v>

77
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 2>truth when it comes to cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine puts holes in your heart.</v>

78
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 2>People that use cocaine their entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives are stereotypically Whitney</v>

79
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Houston that die before they're 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they die of a heart attack from</v>

80
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 2>using cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

81
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 2>will there still be people that will use</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine knowing that they might die of a</v>

82
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 2>heart attack?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

83
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I think there'd be less cocaine use if</v>
<v Speaker 2>people actually knew the truth and could</v>

84
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 2>trust government.</v>

85
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just maintain that 90 percent of the</v>

86
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 2>drug problem is prohibition related,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not use related,</v>

87
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 2>and that is not to discount the problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>with use and abuse,</v>

88
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 2>but that should be the focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have 8,000 deaths a year in</v>

89
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 2>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>8,000,</v>

90
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 2>which is staggeringly low due to cocaine</v>
<v Speaker 2>and heroin overdose,</v>

91
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 2>and people will immediately say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

92
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number is so low because it's</v>

93
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

94
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 2>you can argue that if it were legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if quality quantity was known,</v>

95
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 2>it's arguable that those desks would</v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly decrease.</v>

96
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Although there will always be people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will commit suicide.</v>

97
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Always be people that will push the</v>
<v Speaker 2>limits.</v>

98
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

99
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.620
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always gonna have people that</v>

100
00:04:58.621 --> 00:04:59.970
<v Speaker 1>abuse everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything,</v>

101
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:00.781
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

102
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:01.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

103
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:05.190
<v Speaker 1>we're living in a culture that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol available at every block all</v>

104
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

105
00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a restaurant or a bar or</v>

106
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:11.670
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that you can buy enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol to drink yourself to death.</v>

107
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.420
<v Speaker 1>It's readily available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet when you consider the amount of</v>

108
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>people that actually drink alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

109
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:17.941
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:20.760
<v Speaker 1>the low number of deaths is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

111
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's because we're aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of alcohol and it's pretty.</v>

112
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.900
<v Speaker 1>When you get a bottle of Jack Daniels is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty consistent.</v>

113
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are 100,000 deaths a year that</v>

114
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 2>are contributed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

115
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.790
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

116
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.000
<v Speaker 2>get contributed to alcohol consumption</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not talking about drinking and</v>

117
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 2>driving or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or violence committed under the equal</v>

118
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.440
<v Speaker 2>abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol abuse,</v>

119
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.340
<v Speaker 2>statistically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one dies from marijuana.</v>

120
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.180
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

121
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.150
<v Speaker 1>what I was going to get to was that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at what's happening in</v>

122
00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the more interesting things is</v>

123
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.060
<v Speaker 1>the lessening of violent crime and drunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving.</v>

124
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Those are two effects that have dropped</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty drastically,</v>

125
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>noticeably statistically because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization of marijuana that you would</v>

126
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>reduce because of the legalization of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>less harmful,</v>

127
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>more peaceful drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd reduce the effects of what's right</v>

128
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a readily available and incredibly</v>

129
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 1>prevalent drug.</v>

130
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I have always maintained that legalizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana will make for a better planet</v>

131
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 2>on the medicinal side of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

132
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.570
<v Speaker 2>marijuana products directly compete with</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal prescription drugs,</v>

133
00:06:30.571 --> 00:06:33.960
<v Speaker 2>pain killers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants that statistically kill</v>

134
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.660
<v Speaker 2>100,000 people a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

135
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.910
<v Speaker 2>no documented death due to marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the recreational side,</v>

136
00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I've always maintained that legalizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana will lead to less overall</v>

137
00:06:46.591 --> 00:06:51.240
<v Speaker 2>substance abuse because people are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find it as such a safer alternative</v>

138
00:06:51.241 --> 00:06:54.240
<v Speaker 2>than everything else that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starting with alcohol.</v>

139
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 2>The campaign to legalize marijuana in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado was a campaign based on</v>

140
00:07:00.481 --> 00:07:03.360
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is safer than alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Joe,</v>

141
00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:07.800
<v Speaker 2>as you were pointing out all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics that all the naysayers were</v>

142
00:07:07.801 --> 00:07:09.490
<v Speaker 2>going to go south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

143
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.100
<v Speaker 2>have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have gone better.</v>

144
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.590
<v Speaker 2>There are less traffic instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's less overall crime in the state</v>

145
00:07:16.591 --> 00:07:20.640
<v Speaker 2>of Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado is vibrant and does it have to</v>

146
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:23.310
<v Speaker 2>do with marijuana?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's an ingredient,</v>

147
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comprised in why Colorado is so vibrant</v>

148
00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:27.684
<v Speaker 2>right now</v>

149
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>questionably unquestionable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a prime example of how</v>

150
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:37.001
<v Speaker 1>screwy the system gets when people lobby</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the legalization of things that</v>

151
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:42.761
<v Speaker 1>don't harm anyone is the fact that hemp</v>
<v Speaker 1>is illegal federally and that we're</v>

152
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:46.820
<v Speaker 1>trying to make it legal and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it legal statewide and in various</v>

153
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:50.510
<v Speaker 1>states and start production of hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But hemp is not psychoactive.</v>

154
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

155
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.733
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

156
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.080
<v Speaker 2>we can sell hemp products in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

157
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.840
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come from China.</v>

158
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.890
<v Speaker 1>My bias or my company on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we buy it from Canada.</v>

159
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.090
<v Speaker 1>We buy hemp protein from Canada and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't grow it in America.</v>

160
00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:07.770
<v Speaker 1>We can import it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't grow it.</v>

161
00:08:07.771 --> 00:08:09.330
<v Speaker 1>CBD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CBD oil.</v>

162
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

163
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Not psychoactive helps pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very effective for people just not</v>

164
00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:16.620
<v Speaker 1>getting people hired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not ruining lives,</v>

165
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.140
<v Speaker 1>not doing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that are</v>

166
00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:22.050
<v Speaker 1>concerned that are making money off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternatives.</v>

167
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Especially with hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the reason why marijuana</v>

168
00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:26.250
<v Speaker 1>was made illegal in the first place.</v>

169
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason it was about hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracy of dupont to promote</v>

170
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:33.850
<v Speaker 2>nylon as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

171
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.520
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course they,</v>

172
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Randolph hearst with his paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>factories,</v>

173
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 2>they made a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made a marijuana illegal.</v>

174
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:46.991
<v Speaker 2>But because the marijuana plant in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hemp plant look the same then hence hemp</v>

175
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.260
<v Speaker 2>was also made illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

176
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.103
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

177
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy.</v>

178
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

179
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's all been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

180
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 1>we're in a strange time that it's 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still illegal.</v>

181
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly starting to become legal and</v>

182
00:09:01.731 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 1>people starting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in Kentucky and a few other</v>

183
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're allowing farmers to profit off</v>

184
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>of this incredibly vibrant plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to grow,</v>

185
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>doesn't require pesticides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a variety of uses as a textile,</v>

186
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 1>as a commodity for food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full amino acid profile.</v>

187
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It makes amazing clothes and made this</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacket.</v>

188
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.110
<v Speaker 2>This is made out of hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

189
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.100
<v Speaker 2>if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

190
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.430
<v Speaker 2>if the marijuana plant were discovered</v>
<v Speaker 2>today in the Amazon,</v>

191
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:33.431
<v Speaker 2>it would be hailed as the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery of humankind in 1999.</v>

192
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.790
<v Speaker 2>A good news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad news here in 1999,</v>

193
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:40.910
<v Speaker 2>I was the highest elected official in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States to call for the</v>

194
00:09:40.911 --> 00:09:44.810
<v Speaker 2>legalization of marijuana in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad News.</v>

195
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm still the highest elected official</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States to call for the</v>

196
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:51.650
<v Speaker 2>legalization of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although Bernie Sanders apparently</v>

197
00:09:51.651 --> 00:09:56.090
<v Speaker 2>rolled out of bed and hit his head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's come to that same epiphany.</v>

198
00:09:56.091 --> 00:09:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad,</v>

199
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 2>but in 1990 minutes a roll out of bed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hit his head on that.</v>

200
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.460
<v Speaker 2>He came to this epiphany at this point</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his life.</v>

201
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 2>He's never said it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

202
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not until he's been running for a,</v>

203
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.630
<v Speaker 2>for Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's like one of those lick</v>

204
00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:13.850
<v Speaker 2>your finger and put it up in the air and</v>
<v Speaker 2>check where the breeze is going.</v>

205
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that he's joined the big crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

206
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.290
<v Speaker 2>but in 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent of Americans supported</v>

207
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:26.291
<v Speaker 2>legalizing marijuana in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 percent of Americans now are</v>

208
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:31.421
<v Speaker 2>supporting the legalization of marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not one politician outside of Bernie</v>

209
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Sanders in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

210
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.670
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I say elected official at the</v>

211
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:41.030
<v Speaker 2>congressional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>senatorial or gubernatorial level,</v>

212
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.900
<v Speaker 2>not one politician in that group outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Bernie Sanders,</v>

213
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.690
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a spouse legalizing marijuana.</v>

214
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I think what a disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What an incredible disconnect between</v>

215
00:10:51.891 --> 00:10:54.200
<v Speaker 2>what people think and our elected</v>
<v Speaker 2>officials.</v>
