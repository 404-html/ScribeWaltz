<v Speaker 1>it's really blown up lately.</v>

19
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>When it first came out years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

20
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I had a little different connotation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

21
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:47.561
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

26
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>but nobody deletes those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just make a screenshot.</v>

27
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>that's that horrible feeling in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of your gut.</v>

32
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

33
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>You've got problems with your sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick pics anyway.</v>

34
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Understand the less the girl wants dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>pecs and then you've got to send them,</v>

35
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.853
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you talk to people that are in the </v>

37
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:18.204
<v Speaker 1>Dick pic game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you got to send pictures to </v>

38
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 1>get pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

39
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>cause girls feel vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're just telling you,</v>

40
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.033
<v Speaker 1>sending you pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're posting and you're not sending </v>

41
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>anything back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like this mother fucker has me</v>

42
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit.</v>

43
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>There's no trust in this relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they don't want them,</v>

44
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>they just want a picture.</v>

45
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.583
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you gotta be vulnerable for </v>

46
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>these girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>

47
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>One of my next part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where we're starting Dick pics.</v>

48
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.133
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no rhyme or reason to any of </v>

49
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>these damn damn thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

50
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.223
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely Joe Rogan's Dick pic game is </v>

52
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still is shaky.</v>

53
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>It's all over the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my fucking phone,</v>

54
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I give my phone to my six year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's filled with snapchat,</v>

55
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 1>pictures of her face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>switching in with Kimbo slices,</v>

56
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.690
<v Speaker 1>face all the pictures I have on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

57
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.793
<v Speaker 1>She goes through all my photos and finds</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures that she wants us swap faces </v>

58
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:19.821
<v Speaker 1>with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these wacky kids these days.</v>

59
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fresh out of the trenches,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was wild.</v>

65
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that was something wasn't it?</v>

67
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was for sure.</v>

68
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Like we were saying before the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>started you,</v>

69
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>you were really fighting emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>

70
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>you were worked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>you'd already fought him before and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

72
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to get back at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

73
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of obvious in a way.</v>

74
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>You were fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>

75
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>you were really putting a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on him.</v>

76
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really feel that way at the </v>

77
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said I wasn't aware of it.</v>

78
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just in there doing me and uh,</v>

79
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of pressure,</v>

80
00:02:58.771 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.363
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

82
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering,</v>

83
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to knock them out.</v>

84
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I set things right.</v>

85
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.973
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

86
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>being the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

87
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.533
<v Speaker 2>told and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of carried as the face of a </v>

88
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.703
<v Speaker 2>belts or kickboxing and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure on my shoulders at night and a </v>

89
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:15.101
<v Speaker 2>lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

90
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of,</v>

91
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.473
<v Speaker 2>one of the big shot and I wanted to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>an exciting fight and I think I did </v>

92
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.114
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 2>definitely did that kill or be killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

94
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 2>and for Spike TV's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we killed it on the ratings.</v>

95
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:27.870
<v Speaker 2>And my job was to carry the ratings </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was white.</v>

96
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I was the first fight from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

97
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 2>the main card and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said it was a never a boring moment,</v>

98
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:34.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.500
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking wild.</v>

100
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

101
00:03:38.361 --> 00:03:40.580
<v Speaker 1>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird like fine line.</v>

102
00:03:40.581 --> 00:03:43.650
<v Speaker 1>You have to cross some sometimes between</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

103
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.833
<v Speaker 1>which I should ask you when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you make the distinction of </v>

104
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:51.290
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you should fight smart or</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight exciting?</v>

105
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you make that distinction or do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just go,</v>

106
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>can't stop crazy and fucking charge at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

107
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

108
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.523
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

109
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I guess there was like a tournament in </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

110
00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:02.700
<v Speaker 2>it'd be more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

111
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure to,</v>

112
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:05.880
<v Speaker 2>to fight a little smarter or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

113
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

114
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I take pride in the way that I fight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

115
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

116
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.590
<v Speaker 2>when you turn on a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to see a guy like me.</v>

117
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.900
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys that complain about,</v>

118
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:16.651

<v Speaker 2>and go out on the shield.</v>

125
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

126
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:28.714
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that promoters always </v>

127
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:31.654
<v Speaker 1>hope that a guy fights like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always hope that a guy goes out </v>

00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>there charging out guns blazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

129
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 1>But most people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.103
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean</v>

131
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.280
<v Speaker 2>hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work out that all of a sudden.</v>

132
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 2>it has worked out in the past a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 2>often than that.</v>

134
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people on the Internet.</v>

135
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Internet these days right now.</v>

136
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Vertel you didn't get online after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

137
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Did you try to stay off for awhile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

138
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.740
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to stay offline too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a little hard to see if,</v>

139
00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:02.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything I could get out of it?</v>

140
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.663
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you could get a lot of technique </v>

141
00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 1>advice from keyboard warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they have some,</v>

142
00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:11.720
<v Speaker 1>a strategy advice for you.</v>

143
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has everybody.</v>

144
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is an expert,</v>

145
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.223
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

146
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's an expert.</v>

147
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the thing.</v>

148
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really earn their opinion or their</v>

149
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>right to express her opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody just has one.</v>

150
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Now they have an avenue to express.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to separate,</v>

151
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>what does that expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheat from the shaft?</v>

152
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.603
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never figured out what the fuck </v>

153
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:35.374

<v Speaker 2>You know what that is?</v>

155

<v Speaker 2>I talked to Vinnie the day after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoreman vinny shoreman and uh,</v>

156
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.650

<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

157
00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

<v Speaker 2>these fucking guys online,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's easy to say like ignore him.</v>

160
00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that,</v>

161
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.943
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some jerk off kid in their parents' </v>

162
00:05:50.961 --> 00:05:54.230
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not personally religious,</v>

163
00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:55.910
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used it as an example.</v>

164
00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:57.240
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ was</v>

166
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>like the greatest person ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

167
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Like the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168

<v Speaker 1>water into wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heal the sick,</v>

169
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 1>give mine all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people still killed him,</v>

170
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>

171
00:06:05.821 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter how good you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do,</v>

172
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole who talk shit and does,</v>

173
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.813
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a interesting little </v>

174
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 1>perspective that seemed to work out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

175
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares what these people think?</v>

176
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to fucking hate you.</v>

177
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>If everyone was perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't appreciate perfect people.</v>

178
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.763
<v Speaker 1>If everybody was awesome and really cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>and easy to talk to and friendly and </v>

179
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 1>like you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen.</v>

180
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard to have your shit together</v>

181
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>and there's too many variables that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen in your childhood.</v>

182
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

183
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>like everything either has to go really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good or really bad.</v>

184
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.793
<v Speaker 1>What you appreciate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are really good so you'd </v>

185
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>gravitate towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one or the other,</v>

186
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's just human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a project with no directions.</v>

187
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.633
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're a super complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer and no one has a fucking </v>

188
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>guidebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows exactly how to work it.</v>

189
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>No one knows exactly what's the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's happening in real time.</v>

190
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.723
<v Speaker 1>And the words you say they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you say something </v>

191
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:04.424
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you might just be in a crazy mood </v>

192
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.130

<v Speaker 1>you might just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're doing it to get a reaction or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they doing it because they're upset and </v>

00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 1>And even if you're a real piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day you might snap out of it,</v>

218
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.930
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have to change your </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter name.</v>

219
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.680
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to start fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you think about it that way.</v>

221
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 1>You're a neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think you know,</v>

222
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 1>if someone is upset at you because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like,</v>

223
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:16.424
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a painting that you did or they don't </v>

224
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 1>like a song that you made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>

225
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.253
<v Speaker 1>But a fight is so emotional and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal and it's so the consequences </v>

226
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.403
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much different than any other </v>

227
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you lose a game,</v>

228
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Lebron James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking suck.</v>

229
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.370

<v Speaker 1>It's just the game.</v>

230
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>The ball didn't go in the net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck?</v>

231
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a fight it's salt.</v>

232
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the highest consequences possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

233
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 1>there's no higher consequences other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than war.</v>

234
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.553
<v Speaker 1>There's no higher consequences as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how it feels to lose or what it </v>

235
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>feels like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear people talk shit about you,</v>

236
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 1>about your performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that,</v>

237
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the reasons why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

238
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Like they know.</v>

239
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I know it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they know it's not them.</v>

240
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

241
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why people </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack people,</v>

242
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something goes wrong in their life,</v>

243
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 1>like a charlie sheen thing or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is that they,</v>

244
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>they know that that could happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

245
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's not happening to them right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

246
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 1>So they feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fuck him,</v>

247
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 1>then go after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

248
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:16.540
<v Speaker 1>they have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

249
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.383
<v Speaker 1>this vault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they understand that they would be </v>

250
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 1>equally vulnerable and they feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that little opening and they just dead.</v>

251
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking scab.</v>

252
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 1>They count,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to pick at it.</v>

253
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.423
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

254
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think they're just pieces of shit</v>

255
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 2>that to me just do this a fucking piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit.</v>

256
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 2>And they're just haters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're just,</v>

257
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 2>you've never done anything with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

258
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not willing to take those risks.</v>

259
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.763
<v Speaker 2>And then when you see somebody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking those risks and then it doesn't </v>

260
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:43.360
<v Speaker 2>work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

261
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking told you.</v>

262
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:44.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.673
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ever send people and they're </v>

264
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 2>just sad and miserable people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that Hbo a,</v>

267
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:55.074

<v Speaker 1>How he's afraid to fight Manny Pacquiao </v>

271
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>like you're talking to arguably the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxer that's ever lived,</v>

272
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:14.390
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty.</v>

<v Speaker 1>twice in his whole fucking career.</v>

276
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 1>You might think of styles boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fucking guy has done it.</v>

277
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just did it and he's talking </v>

<v Speaker 1>Pacquiao,</v>

280
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 1>who he then went and shut out a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>months later.</v>

281
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's those people that aren't doing </v>

282
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:45.204
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the ones that are going to </v>

<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's going to be winners and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be losers and there's going to </v>

304
00:11:34.941 --> 00:11:35.774
<v Speaker 1>be people to take risks is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that don't ever take risks and </v>

305
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:40.970
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live their life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they never get to shine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 1>risks with your life and you have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>big shining moments,</v>

311
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.480

<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the fourth round Kale of Simon Marcus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 1>like you don't get those moments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>

314
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 1>sometimes those moments are turned on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

315
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no other way.</v>

316
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Like the way you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way.</v>

317
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're the hammer,</v>

318
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're the nail.</v>

319
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I am proud as hell of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

320
00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:21.624
<v Speaker 2>Like having this conversation like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>or three days ago of it wouldn't been a </v>

321
00:12:24.691 --> 00:12:25.524
<v Speaker 2>little rough conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm like looking at it like I'm </v>

322
00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:29.304
<v Speaker 2>going to be remembered as that guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>always brought it up and you're not </v>

323
00:12:30.841 --> 00:12:33.090
<v Speaker 2>going to on my name is going to go down </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm dead and gone.</v>

324
00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 2>They're going to remember what I've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the sport of kickboxing and I didn't</v>

325
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:36.523
<v Speaker 2>take a lot of pride in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you turn on the Joe Schilling </v>

326
00:12:38.221 --> 00:12:39.180
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill or be killed,</v>

327
00:12:39.181 --> 00:12:40.014
<v Speaker 2>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking try and knock his </v>

328
00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:42.264
<v Speaker 2>head off and I'm going to get caught </v>
<v Speaker 2>again in the future and I'm going to </v>

329
00:12:43.801 --> 00:12:47.010
<v Speaker 2>have some huge fucking ups and I'm okay </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

330
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.990
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

331
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:49.853
<v Speaker 2>I've been knocked out three times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't knocked out cold in this fight </v>

332
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.330
<v Speaker 2>and it was unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even for a second.</v>

333
00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:56.490
<v Speaker 2>They just stopped the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been knocked out three times.</v>

334
00:12:56.491 --> 00:12:57.324
<v Speaker 2>The number 95 fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done more than I ever dreamed I </v>

335
00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:01.620
<v Speaker 2>would in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fucking fight.</v>

336
00:13:01.621 --> 00:13:04.410
<v Speaker 2>And my kids are super proud of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad's a superhero.</v>

337
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.990
<v Speaker 2>My mom is super proud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those what I've done.</v>

338
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with that.</v>

339
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.443
<v Speaker 1>That's a great attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have that attitude and you </v>

340
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you press forward with that attitude,</v>

341
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you don't like losing,</v>

342
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.153
<v Speaker 1>but if you can deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes all the other stuff so much </v>

343
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 1>easier because you can get right back on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horse,</v>

344
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've done that already.</v>

345
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>You have the experience of getting back </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the horse.</v>

346
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got hit by a shot and got drops in the</v>

347
00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:30.321
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got stopped.</v>

348
00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I've had knee surgeries arose out for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year and had to come back from it.</v>

349
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.610
<v Speaker 2>And I've had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

350
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.593
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard things to overcome and I </v>

351
00:13:36.831 --> 00:13:37.664
<v Speaker 2>don't plan on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a good loser and I don't play </v>

352
00:13:39.121 --> 00:13:40.850
<v Speaker 2>them on ever becoming a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

353
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.650
<v Speaker 2>you show me a good loser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you a loser.</v>

354
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight,</v>

355
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit you with a,</v>

356
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.530
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful spinning back fist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

357
00:13:48.531 --> 00:13:50.840
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't necessarily like legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

358
00:13:50.841 --> 00:13:54.680
<v Speaker 1>because he hit you with a forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does it Bella to our rules.</v>

359
00:13:54.681 --> 00:13:57.040
<v Speaker 1>You can't throw elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't throw forums is,</v>

360
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.053
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that kind of weird because you </v>

361
00:13:59.181 --> 00:14:01.070
<v Speaker 1>could fucking Shin kick someone in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

362
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

363
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:04.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

364
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.553
<v Speaker 2>I s k rule is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the ruling body that does the for </v>

365
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 2>both blower glory and for a belter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules,</v>

366
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:13.380
<v Speaker 2>meaning that talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

367
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.730
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can clinch and knee,</v>

368
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:16.564
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be active.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you are active and you were </v>

369
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 2>effective in the let it go for five </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

370
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Speaker 2>If you're holding it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're just clenching to hold,</v>

371
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:23.680
<v Speaker 2>they want to be the five seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll break it.</v>

372
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the rules they explained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

373
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you throw spending back fist,</v>

374
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.730
<v Speaker 2>it has to be the glove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hit you or they stick,</v>

375
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.420
<v Speaker 2>they start taking a point where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start warning cause it's a illegal shot.</v>

376
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Now I was a professional muy Thai </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter of elbows and everything else.</v>

377
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 2>So I'm never gonna say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

378
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:41.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he plan on throwing that spinning </v>

379
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 2>back fists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

380
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Did he have a fucking clue where he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he threw it?</v>

381
00:14:47.301 --> 00:14:48.880
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it was rock.</v>

382
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:51.170
<v Speaker 2>There was no fucking fucking threw it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hit me with it.</v>

383
00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 2>And you know that shit happens.</v>

384
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 3>But is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that technically illegal shot?</v>

385
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:55.963
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know I'm not going to get </v>

386
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 3>tested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

387
00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of should be illegal though,</v>

388
00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:00.824
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean don't you think if you can hit </v>

389
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:03.254
<v Speaker 3>someone with your Shin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to hit someone with </v>

390
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 3>your forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

391
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:06.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't like these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

392
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like these rules.</v>

393
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:09.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they,</v>

394
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.353
<v Speaker 3>they came up with these rules for k one </v>
<v Speaker 3>k one had this idea like used to be no </v>

395
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:14.534
<v Speaker 3>back spinning back fist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watched the old kid one fights </v>

396
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.100
<v Speaker 3>one the only rule they like say come out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and touch clothes,</v>

397
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 3>come out and swinging or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like no,</v>

398
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.470
<v Speaker 3>spinning back fist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

399
00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Cause he always from spinning backwards </v>
<v Speaker 3>but we could throw a wheel kicks.</v>

400
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any cat.</v>

401
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.813
<v Speaker 3>You know the rule set is I believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>designed for a certain style of fighter </v>

402
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 3>or entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with the clinch.</v>

403
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the,</v>

404
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 3>those are the rules that they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

405
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:37.334
<v Speaker 3>They're not big on elbows in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 3>because pride didn't allow elbows </v>

406
00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:41.930
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy cause they allowed stomps</v>

407
00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 3>and soccer kicks but they didn't allow </v>
<v Speaker 3>elbows on the ground.</v>

408
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:46.783
<v Speaker 3>So k one came up with that rule set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea behind it I guess was to </v>

409
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:50.774
<v Speaker 3>make the fights more entertaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you wouldn't be able to clinch </v>

410
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:55.910
<v Speaker 3>and you would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be forced to fight it out,</v>

411
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

412
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.853
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What came did was pretty God damn </v>

413
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they really took this sport that,</v>

414
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.630
<v Speaker 3>and I think you know Dana white had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good point.</v>

415
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:09.350
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this once when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was trying to get him to buy k one and I</v>

416
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:10.184
<v Speaker 3>was like look man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys they're going under like he </v>

417
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:15.980
<v Speaker 3>got like kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this high level kickbox and whether</v>

418
00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 3>its glory or it's showtime or any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these big organizations.</v>

419
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the like the high level</v>
<v Speaker 3>talent and kickboxing,</v>

420
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.920
<v Speaker 3>that to me is some of the most exciting </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit to watch and all combat sports.</v>

421
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.240
<v Speaker 3>When I watch a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

422
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.223
<v Speaker 3>like your fight this past weekend or </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're the tournament or the Simon </v>

423
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Marcus fight or you fight with </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

424
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:41.050
<v Speaker 3>These are crazy chaotic fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what people love,</v>

425
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.270
<v Speaker 3>I think potentially the most about mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously,</v>

426
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of Jujitsu as well and I </v>

427
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 3>love when fights go to the ground and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>love when guys win by submission.</v>

428
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:51.584
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you want to talk about just pure </v>

429
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:54.584
<v Speaker 3>excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kickboxing is one of the most exciting </v>

430
00:16:56.421 --> 00:17:00.320
<v Speaker 3>sports on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Dana White's point was it got fucked</v>

431
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:01.154
<v Speaker 3>in America by that Goddamn PKA karate </v>
<v Speaker 3>that used to be on espn where you would </v>

432
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:06.374
<v Speaker 3>watch these guys throw these bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass fake kicks where they had to get in </v>

433
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:12.050
<v Speaker 3>like x amount of kicks per round.</v>

434
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:12.883
<v Speaker 3>So they would like throw these flippy </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake stupid kicks and then they would </v>

435
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:18.900
<v Speaker 3>have just really shitty sloppy boxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and oh man,</v>

436
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.840
<v Speaker 3>there's some really good fucking boxers </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

437
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:21.703
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason they like it started </v>

438
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:23.530
<v Speaker 3>from like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

439
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the seventies eighties.</v>

440
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.063
<v Speaker 3>It was when you were martial arts was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the thing is Kung Fu Billy Jack </v>

441
00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:31.761
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Shit,</v>

442
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they had some Rick Rufus,</v>

446
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:41.440
<v Speaker 3>you know Don the Dragon Wilson was a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

447
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so they had these,</v>

448
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.473
<v Speaker 3>there's karate guys and there are other </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts guys general and they're </v>

449
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:49.950

<v Speaker 3>trying to make this is full thing.</v>

450

<v Speaker 3>going there and just beating the fuck </v>

<v Speaker 3>per round.</v>

455
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.083
<v Speaker 3>Just even keep it from turning into just</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight boxing matches and you watch </v>

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 3>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

467
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:20.450
<v Speaker 3>There was somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

468
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 3>But there was also a lot of like sloppy </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

469
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a lot of sloppy shit too.</v>

470
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.043
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at the level that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing now today in high level </v>

471
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing in comparison to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Nikki holds skins and a,</v>

472
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:31.464
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joel Valine Fellini and the Raymond </v>

473
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Daniels and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's no,</v>

474
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.050
<v Speaker 3>no comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The level is so high today.</v>

475
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 3>It's much higher today and I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the public,</v>

476
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:43.110
<v Speaker 3>it's just for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they haven't tuned into it yet.</v>

477
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.700
<v Speaker 3>To me it's like the most exciting thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that most people don't know about.</v>

478
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you watch the might might've been,</v>

479
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did like that.</v>

480
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.260
<v Speaker 3>I thought that that was an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to do it.</v>

481
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Have a cage in a ring right by each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

482
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

483
00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 3>the set up of the ring in the cages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

484
00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.513
<v Speaker 3>coker really likes it be for the fans </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are there that they can watch both </v>

485
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:03.150

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

486
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I think the seating arrangements get </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird or not,</v>

487
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.113
<v Speaker 3>but from a marketing perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get what exactly we were talking </v>

488
00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:09.924

514
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.940
<v Speaker 3>what's missing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

515
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 3>the UFC needed the ultimate fighter </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the ultimate fighter.</v>

516
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody had a fucking clue as to what MMA</v>

517
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:09.890
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

518
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:10.723
<v Speaker 3>They really didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a few people that hurting </v>

519
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:17.430
<v Speaker 3>UFC from the old days and the hoists </v>
<v Speaker 3>gracie days and the vast majority of the</v>

520
00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:18.264
<v Speaker 3>public was kind of out of the loop and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they put on the ultimate fighter </v>

521
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.210
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was sort of the,</v>

522
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.313
<v Speaker 3>the prime of reality tv back then and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that fight between forrest griffin and </v>

523
00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:29.694
<v Speaker 3>Stephan Bonner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was such a wild ass fight that </v>

524
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:34.380
<v Speaker 3>sort of made mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really did.</v>

525
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 3>It made the UFC and ballot or needs </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that they need,</v>

526
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.010
<v Speaker 3>what if those two played it safe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>night?</v>

527
00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would we be here,</v>

528
00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:44.130

566
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a stud guy who comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smashes it.</v>

567
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.410
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if she's just stud.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If he lets the guy suck his deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

571
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of variables they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take into consideration.</v>

572
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.470
<v Speaker 1>But I see people calling people cox all </v>

626
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we've run out of insults.</v>

628
00:24:56.271 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not really applicable and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it because it's a new one.</v>

00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:50.420
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

813
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.313
<v Speaker 1>like when something happens we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be real sensitive to who we insult post </v>

814
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.163
<v Speaker 1>post like attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with his shit that was going on in </v>

815
00:32:59.331 --> 00:33:00.164
<v Speaker 1>Germany where all these women were </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting raped during New Year's eve cut </v>

816
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 1>cause of all these Islamic refugees that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had come in from Syria.</v>

817
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the way it is.</v>

818
00:33:07.701 --> 00:33:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

819
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.810
<v Speaker 1>your people are coming from a completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different culture in their culture.</v>

820
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Women are much more suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come over to this country,</v>

821
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.093
<v Speaker 1>Germany where women or Western eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're free and they're wearing skirts </v>

822
00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:20.264
<v Speaker 1>and their tits or hanging out and w </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dressed normal and to getting </v>

823
00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 1>attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what is the fucking mayor of,</v>

824
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:26.330
<v Speaker 1>was it Berlin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell them,</v>

825
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.213
<v Speaker 1>stay away from men and dress different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay an arm's length away from men and </v>

826
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.880
<v Speaker 1>dress more conservatively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally this fucking,</v>

827
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:35.743
<v Speaker 1>these people are so sensitive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried that they're going to hurt </v>

828
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:43.610
<v Speaker 1>someone's feelings or they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be called Islamophobic or racist in some</v>

829
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:45.110
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're,</v>

830
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.870
<v Speaker 1>they're telling women who've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing wrong,</v>

831
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:48.833
<v Speaker 1>that they should dress differently </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they've unfortunately let these </v>

832
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:55.940
<v Speaker 1>people in from another culture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about things differently.</v>

833
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of cooks.</v>

834
00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Fucking cooks sensitive dazzle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mayor of Berlin or wherever it was,</v>

835
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.960
<v Speaker 1>it was a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it Berlin?</v>

836
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I remember the city was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a woman,</v>

837
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:09.464
<v Speaker 1>so it's even more confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But boy did she get fucking raked over </v>

838
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:14.420
<v Speaker 1>the coals online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are getting tired of it.</v>

839
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:16.760
<v Speaker 1>The pendulum swings both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

840
00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:17.594
<v Speaker 1>it swings towards ultra sensitivity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then people get sick of that and they </v>

841
00:34:20.361 --> 00:34:21.590
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

842
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:25.250
<v Speaker 1>And then they go hard the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one the reasons why trump</v>

843
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.113
<v Speaker 1>is the republican nominee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Caitlyn Jenner is responsible </v>

844
00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:30.134
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people saw that and they're </v>

845
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:33.890
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

846
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:34.990
<v Speaker 1>They just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

<v Speaker 1>A demasculated millennial liberal male </v>

861
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:14.460

<v Speaker 1>modern feminism blames white men for all</v>

862
00:35:14.461 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 1>of the world's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

872
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:48.561
<v Speaker 1>commonly used on twitter to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti white males while it was originally</v>

873
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:51.000
<v Speaker 1>formed with the original meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kack.</v>

874
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.313
<v Speaker 1>Kack hold the use of the word cock does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily denote a sexual </v>

875
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:56.701
<v Speaker 1>connotation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

877
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:00.384
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cox do not care about Islamic countries </v>

878

882
00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:16.620
<v Speaker 1>criticized them for fear of looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist or homophobic.</v>

883
00:36:16.621 --> 00:36:18.390
<v Speaker 1>We'll still have that lady in Germany is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cook.</v>

884
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.870
<v Speaker 1>The word originated from white </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalists vocabulary,</v>

885
00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's still widely used by all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

886
00:36:24.481 --> 00:36:26.820
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to me like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's really pushing it.</v>

931
00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the Viacom and spike sports are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really pushing it.</v>

932
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.883
<v Speaker 2>They really get behind and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to promote the sport and you </v>

<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

940
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.690
<v Speaker 3>So you're throwing an elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right.</v>

941
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.543
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

943
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.390
<v Speaker 3>You know the elbow torque.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

944
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.243
<v Speaker 3>That's even weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're throwing an elbow and you're not </v>

945
00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 3>allowed to elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

946
00:38:57.551 --> 00:39:01.210
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just shows how ridiculous it is.</v>

947
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they just do Moitai well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I watched lion fight.</v>

948
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.123
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just doing straight Moy Tai and </v>

949
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.050
<v Speaker 3>it seems pretty popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it's on access TV.</v>

950
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.390
<v Speaker 3>And I think the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the k one model,</v>

951
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked really well.</v>

952
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

953
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Why Change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It obviously worked for so long.</v>

954
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the other stuff works.</v>

955
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're going to strike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just going to do striking,</v>

956
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.270
<v Speaker 3>why not throw elbows?</v>

957
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not throw knees and the clinch?</v>

958
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Why not be able to click clinch and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweep?</v>

959
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Why not be able to do all the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that make [inaudible] special?</v>

960
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.220
<v Speaker 3>Why not take off him and made gloves </v>
<v Speaker 3>went not stomp on his face?</v>

961
00:39:36.221 --> 00:39:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

962
00:39:38.321 --> 00:39:40.480
<v Speaker 3>I want to say everything can change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

963
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Bare knuckle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bare knuckled tiger.</v>

964
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:44.590
<v Speaker 3>You're going to bring those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to bring it up.</v>

965
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Does anybody bald?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know in Thailand they're still,</v>

966
00:39:47.771 --> 00:39:51.220
<v Speaker 3>like I saw Sam Chai had a fight recently</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they were wearing,</v>

967
00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:53.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm just essentially hand wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

968
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.870
<v Speaker 3>but the paint thick hand wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a rope.</v>

969
00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bounded fist matches a Thai fight.</v>

970
00:39:57.971 --> 00:40:00.730
<v Speaker 3>They still do that every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every couple hour long.</v>

971
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.713
<v Speaker 3>What's the benefit of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it looks like it's still a lot </v>

972
00:40:02.951 --> 00:40:06.250
<v Speaker 3>of padding it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more about the Thai culture</v>

973
00:40:06.251 --> 00:40:07.084
<v Speaker 3>and that was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Siam Warrior days when they were </v>

974
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:10.684
<v Speaker 3>going to war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had that kind of thing and the </v>

975
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Hmong con that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they walked off of the thing,</v>

976
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 3>we would work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would wear that around.</v>

977
00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:18.430
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't take that off like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are now.</v>

978
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.110
<v Speaker 3>They would pull it down when they wear </v>
<v Speaker 3>it around their neck,</v>

979
00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:21.760
<v Speaker 3>like a necklace when they would fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>and go to war.</v>

980
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's still the same thing.</v>

981
00:40:22.991 --> 00:40:26.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like a cloth that's been blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be your,</v>

982
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:27.543
<v Speaker 3>your mother shirt or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>special and you're taking that with you </v>

983
00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:31.960
<v Speaker 3>to bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would never take that off.</v>

984
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.750
<v Speaker 3>And years and years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no shit.</v>

985
00:40:34.751 --> 00:40:35.584
<v Speaker 3>When did they start taking it off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody's got to be big deal choked </v>

986
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:40.540
<v Speaker 3>with it probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know that was a boy.</v>

987
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Barron is a traditional martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>style of Moitai.</v>

988
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Before it became a sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was more Brown.</v>

989
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.560
<v Speaker 3>That's where you see like Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John and those guys.</v>

990
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh run up you and dropped elbows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the war,</v>

991
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:52.653
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>style of Thai was [inaudible] which is </v>

992
00:40:56.261 --> 00:40:57.790
<v Speaker 3>what those bounded fix things are.</v>

993
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 3>It's more about like giving a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>showing their culture.</v>

994
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:03.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it's interest proud of when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>tie in Thailand.</v>

995
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 3>That's their national sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they should be,</v>

996
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean they figured out the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take care of someone's legs.</v>

997
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean they really did figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best way to leg kick.</v>

998
00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.420
<v Speaker 3>They figured out the best way to throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>elbows in the clinch.</v>

999
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:17.283
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so many excellent things came at </v>

1000
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:22.210
<v Speaker 3>him with tyler yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting that this one country,</v>

1001
00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean sit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretend Thailand didn't exist.</v>

1002
00:41:24.611 --> 00:41:27.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a very small country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Thailand didn't exist,</v>

1003
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.850
<v Speaker 3>like literally all of combat striking </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be very different.</v>

1004
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.013
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most influential countries </v>

1005
00:41:33.321 --> 00:41:34.154
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really take into consideration </v>

1006
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:39.710
<v Speaker 3>like there what they've contributed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>overall combat sports.</v>

1007
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Thailand is one of the most influential </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries ever next to Brazil.</v>

1008
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:44.743
<v Speaker 3>But I guess Japan because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first and foremost because the Japanese </v>

1009
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:53.330
<v Speaker 3>even taught Jujitsu to Elio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gracie and Carlos Gracie,</v>

1010
00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:54.164
<v Speaker 3>and then it became Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Brazil is responsible for a massive </v>

1011
00:41:57.381 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 3>amount of evolution of submission </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>

1012
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:05.480
<v Speaker 3>But other than that you got I guess </v>
<v Speaker 3>western wrestling,</v>

1013
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:06.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1014
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 3>but that's Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of countries.</v>

1015
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:12.420
<v Speaker 3>We did start talking about wrestling and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you got boxing,</v>

1016
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.720
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1017
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.850
<v Speaker 2>martial arts is not used as </v>
<v Speaker 2>predominantly in mma.</v>

1018
00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:19.400
<v Speaker 2>So like mma makes the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1019
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:20.263
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about Brazil and what </v>

1020
00:42:22.671 --> 00:42:24.710
<v Speaker 2>it's done for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the sport.</v>

1021
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the sports style of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1022
00:42:26.061 --> 00:42:26.894
<v Speaker 2>But like cook food was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a huge martial art from China and </v>

1023
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:31.930
<v Speaker 2>judo and karate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1024
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 2>before there was guns and bombs and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1025
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.890
<v Speaker 2>cucs everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was weird,</v>

1026
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.033
<v Speaker 2>it was like vikings who had fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>swords that like when across the globe </v>

1027
00:42:39.621 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 2>and fucking raped and pillaged and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated people and you know,</v>

1028
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.580
<v Speaker 2>humans millions a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember many years ago it was,</v>

1029
00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were animals and killing people and</v>

1030
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:54.920
<v Speaker 2>going to war and there were all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries made up,</v>

1031
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Samurais and made up their own style or </v>

1032
00:42:57.651 --> 00:42:59.090
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I think Burma,</v>

1033
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.780
<v Speaker 2>which is like right next to Thailand has</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Burmese boxing,</v>

1034
00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:03.614
<v Speaker 2>which is very similar to Cambodia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has tire it's own version of those </v>

1035
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:08.570
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1036
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1037
00:43:09.591 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 3>There was a Bondo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1038
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.210
<v Speaker 3>which is a from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's from Burma too,</v>

1039
00:43:14.211 --> 00:43:15.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1040
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:15.853
<v Speaker 3>But no kickbox some amazing that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>style that the ties use as far as the </v>

1041

1095
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 1>That was like a 15 year old in Thailand </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a boxer.</v>

1096
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:33.780
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1097
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Find a boxer has 90 fights and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty rare.</v>

1098
00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like he had like 150 images.</v>

1099
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Did he really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:43.973
<v Speaker 1>What is the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody's ever had an mma I think is </v>

1101
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:47.304
<v Speaker 1>Travis Fulton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Travis Fulton as like full 300 </v>

1102
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.870
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he has 300 fights.</v>

1103
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:53.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Horn I think at 200 or close to </v>

1104
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:56.290
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

1105
00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:57.803
<v Speaker 1>I thought I saw Jeremy Horn fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>this janky little fucking card once in </v>

1106
00:46:01.771 --> 00:46:03.030
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in California.</v>

1107
00:46:03.031 --> 00:46:03.864
<v Speaker 1>I forget where we want some Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>casino or something like that where you </v>

1108
00:46:06.721 --> 00:46:07.554
<v Speaker 1>weren't allowed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't allowed to punch you a lot </v>

1109
00:46:10.261 --> 00:46:13.950
<v Speaker 1>of slap slap to the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will have to kick to the face.</v>

1110
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.340
<v Speaker 1>And it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like when mma was illegal,</v>

1111
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.220
<v Speaker 1>like pink creation.</v>

1112
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When MMA was illegal there was like a </v>

1113
00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:22.914
<v Speaker 1>bunch of loopholes that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploiting cause you couldn't fight mma </v>

1114
00:46:26.221 --> 00:46:27.054
<v Speaker 1>in California for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they came up with all sorts of </v>

1115
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:32.310
<v Speaker 1>different ways of doing it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call,</v>

1116
00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:34.950
<v Speaker 1>you have to throw seven kicks before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have that.</v>

1117
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:36.023
<v Speaker 1>But they had slaps like that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was another thing that existed in </v>

1118
00:46:39.361 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The early days,</v>

1119
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:42.870
<v Speaker 1>the pancreas style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is real.</v>

1120
00:46:42.871 --> 00:46:43.704
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird to watch now boss route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys figured out how to insulate it </v>

1121
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:48.263
<v Speaker 1>though he hacked it because he threw </v>
<v Speaker 1>palms like punches where everybody else </v>

1122
00:46:51.901 --> 00:46:52.734
<v Speaker 1>was throwing bitch slaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bas rutten was knocking guys out with </v>

1123
00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:58.950
<v Speaker 1>palm strikes cause he was throwing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>palm upper cuts and palm hooks.</v>

1124
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.310
<v Speaker 1>He figured out how to hack it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1125
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.440
<v Speaker 1>That crazy fucker is he fucking kicked </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lever.</v>

1126
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 1>That lever cake.</v>

1127
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's uh,</v>

1128
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.340
<v Speaker 1>he's another guy who paid the price </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically his uh,</v>

1129
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:15.203
<v Speaker 1>his craziness and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his madness in his pursuit because he </v>

1130
00:47:17.761 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would talk about,</v>

1131
00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:20.544
<v Speaker 1>I mean talked about on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would just shoot cortisone into his </v>

1132
00:47:22.711 --> 00:47:26.820
<v Speaker 1>joints and his shins and just numb </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything up and lie to Cain.</v>

1133
00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:30.700
<v Speaker 1>He shoot lidacain into his shins and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they cannot lie to keynes,</v>

1134
00:47:30.701 --> 00:47:32.920
<v Speaker 1>a numbing agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Novacane right.</v>

1135
00:47:32.921 --> 00:47:34.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like the gay cousin of cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1136
00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.200
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get you high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just leaves me numb and confused.</v>

1137
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't cousin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1141
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:46.990

<v Speaker 1>it's interesting like it makes you like,</v>

1142
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 1>you feel weak and disoriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not,</v>

1149
00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.570
<v Speaker 1>So he would inject it into the Shin so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't because he was injured his,</v>

1150
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.660
<v Speaker 1>because he wouldn't feel it when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked it.</v>

1151
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to ask boss again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the full story.</v>

<v Speaker 1>His knees are completely shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all bone on bone.</v>

1155
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.830
<v Speaker 1>He was actually going to get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>resurfaced.</v>

1156
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen when someone gets it </v>
<v Speaker 1>resurfaced?</v>

1157
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.350
<v Speaker 1>My friend Steve Graham had his knee </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1158
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you a picture of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get grossed out.</v>

1159
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:27.063
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1160
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.040
<v Speaker 1>he was on the Olympic ski team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Why am I fucking am in so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on the US ski team,</v>

1162
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:33.994
<v Speaker 1>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1163
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.940
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't any Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was um,</v>

1164
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:43.080
<v Speaker 1>a top flight skier and had upwards of 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>operations on his knee.</v>

1165
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exaggerating.</v>

1166
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:48.670
<v Speaker 1>And this is what his needs look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1167
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:56.230
<v Speaker 1>The resurface the inside of his knee </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was bone on bone,</v>

1168
00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.243
<v Speaker 1>so they put steel caps over the joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way his Tibia and fibula </v>

1169
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:05.583
<v Speaker 1>intersect with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm assuming that like they </v>

1170
00:49:07.421 --> 00:49:08.254
<v Speaker 1>don't rust or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stainless steel slide over each </v>

1171
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:12.150
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speak.</v>

1172
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And that white shit is like a artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>meniscus,</v>

1173
00:49:15.701 --> 00:49:19.390
<v Speaker 1>like artificial padding in between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>steel.</v>

1174
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:20.261
<v Speaker 1>How's it work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it good?</v>

1175
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:22.770
<v Speaker 1>If he's happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all good.</v>

1176
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1177
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a crazy fucker.</v>

1178
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.393
<v Speaker 1>He's in pain all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just one of those dudes </v>

1179
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.410
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] some people just not a suck </v>
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>

1180
00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Would you have done to your knee?</v>

1181
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tore my MCL,</v>

1182
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.570
<v Speaker 2>my MCL,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like detached from my Shin and then that</v>

1183
00:49:41.571 --> 00:49:46.520
<v Speaker 2>allowed my knee and I tore my acl and </v>
<v Speaker 2>half and then I partially tore my lcl.</v>

1184
00:49:46.521 --> 00:49:47.354
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like four 10 ins and your whole </v>

1185
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:49.893
<v Speaker 2>journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two of them were completely torn </v>

1186
00:49:51.741 --> 00:49:54.920
<v Speaker 2>and then one of them was pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to being completely joint.</v>

1187
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened there?</v>

1188
00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:00.090
<v Speaker 2>I took a fight on short notice and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Vegas.</v>

1189
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I did 40 a Chinese guy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like the sand chow.</v>

1190
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what Sanchez was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

1191
00:50:06.951 --> 00:50:07.784
<v Speaker 2>they told me the rules for like five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes before the fight in the back of </v>

1192
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.760
<v Speaker 2>backstage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was throwing it,</v>

1193
00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:15.050
<v Speaker 2>went to throw a knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I was like standing on one foot,</v>

1194
00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:18.620
<v Speaker 2>as I was standing on one foot throwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the knee,</v>

1195
00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.320
<v Speaker 2>he'd kicked right under my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my knee.</v>

1196
00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:24.590
<v Speaker 2>And it shifted so hard that it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>ripped my blow everything out.</v>

1197
00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1198
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:26.533
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1199
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:29.750
<v Speaker 2>be in the savage that I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1200
00:50:29.751 --> 00:50:30.584
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took the eight countenance stood up and </v>

1201
00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to fight anyway and I'm like,</v>

1202
00:50:34.641 --> 00:50:35.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to kick my leg.</v>

1203
00:50:35.631 --> 00:50:36.441
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1204
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as he runs to kick my leg,</v>

1205
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:39.973
<v Speaker 2>I jumped over it like Aha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I landed on the one that went out </v>

1206
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:44.511
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1207
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:45.344
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it wasn't completely </v>

1208
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:48.680
<v Speaker 2>torn at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely was after that,</v>

1209
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.540
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1210
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:51.201
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

1211
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:53.140
<v Speaker 2>And then that same fight I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1212
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 2>my other knee ended up getting like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter size piece of cartilage torn out</v>

1213
00:50:57.891 --> 00:50:59.230
<v Speaker 2>and was floating around in the joint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1214
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.073
<v Speaker 2>it was a rough fight.</v>

1215
00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:01.700
<v Speaker 2>It was a rough thousand dollars back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

1216
00:51:01.701 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Joe Thousand Bottles and bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's out for a year.</v>

1217
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.720
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm going out.</v>

1218
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.630
<v Speaker 2>So it was out for a year and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I came back I just went on a terror</v>

1219
00:51:12.631 --> 00:51:13.464
<v Speaker 2>and that goes on at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on my belt and when like I don't </v>

1220
00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.340
<v Speaker 2>tend to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think after that immediately after,</v>

1221
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:19.703
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of surgery did they do to do </v>

1222
00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:25.520
<v Speaker 2>cadavers and cadavers and a scope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have that.</v>

1223
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:26.730
<v Speaker 2>You can't even tell if you look up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>

1224
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:27.603
<v Speaker 2>his name was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>

1225
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.173
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doctor Maura and a Orange City of </v>

1226
00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Warren's to do an amazing job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1227
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Speaker 2>he fought with the insurance company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me it was,</v>

1228
00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:37.010
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want to do the cadaver </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1229
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.233
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to like what they do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll actually cut a sliver out of </v>

1230
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 2>your hamster tele or your hamstring </v>
<v Speaker 2>tendon,</v>

1231
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:46.760
<v Speaker 2>which is the big fat 10 in that goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to the front of your knee.</v>

1232
00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.950
<v Speaker 2>I had that done and it would cut a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sliver out of that.</v>

1233
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:50.083
<v Speaker 2>Take that piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in your acl and then wait for </v>

1234
00:51:52.101 --> 00:51:54.530
<v Speaker 2>that to scar over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1235
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.113
<v Speaker 2>so I already have a weak knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fucking take the one of </v>

1236
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:00.590
<v Speaker 2>the only tendons I have left and make </v>
<v Speaker 2>that one week again.</v>

1237
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.720
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we did the cadaver thing,</v>

1238
00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:06.560
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a dead body Barton obviously.</v>

1239
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 2>And then I guess once they put it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>

1240
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:13.100
<v Speaker 2>like mutates it and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes a while to get soft again and then</v>

1241
00:52:13.101 --> 00:52:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body will take it out as its own.</v>

1242
00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:16.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

1243
00:52:16.541 --> 00:52:20.020
<v Speaker 1>it acts as a scaffolding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the cadaver itself is,</v>

1244
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:20.913
<v Speaker 1>stays in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body uses the tissue that the </v>

1245
00:52:22.901 --> 00:52:23.734
<v Speaker 1>cadaver graft is on to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>peripherally pro proliferate with its </v>

1246
00:52:29.111 --> 00:52:30.610
<v Speaker 1>own cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

1247
00:52:30.611 --> 00:52:33.220
<v Speaker 1>that's why they use an achilles tendon </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's larger.</v>

1248
00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I had that done in my right knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was way quicker recovery.</v>

1249
00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:40.120
<v Speaker 1>The left knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had bolt acl done the left knee,</v>

1250
00:52:40.121 --> 00:52:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I did the Patella thing like way back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1251
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 1993 or four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was back in the day,</v>

1252
00:52:48.221 --> 00:52:49.054
<v Speaker 1>they didn't do the cadaver back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only did the Patella tendon graft </v>

1253
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.800
<v Speaker 1>or they did even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hamstring,</v>

1254
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:54.783
<v Speaker 1>which is a real bad one cause then your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hamstring has to recover and they take </v>

1255
00:52:58.271 --> 00:53:01.930
<v Speaker 1>just take a chunk out of your hamstring </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then just fucking bolted into place.</v>

1256
00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.273
<v Speaker 1>I think that has to the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body has to proliferate it with </v>

1257
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:10.380
<v Speaker 1>cells and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to make,</v>

1258
00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:13.960
<v Speaker 1>you got to make sure that blood supplies</v>
<v Speaker 1>working and so it's a lot of work.</v>

1259
00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:14.903
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do like prp and all this cool </v>

1260
00:53:16.231 --> 00:53:17.700
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were talking about that Orange Shit.</v>

1261
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:18.563
<v Speaker 2>Last one is here.</v>

1262
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:19.983
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're doing stem cell treatments </v>

1263
00:53:21.071 --> 00:53:23.060
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Daniel Cormier,</v>

1264
00:53:23.061 --> 00:53:25.030
<v Speaker 1>I had that done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really close to get knee,</v>

1265
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:28.500
<v Speaker 1>had some stem cells in it and heals </v>
<v Speaker 1>right up.</v>

1266
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 1>It was right up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing.</v>

1267
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:30.744
<v Speaker 1>They can take what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're finding with stem cells is that </v>

1268
00:53:33.331 --> 00:53:34.164
<v Speaker 1>it can take on the form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're doing it from </v>

1269
00:53:36.841 --> 00:53:37.980
<v Speaker 1>women's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1270
00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>placenta,</v>

1271
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.810
<v Speaker 1>like a woman who gets a sterian section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll take a young girl who's getting it</v>

1272
00:53:42.811 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 1>says hereon section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take her placenta and they take the</v>

1273
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:46.284
<v Speaker 1>stem cells out of that and then they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>inject it into various areas of your </v>

1274
00:53:48.781 --> 00:53:51.990
<v Speaker 1>body and it can become anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be good but tendon,</v>

1275
00:53:51.991 --> 00:53:54.780
<v Speaker 1>it can become a ligament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could repair torn muscles.</v>

1276
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.540
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do,</v>

1277
00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:01.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's also some danger apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you go to Mexico.</v>

1278
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1279
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:05.910
<v Speaker 1>some dude went to a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

1280
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:06.773
<v Speaker 1>I think he went to like six different </v>
<v Speaker 1>places to get stem cells cause he had a </v>

1281
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:11.480
<v Speaker 1>back problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1282
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.373
<v Speaker 1>he started growing some weird tumor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his back that was like pressing on his </v>

1283
00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:21.681
<v Speaker 1>spine and when they cut the tumor out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized it was not his tissue,</v>

1284
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:27.420
<v Speaker 1>that it was like someone else's tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>was growing in his body.</v>

1285
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody like whoever's stem cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1286
00:54:32.671 --> 00:54:35.220
<v Speaker 1>He's like trying to get like a uterus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a uterus is laying around.</v>

1287
00:54:35.221 --> 00:54:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean since I was off of that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1288
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.913
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give him that fucking tumor we took out </v>

1289
00:54:40.111 --> 00:54:41.340
<v Speaker 1>of the guide stem cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1290
00:54:41.341 --> 00:54:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Other work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fund can say,</v>

1291
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:47.780
<v Speaker 1>well if you're going to Russia or Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil and cut off often in there.</v>

1292
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously not a doctor so I don't,</v>

1293
00:54:51.441 --> 00:54:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what they did in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these other countries that uh,</v>

1294
00:54:56.001 --> 00:54:58.830
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to pass off as stem cells</v>

1295
00:54:58.831 --> 00:54:59.664
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what the fuck they injected </v>

1296
00:55:00.541 --> 00:55:01.374
<v Speaker 1>this guy with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it used to be you'd have to go to </v>

1297
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:06.890
<v Speaker 1>foreign countries to get stem cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatments cause you know,</v>

1298
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:07.733
<v Speaker 1>they weren't exactly sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was eight apparently helped this guy </v>

1299
00:55:09.871 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 1>once and then it started to go away.</v>

1300
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever benefits he was getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>started going away.</v>

1301
00:55:13.981 --> 00:55:14.814
<v Speaker 1>And then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to go on a fucking mad </v>

1302
00:55:16.231 --> 00:55:18.390
<v Speaker 1>tear all across the world and get stem </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>

1303
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:22.890
<v Speaker 1>third world stem cells towards believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work out for him.</v>

1304
00:55:22.891 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked.</v>

1305
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:24.880
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1306
00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.713
<v Speaker 1>they cut like a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cod out of his back and then </v>

1307
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:30.534
<v Speaker 1>they've probably to fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave him like American stem cells </v>

1308
00:55:32.821 --> 00:55:34.970
<v Speaker 1>and everything's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's done anything.</v>

1309
00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Homeboys toast and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely saying,</v>

1310
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his quote was,</v>

1311
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.720
<v Speaker 1>don't go in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would advise people strongly not to go</v>

1312
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:47.070
<v Speaker 1>with anecdotal evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid advice right there.</v>

1313
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.880
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1314
00:55:49.881 --> 00:55:52.000
<v Speaker 1>and don't help me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My shoulder,</v>

1315
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.913
<v Speaker 1>my shoulder was pretty fucked and I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cells and it's fucking fantastic </v>

1316
00:55:55.921 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1317
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:58.860
<v Speaker 1>it feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he gets a little sore sometimes after</v>

1318
00:55:58.861 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 1>a hard workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just ice it up and it's good to go.</v>

1319
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Like all the strength is hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

1320
00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.430
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1321
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:05.483
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it a lot on pro athletes </v>

1322
00:56:07.171 --> 00:56:08.004
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of athletes that are </v>

1323
00:56:08.941 --> 00:56:10.500
<v Speaker 1>getting it done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>

1324
00:56:10.501 --> 00:56:11.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1325
00:56:11.491 --> 00:56:12.324
<v Speaker 1>there's very little way to get certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas to heal without taking me just </v>

1326
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:18.350
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of time off or surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1327
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 1>But when you're talking about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of injury,</v>

1328
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just par for the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>with</v>

1329
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.761
<v Speaker 3>your business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1330
00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:25.380
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1331
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:28.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that live in my own,</v>

1332
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.090
<v Speaker 3>all my joints hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My elbows are sort of shit right now.</v>

1333
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.013
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1334
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.173
<v Speaker 3>uncle's herb man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course my chest still hurts </v>

1335
00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:37.060
<v Speaker 3>from that last man standing tournament </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had a couple of years ago.</v>

1336
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:40.780
<v Speaker 3>My neck gets a chest hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to pick a broken sternum,</v>

1337
00:56:40.781 --> 00:56:41.261
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1338
00:56:41.261 --> 00:56:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I said.</v>

1339
00:56:42.491 --> 00:56:43.270
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1340
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:45.280
<v Speaker 3>did you ever get an Mri?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got an MRI,</v>

1341
00:56:45.281 --> 00:56:46.114
<v Speaker 3>did injections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did all kinds of stuff that they have </v>

1342
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:48.601
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have this,</v>

1343
00:56:48.601 --> 00:56:49.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

1344
00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:51.363
<v Speaker 3>I guess like a Hematoma that's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the rib cartilage or something </v>

1345
00:56:53.981 --> 00:56:56.410
<v Speaker 3>and it swells out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still swollen.</v>

1346
00:56:56.411 --> 00:56:58.660
<v Speaker 3>And he was like a golf ball right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1347
00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.480
<v Speaker 3>she might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

1348
00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.313
<v Speaker 3>it would get so bad that it would swell </v>
<v Speaker 3>up like a fucking tennis ball and then </v>

1349
00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:07.450
<v Speaker 3>that would pinch off all the nerves </v>
<v Speaker 3>running down my arm.</v>

1350
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:08.280
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrific.</v>

1351
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Be All fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only way to fix that,</v>

1352
00:57:10.501 --> 00:57:12.340
<v Speaker 3>it's probably to open you up like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>

1353
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that out.</v>

1354
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Hope it doesn't come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Proofing on the daily,</v>

1355
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:18.790
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what you taken?</v>

1356
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much all the time.</v>

1357
00:57:19.931 --> 00:57:22.990
<v Speaker 3>You know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend or I have a friend,</v>

1358
00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:25.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a ultra marathon runner and he was</v>

1359
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:28.720
<v Speaker 3>taking Ibuprofen every morning and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was also taking it at night.</v>

1360
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.280
<v Speaker 3>You're taking 800 milligrams in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>

1361
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:34.390
<v Speaker 3>800 milligrams at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I had this woman on who's a,</v>

1362
00:57:34.391 --> 00:57:35.320
<v Speaker 3>a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>

1363
00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda Patrick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a clinical researcher.</v>

1364
00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:41.620
<v Speaker 3>And she was talking about the dangers of</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsteroidal antiinflammatories.</v>

1365
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.650
<v Speaker 3>They cause high blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can cause strokes and some people,</v>

1366
00:57:44.651 --> 00:57:46.360
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're using them on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>daily basis,</v>

1367
00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:49.240
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of people that are using</v>

1368
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:51.460
<v Speaker 3>nonsteroidal anti inflammatories and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

1369
00:57:51.461 --> 00:57:52.294
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fucked up loop that's going </v>

1370
00:57:53.501 --> 00:57:53.750
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1371
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:54.583
<v Speaker 3>This is the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you take nonsteroidal anti </v>

1372
00:57:57.011 --> 00:57:59.410
<v Speaker 3>inflammatories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually causes,</v>

1373
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:03.970
<v Speaker 3>it causes inflammation because it fucks </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the gut flora in your body,</v>

1374
00:58:03.971 --> 00:58:05.470
<v Speaker 3>especially if you take it on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>basis,</v>

1375
00:58:05.471 --> 00:58:06.304
<v Speaker 3>which in turns causes inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you're taking nonsteroidal anti </v>

1376
00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:11.830
<v Speaker 3>inflammatories to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>

1377
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.230
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pills that you're taking a deal with</v>

1378
00:58:14.231 --> 00:58:17.140
<v Speaker 3>joint pains sometimes are causing joint </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>

1379
00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.870
<v Speaker 3>And that's what my friend Cam Haynes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

1495
01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:48.054
<v Speaker 3>but I was always like the American guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was always like a la carte or the </v>

1496
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:50.850
<v Speaker 3>American cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1497
01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.013
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool that a Delaware is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have me see in the world a </v>

1498
01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>

1499
01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.300
<v Speaker 3>You had like a falling out with glory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1500
01:02:57.810 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we uh,</v>

1501
01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:00.660
<v Speaker 3>we just went our separate ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1502
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:01.860
<v Speaker 3>But you were saying that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught,</v>

1503
01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:04.500
<v Speaker 3>they were telling the commentators to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk shit about you.</v>

1504
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.813
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a speculation or is that I </v>

1505
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:10.240
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hm.</v>

1506
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.453
<v Speaker 3>Can't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was asked nicely not to talk </v>

1507
01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:15.320
<v Speaker 3>about anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you say?</v>

1508
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:16.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you think?</v>

1509
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Watching my fight with Gloria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you think the commentators were,</v>

1510
01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:24.150
<v Speaker 3>but it was your opinion on the date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's seat commentating.</v>

1511
01:03:24.151 --> 01:03:26.220
<v Speaker 3>He's interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1512
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.050
<v Speaker 3>being uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's done it before,</v>

1513
01:03:28.051 --> 01:03:31.350
<v Speaker 3>there are things that you see on </v>
<v Speaker 3>television when you're watching it.</v>

1514
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.213
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best view in the house is your </v>

1515
01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:36.960
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause the best view when you're watching</v>

1516
01:03:36.961 --> 01:03:37.794
<v Speaker 3>fights because when you're watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing or whether you're watching </v>

1517
01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:43.080
<v Speaker 3>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're watching on television,</v>

1518
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:44.063
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing it like inside the cage </v>
<v Speaker 3>and inside the ring and you've seen it </v>

1519
01:03:47.971 --> 01:03:48.804
<v Speaker 3>from the right angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of times when I'm </v>

1520
01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:52.410
<v Speaker 3>watching a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1521
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:53.850
<v Speaker 3>I have the best seat in the house.</v>

1522
01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:54.683
<v Speaker 3>You can't get any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm touching the actual ground that the </v>

1523
01:03:57.391 --> 01:03:58.620
<v Speaker 3>people are fighting on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in front of me.</v>

1524
01:03:58.621 --> 01:04:00.960
<v Speaker 3>There's a table and then right in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that I could reach out,</v>

1525
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:02.120
<v Speaker 3>but I can touch the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1526
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.530
<v Speaker 3>So he can't get any closer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I miss a lot of shit and I may watch it.</v>

1527
01:04:05.531 --> 01:04:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Is there a screen for you to watch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two screens,</v>

1528
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:08.783
<v Speaker 3>but I like to watch the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to watch the actual fight and </v>

1529
01:04:11.311 --> 01:04:12.600
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fight is playing in front of me.</v>

1530
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm looking up and then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking down at the screen.</v>

1531
01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:17.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking up and then when we get down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the screen,</v>

1532
01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:19.320
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes I have to do commentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm down in the screen,</v>

1533
01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:23.190
<v Speaker 3>but I want to watch the actual action </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing out.</v>

1534
01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:27.300
<v Speaker 3>And when that is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you don't see everything,</v>

1535
01:04:27.301 --> 01:04:28.134
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like there's some subtleties </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you see when you're looking at a </v>

1536
01:04:31.441 --> 01:04:32.274
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1537
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.980
<v Speaker 3>There's some things that you see in </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement where your brain,</v>

1538
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:36.043
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to think that all the years of </v>

1539
01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:40.740
<v Speaker 3>watching martial arts and doing martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>arts,</v>

1540
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:45.390
<v Speaker 3>my brain's chunked a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and I s I see certain traits</v>

1541
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.493
<v Speaker 3>and I see trends and I see things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see them when you're actually </v>

1542
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:52.820
<v Speaker 3>looking at the person's body better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do if you're looking at a monitor,</v>

1543
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:53.663
<v Speaker 3>a video representation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like there's sometimes the refs in </v>

1544
01:04:57.751 --> 01:04:58.584
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't see what's going on like </v>

1545
01:05:00.141 --> 01:05:00.660
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1546
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.493
<v Speaker 3>the refs here and there right behind the</v>
<v Speaker 3>RAF and so I might miss something or </v>

1547
01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:06.010
<v Speaker 3>their back is to me and they get hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>with an upper cut.</v>

1548
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.013
<v Speaker 3>You don't see what they get hit with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of times you miss a few </v>

1549
01:05:09.301 --> 01:05:12.480
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that taking that into consideration,</v>

1550
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:16.020
<v Speaker 3>I know that these guys were sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>ringside and they're watching it through</v>

1551
01:05:16.021 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 3>the ropes and they're seeing it live and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you don't catch anything.</v>

1552
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:19.833
<v Speaker 3>But I did think that the commentary was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little one sided and I did think that </v>

1553
01:05:23.891 --> 01:05:24.724
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of things that you were </v>

1554
01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:26.284
<v Speaker 3>doing that they weren't either picking </v>
<v Speaker 3>up on or they weren't giving you credit </v>

1555
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:30.210
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1556
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:34.360
<v Speaker 3>it all fairness you told me about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I saw the fight,</v>

1557
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I saw the fight and I was </v>

1558
01:05:36.131 --> 01:05:36.730
<v Speaker 3>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1559
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:37.241
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

1560
01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:38.074
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1561
01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.240
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting way there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about this fight.</v>

1562
01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.710
<v Speaker 3>You were right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was,</v>

1563
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it in my head then I watched it,</v>

1564
01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:46.480
<v Speaker 3>but I tried to be as objective as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

1565
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:47.343
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think they were giving you </v>

1566
01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:49.480
<v Speaker 3>credit for a lot of the shit you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1567
01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:50.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that,</v>

1568
01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:52.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I've a few</v>

1569
01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:54.360
<v Speaker 3>that is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1570
01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.200
<v Speaker 3>no one's ever done that in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever come up to me and said,</v>

1571
01:05:57.201 --> 01:05:58.820
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hype this guy up or hey,</v>

1572
01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.340
<v Speaker 3>talk shit about this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never happened ever.</v>

1573
01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:02.383
<v Speaker 3>But that's the UFC I could tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely see it possibly happening </v>

1574
01:06:06.471 --> 01:06:08.780
<v Speaker 3>in other organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you felt that,</v>

1575
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:10.541
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1576
01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:11.374
<v Speaker 2>the way that I was talked about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general had changed dramatically of </v>

1577
01:06:13.741 --> 01:06:14.380
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1578
01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:16.570
<v Speaker 2>in the last couple of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was what was weird.</v>

1579
01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Earl Hawaiian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came up to me and said the same thing</v>

1580
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:21.310
<v Speaker 2>last time I saw him was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they serve,</v>

1581
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:22.870
<v Speaker 2>talked about you really different now</v>

1582
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe hearing really had an inside mall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe at a mole inside fucking Gloria as</v>

1583
01:06:27.411 --> 01:06:28.140
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1584
01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:28.973
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

1585
01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gloria,</v>

1586
01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a lot for this sport,</v>

1587
01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country and worldwide.</v>

1588
01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1589
01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>they certainly are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish them the best.</v>

1590
01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and I do too.</v>

1591
01:06:37.821 --> 01:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1592
01:06:39.381 --> 01:06:43.340
<v Speaker 1>they were doing weird shit like on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>bio instead of all your accomplishments,</v>

1593
01:06:43.341 --> 01:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>95 professional fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

1594
01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.793
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like kicked out of his house and </v>

1595
01:06:46.781 --> 01:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>he was 17 fucking loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1596
01:06:49.671 --> 01:06:51.800
<v Speaker 1>a forced to go to four different high </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

1597
01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody hated him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His feet smell.</v>

1598
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1599
01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.300
<v Speaker 1>is like a rap sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1600
01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>they were definitely painting you out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1601
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>But that's also in their defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1602
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.700
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to develop personalities </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people tuned into,</v>

1603
01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:08.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's this guy who comes out with </v>

1604
01:07:09.261 --> 01:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>fucking prison pants on with la on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1605
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

1606
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:15.103
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wouldn't to live well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I develop or promote the fact that he </v>

1607
01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>was the first American to ever win a </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's essentially,</v>

1655
01:08:59.091 --> 01:09:02.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a more potent form of fish oil or </v>

01:12:07.501 --> 01:12:12.501
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin Syndrome or your body has too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much serotonin in it and sort of like a,</v>

1724
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.150
<v Speaker 3>when guys are on steroids and they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitched,</v>

1725
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:18.030
<v Speaker 3>it's same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like your body is like,</v>

1726
01:12:18.031 --> 01:12:20.220
<v Speaker 3>what is all this fucking Serotonin doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it here?</v>

1727
01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:23.310
<v Speaker 3>It's creates an imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

1728
01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.960
<v Speaker 3>they just don't work with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1729
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:29.560
<v Speaker 3>a Neil Brennan friend of mine who's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comic was the first guy that I ever met.</v>

1730
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.790
<v Speaker 3>It was on a five htp and then when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>got on Ssri,</v>

1731
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.690
<v Speaker 3>they told him to get off the five htp </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

1732
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 3>you're taking this too much going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1733
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.313
<v Speaker 3>Also the antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do is they create </v>

1734
01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.780
<v Speaker 3>serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1735
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it helps.</v>

1736
01:12:44.161 --> 01:12:44.721
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1737
01:12:44.721 --> 01:12:45.554
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it helps your body establish a better </v>

1738
01:12:48.001 --> 01:12:48.780
<v Speaker 3>mood.</v>

1739
01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.690
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know exactly what the Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been described to me,</v>

1740
01:12:51.691 --> 01:12:52.940
<v Speaker 3>but I can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1741
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.140
<v Speaker 3>recite it off memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1742
01:12:55.141 --> 01:12:55.974
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin and obviously is a big factor </v>

1743
01:12:57.961 --> 01:13:01.860
<v Speaker 3>in the way you feel growing up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking things like new mood.</v>

1744
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:03.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like athletes,</v>

1745
01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:05.130
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters,</v>

1746
01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.730
<v Speaker 3>you're constantly draining yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you are just,</v>

1747
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:09.743
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've seen your workouts dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just fucking empty it all out and </v>

1748
01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:14.820
<v Speaker 3>your body's just like boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's done.</v>

1749
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:18.480
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to regear up so your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body has to produce everything again.</v>

1750
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:19.314
<v Speaker 3>Your endocrine system is taxed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is taxed and you have to get </v>

1751
01:13:22.471 --> 01:13:25.440
<v Speaker 3>all the right food in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why fucking with any of that,</v>

1752
01:13:25.441 --> 01:13:29.430
<v Speaker 3>like taking the Ibuprofen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking cigarettes,</v>

1753
01:13:29.431 --> 01:13:31.320
<v Speaker 3>shitty food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff is like,</v>

1754
01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:35.100
<v Speaker 3>it has a massive effect on someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>does something that you do.</v>

1755
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.990
<v Speaker 3>Like you need every edge you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1756
01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a,</v>

1757
01:13:38.671 --> 01:13:39.504
<v Speaker 3>you're in the craziest business that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be when it comes to professional </v>

1758
01:13:42.661 --> 01:13:43.494
<v Speaker 3>athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the combat sports business </v>

1759
01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:48.900
<v Speaker 3>here in the business and arguably the </v>
<v Speaker 3>craziest of the combat sports cause it's</v>

1760
01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:50.820
<v Speaker 3>all just throwing bones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>there's no take,</v>

1762
01:13:52.621 --> 01:13:54.720
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking lay in pray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no hump.</v>

1763
01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:55.554
<v Speaker 3>And someone on the ground and holding </v>
<v Speaker 3>them down and no getting him in the </v>

1764
01:13:57.091 --> 01:13:58.650
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do any of that.</v>

1765
01:13:58.690 --> 01:14:00.630
<v Speaker 3>You got to throw bones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1766

<v Speaker 3>You need to all the advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

1768
01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:07.770
<v Speaker 3>I know you were working with a nic curse</v>
<v Speaker 3>on for awhile,</v>

1769
01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.880
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't work with him this last year.</v>

1770
01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.820
<v Speaker 3>It was like with Brovana coffin and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just really busy.</v>

1771
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.320
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1772
01:14:17.321 --> 01:14:18.154
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1773
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.560
<v Speaker 3>lately I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1774
01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.930
<v Speaker 3>four week notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My camps have been really short for both</v>

1775
01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:23.913
<v Speaker 3>my last two fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just hadn't had a chance to work </v>

1776
01:14:25.411 --> 01:14:27.940
<v Speaker 3>with I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think two or three times for this,</v>

1777
01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:29.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this last fight.</v>

1778
01:14:29.471 --> 01:14:30.160
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys,</v>

1779
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:30.993
<v Speaker 3>the guy's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say enough good things about </v>

1780
01:14:32.531 --> 01:14:33.161
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1781
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:35.560
<v Speaker 3>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An awesome fucking awesome.</v>

1782
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.900
<v Speaker 3>He never so much too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so different.</v>

1783
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:38.734
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I used to train and do like </v>

1784
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:42.100
<v Speaker 3>strength conditioning and working on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>own and stuff,</v>

1785
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:44.470
<v Speaker 3>it was like by how hard you worked and </v>
<v Speaker 3>every day it was,</v>

1786
01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a session with,</v>

1787
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.210
<v Speaker 3>with nick where I left and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

1788
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Like they were always hard and difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I never,</v>

1789
01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.090
<v Speaker 3>they were never like breaking me down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1790
01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.740
<v Speaker 3>the results and the level of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>increase every week was like really,</v>

1791
01:14:59.741 --> 01:15:01.360
<v Speaker 3>really noticeable and impressive.</v>

1792
01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the intelligent approach and </v>

1793
01:15:03.881 --> 01:15:06.820
<v Speaker 3>that's the approach that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trainers are using now is they're giving</v>

1794
01:15:06.821 --> 01:15:10.240
<v Speaker 3>you enough work so that your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>improves and recovers,</v>

1795
01:15:10.241 --> 01:15:12.880
<v Speaker 3>but not so much that your body can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve.</v>

1796
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.490
<v Speaker 3>So this old stupid idea that a lot of us</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

1797
01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:19.540
<v Speaker 3>and I used the APP just work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of there like you fucking,</v>

1798
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:23.110
<v Speaker 3>you can barely walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to leave it all in the gym,</v>

1799
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:24.403
<v Speaker 3>but that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't give you a chance to </v>

1800
01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:26.051
<v Speaker 3>recover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1801
01:15:26.051 --> 01:15:27.190
<v Speaker 3>And then like rest days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1802
01:15:27.191 --> 01:15:28.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1803
01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:29.643
<v Speaker 3>not killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to just crush myself on Monday </v>

1804
01:15:31.931 --> 01:15:32.764
<v Speaker 3>and then the rest of the week I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragging ass trying to make it by </v>

1805
01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:36.250
<v Speaker 3>Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rolled around and was like,</v>

1806
01:15:36.251 --> 01:15:39.430
<v Speaker 3>now your last three workouts a the week </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't that productive.</v>

1807
01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:40.990
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1808
01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:41.853
<v Speaker 3>I've been really into that a lot lately </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I started listening to Wa Pavel </v>

1809
01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Tatsu lean.</v>

1810
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.630
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy that brought kettle bells </v>
<v Speaker 3>to America.</v>

1811
01:15:49.631 --> 01:15:52.630
<v Speaker 3>It's this bad ass Russian dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

1812
01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:53.483
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has some really interesting ideas about </v>

1813
01:15:55.181 --> 01:15:56.014
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that he said that </v>

1814
01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:03.820
<v Speaker 3>I think is most important is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way you're training,</v>

1815
01:16:03.821 --> 01:16:06.070
<v Speaker 3>especially training with kettle bells in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

1816
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.233
<v Speaker 3>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're trying to do is you're </v>

1817
01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:13.570
<v Speaker 3>trying to give your body work so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body feels like,</v>

1818
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:15.183
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1819
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 3>it can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can recover.</v>

1820
01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.820
<v Speaker 3>And you slowly build upon these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and think of them as a skill.</v>

1821
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:22.923
<v Speaker 3>Like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strength is a skill and you're not </v>

1822
01:16:25.511 --> 01:16:26.344
<v Speaker 3>trying to leave yourself completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhausted and blown out and all your </v>

1823
01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:32.680
<v Speaker 3>joints are fried and all your muscles </v>
<v Speaker 3>are just rubber.</v>

1824
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Like you're trying to what he calls </v>
<v Speaker 3>grease the groove,</v>

1825
01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.400
<v Speaker 3>which means like slowly build this up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and do it.</v>

1826
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:42.640
<v Speaker 3>Like instead instead of sets of like 25 </v>
<v Speaker 3>wraps,</v>

1827
01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:43.750
<v Speaker 3>like crossfit style.</v>

1828
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:46.840
<v Speaker 3>He's like everything more than five reps</v>
<v Speaker 3>is bullshit.</v>

1829
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:49.330
<v Speaker 3>He's like everything more than five reps</v>
<v Speaker 3>is bodybuilding.</v>

1830
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:50.583
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be doing like heavyweight </v>

1831
01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:57.190
<v Speaker 3>five reps and if you can do 10 reps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do five like you don't need to do,</v>

1832
01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.173
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to work to failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't believe in working to </v>

1833
01:17:00.071 --> 01:17:02.380
<v Speaker 3>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing a bad job of explaining,</v>

1834
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:03.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his philosophies,</v>

1835
01:17:03.941 --> 01:17:04.774
<v Speaker 3>but tim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim Ferriss had two podcasts with them </v>

1836
01:17:07.141 --> 01:17:07.990
<v Speaker 3>where you could listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1837
01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll send them to you.</v>

1838
01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:09.694
<v Speaker 3>They're excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's kind of similar to like </v>

1839
01:17:10.881 --> 01:17:12.830
<v Speaker 3>the way nick least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that I see nick's training,</v>

1840
01:17:12.831 --> 01:17:13.664
<v Speaker 3>it's like trying to send a neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>signal to my body to grow or to change </v>

1841
01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:18.591
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to move.</v>

1842
01:17:18.591 --> 01:17:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to like destroy it to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1843
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't need a breakdown my muscle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to rebuild itself.</v>

1844
01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.010
<v Speaker 3>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a altitude training.</v>

1845
01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:28.890
<v Speaker 3>When you go to high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body has picks up a signal that I,</v>

1846
01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:29.763
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough oxygen in this air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to make more red blood cells so </v>

1847
01:17:32.601 --> 01:17:33.434
<v Speaker 3>your body sends a neuron neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>signal to create red blood cells from </v>

1848
01:17:36.981 --> 01:17:37.814
<v Speaker 3>your blue mirror or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your body's like a computer and </v>

1849
01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.240
<v Speaker 3>just trying to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1850
01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:42.980
<v Speaker 3>I want my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a little faster,</v>

1851
01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:46.460
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a little whatever and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing enough work to send that signal to</v>

1852
01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:48.530
<v Speaker 3>make my body adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1853
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:49.423
<v Speaker 3>As opposed to I want to be faster so I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to just destroy my legs until he </v>

1854
01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:54.560
<v Speaker 3>can't walk for a week and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to build back faster.</v>

1855
01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:55.350
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sense.</v>

1856
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:56.750
<v Speaker 3>It does work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

1857
01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it doesn't work good.</v>

1858
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:59.383
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right way to do it really is to </v>

1859
01:18:01.601 --> 01:18:02.221
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've,</v>

1860
01:18:02.221 --> 01:18:03.054
<v Speaker 3>I've been getting great results with </v>
<v Speaker 3>pebbles methods with doing lighter or </v>

1861
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:10.730
<v Speaker 3>not lighter weights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but lower reps,</v>

1862
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.640
<v Speaker 3>lower wraps in like if I could do eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>or nine reps,</v>

1863
01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:14.474
<v Speaker 3>I do five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do five and I ended there and like </v>

1864
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:18.020
<v Speaker 3>when I'm done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel good.</v>

1865
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm done with my workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I put in,</v>

1866
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>45 minutes or more of hard work,</v>

1867
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:23.953
<v Speaker 3>but I don't feel like broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas before when I was like sort of </v>

1868
01:18:27.561 --> 01:18:28.394
<v Speaker 3>structuring it off of my own ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just have these fucking brutal </v>

1869
01:18:31.881 --> 01:18:34.940
<v Speaker 3>workouts where I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was to failure.</v>

1870
01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Everything is right.</v>

1871
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:37.550
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

1872
01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.070
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when it was over,</v>

1873
01:18:39.071 --> 01:18:40.960
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like a Zombie for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the day.</v>

1874
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then now your serotonin levels,</v>

1875
01:18:43.061 --> 01:18:44.770
<v Speaker 3>by the time you're three days in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1876
01:18:44.771 --> 01:18:45.604
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need some new move because I don't </v>

1877
01:18:46.151 --> 01:18:46.984
<v Speaker 3>feel like I want to do this shit anymore</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're not going to perform as well </v>

1878
01:18:49.151 --> 01:18:51.610
<v Speaker 3>and you're not gonna you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a caffeine big thing.</v>

1879
01:18:51.611 --> 01:18:52.444
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was chugging 20 ounce starbucks like </v>

1880
01:18:54.101 --> 01:18:56.110
<v Speaker 3>they were nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to sleep,</v>

1881
01:18:56.350 --> 01:19:01.310
<v Speaker 3>I can take a 20 ounce Dar Bucket Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit doesn't work anyway at work.</v>

1882
01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1883
01:19:02.710 --> 01:19:04.840
<v Speaker 3>you can get to the point where your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just,</v>

1884
01:19:04.841 --> 01:19:06.400
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stimulants,</v>

1885
01:19:06.401 --> 01:19:07.270
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just,</v>

1886
01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:10.090
<v Speaker 3>you're just toast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:19:37.211 --> 01:19:38.044
<v Speaker 3>craze where people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only eat one meal a day because </v>

1902
01:19:40.091 --> 01:19:42.370
<v Speaker 3>that's what a road warrior did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would only eat once a day.</v>

1903
01:19:42.371 --> 01:19:43.440
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.490
<v Speaker 3>you're not a warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not a viking.</v>

1905
01:19:45.670 --> 01:19:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not a fucking barbarian.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Come up with a name that you can call </v>

1911

<v Speaker 3>certain types of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we'll work on that.</v>

1912
01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:07.293
<v Speaker 3>That's for time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's interesting that like </v>

1913
01:20:09.001 --> 01:20:09.834
<v Speaker 3>nutritional advice that people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>give you just 10 years ago isn't valid </v>

1914
01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:13.140
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1915
01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the,</v>

1916
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:18.930
<v Speaker 3>the ideas of a absorption of certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>fats and essential fatty acids that they</v>

1917
01:20:18.931 --> 01:20:19.764
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially plant based stuff just a few </v>

1918
01:20:20.761 --> 01:20:22.290
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're realizing like,</v>

1919
01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:24.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff exists in these platforms,</v>

1920
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:29.490
<v Speaker 3>but it's not as bio available as it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>in an animal forms.</v>

1921
01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:32.910
<v Speaker 3>And this is what really recent stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the Food Pyramid Shit.</v>

1922
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

1923
01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.860
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about that,</v>

1924
01:20:35.861 --> 01:20:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I guess margarine and butter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's better.</v>

1925
01:20:37.641 --> 01:20:39.660
<v Speaker 3>And I can't believe it's not butter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now it's not about,</v>

1926
01:20:39.661 --> 01:20:40.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's march,</v>

1928
01:20:42.511 --> 01:20:43.344
<v Speaker 3>It's one molecule away from plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they were telling people to </v>

1929
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:46.404
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the Food Pyramid said that you </v>

1930
01:20:47.941 --> 01:20:50.220
<v Speaker 3>should have like 300 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate today.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're a child.</v>

1939
01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:03.363
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which the food pyramid was based around </v>

1940
01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.750
<v Speaker 3>the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want,</v>

1941
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:08.303
<v Speaker 3>they need people to buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to buy the fucking oats and grains that </v>

1942
01:21:11.611 --> 01:21:12.840
<v Speaker 3>we grow here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>wheat and how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how corn is subsidized.</v>

1951
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Have they paid people to grow corn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the government pays farmers to grow</v>

1952
01:21:34.711 --> 01:21:35.544
<v Speaker 3>corn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the government didn't subsidize corn </v>

1953
01:21:37.201 --> 01:21:38.034
<v Speaker 3>production,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this company corn agricultural like </v>

1954
01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:41.003
<v Speaker 3>would fucking collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's so many of these people </v>

1955
01:21:43.021 --> 01:21:43.854
<v Speaker 3>that are reliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these agricultural farms that are </v>

1956
01:21:46.441 --> 01:21:49.830
<v Speaker 3>growing corn reliant on government </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsidies in order to stay afloat.</v>

1957
01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:52.200
<v Speaker 3>It's weird and corns and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Corn,</v>

1960
01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:00.060
<v Speaker 3>didn't know this has corn in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>

1961
01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Corn Syrup is one protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything right?</v>

1962
01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:03.450
<v Speaker 3>Corn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protein,</v>

1963
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:05.730
<v Speaker 3>corn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protein in fucking beef jerky.</v>

1964
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:09.570
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking corn heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a new one.</v>

1965
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Corn,</v>

<v Speaker 3>protein in beef Jerky,</v>

1969
01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.153
<v Speaker 3>beef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The protein that you would think would </v>

1970
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:21.360
<v Speaker 3>be in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1971
01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:22.203
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it must have something to do with </v>

1972
01:22:23.161 --> 01:22:26.340
<v Speaker 3>the flavoring or something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sauce that they,</v>

1974
01:22:28.531 --> 01:22:30.030
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck they do when they make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1975
01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:34.200

<v Speaker 3>I have seen it all too.</v>

1978
01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:40.740
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1979
01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:44.130
<v Speaker 3>so what's the plan now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you come off of a fight like that?</v>

1980
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.233
<v Speaker 3>What'd he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just chillax for a little bit and </v>

1981
01:22:46.411 --> 01:22:47.244
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1982
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:49.840
<v Speaker 3>I had two back to back fights anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1983
01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.073
<v Speaker 3>and I'm looking forward to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a little time off for relaxing a </v>

1984
01:22:53.311 --> 01:22:54.144
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting my mind wrapped around what </v>

1985
01:22:56.011 --> 01:22:57.060
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it happened,</v>

1986
01:22:57.090 --> 01:22:57.923
<v Speaker 3>where I go from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you move around your training </v>

1987
01:22:59.761 --> 01:23:01.560
<v Speaker 3>camps at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you bring in new trainers?</v>

1988
01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.493
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever go to places and spend a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of time working with someone </v>

1989
01:23:04.651 --> 01:23:05.890
<v Speaker 3>different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm numb.</v>

1990
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.813
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'll be up in stockton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Latin hoping an acre ready for his </v>

1991
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:11.230
<v Speaker 3>fight with conor now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1992
01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:12.363
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always good to work with those </v>

1993
01:23:12.671 --> 01:23:13.420
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1994
01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:16.360
<v Speaker 3>I want to get some boxing rounds in with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Perez when I'm up there.</v>

1995
01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.720
<v Speaker 3>So Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1996
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:19.330
<v Speaker 3>not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1997
01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to,</v>

1998
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:20.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1999
01:23:20.951 --> 01:23:23.700
<v Speaker 3>I think my team is really solid and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2000
01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:24.603
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where I need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at American top team is a little </v>

2001
01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:27.813
<v Speaker 3>before when the sock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got nine mail the first time it was </v>

2002
01:23:29.601 --> 01:23:31.390
<v Speaker 3>an American top team working on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling and stuff.</v>

2003
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:32.880
<v Speaker 3>And then was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

2004
01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:34.840
<v Speaker 3>it was a cool experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was the best experience</v>

2005
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:39.540
<v Speaker 3>from just being away from my sports </v>
<v Speaker 3>system of my coaches and my team.</v>

2006
01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.473
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a mistake to to jump </v>

2007
01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:45.220
<v Speaker 3>ship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak and go train someplace else.</v>

2008
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.473
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that there's a lot of </v>

2009
01:23:47.111 --> 01:23:51.130
<v Speaker 3>comforts of home that help relax you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just being in the,</v>

2010
01:23:51.131 --> 01:23:54.970
<v Speaker 3>in the same environment all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably real good for you in terms</v>

2011
01:23:54.971 --> 01:23:58.390
<v Speaker 3>of like your comfort level recovery and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in your own home.</v>

2012
01:23:58.630 --> 01:23:59.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think just your coaches and being </v>

2013
01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:03.280
<v Speaker 3>with somebody that's you for 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he knows what you're thinking,</v>

2014
01:24:03.281 --> 01:24:05.020
<v Speaker 3>you know what he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows how you are,</v>

2015
01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:06.670
<v Speaker 3>what you need to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how hard to work,</v>

2016
01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:07.530
<v Speaker 3>do things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2017
01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knows when you're tired,</v>

2018
01:24:09.161 --> 01:24:11.320
<v Speaker 3>when you're off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a good understanding of you.</v>

2019
01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think I liked the fact that you've</v>

2020
01:24:13.571 --> 01:24:14.404
<v Speaker 3>gone away from the MMA and decided to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight back to kickboxing cause you </v>

2021
01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:19.480
<v Speaker 3>know what do you 32 now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2022
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just like,</v>

2023
01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.800
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so good at kickboxing.</v>

2024
01:24:23.801 --> 01:24:25.060
<v Speaker 3>It's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2025
01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:25.894
<v Speaker 3>it's such an emerging sport too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And with this opportunity with Bella </v>

2026
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:29.644
<v Speaker 3>tour too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a really good idea because </v>

2027
01:24:31.211 --> 01:24:35.440
<v Speaker 3>like learning all the wrestling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning all the fucking submissions and</v>

2028
01:24:35.441 --> 01:24:37.510
<v Speaker 3>take down defense and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2029
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:39.670
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole nother experience.</v>

2030
01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:42.330
<v Speaker 3>A whole nother like journey to get on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2031
01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

2032
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.553
<v Speaker 3>I think it's too late for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like if I went into a boxing </v>

2033
01:24:46.451 --> 01:24:47.590
<v Speaker 3>career now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2034
01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:49.240
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

2035
01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.950
<v Speaker 3>you can throw and you can take some </v>
<v Speaker 3>shots,</v>

2036
01:24:50.951 --> 01:24:54.190
<v Speaker 3>but like you don't have 150 amateur </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing fights,</v>

2037
01:24:54.191 --> 01:24:55.870
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to catch up.</v>

2038
01:24:56.530 --> 01:24:57.363
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your body is programmed to do </v>

2039
01:24:58.451 --> 01:25:01.270
<v Speaker 3>certain things already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you brought your body's program for</v>

2040
01:25:01.271 --> 01:25:04.300
<v Speaker 3>certain distances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you buy like kick him.</v>

2041
01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:06.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh he can't kick him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what my problem is with him.</v>

2042
01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:07.140
<v Speaker 3>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2043
01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:09.520
<v Speaker 3>my body has been programmed that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in,</v>

2044
01:25:10.210 --> 01:25:12.280
<v Speaker 3>when we get close to marina and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>clench,</v>

2045
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:13.930
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pull you into the clinch.</v>

2046
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:14.621
<v Speaker 3>I get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2047
01:25:14.621 --> 01:25:16.180
<v Speaker 3>when I do that [inaudible] pull you </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2048
01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:17.600
<v Speaker 3>Like you're taken out and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2049
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:22.420
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard for me to think the push </v>
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>

2050
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:23.323
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to stop this because everything </v>

2051
01:25:24.551 --> 01:25:28.180
<v Speaker 3>I've done for the last 17 years of my </v>

<v Speaker 3>California quite a bit because he was at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aka for awhile.</v>

2118

<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's he doing up there?</v>

2119
01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:38.163
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that he was working with Luke </v>

2120
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:41.660
<v Speaker 3>for the last fight and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2121
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:44.300
<v Speaker 3>think he might be moving out this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2122

<v Speaker 3>And so important for the growth and </v>

2141
01:28:27.381 --> 01:28:28.214
<v Speaker 3>development of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what he's done with American top </v>

2142
01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:33.560
<v Speaker 3>team and putting together this world </v>
<v Speaker 3>class facility,</v>

2143
01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:37.340
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spending millions of dollars to do it.</v>

2144
01:28:37.341 --> 01:28:42.080
<v Speaker 3>Just throwing money at that and having </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys take advantage of that.</v>

2145
01:28:42.081 --> 01:28:44.150
<v Speaker 3>And he had guys rip him off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a lot,</v>

2146
01:28:44.151 --> 01:28:46.190

<v Speaker 3>happen a lot.</v>

2147
01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:48.790
<v Speaker 3>And then when the black zillions came </v>
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>

2148
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.720
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys bailed because that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>paid him.</v>

2149
01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 3>He paid people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on over to me,</v>

2150
01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.140
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2151
01:28:54.141 --> 01:28:54.974
<v Speaker 3>he just sort of poached a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people allegedly according to Dan tells </v>

2152
01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 3>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who knows?</v>

2153
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.610
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what the fuck happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the end of the day,</v>

2154
01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 3>guy like Dan Lambert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super important.</v>

2155
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:07.074
<v Speaker 3>You need like these like wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefactors who take these chances and </v>

2156
01:29:09.181 --> 01:29:11.250
<v Speaker 3>put together these facilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in my opinion,</v>

2157
01:29:11.251 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 3>no one's done it like Dan has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it handle a new facility out there?</v>

2180
01:30:07.081 --> 01:30:08.550
<v Speaker 3>coming up,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's this first?</v>

2182
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:11.453
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cowboys.</v>

2183
01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.760

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2185
01:30:16.570 --> 01:30:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that guy is big.</v>

2186
01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.410
<v Speaker 3>He's a big fella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was bigger than cowboy boots.</v>

2187
01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I caught him in the triangle,</v>

2188
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.790
<v Speaker 3>but he just looked great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like Kofi haven body,</v>

2189
01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:24.624
<v Speaker 3>like one 85 and then he started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his first fight was at two oh five he </v>

2190
01:30:27.091 --> 01:30:28.260
<v Speaker 3>dropped Tito Ortiz.</v>

2191
01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:29.123
<v Speaker 3>This is way back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's when Tito was a light heavyweight </v>

2192
01:30:30.991 --> 01:30:31.824
<v Speaker 3>champ I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think Tito was either champ or in </v>

2193
01:30:36.901 --> 01:30:37.620
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

2194
01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:38.453
<v Speaker 3>Tito was in his prime and he lost to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tito at light heavyweight and then went </v>

2195
01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:44.370
<v Speaker 3>down to one 85 fought Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing very well,</v>

2196
01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.233
<v Speaker 3>very smart fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fought a very smart fight against </v>

2197
01:30:47.821 --> 01:30:48.654
<v Speaker 3>Anderson where he was like making </v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson lead in Anderson is really a </v>

2198
01:30:51.331 --> 01:30:52.164
<v Speaker 3>counter guy and he was just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>laying back and Anderson didn't like it </v>

2199
01:30:54.551 --> 01:30:55.384
<v Speaker 3>and he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Anderson does not like it when he </v>

2200
01:30:56.401 --> 01:30:59.010
<v Speaker 3>had like a weird knee popped or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and then he blew out.</v>

2201
01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:00.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2202
01:31:01.051 --> 01:31:01.884
<v Speaker 3>kick and his knee just buckled and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaped in on him and shit happens </v>

2203
01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:05.730
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2204
01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.010
<v Speaker 3>weird freak shit like that happens a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this sport.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that you don't even know what goals,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're still standing on and everything </v>

2209
01:31:17.011 --> 01:31:17.844
<v Speaker 3>seems fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you throw a kick and it just </v>

2210
01:31:19.231 --> 01:31:21.150
<v Speaker 3>gives out.</v>

2211
01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:22.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is [inaudible] he's a </v>

2212
01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:24.600
<v Speaker 3>stud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2213
01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:28.020
<v Speaker 3>tough fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to have cowboy work,</v>

2214
01:31:28.021 --> 01:31:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2215
01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:29.733
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninja looked fucking aussie like </v>

2216
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:34.470
<v Speaker 3>terminator that night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he looks like,</v>

2217
01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.180
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked like a world,</v>

2218
01:31:36.181 --> 01:31:38.730
<v Speaker 3>but going to happy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legit world champion.</v>

2219
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2220
01:31:39.751 --> 01:31:41.640
<v Speaker 3>I hope he can keep that together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

2221
01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:44.980
<v Speaker 3>I think one 70 I think these guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are fucking dumb,</v>

2222
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:47.460
<v Speaker 3>depleting themselves so badly to cut </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

2223
01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:49.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that's going to be a thing of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the past.</v>

2224
01:31:49.351 --> 01:31:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people gotta realize like,</v>

2225
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:54.110
<v Speaker 3>this is not the benefit that you get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

2226
01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.153
<v Speaker 3>it's negligible cowboys weighing like </v>
<v Speaker 3>one 76 somewhere around that and he's </v>

2227
01:31:59.200 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 3>cutting just a little</v>

2228
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.590
<v Speaker 2>bit of weight and making one 70 easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2229
01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I think he was like four or five pounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>off when he came for zero.</v>

2230
01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:11.050
<v Speaker 2>We sparked a couple of weeks before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and he was like 14 days out and he</v>

2231
01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:11.884
<v Speaker 2>was like five pounds like you'd be out </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat where even when everyone nice </v>

2232
01:32:15.551 --> 01:32:18.790
<v Speaker 2>shit drinking a beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so fucking ridiculous.</v>

2233
01:32:18.791 --> 01:32:21.700
<v Speaker 2>What that eight drinks beer up until the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day of the weigh ins.</v>

2234
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.630
<v Speaker 2>That can't be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2235
01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2236
01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:30.700
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of beer is probably okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well boss route and said that.</v>

2237
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.800
<v Speaker 2>He said he used to drink beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2238
01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I drink beer every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink a little bit of beer.</v>

2239
01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.760
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get fucking drunk.</v>

2240
01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:41.320
<v Speaker 2>You drink a little beer when you're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp?</v>

2241
01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:42.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink a little beer when I'm in camp </v>

2242
01:32:44.050 --> 01:32:46.070
<v Speaker 2>after the weigh in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not ever immediately after the way I am,</v>

2243
01:32:46.071 --> 01:32:49.420
<v Speaker 2>but I'm at and when I'm all fed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehydrated and feeling good,</v>

2244
01:32:49.421 --> 01:32:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of mine.</v>

2245
01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I like to be relaxed,</v>

2249
01:33:02.861 --> 01:33:03.694
<v Speaker 2>so stressful now for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you get so like mentally just </v>

2250
01:33:07.541 --> 01:33:09.730
<v Speaker 2>stressed out and you can't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

2261
01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.890
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try not to think about the fight,</v>

2262
01:33:29.891 --> 01:33:30.724
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cowboy the same way as we get a little </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2265
01:33:37.841 --> 01:33:39.550
<v Speaker 2>and you're already tired and you sat at </v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

2266
01:33:39.551 --> 01:33:41.650
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that you can think of is </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Saturday night,</v>

2267
01:33:41.651 --> 01:33:42.870
<v Speaker 2>this guy's gonna try and kill me and </v>

<v Speaker 2>stresses you the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2271
01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:49.600
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As opposed to like go in and see a movie</v>

2272
01:33:49.601 --> 01:33:51.250
<v Speaker 2>and relaxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2273
01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:52.253
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the thoughts of the fight come up </v>

2274
01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:55.270
<v Speaker 2>and your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you purposely ignore them,</v>

2275
01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:56.950
<v Speaker 2>push them aside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2276
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.650
<v Speaker 2>If they're not helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2277
01:33:58.670 --> 01:34:00.490
<v Speaker 2>There's something I can't change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2278
01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't over analyze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2279
01:34:02.490 --> 01:34:03.323
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So watch my fight my is a million times </v>

2280
01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:06.603
<v Speaker 2>before I bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like I'll watch them fight and </v>

2281
01:34:08.071 --> 01:34:08.904
<v Speaker 2>maybe once or twice and see if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that jumps out at me that it </v>

2282
01:34:12.341 --> 01:34:13.174
<v Speaker 2>looked like he does this sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that turned out to </v>

2283
01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:18.670
<v Speaker 2>overanalyze it and make it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do it now.</v>

2284
01:34:18.671 --> 01:34:20.590
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a smart way to do it because it's</v>

2285
01:34:20.591 --> 01:34:23.980
<v Speaker 2>like you're doing all the work anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing all the work in the gym.</v>

2286
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:28.030
<v Speaker 2>You're prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the mindset needs time off too,</v>

2287
01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:29.710
<v Speaker 2>just like the body does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2288
01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've,</v>

2289
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:33.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is cowboy drink and a beard or fight </v>

2290
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:37.080
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it changed the,</v>

2291
01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:37.983
<v Speaker 2>what is body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's done to train for the last 12 </v>

2292
01:34:40.121 --> 01:34:42.700
<v Speaker 2>years of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to perform because you're</v>

2293
01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:43.541
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2294
01:34:43.541 --> 01:34:44.374
<v Speaker 2>I think being relaxed and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>confident and comfortable and then </v>

2295
01:34:47.831 --> 01:34:50.080
<v Speaker 2>getting in there and handling business </v>
<v Speaker 2>at night,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you did some work with vinny shoreman,</v>

2301
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:01.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had on the podcast,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2303

<v Speaker 3>before that Vinnie's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he calls himself a mental coach.</v>

2304
01:35:07.131 --> 01:35:09.200
<v Speaker 3>She does hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he calls himself a mental coach.</v>

2305
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:10.610
<v Speaker 3>And before that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2306
01:35:10.611 --> 01:35:12.170
<v Speaker 3>well what's the deal with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnotism?</v>

2307
01:35:12.171 --> 01:35:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is shit legit.</v>

2308
01:35:14.150 --> 01:35:16.370
<v Speaker 3>And then he put me under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had them do it and I was like,</v>

2309
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should I woke up?</v>

2310
01:35:17.571 --> 01:35:20.500
<v Speaker 3>My pants were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to have him do timeline therapy on</v>

2311
01:35:20.501 --> 01:35:21.680
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

2312
01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Timeline therapy is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a hypnosis state,</v>

2313
01:35:24.991 --> 01:35:27.060
<v Speaker 2>but you're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2314
01:35:27.061 --> 01:35:31.470
<v Speaker 2>like a timeline and a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Jesus born whatever,</v>

2315
01:35:31.471 --> 01:35:32.640
<v Speaker 2>World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War II.</v>

2316
01:35:32.970 --> 01:35:34.440
<v Speaker 2>And he kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>

2317
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:37.390
<v Speaker 2>did you feel like you floated up at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're under?</v>

2318
01:35:37.410 --> 01:35:37.840
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2319
01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.490
<v Speaker 3>Didn't feel like I floated but I felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I went inward more.</v>

2320
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it almost felt like I was on</v>

2321
01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:45.680
<v Speaker 3>a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this one</v>

2322
01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.433
<v Speaker 2>you almost like you pull back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you pull back and you'll go up and </v>

2323
01:35:49.941 --> 01:35:50.774
<v Speaker 2>go be out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that probably sounds so weird to people </v>

2324
01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:54.620
<v Speaker 2>that don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fuck them,</v>

2325
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you go like straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back into the sky.</v>

2326
01:35:57.170 --> 01:35:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're like almost,</v>

2327
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:59.400
<v Speaker 2>it feels like you're floating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2328
01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:01.940
<v Speaker 2>like I know what it feels like to fly </v>
<v Speaker 2>based off of that.</v>

2329
01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:03.320
<v Speaker 2>And you go up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2330
01:36:03.321 --> 01:36:03.651
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2331
01:36:03.651 --> 01:36:06.620
<v Speaker 2>up and you're looking at your life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a timeline and it will be like,</v>

2332
01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:08.520
<v Speaker 2>think about a time when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2333
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:11.570
<v Speaker 2>as far back as you could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember and you will tap into some shit</v>

2334
01:36:11.571 --> 01:36:12.404
<v Speaker 2>from like a Jew childhood that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even know that you even </v>

2335
01:36:14.121 --> 01:36:15.140
<v Speaker 2>remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2336
01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.513
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2337
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:20.210
<v Speaker 2>some really some really far out stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it will change a lot of things.</v>

2338
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:21.643
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everything that's ever happened to </v>

2339
01:36:24.891 --> 01:36:26.300
<v Speaker 2>your whole life isn't you've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

2340
01:36:26.301 --> 01:36:30.650
<v Speaker 2>heard is where did that information go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it didn't fall out of your head.</v>

2341
01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:31.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there,</v>

2342
01:36:31.641 --> 01:36:34.550
<v Speaker 2>you just can't access it anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have a hard time accessing it.</v>

2343
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.863
<v Speaker 2>And with these hypnosis things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have opportunity to still tap into </v>

2344
01:36:40.401 --> 01:36:43.520
<v Speaker 2>that or get better at tapping into them </v>
<v Speaker 2>accessing that information.</v>

2345
01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.800
<v Speaker 2>So what did you get out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2346
01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:50.690
<v Speaker 2>I remember I said I forgive my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2347
01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:51.950
<v Speaker 2>49.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2348
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I hated my dad's guts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hated him.</v>

2349
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:57.250
<v Speaker 2>My Dad did some really shitty things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me when a,</v>

2350
01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:59.330
<v Speaker 2>and I hated him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated him.</v>

2351
01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:00.740
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vinny,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2357
01:37:07.881 --> 01:37:08.714
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to see if you'd like </v>

2358
01:37:09.271 --> 01:37:10.420
<v Speaker 2>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no clue.</v>

2359
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:11.450
<v Speaker 2>It was going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2360
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:12.284
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had me think of all these times of my </v>

2361
01:37:13.791 --> 01:37:17.480
<v Speaker 2>life and when I felt really proud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I felt really afraid,</v>

2362
01:37:17.481 --> 01:37:19.580
<v Speaker 2>when I felt really scared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I felt really strong,</v>

2363
01:37:19.581 --> 01:37:21.380
<v Speaker 2>when I felt really all these emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2364
01:37:21.381 --> 01:37:22.214
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was probably about 45 minutes and </v>

2365
01:37:24.650 --> 01:37:27.500
<v Speaker 2>every single one of the emotions was </v>
<v Speaker 2>some other time with my dad.</v>

2366
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:30.380
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2367
01:37:30.381 --> 01:37:32.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we got done with the session,</v>

2368
01:37:32.031 --> 01:37:32.864
<v Speaker 2>like I couldn't even tap into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred that I had from my dad anymore </v>

2369
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:37.670
<v Speaker 2>and I fucking hated him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I found out he had cancer,</v>

2370
01:37:37.671 --> 01:37:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit and fucking,</v>

2371
01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2372
01:37:41.181 --> 01:37:42.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that session,</v>

2373
01:37:42.171 --> 01:37:43.004
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have that anger anymore and I </v>

2374
01:37:45.711 --> 01:37:46.820
<v Speaker 2>couldn't even find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2375
01:37:46.821 --> 01:37:49.250
<v Speaker 2>And I used to be able to like look in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mirror and think about my dad and my</v>

2376
01:37:49.251 --> 01:37:50.780
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are ready to be so fucking mad.</v>

2377
01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to fight when I was,</v>

2378
01:37:52.641 --> 01:37:53.474
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do a lot of things that were </v>

2379
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 2>based off of</v>

2380
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.270
<v Speaker 3>like shoving up my dad's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2381
01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 3>I want to show him not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting the person,</v>

2382
01:37:59.671 --> 01:38:02.300
<v Speaker 3>like not pretending it's my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was more like I'm going to,</v>

2383
01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:03.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a lot of motivation from my dad </v>

2384
01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:05.820
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2385
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.380
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the session was over,</v>

2386
01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:09.660
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even tap into that.</v>

2387
01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I was able to go and I decided to go and</v>
<v Speaker 3>start a new relationship with my dad and</v>

2388
01:38:14.881 --> 01:38:17.880
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like I forgive you but say </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sorry.</v>

2389
01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:18.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still,</v>

2390
01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:20.880
<v Speaker 3>it was like I just didn't give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore that like,</v>

2391
01:38:20.881 --> 01:38:22.110
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2392
01:38:22.111 --> 01:38:22.944
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that really knew me really well </v>

2393
01:38:25.171 --> 01:38:26.004
<v Speaker 3>could just see me differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was like this chip that I </v>

2394
01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:29.670
<v Speaker 3>carried around on my shoulder that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't there anymore.</v>

2395
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:31.800
<v Speaker 3>It was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nuts.</v>

2396
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:33.750
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting thing.</v>

2397
01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of timeline therapy,</v>

2398
01:38:35.851 --> 01:38:40.290
<v Speaker 3>the idea of thinking about your life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to separate yourself,</v>

2399
01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:41.363
<v Speaker 3>like who you are right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go back and look at all these </v>

2400
01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:44.484
<v Speaker 3>moments in your life and what they meant</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you and how you're carrying that </v>

2401
01:38:46.411 --> 01:38:50.040
<v Speaker 3>around today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be very valuable to people.</v>

2402
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:51.090
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>

2403
01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:52.213
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2404
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:53.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does all kinds of stuff.</v>

2405
01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:54.970
<v Speaker 3>You have a phobia,</v>

01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.240
<v Speaker 3>There is a tricky one because in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>places the Eskimo is a,</v>

2521
01:43:40.250 --> 01:43:42.430
<v Speaker 3>is an insult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in like Alaska,</v>

2522
01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:43.713
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a problem with Eskimo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the people that live in certain </v>

2523
01:43:46.631 --> 01:43:48.430
<v Speaker 3>parts of Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently they,</v>

2524
01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:50.020
<v Speaker 3>that's what they call them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they like it.</v>

2525
01:43:50.770 --> 01:43:53.570
<v Speaker 3>It's Omni issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends is totally geographical.</v>

2526
01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.680
<v Speaker 3>Who else would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2527
01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:58.360
<v Speaker 3>an Eskimo outside of Alaska in you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in you.</v>

2528
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:59.203
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they live a different parts of the </v>

2529
01:44:00.891 --> 01:44:01.420
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2530
01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in Canada,</v>

2531
01:44:03.291 --> 01:44:04.124
<v Speaker 3>Eskimo may be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an insult because they're not from </v>

2532
01:44:07.521 --> 01:44:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Alaska.</v>

2533
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:09.163
<v Speaker 3>I just think they're the same people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just prefer a different name </v>

2534
01:44:13.521 --> 01:44:14.410
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2535
01:44:14.411 --> 01:44:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I like the people in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call themselves a,</v>

2536
01:44:17.610 --> 01:44:19.640
<v Speaker 3>the natives call them cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First nations.</v>

2537
01:44:20.210 --> 01:44:20.841
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2538
01:44:20.841 --> 01:44:21.320
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

2539
01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.210
<v Speaker 3>you can't call them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indians are not Indians.</v>

2540
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:24.103
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's essentially the same kind of </v>

2541
01:44:25.251 --> 01:44:27.350
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just in a different spot.</v>

2542
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:29.090
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2543
01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.150
<v Speaker 3>It's all weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2544
01:44:32.151 --> 01:44:34.030
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Travelers calm.</v>

2545
01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.590
<v Speaker 3>A traveler traveler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is there.</v>

2546
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:39.320
<v Speaker 3>He's a funny guy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucked with Vladimir Klitschkos head.</v>

2547
01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:42.080
<v Speaker 3>He really fucked with his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a funny motherfucker.</v>

2548
01:44:42.110 --> 01:44:43.130
<v Speaker 3>He's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very funny.</v>

2549
01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible sanger though.</v>

2550
01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Tell him to stop singing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

2551
01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:52.290
<v Speaker 3>But they're having this a heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>title and getting to go to the family is</v>

2552
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:53.900
<v Speaker 3>a trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they really?</v>

2553
01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:55.700
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2554
01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.790
<v Speaker 3>who else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2555
01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:58.673
<v Speaker 3>over cross?</v>

2556
01:44:58.910 --> 01:45:00.350
<v Speaker 3>He's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2557
01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tough fuckers,</v>

2558
01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:04.003
<v Speaker 3>but makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Theory does like interviews from inside </v>

2559
01:45:06.711 --> 01:45:07.544
<v Speaker 3>his trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2560
01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:09.590
<v Speaker 3>does he really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw one the other day.</v>

2561
01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:13.190
<v Speaker 3>He still has a trailer still as a world </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>

2562
01:45:13.210 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's living in a trailer.</v>

2563
01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.073
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2564
01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:16.780
<v Speaker 3>The traveler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2565
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:19.430
<v Speaker 3>It's proud of is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think he keeps the house too?</v>

2566
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:21.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

2567
01:45:22.570 --> 01:45:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

2568
01:45:23.451 --> 01:45:27.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't think being a traveler from what</v>
<v Speaker 3>might know about,</v>

2569
01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.330
<v Speaker 3>well I don't really fuck do I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that there,</v>

2570
01:45:29.331 --> 01:45:31.430
<v Speaker 3>it's about the money thing because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think a lot of those people have,</v>

2571
01:45:31.610 --> 01:45:32.443
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2572
01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:37.010
<v Speaker 3>have money in flashy stuff and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like their way of life.</v>

2573
01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

2574
01:45:38.190 --> 01:45:40.220
<v Speaker 3>You had to be able to pick up and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>

2575
01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:43.400
<v Speaker 3>So they just don't want to have roots.</v>

2576
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:46.280
<v Speaker 3>They liked to be able to just have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they call him caravans.</v>

2577
01:45:46.281 --> 01:45:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I saw them and he snatch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite movie of all time.</v>

2578
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.903
<v Speaker 3>Favorite movie of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could fucking recite that entire </v>

2579
01:45:52.341 --> 01:45:54.380
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There he is.</v>

2580
01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2581
01:45:57.890 --> 01:46:00.320
<v Speaker 3>Heavyweight boxer can't even stand up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his trailer.</v>

2582
01:46:01.190 --> 01:46:04.880
<v Speaker 3>He's too tall for his own trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where you actually get of in.</v>

2583
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:06.610
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can get out of it.</v>

2584
01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:11.420

<v Speaker 3>The kids,</v>

2594
01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:36.680
<v Speaker 3>the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the kids are still good.</v>

2595

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2598
01:46:42.531 --> 01:46:44.630

<v Speaker 3>fights,</v>

2599
01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:46.580
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have no rounds.</v>

2600
01:46:46.581 --> 01:46:50.250
<v Speaker 3>They have some weird rules and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>all fight with their fucking jeans on.</v>

2601
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have like their own court system </v>

2602
01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:52.883
<v Speaker 3>and like that's if you have a dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's somewhat like food </v>

2603
01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.340
<v Speaker 3>dispute and then the fight over it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you know it's settled,</v>

2604
01:46:59.341 --> 01:47:00.470
<v Speaker 3>when it's settled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's settled.</v>

2605
01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:03.510
<v Speaker 3>We'll have like a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a file full on fucking fight.</v>

2606
01:47:03.511 --> 01:47:05.280
<v Speaker 3>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the law.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2611
01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:11.993
<v Speaker 3>But it's just interesting to watch it </v>
<v Speaker 3>all play out on youtube because you </v>

2612
01:47:14.341 --> 01:47:15.174

2613
01:47:17.911 --> 01:47:18.744

2614
01:47:20.731 --> 01:47:22.410
<v Speaker 3>that's ever had a chance to wash these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

2615

<v Speaker 3>Challenge each other.</v>

<v Speaker 3>shade and there's a ton of them online.</v>

2617

<v Speaker 3>they don't have,</v>

2621
01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:44.880
<v Speaker 3>there's not like a lot of history behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in terms of uh,</v>

2622
01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:49.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a documented culture and they could</v>

2623
01:47:49.711 --> 01:47:50.544
<v Speaker 3>go away like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that might not be here </v>

2624
01:47:52.861 --> 01:47:53.694
<v Speaker 3>a hundred years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we might be watching a type of </v>

2625
01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:58.560
<v Speaker 3>people or a group of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>living a certain way that,</v>

2626
01:47:59.190 --> 01:48:01.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things might change and the next hundred</v>

2627
01:48:01.710 --> 01:48:04.440
<v Speaker 3>years and they might integrate back into</v>
<v Speaker 3>society like these fucking people,</v>

01:48:39.781 --> 01:48:40.614
<v Speaker 3>talking to me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's so interesting to see </v>

2639
01:48:42.301 --> 01:48:43.134
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff on youtube because like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have like a view into this culture </v>

2640
01:48:48.001 --> 01:48:50.850
<v Speaker 3>that we just never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never would have gotten this before.</v>

2641
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.080
<v Speaker 3>You would have heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2642
01:48:52.081 --> 01:48:52.914
<v Speaker 3>Patio Brian called out mickey fuck face </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they met in the swamps and duked it </v>

2643
01:48:57.031 --> 01:48:57.780
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2644
01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:59.880
<v Speaker 3>but see in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2645
01:48:59.881 --> 01:49:00.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2646
01:49:00.931 --> 01:49:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I would like them to be able to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>their way of life and all that.</v>

2647
01:49:02.881 --> 01:49:04.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that they shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do this,</v>

2648
01:49:04.531 --> 01:49:08.610
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying that it's possible that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that might not be there in 50 years.</v>

2649
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:10.650
<v Speaker 3>I these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't really have us,</v>

2650
01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:13.200
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a city.</v>

2651
01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:14.940
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of delicate.</v>

2652
01:49:14.970 --> 01:49:15.803
<v Speaker 3>Their existence is fairly delicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're talking about </v>

2653
01:49:18.301 --> 01:49:19.134
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh these are guys that live in Detroit </v>

2654
01:49:20.731 --> 01:49:23.490
<v Speaker 3>and Detroit always had this sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gypsy community.</v>

2655
01:49:23.530 --> 01:49:24.363
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2657
01:49:27.151 --> 01:49:28.950
<v Speaker 3>places we travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't want them there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I have friends who are from London and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a house that is in some suburb,</v>

2659
01:49:34.621 --> 01:49:35.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they call it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>England,</v>

2660
01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they call it a suburb in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>

2661
01:49:37.710 --> 01:49:41.340
<v Speaker 3>They had this house and these travelers </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved next to their house.</v>

2662
01:49:41.341 --> 01:49:42.630
<v Speaker 3>There was like a lot next to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They just set up shop party till fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>four o'clock in the morning through </v>

2664
01:49:46.321 --> 01:49:48.670
<v Speaker 3>garbage in the street and nobody could </v>
<v Speaker 3>do shit.</v>

2665
01:49:48.671 --> 01:49:49.504
<v Speaker 3>They're all scared to say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's scared to say anything and </v>

2666
01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:54.820
<v Speaker 3>you can't like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no laws.</v>

2667
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no law against what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

2668
01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:59.350
<v Speaker 3>Cause there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't discriminate against these,</v>

2669
01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.273
<v Speaker 3>these travelers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's this weird situation where </v>

<v Speaker 3>you're pulling the AB wheel that's </v>

2749
01:53:28.881 --> 01:53:32.930
<v Speaker 3>connected to your feet forward and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing frog fitness.</v>

2750
01:53:33.570 --> 01:53:34.403
<v Speaker 3>I just pulled it up cause you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked like a frog while you're doing </v>

2751
01:53:36.381 --> 01:53:38.540
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is frog fitness,</v>

2752
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:43.750
<v Speaker 3>fill out one of our forms or click here </v>
<v Speaker 3>to head to our new website.</v>

2753
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:47.130
<v Speaker 3>So they sent me two of these to the gym </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me to try out and I was like Oh that</v>

2754
01:53:47.131 --> 01:53:48.470
<v Speaker 3>looks like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

2755
01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:49.333
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like a burpee and you like </v>

2756
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:52.220
<v Speaker 3>almost immediate exhaustion like that.</v>

2757
01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:53.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah that thing is one of the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 3>workouts I've ever had and they're </v>

2758
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:58.190
<v Speaker 3>marketing it for like a lot of the NFL </v>
<v Speaker 3>training camps are getting it cause it's</v>

2759
01:53:58.191 --> 01:54:01.130
<v Speaker 3>like the same position for right for </v>
<v Speaker 3>football,</v>

2760
01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:03.320
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a beast of a thing.</v>

2761
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:05.990
<v Speaker 3>So that would make sense that it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be really good for wrestling too.</v>

2762
01:54:05.991 --> 01:54:06.824
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2763
01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.530
<v Speaker 3>the new evolution in fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2764
01:54:09.531 --> 01:54:10.364
<v Speaker 3>So it's got resistance bands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you push the forward cart and the </v>

2765
01:54:14.031 --> 01:54:16.180
<v Speaker 3>resistance bands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2766
01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:20.000
<v Speaker 3>are resisting you as you push forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you pull your legs forward.</v>

2767
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This looks fucking bad ass.</v>

2768
01:54:22.730 --> 01:54:26.570
<v Speaker 3>It works every part of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like immediate exhaustion.</v>

2769
01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:27.463
<v Speaker 3>Like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like nothing else I've ever used </v>

2770
01:54:28.371 --> 01:54:29.360
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking awesome.</v>

2771
01:54:29.370 --> 01:54:30.260
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenny man.</v>

2772
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:31.123
<v Speaker 3>And do you feel any benefit of this when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a sparring or when you're </v>

2773
01:54:33.471 --> 01:54:35.180
<v Speaker 3>training or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used it for like cardio,</v>

2774
01:54:35.181 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 3>I even used it.</v>

2775
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:37.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can read,</v>

2776
01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:39.470
<v Speaker 3>you can set it so that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be in one place,</v>

2777
01:54:39.471 --> 01:54:41.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that you're not going anywhere.</v>

2778
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:42.223
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like you would get up really </v>

2779
01:54:44.601 --> 01:54:45.434
<v Speaker 3>hard workouts to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll do that with my altitude </v>

2780
01:54:48.170 --> 01:54:52.370
<v Speaker 3>machine cause it just zaps you get so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking tired so fast.</v>

2781
01:54:52.371 --> 01:54:54.200
<v Speaker 3>So I try to do that even at high </v>
<v Speaker 3>altitude.</v>

2782
01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:55.513
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this girl was using it to do like </v>

2783
01:54:57.441 --> 01:55:00.170
<v Speaker 3>cleans and presses and she's doing like </v>
<v Speaker 3>rose with it.</v>

2784
01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.980
<v Speaker 3>So the wheel also acts as resistance </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the bands.</v>

2785
01:55:03.981 --> 01:55:04.814
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can put like a 160 pounds in the </v>

2786
01:55:06.141 --> 01:55:07.880
<v Speaker 3>thing or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something else.</v>

2787
01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:08.990
<v Speaker 3>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2788
01:55:08.991 --> 01:55:09.824
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you use fat or bands and then it </v>

2789
01:55:11.751 --> 01:55:15.050
<v Speaker 3>makes more resistance as you push </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward is just the guy who invented it.</v>

2790
01:55:15.051 --> 01:55:17.720
<v Speaker 3>He looks like a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry Buddy.</v>

2791
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Not in a bad way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frogs are awesome.</v>

2792
01:55:21.130 --> 01:55:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Frogs get your high if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2793
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:23.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this,</v>

2794
01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:26.660
<v Speaker 3>this one right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy's got it fully loaded up.</v>

2795
01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

2796
01:55:29.210 --> 01:55:30.470
<v Speaker 3>That is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Map.</v>

2797
01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could put a bunch.</v>

2798
01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:34.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different ways to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing.</v>

2799
01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2800
01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I like it must give you a fucking hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a core workout.</v>

2801
01:55:40.641 --> 01:55:41.474
<v Speaker 3>How it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2802
01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:42.800
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to,</v>

2803
01:55:42.801 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking terrible.</v>

2804
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.540
<v Speaker 2>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I fucking hate it and like,</v>

2805
01:55:45.541 --> 01:55:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exhausting.</v>

2806
01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:47.873
<v Speaker 2>Exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your strength and conditioning </v>

2807
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 2>when you're not working with curse on </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what do you do?</v>

2808
01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you just mostly concentrate on fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>preparation,</v>

2809
01:55:53.821 --> 01:55:55.710
<v Speaker 2>like pad work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sparring,</v>

2810
01:55:55.711 --> 01:55:57.060
<v Speaker 2>bag work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines?</v>

2811
01:55:57.510 --> 01:56:00.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not working with Kirsten and I run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do a lot of sprints,</v>

2812
01:56:00.511 --> 01:56:01.890
<v Speaker 2>would be allowed to bought us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2813
01:56:01.891 --> 01:56:02.724
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly explained to bottle that people </v>

2814
01:56:04.861 --> 01:56:07.230
<v Speaker 2>don't want to bother 50th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interval thing.</v>

2815
01:56:07.231 --> 01:56:08.064
<v Speaker 2>It's eight rounds of 15 seconds of work </v>
<v Speaker 2>or 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of </v>

2816
01:56:12.181 --> 01:56:13.680
<v Speaker 2>rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're doing is you're going as</v>

2817
01:56:13.681 --> 01:56:16.170
<v Speaker 2>fast and as hard as you can for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>

2818
01:56:16.171 --> 01:56:19.140
<v Speaker 2>getting your heart rate as high as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and then immediately went,</v>

2819
01:56:19.230 --> 01:56:21.060
<v Speaker 2>20 seconds is up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have 10 seconds of rest.</v>

2820
01:56:21.070 --> 01:56:21.903
<v Speaker 2>So you're training your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your heart rate to get used to spiking </v>

2821
01:56:25.861 --> 01:56:28.050
<v Speaker 2>and they come back down in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're training your,</v>

2822
01:56:28.051 --> 01:56:29.300
<v Speaker 2>it can increase your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2823
01:56:29.490 --> 01:56:31.080
<v Speaker 2>your vo two Max,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like incredibly.</v>

2824
01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:33.850
<v Speaker 2>And to bought us is like really a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of my,</v>

2825
01:56:33.890 --> 01:56:35.460
<v Speaker 2>my cardio sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2826
01:56:35.461 --> 01:56:36.294
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing protocol that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented that I don't know who invented </v>

2827
01:56:39.871 --> 01:56:41.280
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be a four minute round total,</v>

2828
01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:43.610
<v Speaker 2>eight times of eight of 20 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2829
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:44.633
<v Speaker 2>But it sort of goes along the same lines</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what we're talking about with nick </v>

2830
01:56:47.641 --> 01:56:50.340
<v Speaker 2>curse on is doing or what a pebble Tatsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead is doing.</v>

2831
01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:51.413
<v Speaker 2>It's not about massive amounts of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amount doing it smart and doing it </v>

2832
01:56:54.301 --> 01:56:57.210
<v Speaker 2>the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these 22nd sprint and he's ten second</v>

2833
01:56:57.211 --> 01:56:58.440
<v Speaker 2>brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2834
01:56:58.441 --> 01:57:00.510
<v Speaker 2>what a massive impact it has on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>cardio.</v>

2835
01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:02.340
<v Speaker 2>And he can do that with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be on a,</v>

2836
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:04.410
<v Speaker 2>you could be running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be happy,</v>

2837
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:06.550
<v Speaker 2>even hit pads with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2838
01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:08.280
<v Speaker 2>do a bag work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2839
01:57:08.281 --> 01:57:10.530
<v Speaker 2>hard as you can for 20 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then 10 seconds off.</v>

2840
01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:12.190
<v Speaker 2>You think about that sort of hellified </v>
<v Speaker 2>is anyway,</v>

2841
01:57:12.210 --> 01:57:13.043
<v Speaker 2>have a 22nd bursts and you're like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds and getting your shit together </v>

2842
01:57:15.001 --> 01:57:18.210
<v Speaker 2>and the 22nd bursts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that a lot.</v>

2843
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:19.103
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2844
01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:20.123
<v Speaker 2>lately I've been doing a lot more just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pad work and speed work and I'm using a </v>

2845
01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:24.960
<v Speaker 2>double end bag a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2846
01:57:24.970 --> 01:57:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2847
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:29.700
<v Speaker 2>for a long time I was trying to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2848
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000
<v Speaker 2>very physical and very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my outworking the other person and being</v>

2849
01:57:35.491 --> 01:57:39.570
<v Speaker 2>like more aggressive and I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get more to,</v>

2850
01:57:39.710 --> 01:57:41.460
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed and technique,</v>

2851
01:57:41.530 --> 01:57:44.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they tried to outwork people.</v>

2852
01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:46.890
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a smart move.</v>

2853
01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely a smart way to go.</v>

2854
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:50.700
<v Speaker 2>And it was exactly what I did last </v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday night,</v>

2855
01:57:50.701 --> 01:57:51.534
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2856
01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Jason Wellness Wellness Day at the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>of four,</v>

2857
01:57:54.091 --> 01:57:55.440
<v Speaker 2>it was like a really good example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2858
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:56.910
<v Speaker 2>And that was a very good example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2859
01:57:56.970 --> 01:57:57.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wellness is a dangerous </v>

2860
01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:00.180
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's very dangerous.</v>

2861
