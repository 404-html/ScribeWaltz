2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.430
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard for us to wrap our heads around how big the whole picture is.</v>

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:05.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>We are billion year old carbon.</v>

13
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.481
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

15

<v Speaker 1>Fucking Joni Mitchell.</v>

17
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.951
<v Speaker 1>Joni Mitchell.</v>

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And who was a Crosby stills.</v>

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>They covered is eye what it was.</v>

21
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>That's her song.</v>

22
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant Song.</v>

24
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>And it's so true.</v>

25
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.230
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing that people do understand human beings actually made because</v>

26
00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>the star Burns out explodes.</v>

27
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>And that has to happen.</v>

28
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.051
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't happen,</v>

29
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't make those materials and human life,</v>

30
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>carbon based life forms don't,</v>

31
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:38.041
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

32
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:38.491
<v Speaker 1>don't exist.</v>

33
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>So even if it doesn't work out,</v>

34
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>it works out.</v>

35
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's part of it.</v>

53
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Super easy.</v>

54
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.420

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Like how's it going?</v>

75

76
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.881
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

77
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:17.240

82
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I ended up forwarding it to a bunch of people because I knew a bunch of other</v>

83
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>people were going through some weird shit.</v>

84

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 1>So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart trouble.</v>

88
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>No one about their religion,</v>

89
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>respect others in their view and demand that they respect yours.</v>

90
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.583

<v Speaker 1>Prepare a noble death song for the day.</v>

95
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>When you go over to the great divide,</v>

96
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting up or passing a friend,</v>

97
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>even a stranger,</v>

98
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>when an are lonely place,</v>

99
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>show respect to all people and grovel to none.</v>

100
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 1>When you arrived in the morning,</v>

101
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>give thanks for the food,</v>

102
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>for the joy of living.</v>

103
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>If you see no reason for giving thanks.</v>

104
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>The fault lies only in yourself.</v>

105
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.601
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

106
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:14.961
<v Speaker 1>abused.</v>

107
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:18.380
<v Speaker 1>No one or no thing for abuse turns the wise ones into fools.</v>

108
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And Rob's a spirit of its division.</v>

109
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>When it comes your time to die being out like those whose hearts are filled with</v>

110
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:27.350
<v Speaker 1>fear and death so that their time comes,</v>

111
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 1>they weep.</v>

112
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>They pray for more,</v>

113
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>a little time and live their lives again over and over in a different way.</v>

114
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.593
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

115
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.020
<v Speaker 1>sing near death song and die like a hero going home.</v>

116
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking beautiful.</v>

117
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.281

<v Speaker 1>Probably do pilfered some stuff off the internet and pieced it together.</v>

152
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:25.584
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

156
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>I agree with everything you said.</v>

157
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:27.911
<v Speaker 1>Except for Megan.</v>

158
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:28.744
<v Speaker 1>Front of religion.</v>

164
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>if you can't make fun of things that are ridiculous,</v>

165
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:43.670
<v Speaker 1>you're missing out on a big part of what's fun about this life and religions.</v>

166
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

167
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Respect it,</v>

175

176
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I never knew how to start.</v>

177
