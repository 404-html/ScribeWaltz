<v Speaker 1>was looking at the cat bowls.</v>

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>The cat balls up in the air spinning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cats running for their lives.</v>

22
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>They acted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were acting with a couple of </v>

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>seconds before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I go.</v>

24
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Why are they so fucked up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>cartoon went up in the air spending the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake and the whole building </v>

29
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard the bricks,</v>

30
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told her about it being at night's </v>

35
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 1>you panic about what earthquakes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely if you,</v>

36
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>when you before you move here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>and then you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first week I was here,</v>

38
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I was in an apartment in Sherman oaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was standing at the kitchen </v>

39
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>counter of this person's apartment on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their laptop doing like sending an email</v>

40
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>and I felt a little and I go in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

41
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the subway.</v>

42
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>And I kept typing and then he could feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

43
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

44
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>And he's like crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

45
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the earth shake underneath your </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

46
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugh.</v>

47
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a panic sets in and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

48
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.830
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've,</v>

49
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I've actually experienced the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving now.</v>

50
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>And then the next step is like when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

51
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're asleep and then you hear like </v>

52
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>you feel the dresser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dresser,</v>

53
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

54
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>or something that's hanging on your wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>bumping,</v>

55
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on,</v>

56
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>it takes you that extra beat to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out you're going through an earthquake.</v>

57
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>That extra beat is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

58
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Have you been through?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing big but like fives,</v>

59
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>five point fives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of those.</v>

60
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>The first one I was in was an aftershock</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the northridge earthquake.</v>

61
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:47.751
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying in north Hollywood and I was in </v>

62
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>this shitty apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was made out of like fucking the same</v>

63
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:53.571
<v Speaker 1>boxes that they used to ship </v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigerators and like literally the </v>

64
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>walls when the earthquake hit the walls </v>
<v Speaker 1>just went to with this.</v>

65
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the whole thing was just like a </v>

66
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.350
<v Speaker 1>giant was pushing on the scariest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

67
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Well it's humbling because you realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

69
00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>this is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't tune up the street,</v>

70
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:10.501
<v Speaker 2>this is not going over any houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what it felt like when that big </v>

71
00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 2>one hit and it hit for 30 seconds for </v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

72
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 2>30 seconds is so long to feel the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving.</v>

73
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those people moved to </v>
<v Speaker 2>boulder.</v>

74
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 2>That's why that was just going to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you have that experience,</v>

75
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 2>there's some people that because app for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few days after the North Ridge,</v>

76
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.730
<v Speaker 2>there was aftershocks and there's people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that want.</v>

77
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 2>They look at their kids and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going through this together and </v>

78
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 2>we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're working on Wilshire big building.</v>

79
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.780
<v Speaker 2>What if house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people just a bad.</v>

80
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody's waiting for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>earthquake here because then people </v>

81
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 2>leave and they sell their houses for </v>
<v Speaker 2>dirt cheap.</v>

82
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 2>But it does happen.</v>

83
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.190
<v Speaker 2>What gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't ever want to experience it </v>

84
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.561
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I see a guy like my uncles </v>

85
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 2>lived here 55 and I've asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you ever scared?</v>

86
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

87
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:04.330

<v Speaker 2>When I first moved here,</v>

88
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.390
<v Speaker 2>before I first moved here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out here for meetings and I went </v>

89
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 2>by a section of the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the 10 that had collapsed</v>

90
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 2>and they were moving cars around it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as we are.</v>

91
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Is this what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.020
<v Speaker 2>What is this an apartment building that </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsed the North Ridge earthquake in </v>

<v Speaker 2>northridge.</v>

97
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 2>And when I was driving by this one </v>
<v Speaker 2>section of the highway,</v>

98
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 2>it collapsed on the lower section and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking that's just shit luck </v>

<v Speaker 2>Colorado is the right way.</v>

139
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 2>You've got to remember guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a decision that it could be.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You go home.</v>

<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

144
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I packed the bags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back Colorado without a whole cow.</v>

145
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It affects that way.</v>

146
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they go like this ends today with </v>

147
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.780
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that earthquake.</v>

148
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Some you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you feel that motherfucker,</v>

149
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 2>the ones that take down highways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you feel that you're like,</v>

150
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.010
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

151
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.050
<v Speaker 2>and this is not even a really big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really big ones changed the shape of </v>

152
00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.050
<v Speaker 2>continence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

153
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the real fear.</v>

154
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 2>The real fear is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a giant one,</v>

155
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 2>like a 10 or an 11 part of you by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way always feels kind of crazy.</v>

156
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:11.411
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was growing up in Florida </v>
<v Speaker 2>with hurricanes that like after a </v>

157
00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:11.800
<v Speaker 2>hurricane you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we staying after?</v>

158
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 2>This happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Florida Florida's mentality.</v>

159
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:19.601
<v Speaker 2>Like we just brought up a good beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a hurricane that for </v>

160
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:21.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason I feel like if you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the basement,</v>

161
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 2>the top blows off the thing and you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking strapped.</v>

162
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Or sometime like a wild ride at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Disneyland,</v>

163
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 2>but now they give you these warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

164
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're at the beach and people still are</v>

165
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:32.830
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

166
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

167
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend's mom,</v>

168
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.500
<v Speaker 2>his mom is like 70 something years old </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this big one was coming.</v>

169
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this time we're not fucking around,</v>

170
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.060
<v Speaker 2>this is a category five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to absolutely devastate </v>

171
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.060
<v Speaker 2>this area.</v>

172
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not.</v>

173
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.040
<v Speaker 2>I've been here 40 something years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing ever fucking happens.</v>

174
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 2>And he begged her and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

175
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 2>those are all those reports are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling the dice because they,</v>

177
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:02.770
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say it's going to be this bad </v>

178
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:02.770
<v Speaker 2>and then it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:02.770
<v Speaker 2>it'll turn or to land different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

180
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.420
<v Speaker 2>And it turned into like a tropical </v>
<v Speaker 2>storm.</v>

181
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 2>She was safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like the only person that stayed</v>

182
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 2>like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would always bail.</v>

183
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:13.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you were ever there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurricane.</v>

184
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like we would always book it man.</v>

185
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:18.160
<v Speaker 2>As soon as they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing is going to land,</v>

186
00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:18.670
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

187
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.710
<v Speaker 2>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even driving in those tropical </v>

188
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.561
<v Speaker 2>storms was an real men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't see an inch in front of </v>

189
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:32.261
<v Speaker 2>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're driving through a car </v>

190
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:32.261
<v Speaker 2>wash.</v>

191
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:32.261
<v Speaker 2>We had to stop once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you with me?</v>

192
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 2>When Eddie did that seminar in Miami </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were working at West Palm.</v>

193
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Did you go down with us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

194
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.840
<v Speaker 2>we went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We Eddie's doing a seminar in West Palm </v>

195
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 2>or in in Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in West Palm.</v>

196
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:45.911
<v Speaker 2>It's like a half hour away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we left to go to the seminar and we </v>

197
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:49.961
<v Speaker 2>were stopped dead on the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could not see an inch in front of </v>

198
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:51.000
<v Speaker 2>the windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

199
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.580
<v Speaker 2>It lasted for about 15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was too damn sky opened up the </v>

200
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 2>time there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know what rain is.</v>

201
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even know and I never knew </v>

202
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:06.800
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in Boston growing up,</v>

203
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 2>growing up in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw that we saw it rain.</v>

204
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 2>We never saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's some next level.</v>

205
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really seen it duplicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>since leaving there.</v>

206
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.850
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw one bad rainstorm in Jersey with a</v>

207

<v Speaker 2>cloud's got dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Colorado as well as the videos of what?</v>

210
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 2>People's cars are just coming around it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's one guy,</v>

211
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.810
<v Speaker 2>one guy had a film of a lake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were watching it and it slowly </v>

212
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.810
<v Speaker 2>ramps up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's literally like being attacked with </v>

<v Speaker 1>he did for them was if they caught him </v>

321
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.330
<v Speaker 1>and he set them up on the drugs thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I read the paperwork.</v>

324
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 1>coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cops actually gave him $250,000</v>

325
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:47.580
<v Speaker 1>cash to buy the 10 kilos of coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He set it up with his friend,</v>

326
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.530
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a car behind the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The car was empty,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the house was empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no cops.</v>

328
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Never even did a background check to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>who lived in the house.</v>

329
00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Jesus the house was empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went through the front and went out </v>

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.950
<v Speaker 1>the back and disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travel for 10 years and he came back to </v>

<v Speaker 1>the states because his dad died and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested him.</v>

332

461
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Like not just his but what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they can do.</v>

462
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Because you think about what it is is </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just talking about money.</v>

463
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:17.281
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're talking about some deception </v>

464
00:21:17.281 --> 00:21:17.281
<v Speaker 3>on his part where he tried to keep some </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

465
00:21:17.281 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to make them look like anybody else.</v>

466
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

467
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:25.621
<v Speaker 3>or you're in some sort of a deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>costco and he'd do some sneaky shit and </v>

468
00:21:25.621 --> 00:21:25.621
<v Speaker 3>just that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can sue you,</v>

469
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.660
<v Speaker 3>neil owe them and you have to pay them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no threat of jail time.</v>

470
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

471
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

472
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 3>have you tried to like cook the books?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would they get just what they put you in</v>

473
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:39.871
<v Speaker 3>jail or were they just trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>why fraud a today finds I'm guessing be </v>

474
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.450
<v Speaker 3>the same kind of scrutiny and attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that he's getting?</v>

475
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be all about paying a lot </v>

476
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:48.480
<v Speaker 3>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

477
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:48.480
<v Speaker 3>let's put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's pretend that Mike Sorrentino,</v>

478
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.290
<v Speaker 3>was that his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's pretend that he had some sort of a</v>

479
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:53.020
<v Speaker 3>deal Chevrolet and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

480
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.040
<v Speaker 3>he was using his name to sell cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was fucking around with some </v>

481
00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Speaker 3>money and cooking the books and little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of this,</v>

482
00:21:58.481 --> 00:22:01.720
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of that to the same tune as</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was going on with the irs.</v>

483
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.810
<v Speaker 3>What do you think they would do to him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you even be seeing this on TV now?</v>

484
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:06.610
<v Speaker 3>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

485
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.600
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like a suit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

486
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Because what they're saying is this guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to fuck that big daddy,</v>

487
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what they're showing you,</v>

488
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 3>showing you that big daddy gets mad when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you try to fuck him.</v>

489
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:23.280
<v Speaker 3>And in the grand scheme of things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of money for an individual to </v>

490
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:23.280
<v Speaker 3>earn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

491
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not money that affects big daddy.</v>

492
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Daddy's coming after you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the strange thing,</v>

493
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.780
<v Speaker 3>big daddy is just people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

494
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.500
<v Speaker 3>why don't we let anything be big daddy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

495
00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to think of it I think from like</v>

496
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 3>almost like a primitive perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have a king,</v>

497
00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you have a leader of a tribe.</v>

498
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:45.150
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how people used to think of it </v>

499
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:45.150
<v Speaker 3>and used to think of all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations,</v>

500
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.440
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the FBI or the dea as being</v>
<v Speaker 3>a part of that,</v>

501
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.520
<v Speaker 3>but there are just a bunch of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and no,</v>

502
00:22:50.521 --> 00:22:55.521
<v Speaker 3>no person should ever be big daddy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where if you have money that's</v>

503
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 3>owed to someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps there's some sort of an argument</v>

504
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:03.250
<v Speaker 3>that you've been deceptive that they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>just swoop down and take all your money.</v>

505
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Like they lock it all up like they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

506
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:05.930
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

507
00:23:05.931 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

508
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 3>We're fucking freezing your funds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Exxon doesn't get to do that.</v>

509
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Chevy doesn't get to do that over other </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations don't get to do that,</v>

510
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:17.620
<v Speaker 3>but big daddy has the overall say if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>violate big daddy's code,</v>

511
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.040
<v Speaker 3>even though big daddy like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>need you to get a receipt from,</v>

512
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.990
<v Speaker 3>from big Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big daddy,</v>

513
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:26.650
<v Speaker 3>half your money and big daddy just takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and spends as fuck.</v>

514
00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:29.460
<v Speaker 3>You want to whatever the fuck they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

515
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.860
<v Speaker 3>you said you don't pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking hippie.</v>

516
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 3>What are you a Bernie Sanders supporter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not even saying that,</v>

517
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Speaker 3>not even saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

518
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 3>don't you think big data should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>accountable if big daddy's gonna be able</v>

519
00:23:38.081 --> 00:23:43.081
<v Speaker 3>to just throw us in a cage because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't give him ones and zeroes don't </v>

520
00:23:43.081 --> 00:23:44.490
<v Speaker 3>think big daddy should be a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>accountable.</v>

521
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Should be way accountable for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>spending</v>

522
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.900
<v Speaker 4>way more accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

523
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.640
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to check off boxes </v>

524
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.551
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There should be like still like needs </v>

525
00:23:57.551 --> 00:23:58.790
<v Speaker 4>like healthcare check,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a police department,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

527
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.460
<v Speaker 4>We all like have to pay and then there </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be elective things.</v>

528
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.890
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of elective shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

529
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:12.730
<v Speaker 4>I feel like they should also like our </v>
<v Speaker 4>representatives should be way more </v>

530
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.871
<v Speaker 4>willing and like actually like mandated </v>
<v Speaker 4>to explain in detail and like what </v>

531
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:19.990
<v Speaker 4>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're spending on it.</v>

532
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.940
<v Speaker 4>I feel like a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

533
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.340
<v Speaker 4>house represent Congress Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just like an air of arrogance </v>

534
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Speaker 4>about the way that they even handle </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

535
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have power.</v>

536
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 4>Of course they are big daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big daddy and like it's.</v>

537
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:36.941
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just like aloofness that </v>

538
00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:36.941
<v Speaker 4>they have is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always been upsetting to him.</v>

539
00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one should be big daddy and you mean </v>

540
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.780
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people in Congress should be humble </v>

541
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:45.780
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things about Obama.</v>

542
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.080
<v Speaker 4>Say what you want about Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you liked his policies as a </v>

543
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.831
<v Speaker 4>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy conducted himself better than </v>

544
00:24:53.831 --> 00:24:54.650
<v Speaker 4>any president ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way he spoke,</v>

545
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 4>the way he interacted with people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way he even responded to criticism,</v>

546
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not just talking,</v>

547
00:25:00.771 --> 00:25:03.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about his policies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you might hate to clap for them,</v>

548
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.640
<v Speaker 4>be as good as it's ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why this trump thing is in such</v>

549
00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 4>direct contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he's yelling the other day,</v>

550
00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:13.240
<v Speaker 4>it's some reporter and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

551
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fake news.</v>

552
00:25:14.661 --> 00:25:15.950
<v Speaker 4>He used that again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

553
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:16.760
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be quiet.</v>

554
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:19.850
<v Speaker 4>Fake news or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about something,</v>

555
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can conflate the two,</v>

556
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:26.580
<v Speaker 4>like if you want to take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about policy and effectiveness of </v>

557
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.170
<v Speaker 4>it administration and just personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>conduct.</v>

558
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.540
<v Speaker 4>Like let's say you take all the politics</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of it.</v>

559
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:34.870
<v Speaker 4>That's what bothers a lot of people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this moment still if you just even </v>

560
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:39.311
<v Speaker 4>separate politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which a lot of people are in favor of </v>

561
00:25:39.311 --> 00:25:39.830
<v Speaker 4>just the way he conducts himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people love it.</v>

562
00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's be honest.</v>

563
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:43.520
<v Speaker 4>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very small amount of people love it,</v>

564
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of people are on president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

565
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

566
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.820
<v Speaker 4>You were saying before there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>debtor's prison.</v>

567
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no debtor's prison.</v>

568
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.250
<v Speaker 4>When I first got into comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was getting divorced.</v>

569
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:58.590
<v Speaker 4>I was getting squeezed by an attorney </v>
<v Speaker 4>and as much as i.</v>

570
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.720
<v Speaker 4>I never forget the first day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't missed sending a payment or </v>

571
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.230
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll never forget how sugar that my</v>

572
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:11.231
<v Speaker 4>credit rating and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked all those years going down the </v>

573
00:26:11.231 --> 00:26:12.620
<v Speaker 4>toilet and then at that point is if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking on nights,</v>

574
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:13.580
<v Speaker 4>I might as well dance.</v>

575
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was just buying cars and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking around and know what.</v>

576
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't throw me in jail for all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit,</v>

577
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:22.640
<v Speaker 4>but one discovery closed my account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

578
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 4>And I went home and opened up my drone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of those,</v>

579
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:26.060
<v Speaker 4>because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you want coke,</v>

580
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 4>you get fucking Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>creative Jack.</v>

581
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:32.810
<v Speaker 4>I went home and I opened the drawer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw all those checks.</v>

582
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Speaker 4>Those three checks with discover sends </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

583
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.520
<v Speaker 4>When you first went to card,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get the card.</v>

584
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.380
<v Speaker 4>I had a bank account to Bank of Boulder </v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever it was called.</v>

585
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 4>I had my back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my car finance through that.</v>

586
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

587
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.140
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have had a 24 hour drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

588
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't at 1:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>and signed that check over to myself for</v>

589
00:26:49.621 --> 00:26:54.621
<v Speaker 1>a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waited for two seconds and all of a </v>

590
00:26:54.621 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 1>sudden envelope came out with a 100 with</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 hundreds.</v>

591
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I peeled them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did 90 out of the discover call,</v>

592
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.840
<v Speaker 1>said you got an hour to bring that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking money back or we're going to </v>

593
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 1>charge you with fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was put up against the thing.</v>

594
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:14.181
<v Speaker 1>I went to the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told them it was a mistake I didn't </v>

595
00:27:14.181 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 1>know and one lady said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

596
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will give you the thousand,</v>

597
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:22.730
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to put it into your car </v>
<v Speaker 1>loan and raise the payments by 25 bucks </v>

598
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.120
<v Speaker 1>for every thousand dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 bucks,</v>

599
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only reason why I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to jail for that fucking thing.</v>

600
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.740
<v Speaker 1>So they don't put you in jail for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>in debt.</v>

601
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.580
<v Speaker 1>They put you in jail for deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how they get athletes and </v>

602
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.181
<v Speaker 1>entertainers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that biggest downfall is </v>

603
00:27:41.181 --> 00:27:42.750
<v Speaker 1>when they go to comic cons and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>autograph signings.</v>

604
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get paid for.</v>

605
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Those are they get paid for those don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>

606
00:27:46.201 --> 00:27:49.670
<v Speaker 1>There's two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the people who get $5,000</v>

607
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.720
<v Speaker 1>flat and you take pictures all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the people that get $10 for</v>

608
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:59.160
<v Speaker 1>their tee shirt and $15 for a headshot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a smile.</v>

609
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those 15 that I was going in your </v>

610
00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:04.220
<v Speaker 1>pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

611
00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.950
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is you have to give a </v>

612
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:10.131
<v Speaker 1>percentage to that $15 to the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you sell a merchant at a </v>

613
00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:14.131
<v Speaker 1>comedy club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now all of a sudden now they want 80 </v>

614
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:14.131
<v Speaker 1>percent of your merchant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

615
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Well that guy reports it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pete rose.</v>

616
00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying Pete Rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing against Rosie.</v>

617
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 1>My dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pete rose.</v>

618
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.050
<v Speaker 1>We just put $15 in his pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

619
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.000
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>$60 or he took 10 pictures.</v>

620
00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:32.001
<v Speaker 1>It's $150.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they get you on all those </v>

621
00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 1>autograph things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

622
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.620
<v Speaker 1>What's this is from an article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's talking about.</v>

623
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:43.110
<v Speaker 1>This article is talking about walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from comic con with garbage bags </v>

624
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.221
<v Speaker 1>full of twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy said he can make up to 250 </v>

625
00:28:46.221 --> 00:28:49.671
<v Speaker 1>grand shit twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't feel a need for </v>

626
00:28:49.671 --> 00:28:50.160
<v Speaker 1>representation because he's walking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bag full of cash.</v>

627
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is he?</v>

628
00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:53.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like an unnamed person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a source.</v>

629
00:28:53.581 --> 00:28:58.581
<v Speaker 1>Deeply involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Steven Arnelle who became so </v>

630
00:28:58.581 --> 00:28:58.780
<v Speaker 1>enhanced the festival business that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>started his talent.</v>

631
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the Arrow to show the arrow.</v>

632
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

633
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Comic book show on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

634
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

635
00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:10.500
<v Speaker 1>that seems very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comic Con,</v>

636
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:15.501
<v Speaker 1>you pay for a booth and then I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've given me three percent of the </v>

637
00:29:15.501 --> 00:29:15.501
<v Speaker 1>overall take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>

638
00:29:15.501 --> 00:29:18.900
<v Speaker 1>That's really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having people pay to come and meet you.</v>

639
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.420
<v Speaker 1>That seems weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strange.</v>

640
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's weird to charge somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a picture and,</v>

641
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.750
<v Speaker 1>and charge somebody to sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

642
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.550
<v Speaker 1>I guess the signing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand there's a bit,</v>

643
00:29:29.551 --> 00:29:30.790
<v Speaker 1>especially in sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

644
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.480

<v Speaker 2>low,</v>

650
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.710

<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>

655
00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.480

<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine called me and he goes,</v>

656
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I was at my dad's hospital room the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day and it was the funniest thing.</v>

657
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young Joe Rogan sitting around a </v>

658
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:20.580
<v Speaker 2>campfire with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

659
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.261
<v Speaker 2>I never saw that episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden he pulls out a bag </v>

660
00:30:25.261 --> 00:30:25.840
<v Speaker 2>of dicks and he made every believer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He dixie goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

662
00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:31.750

<v Speaker 2>going to come to you and say,</v>

663
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.180

664
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're sit back on one picture now.</v>

665
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.830
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bad relationship.</v>

666
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people when they go to Comicon,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I can make a living.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't have any problem with it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't have any problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do want to make a living know who</v>

672

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.140
<v Speaker 2>common is that even though you have like</v>
<v Speaker 2>these issues,</v>

689
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:43.170
<v Speaker 2>there was never a point where I felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I couldn't trust you with </v>

690
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:43.860
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

691
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.050
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

692
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.950
<v Speaker 2>you never would sell anybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would never,</v>

693
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

694
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not a type of person who would do</v>

695
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:55.951
<v Speaker 2>something to hurt somebody else so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could profit because you were sick </v>

696
00:31:55.951 --> 00:31:57.420
<v Speaker 2>and you needed drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was never you.</v>

697
00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.010
<v Speaker 2>You always had like a strong code of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethics.</v>

698
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Get out that you were worth nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a jam that had problems,</v>

699
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 2>but when are we started telling people </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a junkie but he pays his bills.</v>

700
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Will you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you know like,</v>

701
00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:16.051
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just a guy struggling in and I </v>

702
00:32:16.051 --> 00:32:20.940
<v Speaker 2>recognized he knew a lot of what I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen in my friend Johnny was that </v>

703
00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.441
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant people that for some reason </v>

704
00:32:25.441 --> 00:32:29.160
<v Speaker 2>the fabric of society just doesn't fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just is.</v>

705
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:34.350
<v Speaker 2>There's something about getting up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning and go into a job and you </v>

706
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:38.401
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is about the way they were </v>

707
00:32:38.401 --> 00:32:40.021
<v Speaker 2>raised to experiences they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just who they are inherently from </v>

708
00:32:40.021 --> 00:32:40.021
<v Speaker 2>whatever the</v>

709
00:32:40.021 --> 00:32:44.980
<v Speaker 3>factors are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certain people that just can't do the </v>

710
00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.550
<v Speaker 3>regular thing and they just need to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>this other thing for you is obviously </v>

711
00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.390
<v Speaker 3>stand up and once you found that other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing and became successful,</v>

712
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:53.810
<v Speaker 3>that other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when your whole thing changed.</v>

713
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 3>That's when you were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

714
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 3>it was really proved positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for sure.</v>

715
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:59.300
<v Speaker 3>You learned a lot of things about life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got older,</v>

716
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:00.890
<v Speaker 3>you get wiser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

717
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:05.891
<v Speaker 3>but I think a big part of you becoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>more comfortable and more relaxed and </v>

718
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:11.111
<v Speaker 3>becoming who you are today is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you started becoming successful as a </v>

719
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 3>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you started becoming successful</v>

720
00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:15.520
<v Speaker 3>as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

721
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.310
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

722
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago things started really </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramping up for Ya.</v>

723
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>noticeable,</v>

724
00:33:20.871 --> 00:33:24.200
<v Speaker 3>relaxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few noticeable change because you,</v>

725
00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.550
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize like,</v>

726
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm supposed to be doing.</v>

727
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.070
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when this isn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you think,</v>

728
00:33:31.071 --> 00:33:32.780
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I should go back to selling cars.</v>

729
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe I should get a job in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>factory.</v>

730
00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I should do something a three or </v>

731
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:39.550
<v Speaker 3>four nights a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just bartend.</v>

732
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Make a little extra money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lighten up the load on the family that </v>

733
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.370
<v Speaker 3>when those types of things start fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you and that's when you start doing</v>

734
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:48.410
<v Speaker 3>coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when you start going crazy.</v>

735
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 3>That's when you stay up late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when you fuck off.</v>

736
00:33:51.141 --> 00:33:53.990
<v Speaker 3>That's when you make big mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're unhappy,</v>

737
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 3>you're upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the wrong groove.</v>

738
00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:01.630
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't the external struggles as much</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the internal struggle or maybe all of</v>

739
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.730
<v Speaker 3>it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No violent this November,</v>

740
00:34:03.731 --> 00:34:08.350
<v Speaker 3>so it'd be 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done a lot of coke and coffee.</v>

741
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:09.080
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing</v>

742
00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The January after the November and </v>

743
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't done it in 60 days and that </v>

744
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>was still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sweating it out.</v>

745
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still wasn't trusting myself.</v>

746
00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I could snap at any minute,</v>

747
00:34:21.691 --> 00:34:26.691
<v Speaker 1>some chicklet hot pits with a gram of </v>
<v Speaker 1>coke or whatever,</v>

748
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:34.150
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta remember Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it wasn't about success or or </v>

749
00:34:35.641 --> 00:34:40.641
<v Speaker 1>selling tickets or for me it was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something with my life where I've </v>

750
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I wanted was just to do something </v>

751
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:46.020
<v Speaker 1>with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I could pay rent,</v>

752
00:34:46.021 --> 00:34:49.080
<v Speaker 1>feed the cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke pot and do spots,</v>

753
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot better than what I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

754
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how a lot better than when the </v>

755
00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.090
<v Speaker 1>life I had you understand that even if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go on the road and I'm not Louis,</v>

756
00:34:57.091 --> 00:34:57.740
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>

757
00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:02.770
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that I didn't have to carry a gun </v>

758
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.050
<v Speaker 1>or worry about people knocking on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>

759
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I was like Richard Gere and Austin's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen.</v>

760
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I had nowhere else to go to the store </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do that stupid spot at 12,</v>

761
00:35:12.121 --> 00:35:15.300
<v Speaker 1>45 and look what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just keep showing up.</v>

762
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>

763
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:21.500
<v Speaker 3>there was a big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but another big part of it was getting </v>

764
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:21.500
<v Speaker 3>you on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the thing.</v>

765
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.500
<v Speaker 3>So we get a chance to show people what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>already knew.</v>

766
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with like the only way for you back then</v>

767
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.530
<v Speaker 3>to get exposure was you had to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something conventional.</v>

768
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:35.650
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to put you in a movie or put </v>

769
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:35.650
<v Speaker 3>you in a TV show and you got an a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>

770
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.340
<v Speaker 3>movies and you got an a few TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't get to see you as Joey d</v>

771
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.420
<v Speaker 3>and c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they got to cut some fucking </v>

772
00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 3>character actor and you know that mob </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie with Robert De Niro.</v>

773
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 3>But there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and you like this.</v>

774
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 3>You just took the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Took the right thing for you to be this.</v>

775
00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:58.570
<v Speaker 3>You took like the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Internet has like for Joey is </v>

776
00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.080
<v Speaker 3>the best medium ever.</v>

777
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

778
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 3>It was exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well for you to know it's gone.</v>

779
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

780
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it.</v>

781
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.140
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just as good of an example.</v>

782
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't have a lot of success </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of the Internet.</v>

783
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

784
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 3>The Internet has been your shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about it.</v>

785
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:21.501
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have like a long running </v>
<v Speaker 3>television series or a series of movies </v>

786
00:36:21.501 --> 00:36:22.980
<v Speaker 3>or anything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're selling out places that a lot</v>

787
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:27.330
<v Speaker 3>of those guys can't even fuck with all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time because of your podcast,</v>

788
00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:30.630
<v Speaker 3>which is if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your podcast with your wife.</v>

789
00:36:30.631 --> 00:36:34.410
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my favorite podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking consistently silly.</v>

790
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:39.090
<v Speaker 3>That is so ridiculous and people get </v>
<v Speaker 3>silly when they get on it.</v>

791
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:42.720
<v Speaker 3>They do and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start seeing things like,</v>

792
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like your mom's house bit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>shit without 90 people hitting me up the</v>

796
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.980

<v Speaker 5>brilliant story in the world.</v>

00:37:11.571 --> 00:37:16.571
<v Speaker 5>sure and he told us about when he shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>in his backyard and somebody thought it </v>

803
00:37:16.571 --> 00:37:20.370
<v Speaker 5>was got the lady she leave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She will let her dogs out everyday and </v>

804
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.940
<v Speaker 5>she would clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They will French poodles dogs.</v>

805
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:33.700
<v Speaker 5>It was just as high up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just reeling back from this shit,</v>

806
00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.630
<v Speaker 5>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe Rogan.</v>

807
00:37:36.631 --> 00:37:41.631
<v Speaker 5>She looked at it and she was like 58.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she's squinting at this shit up </v>

808
00:37:41.631 --> 00:37:46.631
<v Speaker 5>against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took a shit and I put my back against </v>

809
00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:46.700
<v Speaker 5>the wall.</v>

810
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.130
<v Speaker 5>So when I shift,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you shit outside,</v>

811
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:52.490
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to be a decent shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be like explosive.</v>

812
00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 5>So when I got up it looks like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>got shot in the head that we should all </v>

813
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:01.730
<v Speaker 5>behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she's sitting there with a little </v>

814
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.650
<v Speaker 5>French poodles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chihuahuas and she's looking at the wall</v>

815
00:38:03.651 --> 00:38:04.760
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck happened?</v>

816
00:38:04.761 --> 00:38:09.761
<v Speaker 5>Then all of a sudden she actually walks </v>
<v Speaker 5>up to close to it and squint and look at</v>

817
00:38:10.151 --> 00:38:14.090
<v Speaker 5>it and looks around and runs it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm watching all this.</v>

818
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:19.210
<v Speaker 5>I can't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now I go to the computer because my </v>

819
00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:22.421
<v Speaker 5>wife's very decent sitting there for </v>
<v Speaker 5>half and then my wife comes in and she </v>

820
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:23.930
<v Speaker 5>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were you home all day today?</v>

<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>

823
00:38:26.031 --> 00:38:27.680
<v Speaker 5>I just had a conversation with Susan.</v>

824
00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.150
<v Speaker 5>She wanted to know if you heard anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the back yard.</v>

825
00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:40.090
<v Speaker 5>Then I went to get Sushi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but give it a go get Sushi.</v>

826
00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 5>I eat a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You will go to the post office.</v>

829
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 5>But I made a detour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I plan to go home,</v>

830
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:53.290
<v Speaker 5>but I left the house key in the house so</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to climb around the window.</v>

831
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.160
<v Speaker 5>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

832
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:55.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when I pulled myself up,</v>

833
00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.560
<v Speaker 5>I actually landed with my stomach on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>window and now you've made it push it </v>

834
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:07.141
<v Speaker 5>out more like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And my hands are struggling in the </v>

835
00:39:07.141 --> 00:39:11.581
<v Speaker 5>window and my feet are on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the cat's scratching at me.</v>

836
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.570
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I might get to me.</v>

837
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.800
<v Speaker 5>So I ran out,</v>

<v Speaker 2>couldn't sit down and like the regular </v>

<v Speaker 2>he would had have to balance himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly on the very edge of the front </v>

895
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 2>because his ass was so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wide Shit in the water on the deck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I would sit on the toilet,</v>

899
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like the ad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that I was fat.</v>

900
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't like my dick inside the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

901
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Suck his dick and off the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell my wife,</v>

<v Speaker 2>because I want to eat her monkey.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't want that monkey touching the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I hope my balls and I shit towards the </v>

905
00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:55.421
<v Speaker 2>edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck in somebody else's </v>

906
00:42:55.421 --> 00:42:55.421
<v Speaker 2>backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your soul,</v>

907
00:42:55.421 --> 00:42:59.150
<v Speaker 2>your balls and sit where you are because</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of them to move forward because if </v>

908
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:04.331
<v Speaker 2>I'm back there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got grabbed one time sitting on the </v>

909
00:43:04.331 --> 00:43:07.721
<v Speaker 2>toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll jump from that toilet inward </v>

910
00:43:07.721 --> 00:43:10.490
<v Speaker 2>like they jumping over a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who are saying they got crabs to </v>

911
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.490
<v Speaker 2>the toilet isn't an excuse.</v>

912
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you can create crabs from </v>

913
00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:15.280
<v Speaker 2>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why they it take it from here?</v>

914
00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.880
<v Speaker 2>They only cleaned the hairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're like little stay </v>

915
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:18.880
<v Speaker 2>on an actual toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think probably.</v>

916
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

917
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would feel like that's one of the </v>

918
00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.331
<v Speaker 2>things about crabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a shot at the gas station that </v>

919
00:43:25.331 --> 00:43:26.060
<v Speaker 2>had to be at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I haven't figured it was.</v>

920
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always hold my shit.</v>

921
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 2>My Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Remember red band?</v>

923
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:36.670

<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>

924
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

925
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.470
<v Speaker 2>This is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has been many,</v>

926
00:43:42.471 --> 00:43:47.471
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things just like sticking out of go in </v>

927
00:43:47.471 --> 00:43:47.471
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a smell.</v>

928
00:43:47.471 --> 00:43:49.730
<v Speaker 2>You know how when you take an epic shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an above water shit.</v>

929
00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:54.731
<v Speaker 2>It comes out like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the fucking big island of Hawaii </v>

930
00:43:54.731 --> 00:43:54.920
<v Speaker 2>just rises through the water.</v>

931
00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I've done that many times because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat too much now and I'll take these </v>

932
00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.420
<v Speaker 2>shifts that are just so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're preposterous,</v>

933
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.660
<v Speaker 2>but there's a totally different smell to</v>
<v Speaker 2>those shits because you're smelling raw </v>

934
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.780
<v Speaker 2>shit outside of the water.</v>

936
00:44:13.781 --> 00:44:16.421
<v Speaker 2>poking into the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about that that makes you </v>

937
00:44:16.421 --> 00:44:20.501
<v Speaker 2>happy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about the sense of </v>

938
00:44:20.501 --> 00:44:20.501
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment?</v>

<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a door that faces out.</v>

970
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:40.010
<v Speaker 2>The worst is when you go over a girl's </v>
<v Speaker 2>house and you go to use your bathroom </v>

973
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:47.190
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker up tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're thinking about burdening her off </v>

974
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.460
<v Speaker 2>fumes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

976
00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.860
<v Speaker 2>You ever get to a girl's place and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel the gurgles and you're like,</v>

977

<v Speaker 2>I was dating a girl once.</v>

979
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.140
<v Speaker 2>She had ferocious diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ferocious.</v>

980
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:09.290
<v Speaker 2>So she was in regular time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she went to the bathroom and she just</v>

981
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.710
<v Speaker 2>turned on the shower and she turns on </v>
<v Speaker 2>both things on the sink.</v>

982
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And just see what she tried to drown it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>explosive diarrhea shit.</v>

992
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.890

<v Speaker 2>do it that,</v>

993
00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 2>that it would just be a black toilet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I could cover.</v>

994
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:45.900
<v Speaker 2>So you know what I did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went back to my place,</v>

995

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>not getting fucked and they don't want </v>

1002
00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:02.670
<v Speaker 2>their friend to get fucked.</v>

<v Speaker 2>something fucked my thought until nobody</v>

1039
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.760
<v Speaker 2>in those days I was really scared of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors and I wouldn't say shit to </v>

1101
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:44.510
<v Speaker 5>Your seat was seat belted into your </v>
<v Speaker 5>waist.</v>

1102
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:46.130
<v Speaker 5>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was terrible,</v>

1103
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.600

<v Speaker 5>I used to,</v>

1104
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:54.310
<v Speaker 5>I used to take the number one bus from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jersey City to the high school and we </v>

1105
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:57.500
<v Speaker 5>were on the bus one morning kids and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a guy reading a paper,</v>

1106
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 5>I can live to be 100 and never forget </v>
<v Speaker 5>this reading the daily news and he had a</v>

1107

<v Speaker 5>connector of drool from his lift,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Daily News,</v>

1108
00:52:07.611 --> 00:52:09.560
<v Speaker 5>and it was a puddle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was on heroin.</v>

1109
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:15.790
<v Speaker 5>They would go to Jersey City in those </v>
<v Speaker 5>days and get Methadone so they would </v>

1110
00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:15.790
<v Speaker 5>take the bus up north with us.</v>

1111
00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:19.950
<v Speaker 5>So I'm sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's passed the fuck out and the drool </v>

1112
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:22.780
<v Speaker 5>is connected to the daily news and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy to be just six inches of public.</v>

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.980
<v Speaker 5>This guy's been passed out for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>

1114
00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:30.410
<v Speaker 5>I point my ass at him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sitting behind them.</v>

1115
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting across from them and I lift </v>
<v Speaker 5>up my hips a little bit.</v>

1116
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:39.410
<v Speaker 5>Kept my ass or just point that even if </v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't pointed at him,</v>

1117
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.060
<v Speaker 5>he would ricochet off the chair and go </v>
<v Speaker 5>straight and through his mouth.</v>

1118
00:52:43.061 --> 00:52:47.240
<v Speaker 5>Like he's sitting there and I let a fart</v>
<v Speaker 5>go out.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Fantastic.</v>

1128
00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:36.160
<v Speaker 1>This is why I hate people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I hate when I read.</v>

1129
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Give me a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason why I ain't read </v>

1130
00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:46.071
<v Speaker 1>posts from people going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you singing tonight as blue comedy </v>

1131
00:53:46.071 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 1>will come down to the standard feeder in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday night and listened to intelligent</v>

1132
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.720
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought provoking comedy,</v>

1133
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:59.990
<v Speaker 1>and then I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times I'm 54 years old and at </v>

1134
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:03.370
<v Speaker 1>night I got a sleep apnea machine on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little needle in the sleep </v>

1135
00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:05.790
<v Speaker 1>apnea machine because the hall was </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches and into your fucking mouth.</v>

1136
00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:08.970
<v Speaker 1>So there's an escape valve that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>size of a needle.</v>

1137
00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:14.310
<v Speaker 1>You know how many nights I will sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and be half asleep and I'll need </v>

1138
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:18.591
<v Speaker 1>the fart and I'll wake up just to see if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could smell the fucking fart.</v>

1139
00:54:19.201 --> 00:54:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Come through that whole you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1140
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:24.350
<v Speaker 1>If it comes through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tremendous fault.</v>

1141
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I just wake up my wife like I go on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>

1142
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's that good.</v>

1143
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm 54 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That always makes me laptops to Gore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>When we start talking to them about </v>

1257
01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1258
01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1259
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>and they'd walk away with Shirley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever the capital that base was the </v>

1260
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>head of the base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was his wife.</v>

1261
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>And if a band came to town or a comedian</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to town,</v>

1262
01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>she blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1263
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:30.820
<v Speaker 1>That was the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he and he would sit out there with </v>

1264
01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:34.691
<v Speaker 1>his fucking military armed with all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and class and she'd be in the back </v>

1265
01:00:34.691 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>color mink because the whole band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is crazy.</v>

1266
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.600
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She came over and started talking to me </v>

1267
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:43.600
<v Speaker 1>and then she started telling all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuban.</v>

1268
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I dated to Cuba one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was such a big thick.</v>

1269
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>You have a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was that white glove.</v>

1270
01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:49.940
<v Speaker 1>It was quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she just gets to it.</v>

1271
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>She's like 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was maybe like 31.</v>

1272
01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>She was maybe 50 and she just dropped </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the curtain,</v>

1273
01:00:56.090 --> 01:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>took the hammer out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there minding my own </v>

1274
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>business and all of a sudden somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes yelling for Shirley,</v>

1275
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Shirley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shirley.</v>

1276

<v Speaker 1>Now usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surely we get up and stop sucking your </v>

1277
01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Surely.</v>

1278
01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>She moved her knees like I had neon </v>
<v Speaker 1>belly.</v>

1279
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Belly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's supposed to move this way.</v>

1280
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:20.350

<v Speaker 1>She kept sucking and just kept moving </v>

1281
01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:20.350
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She.</v>

1282
01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I tried to take it out of her mouth.</v>

1283
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't let it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's a way to talk.</v>

1322
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I can pick up like one out of 100 words </v>

<v Speaker 2>hand gestures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but then one person like you traveling,</v>

1372
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 3>you go know pro people were very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are nice.</v>

1373
01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:52.990
<v Speaker 3>If you are nice and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>universal.</v>

1374
01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:55.740
<v Speaker 3>People are Nice if you're nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1375
01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:58.960
<v Speaker 3>pretty powerful that people appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 3>it pretty much everywhere.</v>

1376
01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:00.880
<v Speaker 3>People are Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're nice,</v>

1377
01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:06.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and the way you are changes the way </v>

1378
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:06.550
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1379
01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:11.610
<v Speaker 3>like if you run into someone and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a little bit defensive but </v>

1380
01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:15.511
<v Speaker 3>you're openly friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times the relaxed that whereas </v>

1381
01:06:15.511 --> 01:06:20.190
<v Speaker 3>if you run into someone in their sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>defensive and you're aggressive with </v>

1382
01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:26.011
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it ramps up and the whole thing </v>

1383
01:06:26.011 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 3>becomes like some sort of a weird ego </v>
<v Speaker 3>disaster st person,</v>

1384
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:31.480
<v Speaker 3>different person interacting with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying the same words.</v>

1385
01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 3>It's just the whole thing about people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the way we talk to each other.</v>

1386
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're,</v>

1387
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:41.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no one person responsible for an</v>

1388
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:42.790
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1389
01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:46.930
<v Speaker 3>most of the time it comes from both </v>
<v Speaker 3>sides and how you interact with people.</v>

1390
01:06:46.931 --> 01:06:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Even if you feel like you did nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1391
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:54.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a big part of how the conversation </v>

1392
01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:57.030
<v Speaker 3>started shaping itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't want to.</v>

1393
01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants everything to be black </v>
<v Speaker 3>or white,</v>

1394
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:04.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's either like if you got an argument </v>

1395
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:04.590
<v Speaker 3>with the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's his fault or it's your fault,</v>

1396
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:09.510
<v Speaker 3>but it could easily be both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can easily be like just a mismanaged </v>

1397
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:10.450
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1398
01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:14.590
<v Speaker 3>you might have been coming there because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might've been some fucking problem</v>

1399
01:07:14.591 --> 01:07:17.980
<v Speaker 3>that they were supposed to fix on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>car and they didn't and you know,</v>

1400
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:22.390
<v Speaker 3>you are in your car headed to the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>store and you're like this mother fucker</v>

1401
01:07:22.391 --> 01:07:23.770
<v Speaker 3>and the light starts going on again.</v>

1402
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Like God damn it and you get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're already a little bit ramped up </v>

1403
01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:31.860
<v Speaker 3>and you run into someone and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>already coming at them at like a six and</v>

1404
01:07:33.071 --> 01:07:34.870
<v Speaker 3>if you get an interaction with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>about like,</v>

1405
01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:36.430
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything I can get in front of you,</v>

1406
01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I got to go some where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you man.</v>

1407
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could happen.</v>

1408
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Totally does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

1409
01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.480
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I've always learned the very </v>

1410
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.390
<v Speaker 3>important lesson in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what that guy's going </v>

1411
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.390
<v Speaker 3>through it today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one does.</v>

1412
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Right before you hit her members,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before you give that dirty guy,</v>

1413
01:07:54.231 --> 01:07:56.560
<v Speaker 3>it's the hardest thing to cut them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1414
01:07:56.650 --> 01:08:01.240
<v Speaker 3>You don't know if his wife just left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kid just told him she was a lesbian.</v>

1415
01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:06.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all of a sudden he's got a </v>

1416
01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:06.690
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1417
01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:10.531
<v Speaker 3>have a fucking gun car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what somebody is going </v>

1418
01:08:10.531 --> 01:08:10.531
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1419
01:08:10.531 --> 01:08:13.000
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea what time that mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up to you.</v>

1420
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:18.001
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most genius thing is I ever </v>

1421
01:08:18.001 --> 01:08:18.001
<v Speaker 3>heard was</v>

1422
01:08:18.001 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 1>that a great Carlo Gambino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never answered his own door.</v>

1423
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:26.590
<v Speaker 1>He always had his wife answered the door</v>
<v Speaker 1>because no matter how mad a mobster came</v>

1424
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how,</v>

1425
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:35.321
<v Speaker 1>like he just got off the phone with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking guy and he won't give me 10 </v>

1426
01:08:35.321 --> 01:08:38.411
<v Speaker 1>kilos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos' going to resume this no matter </v>

1427
01:08:38.411 --> 01:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>how mad I came into the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife would stop you,</v>

1428
01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:44.600
<v Speaker 1>make you sit down and give you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>express on giving you a score and talk </v>

1429
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.590
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time you got into Carlo,</v>

1430
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you were slowed down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very smart that way.</v>

1431
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.840
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful because he always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife was like,</v>

1432
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 1>everybody's mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those ladies that you'll go ahead</v>

1433
01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:04.070
<v Speaker 1>and come in and get me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why it's not good for </v>

1434
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:07.121
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If men get together for long periods of </v>

1435
01:09:07.121 --> 01:09:08.390
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that I think that people should.</v>

1436
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's involved with customer </v>
<v Speaker 1>service should take some type of </v>

1437
01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:17.930
<v Speaker 1>something to let to calm people down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people who work at an airport,</v>

1438
01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:23.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be a system out of slow </v>

1439
01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:25.400
<v Speaker 1>somebody down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant system.</v>

1440
01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Having a wife that like a very nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that sits you down and you </v>

1441
01:09:31.851 --> 01:09:32.660
<v Speaker 1>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1442
01:09:32.661 --> 01:09:34.610
<v Speaker 1>this is what's important in this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendship here.</v>

1443
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Like half of the issues that people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

1444
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:40.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a perspective issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1445
01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:45.460
<v Speaker 1>like especially if you're like a monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thinks so much fucking you over </v>

1446
01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:45.460
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1447
01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:45.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's my fucking money?</v>

1448
01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.910
<v Speaker 1>And you sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like come on.</v>

1449
01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Perspective issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1450
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.120
<v Speaker 1>It's most of what it is like how are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at your relationship?</v>

1451
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Are you trying to fuck this person over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here trying to work together in harmony?</v>

1452
01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.890
<v Speaker 1>If you're just trying to work together </v>
<v Speaker 1>in harmony,</v>

1453
01:09:57.891 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I bet it'll work out.</v>

1454
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:03.310
<v Speaker 1>We all travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ever have a bad travel day and we get</v>

1455
01:10:03.311 --> 01:10:08.311
<v Speaker 1>to a hotel and we'll fucking furious </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that little lady at the counter </v>

1456
01:10:08.311 --> 01:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>made us laugh and for sure about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>just happened.</v>

1457
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And should we even do something that </v>

1458
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:18.590
<v Speaker 1>will change your whole outlook for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>

1459
01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Like she'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh by the way,</v>

1460
01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:24.941
<v Speaker 1>I know you were delayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We told the kitchen to save your </v>

1461
01:10:24.941 --> 01:10:26.540
<v Speaker 1>spaghetti and meatballs and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bad motherfucker.</v>

1462
01:10:26.541 --> 01:10:28.280
<v Speaker 1>You Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1463
01:10:28.281 --> 01:10:30.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it when that happens.</v>

1464
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I love when I'm furious and like walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a hotel and somebody slows me down </v>

1465
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>and talks to me and it's really cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people have that.</v>

1466
01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:44.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a gift by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to actually slow somebody down and be </v>

1467
01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.010
<v Speaker 1>able to touch him and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1468
01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.690
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be fun and coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me take it to the track them.</v>

1469
01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:53.460
<v Speaker 1>If you have a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a customer service </v>

1470
01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:53.460
<v Speaker 1>representative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who meets people at the door and</v>

1471
01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.990
<v Speaker 1>that person has an amazing personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit is worth a lot of money.</v>

1472
01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't coach it.</v>

1473
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:04.040
<v Speaker 1>You can't train whether it's a guy or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl and I've met him on both sides.</v>

1474
01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:09.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet people that work in a certain </v>

1475
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:11.471
<v Speaker 1>place where you look forward to going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to that place to saying hi to that </v>

1476
01:11:11.471 --> 01:11:12.710
<v Speaker 1>guy because that guy is just super cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1477
01:11:12.711 --> 01:11:13.920
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up man?</v>

1478
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:19.070
<v Speaker 2>And like you've made like legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>friendship with this person and that's </v>

1479
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:20.460
<v Speaker 2>possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1480
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.320
<v Speaker 2>this idea that we all have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly at odds with each other and I</v>

1481
01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:28.770
<v Speaker 2>think even like security people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I see when I'm in a restaurant</v>

1482
01:11:28.771 --> 01:11:33.771
<v Speaker 2>or a bar or a sporting event and I see a</v>

1518
01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.650
<v Speaker 2>impact that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just keep that shit known.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We were in the green room at the </v>

1524
01:13:43.190 --> 01:13:43.190
<v Speaker 2>peninsula.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

01:13:43.190 --> 01:13:45.060
<v Speaker 2>no carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1526
01:13:45.061 --> 01:13:48.250
<v Speaker 2>This was somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is doing a podcast.</v>

1527
01:13:48.251 --> 01:13:53.251
<v Speaker 2>Meet him in red bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the first podcast we did was off </v>

1528
01:13:53.251 --> 01:13:56.061
<v Speaker 2>this thing called Justin Dot TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin TV and we didn't agree and we did</v>

1529
01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:00.570
<v Speaker 2>them back when there were cellular </v>
<v Speaker 2>modems,</v>

1530
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:04.260
<v Speaker 2>so he'd be streaming like there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of Wifi back then,</v>

1531
01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:07.740
<v Speaker 2>so we'd be streaming from a cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>hookup.</v>

1532
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible.</v>

1533
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Like real pixilated stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we were like,</v>

1534
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:17.220
<v Speaker 1>this could be fucking weird and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like watch us get ready in the </v>

1535
01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.360
<v Speaker 1>green room talking to the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just can be bizarre.</v>

1536
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.620
<v Speaker 1>So we decided to do a few of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Joe,</v>

1537
01:14:22.621 --> 01:14:24.760
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get this fucking thing away from me.</v>

1538
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:30.570
<v Speaker 1>But that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the different Joey Diaz back </v>

1539
01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:30.570
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1540
01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:31.570
<v Speaker 1>you were still uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1541
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:36.780
<v Speaker 1>it was funny with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing that set you free to </v>

1542
01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:37.300
<v Speaker 1>let people know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning when he was like,</v>

1543
01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:38.290
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't you also like,</v>

1544

1545
01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1546
01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you like a bird collar kind of guy </v>

1547
01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.301
<v Speaker 1>or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like one of those </v>

1548
01:14:48.301 --> 01:14:48.301
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1549
01:14:48.301 --> 01:14:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Things that people do though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a bird call.</v>

1550
01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Are we talking about man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was onto it.</v>

1551
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.370
<v Speaker 1>He would be on there at night and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't like it.</v>

1552
01:14:57.371 --> 01:15:02.371
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then Dane Cook became a megastar </v>

<v Speaker 1>Nirvana and I'll never forget that.</v>

1570
01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have radio?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have no radio.</v>

1572
01:15:42.081 --> 01:15:47.081

<v Speaker 1>when we got down to the whole weekend </v>

1573
01:15:47.081 --> 01:15:51.031
<v Speaker 1>was so good and that's what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan's onto something with that </v>

1574
01:15:51.031 --> 01:15:53.320
<v Speaker 1>fucking computer,</v>

<v Speaker 1>because my philosophy was that computer.</v>

1576
01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Richard Pryor would go home</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the morning coked up and get on </v>

1580
01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:14.970

<v Speaker 1>but once I saw five sold out shows and </v>

1584
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:27.500

<v Speaker 1>I was in burbank the other day.</v>

1597
01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got a haircut?</v>

1598
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:01.800
<v Speaker 1>We could go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1599
01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:03.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't make the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

1600
01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I went to Jujitsu and had a half hour to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill.</v>

1601
01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.800
<v Speaker 1>So before they had cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just smoked a joint.</v>

1602
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I was in my car on Magnolia Boulevard up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the block from Porto's,</v>

1603
01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:18.731
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I opened up the sunroof and I just </v>

1604
01:17:18.731 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>started smoking a joint before they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut and I put a piece of gum in my mouth</v>

1605
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:27.010
<v Speaker 1>and I actually walked through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crosswalk to walk across the street and </v>

1606
01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:31.421
<v Speaker 1>there was a lady holding a kid with </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one in the thing and she looked </v>

1607
01:17:31.421 --> 01:17:33.830
<v Speaker 1>at me and when she looked at me and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1608
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:35.030
<v Speaker 1>this lady smells me.</v>

1609
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:37.640
<v Speaker 1>You know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't have a child,</v>

1610
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:42.970
<v Speaker 1>you don't give a fuck about refund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you have a child and you see a </v>

1611
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:45.740
<v Speaker 1>mom with a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel kind of fucking sorry man.</v>

1612
01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say it until she looked at me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she goes,</v>

1613
01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:53.200
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the kid in her thing and with the </v>

1614
01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Stroller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she looked at me,</v>

1615
01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.240
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue cheese with your fucking mother.</v>

1616
01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Buffalo.</v>

1617
01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I looked at her and she just kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking,</v>

1618
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:06.940
<v Speaker 1>but it was like the type of woman that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't say that to me with the kid </v>

1619
01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:07.790
<v Speaker 1>ended up pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1620
01:18:07.791 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 1>blue cheese with wings and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck your mother.</v>

1621
01:18:09.681 --> 01:18:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And She just kept walking.</v>

1622
01:18:11.511 --> 01:18:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

1623
01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1624
01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:20.570
<v Speaker 1>What about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Sacramento and families with </v>

1625
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy,</v>

1626
01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.470
<v Speaker 1>but the realm of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they come up to you and Tsa?</v>

1627
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget about Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tsa,</v>

1628
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:29.990
<v Speaker 1>but the realm of people and the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

1629
01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:31.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the actual,</v>

1630
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:36.581
<v Speaker 1>which always killed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been around for 20 years and </v>

1631
01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:38.780
<v Speaker 1>what made you come to my show is I </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know when somebody comes up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always they came to a show for </v>

1637
01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:52.790
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could do weird shit back then.</v>

1762
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:11.770

1763
01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:11.770
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

1764
01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:13.670
<v Speaker 1>just the beginning of the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

1765
01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:18.880
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newspapers regularly distributed </v>

1766
01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.791
<v Speaker 1>television shows on the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff was only like a few </v>

1767
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.140
<v Speaker 1>decades old when the sixties and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies rolled around.</v>

1768
01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really think about the timeline </v>

1769
01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:29.380
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of fascinating.</v>

1770
01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever think about the jump from in</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology from like,</v>

1771
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know how it sites that there </v>

1772
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:37.330
<v Speaker 1>was no us weekly there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1773
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So things kind of advance and now </v>

1774
01:25:41.150 --> 01:25:41.150
<v Speaker 1>everything's monitored and now for </v>
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>

1775
01:25:41.150 --> 01:25:43.760
<v Speaker 1>you can record a phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1776
01:25:43.761 --> 01:25:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Which is like would be a difficult thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do back then.</v>

1777
01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Or you can have a recorder running on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1778
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever think about how that lack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1779
01:25:51.711 --> 01:25:55.670
<v Speaker 1>the privacy goes away and how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to to some degree,</v>

1780
01:25:55.671 --> 01:26:00.671
<v Speaker 1>we can't even conceive of it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how easy it will be to record </v>

1781
01:26:00.671 --> 01:26:02.800
<v Speaker 1>everything at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how it'll,</v>

1782
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we joked like it's in</v>

1783
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:09.040
<v Speaker 3>your watch or it's in your glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it will be like you'll walk out of </v>

1784
01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.700
<v Speaker 3>every conversation and there'll be some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some form to document it.</v>

1785
01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be a total loss.</v>

1786
01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:20.000
<v Speaker 3>So there's gonna be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be some changes.</v>

1787
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:25.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily agree are done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not convinced I should say not </v>

1788
01:26:25.090 --> 01:26:29.351
<v Speaker 3>agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not convinced that they're going to </v>

1789
01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:29.351
<v Speaker 3>be bad to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1790
01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:29.351
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1791
01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I wonder like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1792
01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:35.970
<v Speaker 3>what's gained through this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>privacy now I'm not talking about like </v>

1793
01:26:35.970 --> 01:26:39.521
<v Speaker 3>privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like corporations or the government </v>

1794
01:26:39.521 --> 01:26:42.131
<v Speaker 3>being able to look into your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about we might get to a </v>

1795
01:26:42.131 --> 01:26:46.271
<v Speaker 3>position as human beings within our </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime where everybody looks into </v>

1796
01:26:46.271 --> 01:26:47.420
<v Speaker 3>everything about everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything,</v>

1797
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:52.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finances your day to day life sexually </v>

1798
01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:56.540
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing you everywhere you go,</v>

1799
01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:01.780
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what we could get to a position </v>

1800
01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.530
<v Speaker 3>where there's no disconnection from any </v>
<v Speaker 3>of us,</v>

1801
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:05.480
<v Speaker 3>but we're all connected to each other.</v>

1802
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:07.880
<v Speaker 3>If this keeps going the way it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1803
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:11.600
<v Speaker 3>So it used to be everybody lived far </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart and you know,</v>

1804
01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:13.660
<v Speaker 3>you have to ride a horse to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend,</v>

1805
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:18.700
<v Speaker 3>say hi and talk to them and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still alive when he came back the </v>

1806
01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:19.610
<v Speaker 3>next day know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was no communication.</v>

1807
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Then it got two phone calls it in as as </v>
<v Speaker 3>things have ramped up and now it's in </v>

1808
01:27:25.221 --> 01:27:30.221
<v Speaker 3>your phone and now your phone's in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch and now your watch can tell you </v>

1809
01:27:30.221 --> 01:27:34.781
<v Speaker 3>who's calling you and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can look at your phone and you see </v>

<v Speaker 3>the person start track type shit already</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>

1811
01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1812
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.320
<v Speaker 3>and it's getting deeper and deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper.</v>

1813
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 3>People are streaming live streaming live</v>
<v Speaker 3>streaming facebook.</v>

1814
01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.700

<v Speaker 3>There's a slew of people paying video </v>

1815
01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:49.010
<v Speaker 3>games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live streaming.</v>

1816
01:27:49.011 --> 01:27:52.160
<v Speaker 3>People are tuning in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching other people play video games.</v>

1817
01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:57.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're getting deeper and deeper </v>
<v Speaker 3>into this technological rabbit hole </v>

1818
01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:00.380
<v Speaker 3>where it becomes embedded in your life </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that was unimaginable before it</v>

1819
01:28:00.381 --> 01:28:05.381
<v Speaker 3>was introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing as cell phones before cell </v>

1820
01:28:05.381 --> 01:28:06.800
<v Speaker 3>phones were introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would have ever believed,</v>

1821
01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.240
<v Speaker 3>if you told them that you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to a point in human history where it</v>

1822
01:28:11.241 --> 01:28:16.241
<v Speaker 3>is totally common to see people staring </v>
<v Speaker 3>at electronic screens while they're all </v>

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1888
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I think about the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think about foods that are sweet,</v>

1889
01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.590
<v Speaker 1>like you can have them as long as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have too much,</v>

1890
01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:12.720
<v Speaker 1>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get crazy.</v>

1891
01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:15.120
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel about even going </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

1892
01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I think we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

1893
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:21.530
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting to this weird point where </v>

1894
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:22.980
<v Speaker 1>we're just relinquishing our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our consciousness to this machine,</v>

1895
01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:27.570
<v Speaker 1>relinquishing our consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection that we all enjoy.</v>

1896
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:30.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not a consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the consciousness.</v>

1897
01:31:30.481 --> 01:31:35.481
<v Speaker 1>We're all sharing about a certain topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have to interject on what we </v>

1898
01:31:35.481 --> 01:31:38.070
<v Speaker 1>think about Charlottesville or about </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump and stuff like that.</v>

1899
01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:41.760

1903
01:31:47.031 --> 01:31:48.780
<v Speaker 1>and Sundays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No reason to be on the Internet.</v>

1904
01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:53.810
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason that the shows are </v>

1905
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:54.870
<v Speaker 1>sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your family's at home.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How many people were looking down when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got hit by that car yesterday?</v>

1966
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 five people got hit,</v>

1967
01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:37.960
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cannot.</v>

1971
01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:52.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not smart to be walking around </v>

1972
01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:52.360
<v Speaker 1>staring up fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you have to look at it.</v>

1973
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1974
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.560
<v Speaker 1>there's times where like someone of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course sends you an address,</v>

1975
01:34:56.610 --> 01:34:59.210

<v Speaker 1>Then there's times you catch yourself.</v>

1976
01:34:59.240 --> 01:34:59.850
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going?</v>

1977
01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:04.160
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All three of us have children.</v>

1978
01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Do we want our children to grow up on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking computer?</v>

1979
01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Do we want them to have both?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to grow up on computers.</v>

1980
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:13.570
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1981
01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I want them to grow up in computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want that whole lifestyle to</v>

1982
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:20.120
<v Speaker 1>be on the computer.</v>

1984
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:25.070
<v Speaker 1>I want them to have life experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you know,</v>

1985
01:35:25.071 --> 01:35:28.190
<v Speaker 1>the only way you learn about life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes by having a negative,</v>

1986
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:30.170
<v Speaker 1>something negative happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So true.</v>

01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:56.200
<v Speaker 3>valley stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it heals up man,</v>

2107
01:40:56.201 --> 01:41:01.201
<v Speaker 3>but it makes sure it feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a similar one.</v>

2108
01:41:01.751 --> 01:41:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Tiger Balm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that girl Shit.</v>

2109
01:41:03.281 --> 01:41:08.281
<v Speaker 3>I have another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called something juice and when I </v>

2110
01:41:08.281 --> 01:41:10.951
<v Speaker 3>was a kid I used to have the I am poem </v>
<v Speaker 3>bag and I rubbed it on my hands and do </v>

2111
01:41:10.951 --> 01:41:13.660
<v Speaker 3>the I am poem technique and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With that it's called something that has</v>

2112
01:41:13.661 --> 01:41:17.110
<v Speaker 3>a weird smell to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like does this stuff do like when?</v>

2113
01:41:17.111 --> 01:41:22.111
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that stuff like heats your skin up </v>

2114
01:41:22.111 --> 01:41:22.111
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

2115
01:41:22.111 --> 01:41:22.690
<v Speaker 3>like a icy hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that kind of shit.</v>

2116
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:24.610
<v Speaker 3>What does that really doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

2117
01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just tricking you into </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>

2118
01:41:26.051 --> 01:41:29.360
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it really is someone who's</v>

2119
01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:32.920
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine who's a doctor </v>
<v Speaker 3>described it as a topical analgesic,</v>

2120
01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.890
<v Speaker 3>meaning that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does something to the surface of your</v>

2121
01:41:35.891 --> 01:41:38.380
<v Speaker 3>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe is it psychological that makes</v>

2122
01:41:38.381 --> 01:41:39.670
<v Speaker 3>you feel like it's healing up?</v>

2123
01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Like when you have a muscle soreness or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

2124
01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.210
<v Speaker 3>like if you have like a wound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little injury,</v>

2125
01:41:46.630 --> 01:41:50.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a psychology psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect to that heat and stuff.</v>

2126
01:41:50.770 --> 01:41:52.750
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you think you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>work done.</v>

2127
01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:57.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably a psychological aspect </v>

2128
01:41:57.810 --> 01:41:59.560
<v Speaker 3>to healing in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's 100 percent,</v>

2129
01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:02.380
<v Speaker 3>but I think you could sway it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better direction.</v>

2130
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2131
01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean like that's got to be what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>placebo effect is,</v>

2132
01:42:06.341 --> 01:42:11.341
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tell you they're going to give you </v>

2133
01:42:11.341 --> 01:42:11.341
<v Speaker 3>a pill and it's gonna make you feel bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

2134
01:42:11.341 --> 01:42:11.341
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>

2135
01:42:11.341 --> 01:42:13.450
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing they gave me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gave me the pill,</v>

2136
01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:16.570
<v Speaker 3>and you actually do feel better and even</v>
<v Speaker 3>show signs of recovery,</v>

2137
01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:20.500
<v Speaker 3>like immediately corresponding to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking that pill.</v>

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:38.500
<v Speaker 3>which is the crazier part even to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's.</v>

2163
01:43:38.770 --> 01:43:41.950
<v Speaker 3>He's gotten people train them to swim in</v>
<v Speaker 3>freezing water,</v>

2164
01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:45.520
<v Speaker 3>walk through ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also fight off a cold.</v>

2165
01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2166
01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Fuck me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use his breathing technique before </v>

2167
01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:51.720
<v Speaker 3>going on stage and when I do I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>better shows.</v>

2168
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:57.100
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you looked Kinda hyperoxygenate </v>

2169
01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:58.580
<v Speaker 2>and stimulate your mind how </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated breathing tick.</v>

2170
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Well it's a lot of what he does that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>find beneficial is like,</v>

2171
01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:07.190
<v Speaker 2>and I've heard this concept in yoga </v>
<v Speaker 2>before too,</v>

2172
01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.110
<v Speaker 2>is breathing in like take a giant breath</v>
<v Speaker 2>and letting out,</v>

2173
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:17.500
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting on about 20 percent and then </v>

2174
01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.340
<v Speaker 2>breathing in again as hard as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let it out about 20 percent breathing in</v>

2175
01:44:19.341 --> 01:44:23.330
<v Speaker 2>as hard as you can and then continue </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for like long periods of time.</v>

2176
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that in the Cryo tank where I stand</v>

2177
01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:28.550
<v Speaker 2>in the cold air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2178
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:33.850
<v Speaker 2>three minutes goes by like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant difference between when </v>

2179
01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I do that and when I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you focus on your breathing,</v>

2180
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:38.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely,</v>

2181
01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:43.210
<v Speaker 2>there's something about people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>encountering any sort of stimulation </v>

2182
01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:47.951
<v Speaker 2>where it's real hard to manage the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulation without letting everything </v>

2183
01:44:47.951 --> 01:44:51.311
<v Speaker 2>get fucking crazy and haywire and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to manage it has a gigantic effect </v>

2184
01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:57.160
<v Speaker 2>on what the actual results or the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of being this cold.</v>

2185
01:44:57.830 --> 01:45:00.440
<v Speaker 2>It's because it gets the same goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2186
01:45:00.441 --> 01:45:05.441
<v Speaker 2>but if you can control your breath and </v>
<v Speaker 2>control your consciousness and you're </v>

2187
01:45:05.441 --> 01:45:09.371
<v Speaker 2>doing something that seems to be heating</v>
<v Speaker 2>up your body to and a little bit of a </v>

2188
01:45:09.371 --> 01:45:10.430
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like an internal exercise because</v>

2189
01:45:10.431 --> 01:45:15.431
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to do because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking these big giant breasts of cold </v>

2190
01:45:15.431 --> 01:45:17.090
<v Speaker 2>air and then you're letting out a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you take it a big giant breath.</v>

2191
01:45:17.091 --> 01:45:21.200
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you're flexing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lungs and when you do that man,</v>

2192
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might make it 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent easier to deal with three </v>

2193
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:27.770
<v Speaker 2>minutes supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

2194
01:45:27.771 --> 01:45:29.870
<v Speaker 2>One of the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what year it is.</v>

2195
01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:34.871
<v Speaker 2>If you'd like to check whether the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians beat the fuck out of the </v>

2196
01:45:34.871 --> 01:45:39.071
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly Americans came out walking </v>

2197
01:45:39.071 --> 01:45:41.150
<v Speaker 2>you the flag and the Russian Joel Cave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

2198
01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2199
01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:48.800
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they couldn't figure out what the </v>

2200
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:48.800
<v Speaker 2>fuck is wrong with these motherfuckers.</v>

2201
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They warm up their lungs,</v>

2202
01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:54.080
<v Speaker 2>looked back to think about what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to do,</v>

2203
01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:59.081
<v Speaker 2>the technique they're about to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to let the blood go to the back of </v>

2204
01:45:59.081 --> 01:46:02.441
<v Speaker 2>something fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read about that was pretty </v>

2205
01:46:02.441 --> 01:46:02.441
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's true or not,</v>

2206
01:46:02.441 --> 01:46:06.281
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but supposedly that cardio was so ahead </v>

2207
01:46:06.281 --> 01:46:10.381
<v Speaker 2>of the United States because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a pre breathing exercises.</v>

2208
01:46:11.630 --> 01:46:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Thinking had something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is that the guy that also has the </v>

2209
01:46:16.630 --> 01:46:19.640
<v Speaker 2>record for the deepest drop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a different guy,</v>

2210
01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:20.990
<v Speaker 2>a different guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different guy.</v>

2211
01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:23.630
<v Speaker 2>He's the one that I wrote that I read </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2212
01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:28.920
<v Speaker 2>He used the one that wrote about about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you have to prepare for all that </v>

2213
01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.420
<v Speaker 2>stuff and that it was learned when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians came up at the.</v>

2214
01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.440
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to focus on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>breath,</v>

2215
01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:34.820
<v Speaker 2>like I don't do it much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

2216
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I actually been doing polities and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>way fucking harder than I thought it was</v>

2217
01:46:40.011 --> 01:46:42.050
<v Speaker 2>gonna be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but be like,</v>

2218
01:46:42.051 --> 01:46:44.090
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about your breath for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like an hour.</v>

2219
01:46:44.091 --> 01:46:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always.</v>

2220
01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:47.660
<v Speaker 2>You're always working on your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not.</v>

2221
01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:50.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not a secret</v>

2222
01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:54.690
<v Speaker 3>that like the greatest Jujitsu guy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all time had this crazy breath control.</v>

2223
01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Really Hixon Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had.</v>

2224
01:46:57.210 --> 01:47:00.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of videos of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He received a documentary choke.</v>

2225
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:01.800
<v Speaker 3>You ever heard of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2226
01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:05.040
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing documentary about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy Hixon Gracie,</v>

2227
01:47:05.041 --> 01:47:10.041
<v Speaker 3>who's almost universally regarded as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest Jujitsu player of all time and </v>

2228
01:47:10.041 --> 01:47:12.390
<v Speaker 3>fought a bunch of fights in mma and </v>
<v Speaker 3>strangled everybody fought,</v>

2229
01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.510
<v Speaker 3>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this video where he's doing this</v>

2230
01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:20.930
<v Speaker 3>yoga warm up sort of thing that he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>do every day and he does this thing with</v>

2231
01:47:21.541 --> 01:47:26.541
<v Speaker 3>his stomach that you watch them do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it starts warming his stomach up.</v>

2232
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.640
<v Speaker 3>He's doing this like fire breathing </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

2233
01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:34.820
<v Speaker 3>but then he starts sucking his stomach </v>
<v Speaker 3>into like the upper corners of his rib </v>

2234
01:47:35.551 --> 01:47:40.551
<v Speaker 3>cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rhythmically in this like almost </v>

2235
01:47:40.551 --> 01:47:42.060
<v Speaker 3>impossible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like can you watching them doing it?</v>

2236
01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Like he's warming everything up and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>once he gets it warmed up,</v>

2237
01:47:45.271 --> 01:47:47.580
<v Speaker 3>you starts wiggling the internals.</v>

2238
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:53.270
<v Speaker 3>But look at this man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck has that kind of control of</v>

2239
01:47:53.311 --> 01:47:56.670
<v Speaker 3>your abdominal muscles to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time he trained,</v>

2240
01:47:56.671 --> 01:47:58.410
<v Speaker 3>he did it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it constantly.</v>

2241
01:47:58.411 --> 01:48:00.240
<v Speaker 3>He did this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did yoga constantly.</v>

2242
01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:04.720

2257
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:55.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2265
01:49:16.261 --> 01:49:21.261

2266
01:49:21.261 --> 01:49:23.631
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu because you're being able to put</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body in these weird positions over </v>

2267
01:49:23.631 --> 01:49:25.020
<v Speaker 3>and over and over again to balance </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

2268
01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:30.740
<v Speaker 3>saw a bunch of controlling your body in </v>
<v Speaker 3>any weird way that you could possibly </v>

2269
01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:35.451
<v Speaker 3>encounter a position where you'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be strong wild shit because he was way </v>

2270
01:49:35.451 --> 01:49:39.160
<v Speaker 3>ahead of the curve man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was everybody back then was to,</v>

2271
01:49:39.161 --> 01:49:44.161

<v Speaker 3>and bench pressing and fucking running </v>

2272
01:49:44.401 --> 01:49:47.230

01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:50.280
<v Speaker 3>And Hickson was just strangling people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2274
01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.260
<v Speaker 3>it's really a fascinating thing when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop and think about it,</v>

2275
01:49:53.261 --> 01:49:58.261
<v Speaker 3>that this one guy was the best and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>far ahead of the curve.</v>

2276
01:49:58.571 --> 01:50:03.571
<v Speaker 3>And so few people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even people that really got into </v>

2277
01:50:03.571 --> 01:50:03.571
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw,</v>

2278
01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2279
01:50:04.511 --> 01:50:06.740
<v Speaker 3>he had amazing talent as dad was Leo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grace it.</v>

2280
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Those are two giant factors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the way he trained and the way </v>

2281
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:13.060
<v Speaker 3>he controlled his breath and his own </v>
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>

2282
01:50:13.061 --> 01:50:18.061
<v Speaker 3>Kron Gracie was world champion or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best grapplers in the world can do all </v>

2283
01:50:18.061 --> 01:50:22.771
<v Speaker 3>that stuff too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has massive breath control and he'll </v>

2284
01:50:22.771 --> 01:50:22.771
<v Speaker 3>tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about your breath.</v>

2285
01:50:22.771 --> 01:50:27.640
<v Speaker 3>Like being able to control your breath </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a massive part of your anxiety levels</v>

2286
01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:30.940
<v Speaker 3>to massive part of how you can deal with</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>

2287
01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:36.420
<v Speaker 3>how you can calm yourself down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have control and power over your </v>

2288
01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:37.540
<v Speaker 3>lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this too?</v>

2289
01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another.</v>

2290
01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:44.500
<v Speaker 1>He's out there in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guys actually doing it in the </v>

2291
01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:47.691
<v Speaker 1>jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacques already does a lot of that </v>

2292
01:50:47.691 --> 01:50:47.691
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all breathe naturally will make.</v>

2293
01:50:47.691 --> 01:50:51.671
<v Speaker 1>If you look at your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are breathing the way that we're </v>

2294
01:50:51.671 --> 01:50:54.480
<v Speaker 1>supposed to breathe somewhere with 10 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 or become a teenager.</v>

2295
01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go off like my breathing was </v>

2296
01:50:59.620 --> 01:50:59.670
<v Speaker 1>complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to seminars.</v>

2297
01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I went to digital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2298
01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:07.220
<v Speaker 1>when I went to Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I created so much fear in my mind from </v>

2299
01:51:07.321 --> 01:51:11.580
<v Speaker 1>being on my back that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately run outside and take my gear</v>

2300
01:51:11.581 --> 01:51:16.170
<v Speaker 1>off and pee my pants and people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit.</v>

2301
01:51:16.590 --> 01:51:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I just pay a little bit of my short</v>
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>

2302
01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Most people would have quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:51:21.150 --> 01:51:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2304
01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:24.780
<v Speaker 1>So I kept going back and I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>

2305
01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I would improve because of my car.</v>

2306
01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been smoking joints for 30 years.</v>

2307
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fat fuck.</v>

2308
01:51:30.090 --> 01:51:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that I had a bill,</v>

2309
01:51:31.861 --> 01:51:36.861
<v Speaker 1>but like I had to get Bob's route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mouthpiece to build my diaphragm </v>

2310
01:51:36.861 --> 01:51:38.400
<v Speaker 1>just to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no therapy.</v>

2311
01:51:38.401 --> 01:51:43.290
<v Speaker 1>All of this because of Jujitsu is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boss routing thing is legit.</v>

2312
01:51:43.291 --> 01:51:45.320
<v Speaker 1>When I hit the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use the bus route and thing.</v>

2313
01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what they're saying is the best </v>

2314
01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:52.671
<v Speaker 1>way to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just use it and it's an exercises </v>

2315
01:51:52.671 --> 01:51:52.671
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use It,</v>

2316
01:51:52.671 --> 01:51:56.211
<v Speaker 1>use it like an exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's do a few things with it and </v>

2317
01:51:56.211 --> 01:51:57.030
<v Speaker 1>just blow some air out with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like really good.</v>

2318
01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:00.540
<v Speaker 1>It's really helped me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how much I learned about like</v>

2319
01:52:00.541 --> 01:52:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I now I don't have as much anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I breathe it out.</v>

2320
01:52:04.801 --> 01:52:08.820
<v Speaker 1>It really fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've done a lot of reading about it,</v>

2321
01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but that guy's article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guy that dipped the longest,</v>

2322
01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:13.770
<v Speaker 1>his was the most interesting.</v>

2323
01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about the fucking license </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

2324
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:18.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2325
01:52:18.270 --> 01:52:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Once you.</v>

01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:25.530
<v Speaker 1>with time just to be on my back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be fearful.</v>

2327
01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just couldn't.</v>

2328
01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I just look back whenever I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2365
01:54:10.090 --> 01:54:11.920
<v Speaker 1>scraping some of his videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2366
01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm up to the 20 pounds from Barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2367
01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I started when I first got the club </v>
<v Speaker 1>bells from heartbreak.</v>

2368
01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.840
<v Speaker 1>My wrist was hurting with five pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even do the simple five </v>

2369
01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:24.490
<v Speaker 1>pounds one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm taking twenties,</v>

2370
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:26.570
<v Speaker 1>holding them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going all the way back,</v>

2371
01:54:27.190 --> 01:54:30.200
<v Speaker 1>bringing them back and it's all focused </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my back and breathing.</v>

2372
01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:32.770
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just threw shit to breathe.</v>

2373
01:54:32.771 --> 01:54:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't give a fuck if I get beat up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what was really bothering</v>

2374
01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:39.050
<v Speaker 1>me was the breathing and maybe getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at it.</v>

2375
01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm getting better at it.</v>

2376
01:54:41.001 --> 01:54:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Plus the sleep apnea had put a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

2377
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:46.550
<v Speaker 1>So being on my back and being out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>breath,</v>

2378

2383
01:55:03.471 --> 01:55:08.151
<v Speaker 3>wrestling training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it was a really strong move </v>

<v Speaker 3>sheik cause he was like the iron sheik </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't know.</v>

2386
01:55:13.230 --> 01:55:18.230
<v Speaker 3>He was a pro wrestler in the wwe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was wwf back then and you know,</v>

2387
01:55:18.421 --> 01:55:23.421
<v Speaker 3>he was before he was that he was a super</v>
<v Speaker 3>successful Iranian amateur wrestler.</v>

2388
01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:29.100
<v Speaker 3>He was a legit wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like legit wrestling skills and </v>

2389
01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:33.140
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously strong and he's holding </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things and I don't know how much </v>

2390
01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:33.840
<v Speaker 3>these things way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

2391
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:39.470
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like he's faking this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the slow motion of how he's </v>

2392
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:41.190
<v Speaker 3>moving in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look like heavy objects.</v>

2393
01:55:41.370 --> 01:55:45.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much they weigh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a really hard workout to do.</v>

2394
01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:46.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2395
01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:51.180
<v Speaker 3>I can barely do that shit with like 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds and I'm not bullshitting with one</v>

2396
01:55:51.181 --> 01:55:52.710
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

2397
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:58.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird control thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you realize like how you're strong </v>

2398
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:59.760
<v Speaker 3>in certain areas as a definitely </v>
<v Speaker 3>heaviest,</v>

2399
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:03.090
<v Speaker 3>heaviest fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're strong in certain areas.</v>

2400
01:56:03.091 --> 01:56:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy is super jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is that?</v>

2401
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:10.140
<v Speaker 3>Got Beautiful underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2402
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:15.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very difficult thing because you </v>

2403
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:17.400
<v Speaker 3>could be really strong when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a straight shoulder press,</v>

2404
01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:22.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could like hoist up like 70 </v>

2405
01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.561
<v Speaker 3>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no fucking way in the world </v>

2406
01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:24.561
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be moving around 70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds of fat.</v>

2407
01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:25.680
<v Speaker 3>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just can't do it.</v>

2408
01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:27.870
<v Speaker 3>Your arm's going to fall off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have,</v>

2409
01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:29.820
<v Speaker 3>especially if you have it in the form of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a club,</v>

2410
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000
<v Speaker 3>like you can't even get close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can do a lot of shit with heavy </v>

2411
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:35.000
<v Speaker 3>kettle bells.</v>

2412
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:35.610
<v Speaker 3>But when it comes to like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>clubs,</v>

2413
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I'd take two hands to move around a 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pound one,</v>

2414
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:41.430
<v Speaker 3>which is like if someone says like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds,</v>

2415
01:56:41.431 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 3>like do you bench press $30 Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all we got here.</v>

2416
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Thirty pounds bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even get up pump doing something</v>

2417
01:56:49.291 --> 01:56:53.160
<v Speaker 3>with one of these clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 30 pounds is fucking insane.</v>

2418
01:56:53.170 --> 01:56:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Saying you have to be so God damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>

2419
01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 3>And that sounds weird because it seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2420
01:56:58.921 --> 01:57:03.921
<v Speaker 3>well 30 pounds is 30 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you start swinging that shit </v>

2421
01:57:03.921 --> 01:57:06.741
<v Speaker 3>over your head and it's long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like the leverage is going </v>

2422
01:57:06.741 --> 01:57:08.190
<v Speaker 3>against you look at him like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>bulldozer too.</v>

2423
01:57:08.191 --> 01:57:13.191
<v Speaker 3>He was a bulldozer guy that's on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 3>calling everybody and everybody's all my</v>

2424
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:14.780
<v Speaker 3>dates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazis.</v>

2425
01:57:14.781 --> 01:57:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I retweeted them the other day about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazis.</v>

2426
01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:19.590
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was onstage with him in Toronto is one</v>

2427
01:57:19.591 --> 01:57:24.591
<v Speaker 3>of my favorite moments as a human calm </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you're bronies called </v>

2428
01:57:24.591 --> 01:57:26.880
<v Speaker 3>everybody a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hated everybody.</v>

2429
01:57:26.881 --> 01:57:30.060
<v Speaker 3>He was a good man though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was a stud wrestler.</v>

2430
01:57:30.061 --> 01:57:35.061
<v Speaker 3>But there's the dark secret of not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional wrestling but of I'm just </v>

2431
01:57:36.601 --> 01:57:38.310
<v Speaker 3>real high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real high level grappling.</v>

2432
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:43.290
<v Speaker 3>So the damage that gets done to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys bodies is almost unfixable.</v>

2433
01:57:43.291 --> 01:57:45.070
<v Speaker 3>And he's all fucked up now he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2434
01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:47.070
<v Speaker 3>like flares,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like not in a coma,</v>

2435
01:57:47.071 --> 01:57:50.880
<v Speaker 3>but in the last four or five days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard about that.</v>

2436
01:57:50.881 --> 01:57:51.960
<v Speaker 3>And how old is Rick Flair?</v>

2437
01:57:55.590 --> 01:57:56.310
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2438
01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:58.470
<v Speaker 3>they pay a price,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pay a price to,</v>

2439
01:57:58.730 --> 01:58:01.020
<v Speaker 3>to entertain in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know it's very,</v>

2440
01:58:01.050 --> 01:58:03.270
<v Speaker 3>very physically violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

2441
01:58:03.271 --> 01:58:06.360
<v Speaker 3>because it's not quote unquote a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

2442
01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:11.480
<v Speaker 3>whereas like there's an unplanned </v>
<v Speaker 3>outcome and they're just throwing </v>

2443
01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:11.480
<v Speaker 3>haymakers at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a real mma fight.</v>

2444
01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Just because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that they're not </v>

2445
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:17.360
<v Speaker 3>taking in a lot of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit with those fucking forearms.</v>

2446
01:58:17.361 --> 01:58:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Shivers and dropped a fucking chair on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2447
01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Like all that shit is fucking them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them had brain damage to a lot </v>

2448
01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:26.610
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's no sugar,</v>

2449
01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:31.640
<v Speaker 3>there's no studies on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure I'm sure some of them </v>

2450
01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:31.640
<v Speaker 3>avoided it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2451
01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:33.710
<v Speaker 3>some of them fought smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is he saying?</v>

02:12:26.031 --> 02:12:27.400
<v Speaker 1>mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

2726
02:12:27.650 --> 02:12:31.130
<v Speaker 1>So they had 13 supermarkets were like on</v>
<v Speaker 1>number five,</v>

2727
02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:34.280
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really on number five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew about number five.</v>

2728
02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:39.940
<v Speaker 1>So whatever was bought in that aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cash went upstairs for 13 </v>

2729
02:12:40.041 --> 02:12:45.041
<v Speaker 1>supermarkets on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would just go into a supermarket </v>

2730
02:12:45.041 --> 02:12:49.450
<v Speaker 1>and it had two lanes go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even worry about those two </v>

2731
02:12:49.450 --> 02:12:49.450
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>figuring out a way to crack that,</v>

2736
02:13:01.110 --> 02:13:06.110

<v Speaker 1>They cracked it after they made 10 </v>

2737
02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:06.110
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they cracked it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>guy by the name of Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something big fat guy.</v>

2744
02:13:21.230 --> 02:13:24.440
<v Speaker 1>He came out and he may never be shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking genius.</v>

2745
02:13:24.441 --> 02:13:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Joe came out of jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2746
02:13:26.361 --> 02:13:27.890
<v Speaker 1>everybody's shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social clubs,</v>

2747
02:13:27.891 --> 02:13:31.440
<v Speaker 1>everybody had to have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody had to have a job,</v>

2748
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.710
<v Speaker 1>no drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody stuck to it.</v>

2749
02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:37.060
<v Speaker 1>They were doing phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing phenomenal Joe Massino,</v>

2750
02:13:37.590 --> 02:13:41.520
<v Speaker 1>but somebody was shaking down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and he went in there and they</v>

2751
02:13:41.521 --> 02:13:45.060
<v Speaker 1>were giving him $20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week for security.</v>

2752
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So they couldn't figure out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>Messina because he wasn't doing anything</v>

2753
02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:54.330
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they got this forensic accountant to</v>

<v Speaker 1>FBI.</v>

2773
02:14:45.630 --> 02:14:49.650

<v Speaker 1>30 years in the marines that he's pretty</v>

<v Speaker 1>your asshole until they find something </v>

2786

<v Speaker 1>Can you really do that?</v>

2787
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck you call the irs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2788
02:15:30.241 --> 02:15:35.241
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch your ass or wait till you see the </v>

2789
02:15:35.241 --> 02:15:38.001
<v Speaker 1>end of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to all these people who've been </v>

2790
02:15:38.001 --> 02:15:38.001
<v Speaker 1>talking shit about trump.</v>

2791
02:15:38.001 --> 02:15:41.270
<v Speaker 1>You think Kathy Griffin's they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get harassed and anybody else </v>

2792
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:44.570
<v Speaker 1>you watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust trump when it comes to </v>

2793
02:15:44.570 --> 02:15:46.791
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he's a bad dude or </v>

2794
02:15:46.791 --> 02:15:48.891
<v Speaker 1>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying is trump's one of those </v>

2795
02:15:48.891 --> 02:15:48.891
<v Speaker 1>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really don't want to mess with it.</v>

2796
02:15:48.891 --> 02:15:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that if people want to put </v>

2797
02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:54.090
<v Speaker 1>pressure on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could get you to the irs.</v>

2798
02:15:54.091 --> 02:15:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I think agencies had been doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2799
02:15:56.550 --> 02:16:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you guys think of this </v>

2800
02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Charlottesville stuff and his reaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it?</v>

2801
02:16:01.710 --> 02:16:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just a big failure man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he.</v>

2802
02:16:04.190 --> 02:16:09.190
<v Speaker 1>What was he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you feel like when he fumbled </v>

2803
02:16:09.190 --> 02:16:10.440
<v Speaker 1>on what I thought was two levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2804
02:16:10.441 --> 02:16:14.070
<v Speaker 1>so there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the leadership like presidential</v>

2805
02:16:14.071 --> 02:16:15.600
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where you go,</v>

2806
02:16:15.601 --> 02:16:19.560
<v Speaker 1>like this is the office that we look to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the person.</v>

2807
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:23.250
<v Speaker 1>So I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird how he makes,</v>

2808
02:16:23.251 --> 02:16:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is about him.</v>

2809
02:16:25.050 --> 02:16:29.470
<v Speaker 1>And he even started one of those press </v>
<v Speaker 1>conferences and it went like</v>

2810
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:31.890
<v Speaker 4>how the economy's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

2811
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:36.940
<v Speaker 4>I think it's hard to view that dude </v>
<v Speaker 4>morally as somebody that you're,</v>

2812
02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:40.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that you would enjoy being </v>
<v Speaker 4>around as a person.</v>

2813
02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:43.150
<v Speaker 4>And then I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>

2814
02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:45.850
<v Speaker 4>I get what he was trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do to,</v>

2815
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:46.600
<v Speaker 4>with his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2816
02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:49.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>criticizing and tif and stuff like I,</v>

2817
02:16:49.410 --> 02:16:50.280
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2818
02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:55.380
<v Speaker 4>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like it's the lack of savviness is </v>

2819
02:16:55.380 --> 02:16:59.941
<v Speaker 4>even maybe more like in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in not knowing like this is a time where</v>

2820
02:16:59.981 --> 02:17:03.280
<v Speaker 4>you do this and not that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's also something you're like,</v>

2821
02:17:03.281 --> 02:17:08.281
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he just just feels like it's </v>

2822
02:17:08.281 --> 02:17:11.010
<v Speaker 4>totally unfit for the job in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while I also feel like when you're,</v>

2823
02:17:12.300 --> 02:17:17.300
<v Speaker 4>when you're the president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the workload must be impossible to </v>

2824
02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:21.061
<v Speaker 4>imagine before you get in there and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you get in there you're dealing </v>

2825
02:17:21.061 --> 02:17:24.871
<v Speaker 4>with all these pressures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these super important decisions and </v>

2826
02:17:24.871 --> 02:17:26.680
<v Speaker 4>all these different areas and then some </v>
<v Speaker 4>new shit comes up.</v>

2827
02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:27.970
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think,</v>

2828
02:17:27.971 --> 02:17:30.430
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not even seeing this as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical of like I don't like him.</v>

2829
02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:35.670
<v Speaker 4>I really think he is the only a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people can experience this is </v>

2830
02:17:36.010 --> 02:17:38.710
<v Speaker 4>truly like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit with what this job entails.</v>

2831
02:17:38.930 --> 02:17:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really like one of those </v>

2832
02:17:43.930 --> 02:17:43.930
<v Speaker 4>things where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

2833
02:17:43.930 --> 02:17:48.130
<v Speaker 4>And you can see that he's constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he always refers to the campaign </v>

2834
02:17:48.130 --> 02:17:51.461
<v Speaker 4>still always in any conversation we'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about like I beat those guys </v>

2835
02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:53.230
<v Speaker 4>because I think that's the part that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoyed.</v>

2836
02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:57.270
<v Speaker 4>He enjoyed the competition days of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>campaign and I think like,</v>

2837
02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:00.130
<v Speaker 4>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's always bringing up like the new.</v>

2838
02:18:00.410 --> 02:18:03.220
<v Speaker 4>But the dad was setting records for for </v>
<v Speaker 4>months and months and months,</v>

2839
02:18:03.221 --> 02:18:08.221
<v Speaker 4>but like he'll still tweets will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that or interviews will be about </v>

2840
02:18:08.221 --> 02:18:10.780
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't not make a conversation,</v>

2841
02:18:11.050 --> 02:18:12.690
<v Speaker 4>a statement with talking to.</v>

2842
02:18:12.730 --> 02:18:15.360
<v Speaker 4>It probably is a connection though </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the Dow,</v>

2843
02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:20.460
<v Speaker 4>the up and him being an office and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people thinking that he's friendly to </v>

2844
02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:20.460
<v Speaker 4>business to business markets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>

2845
02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:25.291
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's also no doubt that </v>

2846
02:18:25.291 --> 02:18:28.080
<v Speaker 4>unemployment was at record lows and </v>
<v Speaker 4>setting records beforehand and the Dow </v>

2847
02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:30.370
<v Speaker 4>has been breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has been on an upswing for years now.</v>

2848
02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:35.460
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that how it always is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like presidents always come in and take </v>

2849
02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:35.570
<v Speaker 4>advantage of the upward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2850
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:40.810
<v Speaker 4>of course he's not the first highly </v>
<v Speaker 4>predictive bucket that the economy does </v>

2851
02:18:40.810 --> 02:18:41.680
<v Speaker 4>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These ebbs and flows.</v>

2852
02:18:41.770 --> 02:18:43.690
<v Speaker 4>It does come in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>abs and flows in the market.</v>

2853
02:18:44.170 --> 02:18:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Inevitably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in in the history of it always </v>

2854
02:18:49.170 --> 02:18:49.170
<v Speaker 4>comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always comes back.</v>

2855
02:18:49.170 --> 02:18:49.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you.</v>

2856
02:18:49.170 --> 02:18:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Even if you stayed through like black </v>
<v Speaker 4>Monday,</v>

2857
02:18:51.761 --> 02:18:56.761
<v Speaker 4>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The market's still eventually comes </v>

2858
02:18:56.761 --> 02:18:59.431
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm too stupid to understand that I'm </v>

2859
02:18:59.431 --> 02:18:59.431
<v Speaker 4>too stupid to get the market.</v>

2860
02:18:59.431 --> 02:18:59.431
<v Speaker 4>You know you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2861
02:18:59.431 --> 02:18:59.530
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2862
02:18:59.531 --> 02:19:04.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean I am in the sense that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>really interested in pursuing those </v>

2863
02:19:04.531 --> 02:19:04.531
<v Speaker 4>lines of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>

2864
02:19:04.531 --> 02:19:05.530
<v Speaker 4>That's different.</v>

02:20:21.150 --> 02:20:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Tell you something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2890
02:20:22.461 --> 02:20:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I had to sit in my wife down like a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell about csm.</v>

2891
02:20:27.171 --> 02:20:32.171
<v Speaker 1>BC was not allowed of the house no more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife is very political and I had to </v>

2892
02:20:32.171 --> 02:20:33.890
<v Speaker 1>cut her off like I can't have too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>

2893
02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:36.590
<v Speaker 1>It's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't have the tools to the table,</v>

2894
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:41.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would go out to dinner and somebody </v>

2895
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.930
<v Speaker 1>would bring something up and I had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick her under the table and I feel bad.</v>

2896
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's not talk about that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2897
02:20:44.170 --> 02:20:45.280
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2898
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:47.290
<v Speaker 1>how you hear that expression more than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2899
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:50.970
<v Speaker 1>as a kid where people were like never </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring up politics or religion,</v>

2900
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.860
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2901
02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.560
<v Speaker 1>And as a kid you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why that,</v>

2902
02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:57.500
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the age where it becomes the</v>

2903
02:20:57.501 --> 02:20:58.730
<v Speaker 1>most clear and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at,</v>

2904
02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:00.710
<v Speaker 1>at the time where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2905
02:21:00.711 --> 02:21:05.711
<v Speaker 1>I told we can actually probably have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good time if no one talks about these </v>

2906
02:21:05.711 --> 02:21:05.711
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2907
02:21:05.711 --> 02:21:10.230
<v Speaker 1>And it always comes up guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see for people talk for five </v>

2908
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:12.500
<v Speaker 1>minutes about anything without somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing something up political.</v>

2909
02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:14.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the week,</v>

2910
02:21:14.391 --> 02:21:16.250
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still gotta get up and go to work.</v>

2911
02:21:16.251 --> 02:21:19.010
<v Speaker 1>You still gotta get up her groceries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She still gotta wipe your ass.</v>

2912
02:21:19.430 --> 02:21:24.380
<v Speaker 1>All of this knowledge and gops and slds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Hudson county,</v>

2913
02:21:24.381 --> 02:21:27.230
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which comes into the Cook County,</v>

2914
02:21:27.231 --> 02:21:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2915
02:21:28.430 --> 02:21:32.680
<v Speaker 1>So I learned about politics and a micro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a smaller one?</v>

2916
02:21:32.730 --> 02:21:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Micro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a horrible thing.</v>

2917
02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I benefited from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no show jobs.</v>

2918
02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I had to rip down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show jobs.</v>

2919
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I had a no show job at harvest med </v>
<v Speaker 1>school when I was a kid going there once</v>

2920
02:21:45.321 --> 02:21:47.800
<v Speaker 1>a week and pick up a check and laugh at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old Japanese.</v>

2921
02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never moved the desk,</v>

2922
02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:52.580
<v Speaker 1>no Karma and got me the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got arrested.</v>

2923
02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:55.100
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>

2924
02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I saw the level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never interested me.</v>

2925
02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people fucking pukes they're </v>

<v Speaker 1>before you guys were talking about </v>

2928

<v Speaker 1>taxpayer pay money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the agenda for the 12 </v>

2929
02:22:09.521 --> 02:22:13.631
<v Speaker 1>fucking idiots that sit there with suits</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the old and white and they sit there </v>

2930
02:22:13.631 --> 02:22:17.660
<v Speaker 1>and 12 hours to make a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where our money goes.</v>

2931
02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2932
02:22:18.471 --> 02:22:22.400
<v Speaker 1>you don't know about bureaucracy till my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother died.</v>

2933
02:22:22.430 --> 02:22:24.830
<v Speaker 1>That's where I learned about bureaucracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 4:15.</v>

2934
02:22:25.050 --> 02:22:27.360
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't like it because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother died.</v>

2935
02:22:27.361 --> 02:22:32.361
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even collect social security </v>
<v Speaker 1>without coming up with 92 sheets of </v>

2936
02:22:32.361 --> 02:22:33.750
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking social security number.</v>

2937
02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:36.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when she died.</v>

2938
02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:39.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's an exit ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me my fucking money.</v>

2939
02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is your fucking harder than money.</v>

2943
02:22:50.850 --> 02:22:53.430
<v Speaker 1>That's when you learn that it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

2944
02:22:53.530 --> 02:22:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And this is all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are taxed in four years.</v>

02:23:14.451 --> 02:23:16.140
<v Speaker 1>fucking in the black market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you gotta pay the sneakers,</v>

2950
02:23:16.141 --> 02:23:18.540
<v Speaker 1>which are $100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid though,</v>

2951
02:23:18.570 --> 02:23:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Texas willow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to union city.</v>

2952
02:23:20.671 --> 02:23:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I told him I want to play basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put you on a team,</v>

2953
02:23:23.221 --> 02:23:26.880
<v Speaker 1>they give you a shirt and you played </v>
<v Speaker 1>every week for free.</v>

2954
02:23:26.881 --> 02:23:29.460
<v Speaker 1>It didn't cost you anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the fucking.</v>

2955
02:23:29.461 --> 02:23:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know about taxes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything Joe.</v>

2956
02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:38.240
<v Speaker 1>All I know about is when I go buy a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane ticket and I look at those prices </v>

2957
02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:42.561
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the family or to that isn't </v>

2958
02:23:42.561 --> 02:23:42.561
<v Speaker 1>doing that well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2959
02:23:42.561 --> 02:23:43.560
<v Speaker 1>What about the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was,</v>

2960
02:23:43.561 --> 02:23:48.561
<v Speaker 1>if I was really a tax or have felonies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't vote so I don't even let that </v>

2961
02:23:49.291 --> 02:23:54.291
<v Speaker 1>thing on my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the $50 I got to pay for </v>

2962
02:23:54.291 --> 02:23:54.570
<v Speaker 1>parking when I go to a UFC event?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2963
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:59.750
<v Speaker 1>What about the $184 for a fucking lake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A ticket with a $100 for a fucking </v>

2964
02:24:01.141 --> 02:24:02.580
<v Speaker 1>baseball ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When does it end?</v>

2965
02:24:02.610 --> 02:24:05.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about anything else.</v>

2966

<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2967
02:24:10.890 --> 02:24:15.890

<v Speaker 1>the American family that the American </v>

2968
02:24:15.890 --> 02:24:17.250
<v Speaker 1>family does not stand a chance in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country no more.</v>

2969
02:24:17.580 --> 02:24:21.170
<v Speaker 1>If your wife works and you have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>date care,</v>

2970
02:24:22.050 --> 02:24:22.920

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2972
02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:29.520

<v Speaker 1>That's $800 a month for the average </v>

2974
02:24:35.281 --> 02:24:40.281
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the average person making this </v>

2975
02:24:40.281 --> 02:24:40.281
<v Speaker 1>fucking country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

02:24:40.281 --> 02:24:43.970
<v Speaker 1>So your taxes are getting used for shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I taxes are getting used for shit shit </v>

2977
02:24:48.390 --> 02:24:52.530
<v Speaker 1>because they're not going to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to go $800 a month.</v>

2978
02:24:52.531 --> 02:24:53.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

2979
02:24:53.281 --> 02:24:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Like 900 $9,600</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

2980
02:24:57.330 --> 02:25:00.660
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for fucking and the girl was telling</v>

2981
02:25:00.661 --> 02:25:05.661
<v Speaker 1>me that her son has to volunteer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>help other kids to get that rate city </v>

2982
02:25:06.571 --> 02:25:10.860
<v Speaker 1>and I just was telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kindergarten at monarch is 30,</v>

2983
02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:15.900
<v Speaker 1>$34,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is in the valley and you know,</v>

2984
02:25:15.901 --> 02:25:20.901
<v Speaker 1>don't even mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other two were the daughter went to </v>

2985
02:25:20.901 --> 02:25:20.901
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2986
02:25:20.901 --> 02:25:20.901
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

2987
02:25:20.901 --> 02:25:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about all this.</v>

2988
02:25:21.541 --> 02:25:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we were living in Manhattan,</v>

2989
02:25:23.831 --> 02:25:24.030
<v Speaker 1>there'll</v>

2990
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.070
<v Speaker 2>be a goddamn bark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was a bargain bargain.</v>

2991
02:25:27.310 --> 02:25:29.320
<v Speaker 2>That's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think about politics,</v>

2992
02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:34.680
<v Speaker 2>I think about people who are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggling that have two children and </v>

2993
02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:37.480
<v Speaker 2>they can't go to a dodger game with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking baseball games you go to.</v>

2994
02:25:37.530 --> 02:25:40.570
<v Speaker 2>As a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you how many I went to as a</v>

2995
02:25:40.571 --> 02:25:41.450
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:45.430
<v Speaker 2>But with these families cannot afford a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dodger game,</v>

2997
02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:47.530
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking savage.</v>

2998
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:49.420
<v Speaker 2>My uncle loves baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's on old man.</v>

2999
02:25:49.421 --> 02:25:54.421
<v Speaker 2>I would go to costco and for $50 I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>two tickets to hotdogs to sodas and a </v>

3000
02:25:54.421 --> 02:25:56.770
<v Speaker 2>parking spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about the fucking game.</v>

3001
02:25:56.771 --> 02:26:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I take can be 74.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once magic took over the dodgers,</v>

3002
02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:02.820
<v Speaker 2>they don't give you that deal no more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want.</v>

3003
02:26:02.850 --> 02:26:05.710
<v Speaker 2>It seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have a giant population</v>

3004
02:26:05.711 --> 02:26:09.390
<v Speaker 2>like we do in La and a something like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dodger take care of someone,</v>

3005
02:26:09.430 --> 02:26:11.140
<v Speaker 2>even though it's a giant number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3006
02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.860
<v Speaker 2>it's still a small percentage of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge population.</v>

3007
02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:17.050
<v Speaker 2>I guess they just realize anybody does </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3008
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:21.550
<v Speaker 2>realizes he just jack it up higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get a smaller percentage</v>

3009
02:26:21.551 --> 02:26:22.780
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's still enough people,</v>

3010
02:26:22.781 --> 02:26:23.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3011
02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Like why would we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that.</v>

3012
02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Let's just make more and then if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how it is when you go to a </v>

3013
02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:31.990
<v Speaker 2>theater or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be twice that.</v>

3014
02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:37.020
<v Speaker 2>If there's some sort of a baseball game </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that or one of those </v>

3015
02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:41.040
<v Speaker 2>huge stadiums,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they about all the people that have to </v>

3016
02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:43.261
<v Speaker 2>get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the people that are working there </v>

3017
02:26:43.261 --> 02:26:45.181
<v Speaker 2>while you're working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like giant staff of humans that </v>

3018
02:26:45.181 --> 02:26:45.250
<v Speaker 2>have to keep that thing running smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3019
02:26:45.251 --> 02:26:48.850
<v Speaker 2>What about the American family that </v>
<v Speaker 2>flies a water?</v>

3020
02:26:49.330 --> 02:26:52.760
<v Speaker 2>It's $4 and fifty cents for bottled </v>
<v Speaker 2>water recharging.</v>

3021
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:54.680
<v Speaker 2>I thought water was free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give you a cup of water,</v>

3022
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:55.750
<v Speaker 2>a cup of water.</v>

3023
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:58.180
<v Speaker 2>What if and then when you go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tsa,</v>

3024
02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:01.160
<v Speaker 2>you can't bring the water through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

3025
02:27:01.170 --> 02:27:06.170
<v Speaker 2>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can buy water on the other side of </v>

3026
02:27:06.170 --> 02:27:09.071
<v Speaker 2>the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Joe Rogan you just barely getting by </v>

3027
02:27:09.071 --> 02:27:10.660
<v Speaker 2>and you have three fucking kids and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>$3 a fucking water.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the shit that has always </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He wants to take his kid to a dodger </v>

3061
02:28:34.731 --> 02:28:36.620
<v Speaker 2>How long have you known me Joe Rogan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years.</v>

3062
02:28:36.621 --> 02:28:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I did time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they use a verb.</v>

3063
02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

3064
02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:42.410
<v Speaker 2>ever heard me say some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy shit.</v>

3065
02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:44.390
<v Speaker 2>But you've never heard me say the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>pig.</v>

3066
02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:50.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the most respect for police </v>

3067
02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:50.520
<v Speaker 2>officers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a small percentage of people.</v>

3068
02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:53.630
<v Speaker 2>A stressful job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something's going on now.</v>

3069
02:28:53.810 --> 02:28:56.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not just stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about two days ago,</v>

3070
02:28:56.061 --> 02:28:58.790
<v Speaker 2>the minutes with the gun to the black </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple,</v>

3071
02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:01.070
<v Speaker 2>while he was getting his license and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they kept saying,</v>

3072
02:29:01.071 --> 02:29:03.650
<v Speaker 2>please put the gun away and the guy held</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gun.</v>

3073
02:29:03.651 --> 02:29:05.230
<v Speaker 2>There is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

3074
02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:08.750
<v Speaker 2>And then I love when if they shoot a </v>
<v Speaker 2>black person,</v>

3075
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:11.240
<v Speaker 2>they just get like the black da that go </v>
<v Speaker 2>up there and say,</v>

3076
02:29:11.241 --> 02:29:14.780
<v Speaker 2>well we looked at this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be up that black metallic cat downtown,</v>

3077
02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:17.170
<v Speaker 2>eight cops to beat up a black retard.</v>

3078
02:29:17.540 --> 02:29:22.540
<v Speaker 2>And then the fucking kid died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said it's a fucking black kids </v>

3079
02:29:22.540 --> 02:29:22.540
<v Speaker 2>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking retarded.</v>

3080
02:29:22.540 --> 02:29:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Eight cops on top of him beating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this goes on constantly and you know</v>

3081
02:29:26.721 --> 02:29:29.330
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen and you fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what's going to happen.</v>

3082
02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:31.400
<v Speaker 2>You know exactly what's going to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

3083
02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Two or three years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all it takes is three angry black guys,</v>

3084
02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:38.990
<v Speaker 2>three angry black guys with a surplus to</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread the word.</v>

3085
02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:44.200
<v Speaker 2>It was done with the Black Panthers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was dunphy is three angry back like </v>

3086
02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:45.680
<v Speaker 2>black guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to fucking start going</v>

3087
02:29:45.681 --> 02:29:48.290
<v Speaker 2>around in the cities and saying there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a fire.</v>

3088
02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:51.170
<v Speaker 2>And with all these cops show up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be on Ruby's.</v>

3089
02:29:51.171 --> 02:29:56.171
<v Speaker 2>And they gotta open up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to happen in American </v>

3090
02:29:56.171 --> 02:29:56.840
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some reading happened after Dallas,</v>

3091
02:29:58.320 --> 02:30:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was so don't fucking tell me this </v>

3092
02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:03.320
<v Speaker 2>is going to happen.</v>

3093
02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Three black guys that went through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>service that got weapons,</v>

3094
02:30:05.450 --> 02:30:07.580
<v Speaker 2>like I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're retarded,</v>

3095
02:30:07.581 --> 02:30:09.050
<v Speaker 2>you can't get weapons to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

3096
02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:14.080
<v Speaker 2>I get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck you want and </v>

3097
02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:14.080
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get you something in an hour,</v>

3098
02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:14.390
<v Speaker 2>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get you something to go fight.</v>

3099
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I believe you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so nevermind.</v>

3100
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Assault rifles and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all you need is five assault </v>

3101
02:30:21.550 --> 02:30:25.361
<v Speaker 2>rifles and say that a woman is getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>raped at the end of the fucking a </v>

3102
02:30:25.361 --> 02:30:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Cherokee Street and wait for 20 cops to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come and open up on them.</v>

3103
02:30:28.041 --> 02:30:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Dogs all headshots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>headshots and leg shots.</v>

3104
02:30:31.430 --> 02:30:34.370
<v Speaker 2>That's going to happen eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this cannot continue.</v>

3105
02:30:34.850 --> 02:30:39.850
<v Speaker 2>This cannot continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people that become cops </v>

3106
02:30:39.850 --> 02:30:44.290
<v Speaker 2>have a very difficult time doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for some people it's </v>

3107
02:30:44.290 --> 02:30:47.681
<v Speaker 2>unmanageable and I think if you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about all the interactions and all the </v>

3108
02:30:47.681 --> 02:30:49.880
<v Speaker 2>police officers have with all the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day long,</v>

3109
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:54.910
<v Speaker 2>all across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of it is </v>

3110
02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:54.910
<v Speaker 2>inconsequential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people,</v>

3111
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:57.530
<v Speaker 2>traffic violations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little things here and there,</v>

3112
02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:00.860
<v Speaker 2>but there's going to be a percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that percentage?</v>

3113
02:31:00.861 --> 02:31:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Is it even one percent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>

3114
02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:06.380
<v Speaker 2>but if that one percent gets online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we focused on that one percent,</v>

3115
02:31:06.530 --> 02:31:11.530
<v Speaker 2>so whether it's that guy planting drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Baltimore or these guys beating up </v>

3116
02:31:11.530 --> 02:31:15.941
<v Speaker 2>this giant white guy was giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wasn't threatening them in any </v>

3117
02:31:15.941 --> 02:31:16.010
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just didn't want these guys like fucking</v>

3118
02:31:16.011 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 2>danger in them and I think there's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>way</v>

3119
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:23.690
<v Speaker 3>too few people that are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>navigating the waters,</v>

3120
02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:27.450
<v Speaker 3>the waters of that kind of job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that kind of job is almost.</v>

3121
02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:32.130
<v Speaker 3>It's almost as bad or as difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather as a being in the military.</v>

3122
02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Your life is on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're at risk all the time.</v>

3123
02:31:36.210 --> 02:31:38.550
<v Speaker 3>Constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when people will call you a cop</v>

3124
02:31:38.551 --> 02:31:40.200
<v Speaker 3>apologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it like that.</v>

3125
02:31:40.620 --> 02:31:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this shit goes down,</v>

3126
02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:44.580
<v Speaker 3>someone's breaking into your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're calling the cops,</v>

3127
02:31:44.581 --> 02:31:45.630
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3128
02:31:45.631 --> 02:31:50.631
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're here for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to pretend that you don't need them </v>

3129
02:31:50.631 --> 02:31:50.631
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3130
02:31:50.631 --> 02:31:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Maybe someday we will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but right now you need cops for sure,</v>

3131
02:31:55.220 --> 02:32:00.220
<v Speaker 3>and definitely they need each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need cops to and they know it and </v>

3132
02:32:00.220 --> 02:32:04.371
<v Speaker 3>they and they see it more than you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're the ones who respond to </v>

3133
02:32:04.371 --> 02:32:05.310
<v Speaker 3>murderers and armed robberies and rapes.</v>

3134
02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:10.430
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones who have to show up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>handle car accidents on the highway </v>

3135
02:32:10.430 --> 02:32:10.920
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean how much special training do they</v>

3136
02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:14.370
<v Speaker 3>have that they get to deal with bodies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are torn apart for how much special</v>

3137
02:32:14.371 --> 02:32:15.100
<v Speaker 3>training?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3138
02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:16.170
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

3139
02:32:16.530 --> 02:32:19.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure you could even adequately </v>
<v Speaker 3>train a person.</v>

3140
02:32:20.130 --> 02:32:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Some people can handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>

3141
02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:27.020
<v Speaker 3>but there's some people they see some </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark shit and they just don't recover </v>

3142
02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:31.550
<v Speaker 3>and then you ask those people to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep pulling people over and I also </v>

3143
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.620
<v Speaker 3>think that they should train the cops a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little more.</v>

3144
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:33.870
<v Speaker 3>I see a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have the money.</v>

3145
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I say I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

3146
02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:40.860
<v Speaker 3>I see a lot of dumb shit in La Times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're on Hollywood boulevard,</v>

3147
02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:45.940
<v Speaker 3>bumper to bumper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you go to see what it is and it's a </v>

3148
02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:45.940

<v Speaker 3>the carpet.</v>

<v Speaker 3>scumbag.</v>

3151

<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck.</v>

3153
02:32:54.270 --> 02:32:59.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day I yelled from the car and they </v>

<v Speaker 3>The police have tried to tell people </v>

3173
02:33:42.111 --> 02:33:46.601
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty sure my spreading fake </v>

3174
02:33:46.601 --> 02:33:46.601
<v Speaker 3>news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that they can.</v>

3175
02:33:46.601 --> 02:33:48.340
<v Speaker 3>Let's find out if that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3176
02:33:48.690 --> 02:33:53.690
<v Speaker 3>are there places where it's illegal to </v>
<v Speaker 3>film the cops and know they can tell </v>

3177
02:33:53.690 --> 02:33:54.510
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if there's a situation going down,</v>

3178
02:33:54.570 --> 02:33:55.850
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I was lying when I said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3179
02:33:56.280 --> 02:34:01.280
<v Speaker 3>that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can tell you that they need a </v>

3180
02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:01.280
<v Speaker 3>certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bit of space,</v>

3181
02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:01.920
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think they can tell you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop filming.</v>

3182
02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

3183
02:34:03.290 --> 02:34:08.290
<v Speaker 3>I tried to go to Vegas and there was all</v>
<v Speaker 3>vacation and there were these fucking </v>

3184
02:34:09.420 --> 02:34:14.420
<v Speaker 3>smart kids and the cops kept telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>them they had to get off and they would </v>

3185
02:34:14.420 --> 02:34:18.051
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would shoot him the cops and </v>

3186
02:34:18.051 --> 02:34:18.051
<v Speaker 3>telling them that it was there.</v>

3187
02:34:18.051 --> 02:34:18.051
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

3188
02:34:18.051 --> 02:34:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Taking photographs and videos of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are plainly visible and public </v>

3189
02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:26.041
<v Speaker 3>spaces as a constitutional right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that includes police and other </v>

3190
02:34:26.041 --> 02:34:26.041
<v Speaker 3>government officials carrying out their </v>
<v Speaker 3>duties.</v>

3191
02:34:26.041 --> 02:34:30.331
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a widespread and continuing </v>

3192
02:34:30.331 --> 02:34:32.641
<v Speaker 3>pattern of law enforcement officers </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordering people to stop taking </v>

3193
02:34:32.641 --> 02:34:34.210
<v Speaker 3>photographs or video in public places </v>
<v Speaker 3>and harassing,</v>

3194
02:34:34.211 --> 02:34:39.211
<v Speaker 3>detaining and arresting those who fail </v>
<v Speaker 3>to comply the right of citizens to </v>

3195
02:34:39.211 --> 02:34:40.840
<v Speaker 3>record the police as a critical check </v>
<v Speaker 3>and balance.</v>

3196
02:34:40.841 --> 02:34:43.120
<v Speaker 3>It creates an independent record of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>took place in,</v>

3197
02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:45.370
<v Speaker 3>in a particular incident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3198
02:34:45.371 --> 02:34:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Well that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

3199
02:34:46.660 --> 02:34:51.660
<v Speaker 3>So that seems like maybe what I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading was about people that got </v>

3200
02:34:51.660 --> 02:34:56.371
<v Speaker 3>arrested for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the cops were arresting him for but </v>

3201
02:34:56.371 --> 02:34:59.041
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't even though it's not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal and they can still arrest you </v>

3202
02:34:59.041 --> 02:35:01.771
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you go to court and you figure out </v>

3203
02:35:01.771 --> 02:35:03.460
<v Speaker 3>the arrest and so if a cop arrest you </v>
<v Speaker 3>for not listening to him.</v>

3204
02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:04.640
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

3205
02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:09.660
<v Speaker 3>if say save a cop is arresting someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're filming it because he's </v>

3206
02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:12.391
<v Speaker 3>kicking this guy's ass and you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>filming it and the cop says if you do </v>

3207
02:35:12.391 --> 02:35:15.721
<v Speaker 3>not put that camera down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will arrest you and they can still </v>

3208
02:35:15.721 --> 02:35:18.301
<v Speaker 3>arrest you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could say you're obstructing </v>

3209
02:35:18.301 --> 02:35:19.621
<v Speaker 3>justice or I would say not to turn the </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera with who's doing something wrong.</v>

3210
02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:21.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got you there.</v>

3211
02:35:21.671 --> 02:35:26.671
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like fucking hard to stay on the </v>

3212
02:35:26.671 --> 02:35:27.130
<v Speaker 3>right path and not go straight dirty </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harry.</v>

3213
02:35:27.131 --> 02:35:28.750
<v Speaker 3>If some guy's trying to kill you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3214
02:35:28.751 --> 02:35:29.400
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3215
02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:32.560
<v Speaker 3>you're involved in some situation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you see people filming it too.</v>

3216
02:35:33.430 --> 02:35:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to navigate any of the </v>

3217
02:35:38.430 --> 02:35:39.280
<v Speaker 3>shit that cops have to go through on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>daily basis,</v>

3218
02:35:40.570 --> 02:35:41.370
<v Speaker 3>but they also have</v>

3219
02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:46.700
<v Speaker 1>to clean it up a little bit and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do something wrong and we watch it </v>

3220
02:35:49.721 --> 02:35:54.721
<v Speaker 1>on film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't tell us that the cop was </v>

3221
02:35:54.721 --> 02:35:54.721
<v Speaker 1>justified to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3222
02:35:54.721 --> 02:35:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly there was a lot of shit going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>

3223
02:35:56.650 --> 02:35:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was 37 murders in Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 1>last weekend.</v>

3224
02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:04.560
<v Speaker 1>What did that fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody shooting murder or something </v>

3225
02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:06.670
<v Speaker 1>crazy like in those places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A high level.</v>

3226
02:36:06.671 --> 02:36:11.671
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of times I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>cops act a little too much for what the </v>

3227
02:36:12.191 --> 02:36:17.191
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause where I grew up in Jersey were </v>

3228
02:36:17.191 --> 02:36:17.290
<v Speaker 1>cops come in and they talked to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They asked you,</v>

3229
02:36:17.291 --> 02:36:21.880
<v Speaker 1>they separate you and they determine if </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was even worth the fucking angle.</v>

3230
02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:24.880
<v Speaker 1>These guys today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come in,</v>

3231
02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:30.120
<v Speaker 1>even if we do something at the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come into the store and </v>

3232
02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:31.580
<v Speaker 1>investigate them for what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go fucking chase,</v>

3233
02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:33.430
<v Speaker 1>chase bank robber.</v>

3234
02:36:33.730 --> 02:36:38.730
<v Speaker 1>The day after nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pulled into fucking seven slash 11 and</v>

3235
02:36:38.890 --> 02:36:41.260
<v Speaker 1>a guy had pulled over the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3236

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was called pulled over the line.</v>

3237
02:36:43.601 --> 02:36:48.601

<v Speaker 1>The guy next to me and the whole cars I </v>

3238
02:36:48.601 --> 02:36:52.261
<v Speaker 1>pulled in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was six inches over a handicap thing </v>

3239
02:36:52.261 --> 02:36:55.290
<v Speaker 1>on the Blue Line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut and made au turn and came and gave </v>

3240
02:36:55.290 --> 02:36:56.050

<v Speaker 1>I understood I was wrong,</v>

3241
02:36:56.051 --> 02:36:58.000
<v Speaker 1>but when we just blow up the World Trade</v>
<v Speaker 1>Center.</v>

3242
02:36:58.180 --> 02:36:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ain't got nothing better to do.</v>

3243
02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.140
<v Speaker 1>You ain't got nothing better to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3244
02:37:05.141 --> 02:37:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I see fucking Kinky shit all the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>time if I'm not involved with it.</v>

3245

<v Speaker 1>So it's got nothing to do with me</v>

3246
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:15.260
<v Speaker 3>copses there's a statistic number that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to reach,</v>

3247
02:37:15.261 --> 02:37:20.261
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they believed that certain </v>

<v Speaker 3>amount of traffic violations taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>place in la,</v>

3249
02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:25.830

<v Speaker 3>to write a certain amount of tickets,</v>

3250
02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:30.080
<v Speaker 3>whether you'd call it a quota anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think those things are shawn.</v>

3251
02:37:30.090 --> 02:37:31.980
<v Speaker 3>They say they don't have a quota,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have something.</v>

3252
02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:37.790

3253

<v Speaker 3>don't meet the numbers that they expect </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they in some way shape or form.</v>

3471
02:48:24.081 --> 02:48:26.120
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to be accountable for </v>

3477
02:48:41.921 --> 02:48:41.921
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I like about it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She was dead.</v>

3485
02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:04.860
<v Speaker 2>That's why I believe you always got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a shot at something.</v>

3486
02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:09.880

3487
02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:12.921
<v Speaker 2>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big believer in anecdotal </v>

3488
02:49:12.921 --> 02:49:15.741
<v Speaker 2>evidence unless it benefits me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that case I'll go with one to two </v>

<v Speaker 4>And then they go,</v>

3743
03:03:06.281 --> 03:03:07.960
<v Speaker 4>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you owe 50 more.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he's bought over 100 luxury cars from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same dealer and always pays in cash </v>

3748
03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:24.570
<v Speaker 4>is $15 million worth of cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congratulated.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You can sell those.</v>

3751
03:03:27.461 --> 03:03:29.620
<v Speaker 4>They're worth a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can get that money to,</v>

3752
03:03:30.130 --> 03:03:31.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>

3753
03:03:31.740 --> 03:03:33.340

<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3754
03:03:33.370 --> 03:03:37.240
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting in the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>money that he's able to generate,</v>

3755
03:03:37.590 --> 03:03:42.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's figured out some pretty incredible </v>

3756
03:03:42.590 --> 03:03:42.590
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a great villain to man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>credit for what he does as a skilled </v>

3809
03:05:57.170 --> 03:06:02.170

03:06:02.170 --> 03:06:02.600
<v Speaker 2>that there's a dude who can pull it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

3811
03:06:03.100 --> 03:06:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3817
03:06:20.790 --> 03:06:23.441
<v Speaker 2>stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought Gerry Cooney had a chance </v>

3818
03:06:23.441 --> 03:06:23.441
<v Speaker 2>against Larry Holmes when I was in high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

3819
03:06:23.441 --> 03:06:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I saw Gerry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gerry Cooney knockout Ken Norton and was</v>

3820
03:06:25.831 --> 03:06:27.560
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might have a chance.</v>

3821
03:06:27.870 --> 03:06:29.610
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it.</v>

3822
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Who was the other white dude that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the great white hope that I think for </v>

3823
03:06:34.990 --> 03:06:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Larry Holmes and 82 and he wouldn't make</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye contact.</v>

3824
03:06:36.650 --> 03:06:37.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Chavala.</v>

3825
03:06:37.880 --> 03:06:40.220
<v Speaker 2>June of 82 82.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3826
03:06:40.221 --> 03:06:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Gelada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Galana.</v>

3827
03:06:41.890 --> 03:06:44.510
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about and you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3828
03:06:44.780 --> 03:06:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Know Gerry Cooney is the guy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the guy you're thinking of?</v>

3829
03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:50.000
<v Speaker 2>The Guy I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that.</v>

3830
03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3831
03:06:50.631 --> 03:06:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Gerry Cooney.</v>

3832
03:06:52.370 --> 03:06:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy was talking about some </v>

3833
03:06:57.370 --> 03:06:57.370
<v Speaker 2>white dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3834
03:06:57.370 --> 03:06:57.370
<v Speaker 2>When I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was</v>

3835
03:06:57.370 --> 03:06:58.430
<v Speaker 4>who?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's the white dude from Bayonne?</v>

3836
03:06:58.470 --> 03:07:00.800
<v Speaker 4>That fort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3837
03:07:00.810 --> 03:07:03.540
<v Speaker 4>the Bale and bleeder weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3838
03:07:03.541 --> 03:07:08.541
<v Speaker 4>I guess he's the guy that they based the</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie rocky on because they didn't </v>

3839
03:07:08.541 --> 03:07:11.160
<v Speaker 4>expect him to survive and he kept </v>
<v Speaker 4>surviving.</v>

3840
03:07:11.190 --> 03:07:14.670
<v Speaker 4>You kept moving forward and Chuck Wepner</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the guy.</v>

3841
03:07:14.671 --> 03:07:19.671
<v Speaker 4>I think that was one of the inspirations</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the movie rocky because that guy </v>

3842
03:07:19.671 --> 03:07:22.860
<v Speaker 4>just kept plodding forward and Muhammad </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ali beat the shit out of him,</v>

3843
03:07:22.861 --> 03:07:26.520
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think he stopped them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

3844
03:07:26.650 --> 03:07:29.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that crackers face man too.</v>

3845
03:07:29.580 --> 03:07:32.400
<v Speaker 4>He got dropped there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get that man.</v>

3846
03:07:32.910 --> 03:07:36.930
<v Speaker 4>Muhammad Ali in his prime was so magic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3847
03:07:37.410 --> 03:07:42.020
<v Speaker 4>What he could do as far as movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his ability to like move in and out,</v>

3848
03:07:42.060 --> 03:07:47.060
<v Speaker 4>slide around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people thought he was doomed </v>

3849
03:07:47.060 --> 03:07:49.770
<v Speaker 4>when he was gonna Fight Sonny Liston,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there is no fucking way this kid is</v>

3850
03:07:49.771 --> 03:07:51.060
<v Speaker 4>in so much trouble.</v>

3851
03:07:51.420 --> 03:07:54.630
<v Speaker 4>All he could do is like box around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>move and move fast.</v>

3852
03:07:54.631 --> 03:07:58.110
<v Speaker 4>But Sonny Liston is a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>murderous puncher,</v>

3853
03:07:58.410 --> 03:08:01.560
<v Speaker 4>and he got like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he beat the fuck out of Floyd Patterson.</v>

3854
03:08:01.860 --> 03:08:03.540
<v Speaker 4>So like the way he would beat those </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

3855
03:08:03.541 --> 03:08:04.410
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus,</v>

3856

03:09:14.430 --> 03:09:19.430
<v Speaker 4>you've never seen that level of </v>

3881
03:09:19.430 --> 03:09:21.000
<v Speaker 4>dude could dominate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've never seen,</v>

3882
03:09:21.150 --> 03:09:22.440
<v Speaker 4>but there's people I realized they were </v>

<v Speaker 4>It was the craziest thing ever.</v>

3888
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:38.030
<v Speaker 4>The first time I saw Jordan fly from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>foul line through the air and slam dunk </v>

3889
03:09:40.561 --> 03:09:42.180
<v Speaker 4>a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking,</v>

3890
03:09:42.181 --> 03:09:44.400
<v Speaker 4>how.</v>

<v Speaker 4>slam dunked this ball and I'm not </v>

3894
03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:54.130
<v Speaker 4>exaggerating where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically</v>

3895
03:09:54.130 --> 03:09:56.830
<v Speaker 2>where the foul line was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucking went flying to the.</v>

03:09:56.831 --> 03:10:01.831
<v Speaker 2>An extra step job role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bowling favor you put on the top 10 dogs</v>

03:13:42.330 --> 03:13:42.330
<v Speaker 2>because these are spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3971
03:13:42.330 --> 03:13:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Jordan was just another bar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

3972
03:13:43.670 --> 03:13:46.280
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful thing because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet Thompson would go,</v>

3973
03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:52.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching 30 for 30 and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>call Joe Rogan and call them because I </v>

3974
03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:56.201
<v Speaker 2>know he's not that sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the one about Detroit when they </v>

3975
03:13:56.201 --> 03:13:57.300
<v Speaker 2>beat him up really bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3976
03:13:57.320 --> 03:13:59.990
<v Speaker 2>He decided to lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get on that maximum.</v>

3977
03:14:00.790 --> 03:14:05.570
<v Speaker 2>This ain't ever gonna happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the donkey was when he was done,</v>

3978
03:14:05.720 --> 03:14:06.800
<v Speaker 2>but Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3979
03:14:06.801 --> 03:14:09.470
<v Speaker 2>He used to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the way he held his hair because</v>

3980
03:14:09.770 --> 03:14:14.770
<v Speaker 2>he went and got on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really lifted against the Detroit </v>

3981
03:14:14.770 --> 03:14:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Pistons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Joe Rogan has a basketball </v>

3982
03:14:18.610 --> 03:14:21.010
<v Speaker 2>enthusiast and I called Dama wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only one the greatest dunked the</v>

3983
03:14:21.011 --> 03:14:24.830
<v Speaker 2>ball time and because he jumped over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker who did that.</v>

3984
03:14:27.020 --> 03:14:32.020
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm talking to Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Got Mad ally Drexler Against </v>

3985
03:14:32.020 --> 03:14:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Louisville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 81,</v>

3986
03:14:34.010 --> 03:14:34.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3987
03:14:34.450 --> 03:14:39.450
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3988
03:14:41.061 --> 03:14:44.630

<v Speaker 2>that's all they did was dunked.</v>

3989
03:14:44.690 --> 03:14:49.690
<v Speaker 2>There's a few athletes that I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>even from our era you could bring to </v>

3990
03:14:49.851 --> 03:14:51.770
<v Speaker 2>today and there will be super </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

3991
03:14:51.771 --> 03:14:56.771

<v Speaker 2>could take today and they would be super</v>

<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget I was at a ball.</v>

<v Speaker 2>When we were in high school,</v>

4016
03:16:06.180 --> 03:16:09.060
<v Speaker 2>he was in high school for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to us.</v>

4017
03:16:09.090 --> 03:16:14.090
<v Speaker 2>I jumped over that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would show his high school </v>

4018
03:16:14.090 --> 03:16:17.040
<v Speaker 2>highlights on local news like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would cover it like an NBA game.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>through the ear and then slams that.</v>

4024

<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4025
03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:31.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones Jr was like that.</v>

4026
03:16:31.400 --> 03:16:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones Jr in his prime,</v>

4027
03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:36.330
<v Speaker 2>had some athleticism that didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sense.</v>

4028
03:16:36.480 --> 03:16:41.480
<v Speaker 2>He was able to land a lead left Hook </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of a jab or a lot of guys shot </v>

4029
03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:42.810
<v Speaker 2>in a jab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones Jr.</v>

4030
03:16:42.990 --> 03:16:46.230
<v Speaker 2>He like most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead with a lead left hook.</v>

4031
03:16:46.380 --> 03:16:49.410
<v Speaker 2>WHoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus.</v>

4032
03:16:49.830 --> 03:16:54.830
<v Speaker 2>I got to fly around the rim and dunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the arman rim dunk.</v>

4033
03:16:56.701 --> 03:16:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more difficult than the right.</v>

4034
03:16:58.890 --> 03:17:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Think about a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to worry about breaking your </v>

4035
03:17:03.890 --> 03:17:05.790
<v Speaker 2>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thompson had a 48 junk vertical way </v>

4036
03:17:05.790 --> 03:17:05.790
<v Speaker 2>inch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about that.</v>

4037
03:17:05.790 --> 03:17:10.191
<v Speaker 2>That was 30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine the kind of vertical </v>

4038
03:17:10.191 --> 03:17:11.360
<v Speaker 2>jumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>College player.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The oWner is a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good move on his part.</v>

4055
03:17:56.551 --> 03:17:59.950
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't back up from chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

4056
03:17:59.970 --> 03:18:01.350
<v Speaker 2>that's a smart move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4057
03:18:01.380 --> 03:18:03.550
<v Speaker 2>be a part of some sort of a cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength.</v>

4058
03:18:03.570 --> 03:18:07.630
<v Speaker 2>We don't look at that dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a brand hand.</v>

4059
03:18:08.370 --> 03:18:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes are always getting better,</v>

4060
03:18:10.260 --> 03:18:15.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to baseball from the 19 </v>

4061
03:18:15.260 --> 03:18:16.920
<v Speaker 2>fifties and then go to baseball in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems better and better.</v>

4062
03:18:16.921 --> 03:18:21.921
<v Speaker 2>Athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing people that are Just </v>

4063
03:18:21.921 --> 03:18:21.921
<v Speaker 2>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smarter,</v>

4064
03:18:21.921 --> 03:18:21.921
<v Speaker 2>trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better use,</v>

4065
03:18:21.921 --> 03:18:22.530
<v Speaker 2>better nutrition.</v>

4066
03:18:22.600 --> 03:18:24.840
<v Speaker 2>They're optImizing themselves the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>

4067
03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:30.120
<v Speaker 2>The question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder like genetically what's </v>

4068
03:18:30.120 --> 03:18:32.481
<v Speaker 2>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if like people genetically are </v>

4069
03:18:32.481 --> 03:18:35.001
<v Speaker 2>getting bigger and faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it's like a little slight </v>

4070
03:18:35.001 --> 03:18:35.850
<v Speaker 2>uptick that will one day maybe 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>from now,</v>

4071
03:18:35.851 --> 03:18:40.851
<v Speaker 2>30 years now registering in a big way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've got to wonder with all </v>

4072
03:18:40.851 --> 03:18:43.950
<v Speaker 2>these people competing in crossfit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the strength and conditioning stuff,</v>

4073
03:18:43.980 --> 03:18:48.190
<v Speaker 2>people's bodies might start literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking they have to work harder again.</v>

4074
03:18:48.660 --> 03:18:50.110
<v Speaker 2>They have to get stronger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

4075
03:18:50.140 --> 03:18:55.140
<v Speaker 2>people might get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my terrible understanding of </v>

4076
03:18:55.140 --> 03:18:56.980
<v Speaker 2>genetics as applied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sold on it.</v>

4077
03:18:57.270 --> 03:19:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Just on that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public peer reviewed pApers did.</v>

4078
03:19:01.270 --> 03:19:03.590
<v Speaker 2>I've spent the cub dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting,</v>

4079
03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I know the thRee weeks I spit in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cup,</v>

4080
03:19:05.861 --> 03:19:08.560
<v Speaker 2>just hit home related to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

4081
03:19:08.561 --> 03:19:09.620
<v Speaker 2>The mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Com,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I get pumped up listening to this night.</v>

03:21:03.730 --> 03:21:08.730
<v Speaker 2>you sent me a video you were looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were listening to something else </v>

<v Speaker 2>like italian music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always do that.</v>

4120
03:21:08.730 --> 03:21:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always listened to language that I </v>

4121
03:21:13.380 --> 03:21:13.540
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't think about the words?</v>

4122
03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about the words at all.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

4125
03:21:19.660 --> 03:21:21.820

4126
03:21:21.940 --> 03:21:26.940
<v Speaker 2>So freedom is that I can hear the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful sound of his voice and not </v>

4129
03:21:33.871 --> 03:21:36.900
<v Speaker 2>and I can have it in the background and </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent concentrated on what I'm </v>

4130
03:21:36.900 --> 03:21:39.280

4310
03:29:59.220 --> 03:30:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't put you in jail.</v>

4311
03:30:00.900 --> 03:30:04.020
<v Speaker 1>That's sexual assault just to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impersonation.</v>

4312
03:30:04.050 --> 03:30:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure didn't jim morris and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in trouble for that?</v>

4313
03:30:06.660 --> 03:30:10.640
<v Speaker 1>He pulled his dick out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pulled his dick out of my la.</v>

4314

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

4315
03:30:11.770 --> 03:30:14.070

<v Speaker 1>Famous concert.</v>

4316
03:30:14.520 --> 03:30:17.190
<v Speaker 1>But I thought that during mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mojo rising,</v>

4317
03:30:17.640 --> 03:30:20.150
<v Speaker 1>he would make believe he was whacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>off when he got arrested.</v>

4318
03:30:20.170 --> 03:30:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4319
03:30:20.850 --> 03:30:25.850
<v Speaker 1>our boy who got arrested,</v>

<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he ever pulled his dick </v>

4324
03:30:37.101 --> 03:30:37.101
