00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.650
Hello Ladies and gentlemen.
Anytime you use that word,

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.210
anytime you say,
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:11.910
you're either joking around or you're being a big phony,
right?

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.450
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
trying to be nice.
Uh,

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.210
this episode of the podcast is brought to you by ting.

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.350
Ting is a mobile service company,
a mobile cell phone company.

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.850
How would you say that it's not mobile anymore?

8
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.850
Remember I used to call them these,
call them car phones.
Remember those days?

9
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.110
Steve Maxwell,
you remember this?
I remember that they were caught.

10
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:33.720
I just got a car phone.
Look,
he's got a car phone in his pocket.
This guy's crazy.

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.290
That was Greg is your arm man.
They used to be car phones.

12
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.150
They were car phones before their mobile phones.

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.380
Ting has it set up so that you pay for what you use.

14
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.610
What they do is they take the ting buys time on the sprint backbone,

15
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:51.210
so you get the exact same service you'd get with a major carrier like sprint,

16
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.420
but they do it their own way with their own rates and their own deal.

17
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.170
And their deal is they don't have any like,
oh you,

18
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:02.340
you get a hundred minutes a month or 200 minutes a month.

19
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.420
You just pay for what you use.
And in that method,
you'd be surprised.

20
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.660
98% of people would save money with tank.

21
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.750
They have no early termination fees and no contracts.

22
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.200
So they cut all that nonsense out and I honestly think that that's going to be

23
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:16.950
the future.

24
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.950
I think that all that stuff about contracts and it's a scam and they rope you in

25
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.390
and they rope you in and they get you in debt.

26
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.320
Like when you buy a phone from a normal carrier.
So if you buy an iPhone and you,

27
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.230
you know,
you sign up for a two year contract and buy an iPhone,

28
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.300
you're not really buying that phone.

29
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.120
You're buying a piece of that phone and then the rest of it,

30
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:40.020
you're paying off over a long period of time.
That's why when you want to leave,

31
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.800
they hit you with this big cancellation fee.
Ting says,
you know what?

32
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.340
Fuck all that.
Let's just cancel all that nonsense.
Let's stop doing that.

33
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:49.800
Sell people the phones for what the phones worth,

34
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.340
sell it to them at a reasonable rate and give them very reasonable rates for

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.540
their service itself.

36
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.640
98% of people would save money with tank.
That's pretty crazy.

37
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.670
$21 the average monthly bill per term per device for 10 customers.

38
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.600
I know almost everybody pays more than 21 bucks a month for cell phone coverage.

39
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.870
And again,
you're using the best android phones available.

40
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:17.730
You can also bring over iPhones from sprint and they have excellent service,

41
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.840
excellent phones to these.
Android phones are fantastic.
They have the ht one,

42
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.720
HTC one,
they have the LG phones,

43
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.980
they have the Samsung Galaxy note three,
which is the one that I have.

44
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.980
They have the the galaxy s five all these killer phones and a killer rate and he

45
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.160
can't go wrong with it.

46
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.110
And if you use rogan.ting.com that is the website.
Go there.

47
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.710
You will save $25 off your first device from Tang.

48
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.890
So that's rogan.ting.com go there and save money and,

49
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.780
and be a part of an ethical company.

50
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:54.270
And that's one of the things that I really appreciate about Ting.

51
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.500
They'd done all this on their own.
They also at their two year anniversary,

52
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.210
they slash their rates and they did it without,
I mean they,

53
00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:04.960
they didn't have any motivation to do it other than,
you know what,

54
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.450
we can do this,
we can offer people a great deal,

55
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.100
give them a cheaper deal and a great deal for people that are power users.

56
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.300
If you're one of those freaks,

57
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.340
it's constantly downloading things and downloading apps and mp3s and alike.

58
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.250
You can save a shit load of money on tank.
And uh,
the,

59
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.260
the phone that we use now for the podcast is a,
a tank phone.
So,
uh,

60
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:28.630
the,
the actual office phone is a tank phone.

61
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.490
So there Papao rogan.ting.com we're also brought to you by on it.

62
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.210
That's o n n I t,
a human optimization website.

63
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.330
We have a new color battle rope in the commercial.
Look at that.

64
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:44.230
It's very exciting,
Jamie.
Now it's red and black.
It's fine.

65
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.590
It looks like it's business like you're serious.
That's the,

66
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.680
the 50 foot 2.5 inch battle rope.
Um,

67
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.050
we sell strength and conditioning equipment.
We also sell the,

68
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.620
it's essentially by calling yourself a human optimization website.

69
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.070
We didn't even really have another name for it.
Like what is on itself?
Well,

70
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:05.320
we sell a bunch of cool shit.

71
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.270
What we sell is all stuff that I use as far as fitness equipment.

72
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.550
We sell things like weight vest,
ab wheels,
kettlebells,

73
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.140
steel maces steel clubs,
we sell medicine balls,
jump ropes,
we saw,

74
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.200
so basically all the tools that you would use to develop functional strength.

75
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.370
And then on top of that,
we sell really healthy foods like the new warrior bar,

76
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.180
which is a,
uh,
a buffalo bar,
organic buffalo meat.

77
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.870
It's all organic.
It's all with,
uh,
with,
uh,

78
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.280
no preservatives.
It doesn't have any artificial flavors,

79
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:40.810
it doesn't have any artificial colors.

80
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.400
And we had the made by the same company that makes those a tonka bars.

81
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.600
So what they're done is they're done in this ancient Lakota tradition of

82
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.580
preserving buffalo meat with cranberries,
no antibiotics,
no added hormones,

83
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.370
no nitrates.
You really,
it's really a guilt free.

84
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:02.110
And it's also got 14 grams of protein and 140 calories and uh,

85
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.090
only four grams of fat.
Really healthy for you.
No MSG,
no soy,
no nothing.
And uh,

86
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:10.240
it's one of the things that we started carrying exclusively at on it.

87
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:13.420
They're actually made for on it.
And we tried to do that as often as possible.

88
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:17.110
Things like the hemp forest protein bars,
we have the main,
uh,

89
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:19.450
we use the finest hamp that we can get from Canada,

90
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.320
which a big lawsuit right now in Kentucky and Kentucky.
They,
uh,

91
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:28.060
they're suing the federal government suing the DEA because the DEA confiscated

92
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:32.740
hemp seeds.
Non-Psychoactive hemp seeds.
Why did they confiscate them?

93
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.540
Because they're in cahoots,
ladies and gentlemen,
Coats with other businesses.

94
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.050
It has nothing to do with protecting the children from hemp hemp.

95
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:44.050
It's good for you.
Hams healthy.
It's an excellent source of protein.

96
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.760
It's also completely free of THC.
A lot of people worry,
hey,

97
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:52.300
if I take your hand for us,
I,
you know,
I work at ups and they test me.

98
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.890
You're not going to test positive.
You will not.
There's zero THC in hemp.

99
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.670
All it is is a super healthy plant that gets demonized because a bunch of old

100
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:05.750
people are scared of marijuana or people are making money off the fact that

101
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:06.740
marijuana is illegal.

102
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.770
That's more more likely the case than not in 2014 but times they are changing.

103
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.010
Anyway,

121
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.770
<v 1>Hey Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

122
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.690
Steve Maxwell,

123
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.260
<v 0>my friend.
Good to see you man.
Last time.
If you see ladies and gentlemen,</v>

124
00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:30.310
I'm sitting here and a chair with no back note.
My perfect posture.

125
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.700
I just received this,
uh,
this,
what do they call these things?

126
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.070
Ergonomic besides gay.

127
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:40.000
Don't say gay because a lot of people would call it a chair.
The essays,

128
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:43.160
the position that the Samurai position.
Yeah.

129
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.450
It was just supposed to like promote good posture because I always find myself

130
00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:50.320
leaning in these chairs,
like cracking and trying to find a,
so this is a,

131
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.280
it makes you actively keep your back in a straight line.
Right?

132
00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:56.560
Is that the idea behind this?
The idea that you know,

133
00:07:56.561 --> 00:07:59.920
the chair is like the new cigarettes these days.
Yes.
That's what they say.

134
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:02.260
Sitting is the new smoking.
Then the new smoking.

135
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.160
So many people when they stating if you have like bad posture and you're sitting

136
00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:10.570
your chair,
you really are putting tremendous stress on just a few of the,
the,

137
00:08:10.571 --> 00:08:12.550
the,
the uh,
parts of your spine,

138
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:16.300
like a few of the discs and those discs oftentimes can rupture.

139
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.270
They say that people get herniated disc from wearing a wallet.

140
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.070
If you have a wallet in your pocket,

141
00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:24.400
like say if you're a cab driver or something and you sit down all the time on a

142
00:08:24.401 --> 00:08:27.850
wallet,
like you can get a herniated disc from that.
Well,
I was think of that.

143
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:30.550
I don't even pressure.
Imagine your hip like totally.

144
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:34.270
I imagine that like wearing a shoe right with one heel higher than the other,

145
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.760
right.
Well sort of the same,

146
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.820
same idea where you're sitting with one part of your hip above the other for

147
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.170
years and of course it's going to,
you know,

148
00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:48.370
the stress of just being so imbalanced,
it's going to take its toll on your body.

149
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.670
It's interesting because most folks would never think that that could be

150
00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:56.130
possible.
You would,
you would just think,
well,
it's not hurting.
Your body's fine.

151
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:59.040
Like it's not going to get injured,
but your body's kind of like,

152
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.890
it's all pliable and stuff.

153
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.570
Like someone tried to explain to me that everyone has like sort of a boundary on

154
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:11.160
how flexible they can be.
And I was listening to this guy talk about this.
Well,

155
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:13.920
you know,
so he was kind of like dismissing some plug,
you know,
cause I was,

156
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:17.160
I'm flexible.
It was like some folks just aren't that flexible,
you know,

157
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.740
you just happened to be naturally flexible.
I'm like,
man,

158
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:22.770
I don't know about all that.
I really don't think I'm naturally flexible.

159
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:26.130
I just went through a lot of pain.
Like I forced myself to,

160
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.910
to stretch in really painful positions for,
you know,

161
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.690
30 seconds at a time,
rest for a minute,
30 seconds at a time.
Britain,

162
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.300
when I'm down there for those 30 seconds,
that's hard to breathe.
You're,

163
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:43.110
you're experiencing pain.
It's that fucking,

164
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.940
a lot of people just aren't willing to do that,
you know?
But that's just a,

165
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:51.480
another,
uh,
just another example of how the body's kind of pliable.

166
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.140
<v 2>It's pretty pliable.
I mean,
you couldn't have like a lot of these,
uh,</v>

167
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.650
body real alignment techniques that worked so well like after released tech
Dick.

168
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.610
Uh,
I'm most familiar with rolfing.
Have you ever heard of this?
Yeah,

169
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.520
we talked about last time were here.
I mean that it saved me,

170
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.090
I can't tell you that horrific injuries that rolfing helped me get over,
uh,

171
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.050
you know,
from both wrestling,
Jiu Jitsu and so forth.
So if the,
if the,

172
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.240
the body is very malleable,
very,
very pliable and it can be,

173
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.590
can be moved if a person knows if the practitioner knows how to do it.

174
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.780
<v 0>Yeah.
I went to a rolfing at the suggestion,</v>

175
00:10:25.781 --> 00:10:29.500
one of the guys from my Jujitsu class who had a bulging disc and dealt with it

176
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.780
with rolfing and uh,
he went to this guy,
but

177
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.690
<v 2>the guy was really wacky or they can be a little strange.</v>

178
00:10:35.691 --> 00:10:39.170
Some of these bodywork types,
you know,
this guy was very wacky.

179
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.710
He also believed that Bruce Lee could kill people with one punch.
And he was,

180
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.170
he kept telling me this,
that,
you know,
you know,

181
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.770
proof you could kill people with just one punch.
He just,

182
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.380
especially if it was a three year old kid or yeah,
it was like fucking,
you know,

183
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.000
a baby or something,
you could probably kill them

184
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.740
<v 0>one punch.
Like the people have died with one punch,</v>

185
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.940
but it's not normal.
You know,
when a guy kills the guy with one punch,

186
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:05.070
like this idea that he's got like a gun in his hand,

187
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.810
I need you to just shoot people.
So this guy was [inaudible],
it was a little

188
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.400
<v 2>wacky and he had some,
uh,
very interesting ideas about what he was doing.</v>

189
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.870
He would push down your ribs and think it would release your neck.

190
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:20.690
And I wasn't exactly sure if there was a lot of logic to that,
Joe.

191
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.730
You know,
cause if the way the connected tissue spirals through the body,

192
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.390
how does that work?
Like it?
Well,
there's a,
have you ever seen,

193
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:30.320
what do they call that?
The uh,
the plasticized man that uh,

194
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.930
that exhibit where the body works,
the body works amazing.

195
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.220
You ever see the fashion part of that and how the guy ever figured out the

196
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:42.570
chemicals to use does dissolve away all other tissues and leave.

197
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:47.310
The one in tech that he wanted is just mindblowing.
But anyway,
it's just like a,

198
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.820
it looks like DNA strands all spiraled up.
So really,

199
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:53.800
truly your ankle bone is connected to your neck and

200
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.770
<v 3>one part of your body is out of alignment.
Right?
Or,
or you know,</v>

201
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.830
a stressor in mobilized.
It can cause some problems in other areas of the body.

202
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.920
Well this guy would like push down on your ribs with his elbows,

203
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.240
like to loosen up things in your back.
Unbelievably painful.

204
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:12.410
Just digging your world,
you know,
his,

205
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.710
his elbow into your ribs and moving things around.

206
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.570
And then you'd have you stand up and he'd look at,

207
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.870
you see if you're leaning to the laughter and leaning to the right and where

208
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:22.150
your posture is.
I don't know about all that,

209
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.960
but when he got down to business on your back and would,
you know,
break it,

210
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:29.050
would you want to tap out?
I mean,
it's really bad.
It,
it's pretty,

211
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:30.880
it was pretty bad.
But boy,

212
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:35.350
when you leave it's like everything is just kinda moving better and you feel

213
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:39.250
taller.
Yeah.
Well you feel,
I didn't ever feel tall.
I'm short.
So are you pal?

214
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.710
But I'm pretty sure.
But I definitely felt looser.

215
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.560
I felt like more relieved and I,

216
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:51.190
I think that there's a lot of folks that go out there and they,
you know,

217
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:54.310
they hit the gym,
they lift weights,
they'll do Jujitsu,

218
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.300
do all these different things,
but they never get massaged.
And uh,

219
00:12:57.301 --> 00:13:00.040
I think they're doing themselves a huge disservice.
You know,
I've,
I've,

220
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.370
I've said that to many,
many a Jujitsu guys.

221
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:07.520
Like if you can just at least once a week,
just go,

222
00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:10.990
go to one of those time massages and have one of those people work on you.

223
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:14.650
Or if you can go to a real good sports medicine place and have someone do some

224
00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:17.530
deep tissue on you,
it makes a world of difference.
Well,
I mean,

225
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:19.450
think about the nature of the sport,
right?

226
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.960
You're basically trying to hurt each other as much as possible.
Yeah.

227
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:26.220
You're trying to deflect as much pain and or choke to got asleep.
Yeah.

228
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.520
So I mean for sure it takes a toll on the body and you have to do these things

229
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:34.000
in order to keep yourself in alignment because there's just no way you can do a

230
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.730
heavy combat sports like that without suffering.

231
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.510
So you're going to definitely get knocked out of alignment.
Uh,

232
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.750
have things move that shouldn't be moved and you need someone to kind of put

233
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:47.320
them back in place.
And a lot of times you can't do it on your own.
Yeah.

234
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:52.000
I mean the foam rolling and a lot of times mobility exercises work pretty good

235
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:54.250
for that,
uh,
uh,
self treatment.

236
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.580
But usually after a couple of days and that stuff isn't working,

237
00:13:57.581 --> 00:13:58.420
that's when you know,

238
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:02.770
it's time to get a therapist to actually put stuff back and place.
Boy,

239
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.480
do you ever,
uh,
work with,
um,
lacrosse balls?
Do you ever do any of that?
I have.

240
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.290
Yeah.
It's great.

241
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.410
Lie on your back and then put the Lacrosse ball under your back and roll,

242
00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:14.020
like bridge on the Lacrosse Ball.
Oh,
sure.

243
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.860
And also there's ways you can put the ball against the wall and like we're all

244
00:14:17.861 --> 00:14:22.090
into your shoulders and your packs so forth and really release a lot of stuff.

245
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.050
But sometimes that just doesn't work and that's when you know,

246
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:29.020
it's time to get to the,
uh,
to the therapist.
Yeah.

247
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:33.970
It's one of the things that I'm finding out through this last year because this

248
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.670
last year has been the year of this back injury that I had,

249
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:38.700
which is way better now.
I mean now I'm,

250
00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:42.400
I'm lifting heavy kettlebells and doing all this different things.
No problem,

251
00:14:42.401 --> 00:14:45.060
no pain during the day.
And um,
you know,

252
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.840
we've been doing this for like 10 minutes,
this new chair.

253
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:49.840
But I think this might help me too.
But the,
um,

254
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.250
what I'm learning is how many people

255
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.090
<v 0>get injured and then don't take care of it.
They just keep working.</v>

256
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.570
They keep training that she could try to work around it and it winds up getting

257
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:02.750
really bad or I ignore it.
Yeah.
And crazy isn't it?

258
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.680
It is very crazy cause I'm running into a series of these guys once I started

259
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:07.610
opening up about this,

260
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:11.030
whether it's from the underground guys that I know on Twitter or guys that I

261
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:15.380
know from Jujitsu class who now have atrophy.
And um,

262
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.830
according to the doctor that,
uh,
administers that Regena keen,

263
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:21.680
that blood spinning procedure that I had done to reduce inflammation.

264
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.910
He says once you have atrophy,
like that's really bad.
He's like the,

265
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:28.370
a lot of people think they're going to have atrophy and they got to put it off

266
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:32.060
and put it off.
It's like if you have that for more than like,
you know,

267
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:36.530
x amount of months,
a lot of times those nerves never get fully,

268
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.450
never return 100%.

269
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.830
He said that there's surgery that they have to do to open up the pathways to

270
00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:46.760
alleviate the pressure on those nerves.
And if that doesn't happen,

271
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.530
if you don't do that,
like you,

272
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.550
you run the chance of having permanent atrophy of your muscles and have

273
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.870
permanent loss of function of a,
of your limbs.

274
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.250
<v 4>Well blows my mind how people just don't pay attention to their body.</v>

275
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.060
Like pain is a signal that something's wrong myself,
that's definitely wrong.

276
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.440
And to ignore it and just keep pushing and driving through.
And of course,

277
00:16:08.441 --> 00:16:12.450
you know,
uh,
MMA guys,
Jujitsu guys,
wrestlers,

278
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.000
a grid,
iron football,
rugby guys,
they're pretty tough guys.

279
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:21.390
And a lot of times they just are very stoic and love doing what they do and just

280
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:26.380
don't want to stop and we'll just continue to drive themselves,
you know,

281
00:16:26.381 --> 00:16:28.750
long after they should instead of just taking care of it.

282
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.450
<v 0>Yeah.
And you got to know when a tap out,
you also got to know that if you don't,</v>

283
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.400
there's guys that like let themselves get injured,
you know,
they'd allow,

284
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.770
I'm not topping,
you know,
if you tap you,

285
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.980
you learn the same mistake than not tapping.
Okay.

286
00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:47.490
The mistake is the guy yourself into a bad position.
Something went wrong,

287
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.810
you got your arm caught,

288
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.470
you either didn't respect the person or the person was better than you and they

289
00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:55.710
set you up and they got you and they go and they got you.
And that's it.

290
00:16:55.711 --> 00:16:59.640
You've got got and there's a certain point where you have to realize you got God

291
00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:03.860
and you've got to tap.
Cause if you don't tap and you get your elbow snapped a,

292
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.240
it might not ever be the same again and B,

293
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.100
you're going to be out for a long time.

294
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.370
<v 4>Well it's one thing if you're in the world championships,
right?
Yeah.</v>

295
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.310
And you know,
you're a black belt and you're,
you know,
you're a fighter.

296
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.300
That's what you do.
Or you're in an MMA event,
you know,
on,
you know,

297
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.000
like John Jones versus via.
Exactly.
Okay.

298
00:17:22.001 --> 00:17:24.670
So you might raise risk getting your elbows snap,

299
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.450
but for the average guy in the gym,
or even just like a local tournament,

300
00:17:28.451 --> 00:17:33.320
come on man,
once you're actually caught the,

301
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.040
the techniques already there,
you already made the mistake.

302
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.470
So acknowledge the mistake tap app and forget about it.
Just like,
you know,

303
00:17:41.471 --> 00:17:44.740
it'd be,
it'd be like being thrown out into softball game or whatever.
Right?

304
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.110
But guys,
they put too much emphasis on,
uh,

305
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:50.490
never getting caught or I can't get caught or whatever.

306
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.980
But to get out of whatever hold you've been caught in it just zoos strength.

307
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.260
It's,
it has nothing to do with technique,
you know,
I mean a good guy,

308
00:17:58.261 --> 00:17:59.250
if he gets here,
you're God.

309
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.330
<v 0>It's an interesting thing isn't it?
It's like people don't,</v>

310
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.630
I mean they don't like getting thrown out and softball.

311
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.270
Nobody likes when you hit a fly ball and someone catches it.

312
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.410
But if it's a softball game and everybody's drinking beers and you know,

313
00:18:12.411 --> 00:18:14.180
having Burgers,
it's no big deal.

314
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.290
But if you're on the mat and you're doing jujitsu and someone catches you with

315
00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:19.160
something,
it's,

316
00:18:19.161 --> 00:18:24.161
there's so much pride and machismo involved in that position and that situation.

317
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.700
And if you can get out of it,
you know?
Yeah,
you didn't get me,
you know,

318
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.290
even though your arms all fucked up,

319
00:18:30.291 --> 00:18:33.920
like I have not tapped the things before and got out of it and been okay.

320
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.950
But then my arm is fucked up for months.
You know,

321
00:18:36.951 --> 00:18:41.951
like I had a bad elbow for probably three months because one guard pass I'm

322
00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:43.580
passing and you know,
sometimes he passed.

323
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:47.570
You leave your arm out a little bit to try to bait the guy to go for a Komora so

324
00:18:47.571 --> 00:18:50.850
you could try to get over the knees and as I'm passing and he locked in the car,

325
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:53.780
I'm like,
Oh shit.
Like this is tight,
God dammit.

326
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.670
And I'm trying to figure out do I tap here or do I keep going,
pop,
pop,
you know,

327
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.440
powered out of it.
But then I couldn't do chin up.

328
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.070
<v 4>Then you suffer for four months,
for months,
for months.
It's like,
you know,</v>

329
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.230
it's like one of those deals where you,

330
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.880
you feel the pain maybe like just a little bit.

331
00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.570
But the problem with something like Jujitsu or even wrestling,

332
00:19:16.571 --> 00:19:20.560
sometimes it goes from zero to a hundred and like just a brief blink like heel

333
00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:24.800
hooks.
And then by that point it's already too late.
So you know the risks,

334
00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.830
the risk to benefit ratio,
you know,
the,
the,
the,
the idea of,
oh,

335
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:33.831
I got out of it versus not being able to train for weeks or even months just

336
00:19:34.181 --> 00:19:37.870
never makes it worth it.
And that's one of the big differences as you get older.

337
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:42.420
You know,
a guy my age in the sixties no way man.
Tap early,
tap often,

338
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.030
rarely smart.
That's,

339
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:50.140
that's the key to doing Jujitsu for a lifetime.
You just learned,

340
00:19:50.141 --> 00:19:54.850
hey man,
you got me great job.
I don't care if it's a white belt,
whatever.

341
00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:59.710
You got it.
Okay,
I made a mistake.
Yeah.
Oh,
keep playing man.

342
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.050
<v 0>If you teach them the technique correctly and they get in the right position and</v>

343
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.130
you know your arm is deepen their crotch and they got your thumb up and they're

344
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:11.610
pulling on it,
that's,
they'd got it.
They got it.
You know?
I mean,

345
00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:13.950
they might not be able to hang onto it because they're not familiar with the

346
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:16.980
position.
You know,
like if you watch like Rhonda Rousey,

347
00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:21.750
she's the best example I think of someone who knows how to hold an arm bar,

348
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:24.470
not just keep an arm bar,
not just catching armbar,

349
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.140
but hold it through all of the transitions.
Like,

350
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:31.320
people can flip over,
they can kick their legs over,

351
00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:35.730
they can try to roll and she just keeps it and she keeps adjusting and she keeps

352
00:20:35.731 --> 00:20:37.890
rolling with it.
She's the best at that.

353
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.040
And that's kind of the difference between like a real legit blackbelt like

354
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:43.480
Rhonda and someone who's never done it before.

355
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.740
And maybe just learning the technique and maybe you could kind of get out

356
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.070
because if you just turn your arm a little bit and now you know your elbows up

357
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:54.700
instead of down and there's no pressure on it,
you can kind of,
if you're good,

358
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:57.850
you can kind of get out of the position.
That sort of is the difference between,

359
00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:58.450
you know,

360
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.780
maybe someone like maybe the difference between a purple belt and a black belt.

361
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.090
The difference,
you know,
white belt in a purple belt,
you know,

362
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:06.310
this is like the ability to hang on longer,

363
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:10.300
the ability to adjust because one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu is

364
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:16.030
Jujitsu is like the exact opposite of something that is easy and predictable.

365
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.380
And,
uh,
like a,
like a nautilus machine,
you know,

366
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:23.560
like a nautilus machine is like,
you pushed that thing forward.

367
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:26.080
It's going to go on the same track every time.

368
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.480
But when you're grappling with a person,

369
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.930
even if you know how to execute the technique with,
you know,

370
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:33.310
the perfect leverage and all that,

371
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.050
people are moving and resisting and it's a little bit different every time and

372
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:40.060
their foot's in a little different position every time.

373
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:43.330
And their arms are a little bit different.
And it's,
it's,

374
00:21:43.331 --> 00:21:46.570
it's so interesting in that sense where you're constantly adjusting.

375
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.030
<v 4>It's like a fingerprint or a snowflake.
Every time you do it,</v>

376
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.950
it's just a little bit different.

377
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.010
Tell you a funny story as some of your listeners know,

378
00:21:55.011 --> 00:21:59.120
I had the first Jujitsu Academy and the eastern seaboard and these coasts and,

379
00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:02.920
um,
exercise mattresses.
And,
um,
at one point,
um,

380
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.940
we had a guy by the name of Jeff,
Tom Watson,

381
00:22:04.941 --> 00:22:07.460
who was a Philadelphia Eagle football player.

382
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.360
This guy was probably about six foot five to 75 at the time,

383
00:22:11.361 --> 00:22:16.010
if I remember correctly.
Unbelievably strong and lean and slim.

384
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.590
He was the darling of,
uh,
the super bowl the year that the,

385
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.410
the eagles went to the Superbowl in Jacksonville.
He was called up.

386
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.330
He had actually been released from the team,

387
00:22:26.331 --> 00:22:28.910
but they had a couple injuries and they called him in and went in there and

388
00:22:28.911 --> 00:22:31.780
caught a couple of touchdown passes.
Wow.
So,
uh,
he,
he's,

389
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:36.260
he comes to my Jujitsu class and it's like,
Whoa,
wait a minute.

390
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.640
Jujitsu was designed to protect us for guys like you,
man.
You know,

391
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.110
what do you do with a guy?
I mean,
just ungodly strong.

392
00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.030
He came to my kettlebell class.

393
00:22:44.031 --> 00:22:47.780
It's the first time I ever had to break out like a 48 kilogram kettlebell just

394
00:22:47.781 --> 00:22:50.330
to teach this guy swings.
Whereas he was based kilogram.

395
00:22:50.331 --> 00:22:53.180
What is that about a hundred pounds?
That's a hundred.
I mean,

396
00:22:53.181 --> 00:22:55.330
he was just like doing front up process with,
you know,

397
00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.880
front front raises with his shoulders.
He was just so ridiculously strong.

398
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.030
So he gets a on with one of my brown butter,

399
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.120
the time it fell by the name of Ron [inaudible] who lives in Hawaii.

400
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.250
He teaches in the why now.
But at that time,
Ronnie was a,
uh,

401
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.790
Brown bout and Ron gets them of course,
you know,

402
00:23:10.791 --> 00:23:15.330
and in our block right from the mount and the guy literally does a Turkish getup

403
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.040
with Ronnie,
Bev's him up.
How much does Ronnie way?

404
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.220
Probably about 148 pounds at the time and 50.
And the,
you know,

405
00:23:22.221 --> 00:23:24.300
this guy's like to said he literally does a,

406
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.930
Turkey's got up and was putting Ron's head through the ceiling.

407
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.030
I remember screaming cause I,
you know,

408
00:23:29.031 --> 00:23:32.090
this guy was like really an important part of our team.
Don't hurt,

409
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.410
don't break Rodney,
don't break rati put him down,
put him down.
It was insane.

410
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.370
It's just insane.
Just how strong some people can be,

411
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.280
<v 0>especially people that are like real super athletes,
like football players,</v>

412
00:23:44.281 --> 00:23:49.281
guys that had been slamming into other 300 pound men for years and hitting sleds

413
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:52.870
and doing power cleans and just fist all sorts potty.

414
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.630
So designed to just pick up and move heavy things.

415
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.420
And then the average person,
like I remember,
um,

416
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.750
I was at a in Phoenix one night and I don't know who this guy was,

417
00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:05.840
who some pro athlete have no idea who he was,
but he was,
um,

418
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.850
at this gym that I was working out at.
And um,

419
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.080
it was like we were all like little children,

420
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.160
like little children wandering around the gym and this giant showed up.

421
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.960
It wasn't even like a giant amongst men.
I mean,
he was so big.
I mean,

422
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:24.440
I dunno,
he was some pro football player,
but he was,
he,
it was so big,

423
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:27.860
I felt like a tiny child.
Like not like,

424
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.930
well that's a big man and I'm a small man.

425
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:34.010
Like I'm wasn't even the same species of this guy.
He's probably like six,
seven,

426
00:24:34.011 --> 00:24:38.540
six,
eight,
somewhere around then 370 pounds ish.

427
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:42.950
Just enormous man.
And you,
you see a person like that and you'd go,

428
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.780
all the self defense stuff is

429
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.250
<v 4>the window strength and size does matter.
It's that big.</v>

430
00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:55.660
The first time I realized this,
there was a guy that,
uh,

431
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.350
I worked with the first night.
It was Jim and uh,
uh,
the Philadelphia,

432
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.870
it's actually the first one in Pennsylvania and there was a god,

433
00:25:03.871 --> 00:25:06.270
but I think his name is Ron.
She were Rick Chandler.

434
00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:07.920
He played center for the New York jets.

435
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.450
It's the first time I was exposed to an NFL football player and I had just no

436
00:25:12.451 --> 00:25:16.320
idea how unbelievably fast and strong and powerful these guys are.

437
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.410
And of course I was wrestling for the college wrestling team.

438
00:25:19.411 --> 00:25:22.350
It thought it was pretty bad ass and I probably weighed,

439
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.960
I was a lot of heavier back then,
maybe about one 77.

440
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.510
And we get to mess around.

441
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.980
And this guy literally just grabbed me by the ankle and pick me upside down.

442
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.353
I'm not kidding,

443
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:38.870
I just hold him at arm's length like I was a child and it was just,

444
00:25:38.911 --> 00:25:43.770
whoa.
I just never felt that power and strength,
you know,
my life.

445
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.320
And I mean that's,
you know,
let's,
let's face it,

446
00:25:46.321 --> 00:25:49.320
that's pretty much the elite of the elite,
right?
As far as power athletes go,

447
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.960
we all go to the NFL and there where they can make some money.

448
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.240
<v 0>The only other thing I would think of would be like those guys that do those</v>

449
00:25:55.241 --> 00:25:56.560
strong man competitions.

450
00:25:56.561 --> 00:25:59.610
Those guys are pretty ridiculous but pretty crazy strong.

451
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.860
If you notice that there's that one guy,
it's not magnus.

452
00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:07.690
What is the guy's name that's been fighting and MMA?
God,
what is his name?

453
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.870
Oh,
the chairman.
No,
he's polling

454
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.390
<v 4>Sanford.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
I know exactly what you're talking about.
Damn it.</v>

455
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.390
That was the rationale.
Ski Boots in the House.

456
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.320
<v 0>Yeah.
Whew.
Whew.
Guy.</v>

457
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.830
But not doing so well in MMA.
You know,
he got,

458
00:26:23.831 --> 00:26:26.320
he got manhandled by Tim Sylvia.
It was,

459
00:26:26.321 --> 00:26:30.250
it was just a fascinating fight cause Tim Silvia obviously very skilled guy.

460
00:26:30.251 --> 00:26:32.350
I don't know why put Yanoski took that fight.

461
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:37.010
A lot of people in the Tim Silvia hasn't sort of an awkward uh,

462
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.860
build.
He's a,
he's kind of pigeon toed.
He's enormous guy.
You know,

463
00:26:41.861 --> 00:26:43.980
Tim is,
I think he's like seven or something like

464
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.840
<v 3>that.
Tim's a very big guy,
but he's also got a lot of extra body fat on him.</v>

465
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.850
And uh,
he could pull the video up.
This is a video of them fighting and you know,

466
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.780
put your mouse key.
Just,
it was just so outclassed.
It was like,

467
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.020
who let you fight a former MMA champion,

468
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.060
a former UFC champion?

469
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.610
<v 4>Well,
you know,
a lot of the times these guys,
they,
they,</v>

470
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:08.520
they have a lot of confidence and he,
you know,

471
00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:11.520
he is a real master at his particular sport,

472
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.540
but that's where they make their mistake thinking that somehow that that mastery

473
00:27:15.541 --> 00:27:19.800
in one thing is going to make them better and something else.
And okay,

474
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.100
if I were to fight that guy,
it would be a nightmare for me.
Right.

475
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.450
But when you get against somebody your own size and you're,
uh,
you know,
your,

476
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:30.440
your,
your own weight,
everything changes for these guys.

477
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.160
<v 3>Look at him.
And that's,
by the way,
he's lost a lot of weight.</v>

478
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.780
He used to be way bigger when he was just doing strong man stuff because when

479
00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:42.660
he's just doing strongman stuff,
he was just all muscle.

480
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.200
But Tim's a big fucking guy too and Tim is really long and Tim just beat his ass

481
00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:51.390
man.
Plus he has the requisite skills,
you know,

482
00:27:51.391 --> 00:27:56.391
I mean the skill set is everything in a martial art or a combat sport like that.

483
00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:02.070
Yeah,
skill will so often overcome just Robert Straight and raw power.

484
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.880
No,
100% keep playing it.
It's a,
it's,

485
00:28:03.881 --> 00:28:06.070
it's interesting to watch because it puts you,

486
00:28:06.071 --> 00:28:08.670
Nowicki is like so physically strong,

487
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:12.120
but all that gets countered by the technique of Sylvia.

488
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:15.240
I mean if these guys were in a weight lifting contest,
you know,

489
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:18.060
he probably might be able to lift twice as much as Sylvia,

490
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:20.760
but he rag dogs Tim to the ground.
What does Tim do?

491
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.270
It just the kids back up now I'll put you analyses,
you can start getting tired.

492
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.820
They're exhausted down.

493
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.320
Taking a big guy down all over and over and over and over again like that.

494
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.300
And so disheartening.

495
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:33.990
If you blow your entire was taking the guy down and then just springs right back

496
00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:37.800
up to his feet.
And a lot of these guys,
they just have no clue.

497
00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:42.240
And just the endurance aspect of this game.
No,
there's nothing like it.

498
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.310
There's less adrenaline dump.
I mean,

499
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:46.320
imagine if there's like one of his first fights.

500
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:49.200
He's in front of thousands and thousands of people.
I mean,

501
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:52.720
do you get that adrenaline dump and it just is so exhausted?
Yeah.

502
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:57.180
He turned purple like a grape.
As the fight went on,

503
00:28:57.181 --> 00:29:01.170
you start to see it now.
What is that from all the blood is rushing to your skin.

504
00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:02.490
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

505
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.260
A lot of times these guys aren't breathing properly right there.

506
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.810
The breath holding and there's a Ma we talked about this last time

507
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.080
<v 4>visavis sink where the,</v>

508
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.470
there's a partial glottal closure and they're making these grants and their

509
00:29:13.471 --> 00:29:16.920
blood pressure's building up and it,
you know,

510
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.460
that in itself not knowing how to breathe.
Very exhausted.

511
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.840
<v 3>Awesome.
Yeah,
that was the thing.</v>

512
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:25.080
One of the things that separated Hickson from a lot of the other Jujitsu guys

513
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:29.750
was his work with Yoga and you know,
that video choke the,
um,

514
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.080
the DVD choke,
the documentary.
It's fascinating.
Fascinating in a lot of ways,

515
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:38.890
but really fascinating watching him do that.
Diaphragm thing,
you know,

516
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.310
his son crone was on here and he was explaining the diaphragm

517
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.970
<v 4>thing and talking about how much emphasis he puts on breathing and in his</v>

518
00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:46.804
training,

519
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.250
charting is supposedly really good for digestion.

520
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.950
It's like an internal massage for your organs and so forth.
Yeah,

521
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.590
it seems like it would be,
uh,
the breath he was using.

522
00:29:56.591 --> 00:30:00.760
It's called breath of fire or a bellows breath.
But it's interesting,
you know,

523
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.110
there's different,
uh,
an aerobatic medicine,
which was the,
the,
uh,

524
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.880
the original medical system in the world.
It's like a 5,000 year old,
uh,

525
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:11.440
uh,
system of medicine.

526
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.730
There's different constitutional types and there's different types of breathing

527
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:19.120
for each constitutional time.
So for your listeners out there,

528
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.940
not everyone should be doing that particular type of breath set.

529
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:27.040
It can build up too much heat in,
in certain constitutional types.
Really?
Yeah.

530
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:31.690
There's 13 different Pranayama breath types and they're all therapeutic.

531
00:30:31.691 --> 00:30:33.370
The breath is like medicine.

532
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.150
If it's applied properly for regaining balance and your body and your system,

533
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.380
there's the Vata,

534
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.550
the Pitta and the coffer and a Hickson's that Kafka and that type of breathing

535
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:45.850
assessment.
Fantastic for him.
But one piece of good for me,

536
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.690
there's other types of,
oh,
how do you,
how would you know who you,

537
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.460
why you got to study this stuff,
but what it,

538
00:30:50.461 --> 00:30:52.780
what would make you different from him?
Uh,

539
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.690
your constitutional type of set at birth?
Just like,
you know,

540
00:30:55.691 --> 00:31:00.691
you've heard of Ectomorph endomorph sort of a similar classification and there's

541
00:31:01.001 --> 00:31:04.090
different ways that you,
I mean,
if you,
if,
uh,

542
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.310
if you want to actually find out online,

543
00:31:06.311 --> 00:31:09.580
you can Google this and find out what type of constitutional type you are.

544
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:15.160
And then certain dietary,
uh,
uh,
for example,

545
00:31:15.161 --> 00:31:19.810
for me,
uh,
being a pitch,
a very,
uh,
heat,
I produce too much heat,

546
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:23.880
excess heat,
uh,
eating spicy food for example,
is a horrible thing for a God.

547
00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:27.730
I mean,
really,
what does this based on a aerobatics,
uh,

548
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.540
it was empirical evidence that,
uh,
I mean the ancients weren't stupid,

549
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.070
they didn't have our technology,

550
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:37.240
but they did have the power of observation and these people,
you know,

551
00:31:37.241 --> 00:31:39.490
just imagine how they figured out herbal medicine,

552
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.060
which is around a long time before the pharmaceutical companies.

553
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.880
So what would I Google if I was trying to look this up?
I aerobatic medicine,

554
00:31:46.881 --> 00:31:50.080
they,
U R Y v e d c,

555
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:54.820
and then look at the Dosha types or d,
o s h a Dosha.

556
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.970
And there's online test that you can take.

557
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.760
One of the first books I ever read was called body,

558
00:32:00.761 --> 00:32:03.280
mind and sport by a guy by the name of John d yard,

559
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:08.281
who was an American chiropractor and Ira vedic physician and does consultation.

560
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.390
And he had a little test in the book.
There's this back.
Oh,
I dunno.

561
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:18.130
Probably like 25 years ago I took this test and discover that I indeed was a

562
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:21.730
pitcher and a,
and how did you discover it?
Like what are the,
there's,

563
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:26.930
there's this whole line of questions and you're able to find out your type.

564
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.990
But I've also been to a doctor lads,

565
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:36.080
a clinic in New Mexico in Albuquerque and he's an er physician,

566
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.710
uh,
vast that,

567
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.350
that he's a well respected aerobatic physician.

568
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.080
And he also has a medical degree and he has a clinic,

569
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:49.820
also an in Mumbai,
India.
And,
uh,

570
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:50.900
there,
uh,

571
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:55.901
I also was a typed by professionals and I did what they call a punch,

572
00:32:56.191 --> 00:32:57.830
a Karma,
which is a cleanse.

573
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.510
I pretty much didn't eat anything but this real thin type of soup.

574
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:07.670
It's just like a broth for a week and then had all sorts of treatments.

575
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:12.560
It's a,
it's a real good cleansing,
uh,
help the body detoxify,
you know,

576
00:33:12.561 --> 00:33:16.490
this,
this,
uh,
this environment that we live in,
especially in the United States.

577
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:20.150
You know,
we're just beset with all sorts of pollutants,
air,
water,

578
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.430
toxins in the food.

579
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:26.690
Your body is capable of reading itself of all that stuff once it's not burdened

580
00:33:26.691 --> 00:33:28.010
by digestion.

581
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.840
<v 3>Huh.
This is inch.
These questions are very strange.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

582
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:35.510
what's best describes how you act under stress?

583
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:40.340
<v 4>Say your emotions are also geared towards an another words.</v>

584
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.880
Your constitutional type will affect your emotional outlook and even your mental

585
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:46.760
outlook.
Hmm.
So it's,
you know,
body,
mind and spirit.

586
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.910
They're not looking just at physical symptoms like Western medicine.

587
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.140
They're looking at the whole package.
You know,
what makes Steve Maxwell,

588
00:33:54.141 --> 00:33:57.620
Steve Maxwell,
what makes Joe Rogan Joe Rogan.
So it's,

589
00:33:57.621 --> 00:34:02.360
it's looking at the total package,
the way you think,
you know,

590
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:05.760
your belief systems,
your emotional system,
your,
your fiscal,
uh,

591
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.060
and no one's just one time,

592
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.860
just one constitutional type of course were mixtures of all these things and

593
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:16.090
sometimes you can have an imbalance and,

594
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:20.270
and actually manifest,
uh,
different aspects of,
of,

595
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.980
of other constitutional types.

596
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.880
<v 3>This is fascinating.
It is very fascinating and it is the oldest medical system.</v>

597
00:34:26.881 --> 00:34:28.320
It's been around for a long time.
Yeah.

598
00:34:28.321 --> 00:34:30.550
I'm filling out this form of trying to find out what I am.

599
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:35.910
<v 4>I,
I'm just guessing just from looking at you that you're probably a Kafka,</v>

600
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:37.190
but perhaps not.

601
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.520
<v 3>Yeah,
I like to be active.
It's hard to sit still.
Boom.</v>

602
00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.620
Enjoy activity that has a purpose.
Especially competitive.
Well,
that's true too.

603
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:52.150
I like leisurely activities.
I like all three of those.
How do you describe that?

604
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.090
I said I'll go with be competitive,
which best describes your walking style.

605
00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:02.200
Got a walking style.
Yeah,
there's a walking style.
What's the choices?

606
00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.720
I walk quickly.
I have a determined walk.

607
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:08.140
I walk slow and steady at a leisurely pace,
but slow and steady,

608
00:35:08.141 --> 00:35:09.880
deliberately pace as washing your gait.

609
00:35:09.881 --> 00:35:13.540
When you're walking out to the car you walk like a very strong confident kind of

610
00:35:13.541 --> 00:35:17.590
guy that that'd be a cough.
Okay.
Which best describes your mood?

611
00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:21.670
My mood changes quickly.
My moods change slowly.
My moods are mostly steady.

612
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:25.330
Probably steady.
Seems like a pretty steady Eddie.
Yeah,
pretty steady guy.

613
00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:30.160
Which best describes your memory?
I learned quick and forget quickly.
That's me.

614
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.500
I have a good memory but I have a good memory too.

615
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.040
I learned slowly but I have a good long term memory where you have a hell a mind

616
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:43.140
<v 2>for facts and figures but only if I care.
I mean that isn't it that way.</v>

617
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:43.831
It is with everything.

618
00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:47.100
Cause I mean some of the statistics you come up with on the fighters during the

619
00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:51.900
show,
you know their coaches where they trained the records.
Joe,

620
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.060
your memory is like freaking elephant man.

621
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.840
But that's only if I care about something that I don't care about.

622
00:35:57.841 --> 00:35:58.950
Like people always ask.

623
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.420
<v 0>I mean like when you're,
when you're talking about fights,</v>

624
00:36:01.421 --> 00:36:04.990
like are you basing this off notes?
No,
I'm almost,

625
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:08.950
almost all of the stuff that I talk about like during the fights is just stuff

626
00:36:08.951 --> 00:36:11.710
that I remember if I remember fights and it's just mind blowing.

627
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:15.190
But I do have a sheet that's in front of me that gives me like a fighter's

628
00:36:15.191 --> 00:36:18.690
record but it's very rare that I reference it cause almost all of it is shit.

629
00:36:18.691 --> 00:36:21.460
But that's just because I'm a fan of the sport.
What does,

630
00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:26.290
but if you ask me things about,
I dunno,
the Oliver North trial.

631
00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.750
<v 2>Yeah.
Well you know,
I mean you know your,</v>

632
00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:32.980
your mind only has butts so much capacity.
So I mean

633
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.120
<v 0>organisation.
What best describes your organization style?</v>

634
00:36:37.121 --> 00:36:40.630
I'm good at getting things started but not,
it's getting things done.

635
00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:43.870
I'm very organized and I can focus on a project from start to finish.

636
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.610
I need help getting things started,

637
00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.340
but I am good at seeing things through to the finish.
That's,
I'm neither one.

638
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.220
I'm none of those things.
But sometimes you know the hard times you,

639
00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.920
you can be all those things in different situations or we'll just go with a,

640
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.080
all right.
Congratulations.
You finished the quiz.

641
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.300
Wait a moment while we get your results.
Okay.
Be Curious.

642
00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.810
I mean,
there's so many different tests for this era of anything though.

643
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.680
Fuck Emma.
Come on.
What's with the gum on?
Trying to come up with the answer.

644
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.430
Okay.
This is indicative of Aveda type.

645
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.140
This is indicative of a pita type.
This is indicative of a calf,
a type.

646
00:37:20.141 --> 00:37:23.680
This is indicative of a calf,
a type.
This is indicative of Peta.
Uh,

647
00:37:23.681 --> 00:37:27.460
I got all of them,
man.
I'm,
I'm all of them.

648
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.930
<v 2>Well,
I think one is part of each one,</v>

649
00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:35.310
but you're going to pretty big dominately one or the other.
Just say though.

650
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.730
But there's much more in depth test.
So this sucks.

651
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.720
It might've been for all of this.
Might've been a bogus test.
Well,
yeah,

652
00:37:42.721 --> 00:37:44.730
it's probably some westernized test,
right?

653
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:48.070
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,
some American version of the ancient tests,</v>

654
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.330
obviously it's an English translations are probably a bit funky.

655
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:55.560
<v 2>Okay.
I was,
I was actually typed by a professional with the in the profession.</v>

656
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.680
I found it to be quite true for me personally.
That's interesting.

657
00:37:59.681 --> 00:38:02.630
So you went to an actual specialist to do this?
Yeah,
I did.

658
00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:07.790
And when you find out your body type or you find out there's the dietary regimen

659
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:11.580
that goes along with this and there's even an exercise that's better,

660
00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.890
more beneficial world that's beneficial for different types.

661
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.450
And as the idea of balancing yourself.
Yeah,

662
00:38:19.451 --> 00:38:24.451
you want to keep as balanced as possible and you have to be very careful with

663
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:29.110
imbalances what manifest all sorts of illnesses,
diseases and so forth.

664
00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:32.980
So food choices and exercise choices.
For example,

665
00:38:32.981 --> 00:38:36.790
I mentioned spice for me is just a terrible cause I don't need to produce any

666
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:38.560
more heat in my,
in my body.

667
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.420
Excess heat would cause my joints to do dra eight and caused osteoarthritis and

668
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:47.020
all sorts of stuff.
Why that really?
And that can be caused by spicy food.

669
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.840
By excess heat in the system.
That's correct.

670
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:53.020
But I didn't know that spicy food actually does generate heat.

671
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:56.090
I creates inflammation.
Oh hmm.

672
00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:00.070
But say for certain Dosha types,
like the Vata or the coffee,

673
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.710
it could be quite stimulating.
They need that.
Well what's,

674
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:07.220
what type would be the type that eats a lot of hot food?
Well,
Vod is for example,

675
00:39:07.221 --> 00:39:12.010
or kind of skinny and they have an asymmetry to their body so that can be really

676
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:13.990
good for them to help energize them.
Uh,

677
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.220
for a cough they tend to put on weight on one at a body,
fat and weight,

678
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:22.420
and sometimes the more spicy type foods would be good for helping rev up their

679
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:25.630
metabolism with the Chili and that type of stuff.

680
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:29.260
That's been shown to why they even put that in some of the fat loss formulas.

681
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:33.140
Maybe you guys are used to sell one of those fat loss formulas with your,

682
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.150
now that you don't have any fat burners on your thing.

683
00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:39.420
I don't believe in any of that shit.
I really have a coffee.
Do your best to me.

684
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.850
Coffee.
Yeah,
I mean just the caffeine.
Well,
I just think that that,

685
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.450
that weigh out that everyone's looking for fat burners.
It's this,

686
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.680
this one pill fix thing to a very complex issue.
The,
the,

687
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:54.580
the excess body fat issues are very complex.
It's very complex.
I mean it's,

688
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:59.290
you know,
emotional,
very emotional with a lot of people going on.

689
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:00.480
So much going on.
Yeah.

690
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.860
And the idea that you're going to fix that with a pill with a pill.

691
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:06.100
But see that's one of the problems I have with a lot of supplements.
You know,

692
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.110
I know you sell supplements,
I'm not,
I,

693
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.860
and there was a point you to speak is there was a time when I,

694
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.550
I had like almost a $300 a month hap.
Seriously.

695
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.980
Couple couple of things that uh,
I've come to the conclusion once I stopped,

696
00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:22.480
I didn't notice the damn bit of difference.

697
00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:27.730
But there is a difference between just trying to go for general health and

698
00:40:27.731 --> 00:40:32.140
trying to maximize your potential was competitive athlete when you're trying to

699
00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:35.080
maximize your competitive potential.
Okay.

700
00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:38.890
Maybe this might give you like a one or 2% edge or something,

701
00:40:38.891 --> 00:40:43.891
or 3% but if you're an elite that's maybe all you need to be a champion or,

702
00:40:45.461 --> 00:40:49.030
or when the worlds or something like that,
that's one extra punch,

703
00:40:49.031 --> 00:40:53.980
land extra take down,
defended.
But for general health,
you know,

704
00:40:53.981 --> 00:40:58.300
I mean,
there's not a,
an animal on God's earth that need supplements.

705
00:40:58.450 --> 00:40:59.380
If you think about it,

706
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.510
nature provided everything that every animal on the planet needs.
You know,

707
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.590
think of like how strong a bull gorilla is or,

708
00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.030
or a water buffalo or Elian.
I mean,

709
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:14.650
everything they need is provided by nature and us as the highest form of animal

710
00:41:14.651 --> 00:41:16.090
on the planet.
I mean,

711
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:21.040
what makes us think that God didn't provide the stuff are nature didn't provide

712
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:22.900
for us.
It was that,

713
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.380
it was certain people have to be willing to eat it and they're not.
They want to,

714
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:31.090
you know,
TV dinners and,
and,
you know,
nuke their food in the microwave and,
and,

715
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:34.010
and,
and,
and,
and so forth.
And you know,
we

716
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.520
<v 4>were talking about how,
you know,</v>

717
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:40.000
the damaging sugar is last time and how delicious it is.
And you know,
and,

718
00:41:40.001 --> 00:41:44.180
and these,
these,
these,
uh,
fast food manufacturers,
they're pretty insidious.

719
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:49.040
I mean,
they know how to drop a taste that is almost literally irresistible.

720
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.930
Some people even say addictive.

721
00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.500
<v 0>Well,
it's certainly addictive.
There's sugars in,</v>

722
00:41:53.501 --> 00:41:57.400
in certain foods and certain fast foods that sugar has been shown to be one of

723
00:41:57.401 --> 00:41:58.234
the most addictive food.

724
00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:00.570
<v 4>Oh my God,
yes,
like free,
credible,
predictive.</v>

725
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.540
But the problem is when people are taking a lot of supplements,

726
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.190
somehow they have a tendency to think that it's okay to eat that stuff.

727
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:09.750
And there's a lot say,

728
00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.820
but if they feel somehow they're getting it in their pills and their approach to

729
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.410
covering their bases and the powders and all that,
and there's a lot less

730
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.030
desire to go out and eat a proper,
you know,

731
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.930
they don't have the incentive to go out and eat a really good diet.
I mean,
I,

732
00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.980
I do online personal training and diet fat loss programs.

733
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.060
I'm shocked when I see the food logs of some of the guys to send it in.

734
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.680
I mean there's no raw fruits or raw vegetables on their menus.

735
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:42.030
It's like,
wow,
how,
how could you not at least have some,

736
00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.260
you know,
and it's all,
you know,
cooked,
prepared foods,

737
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.880
canned bottled stuff in plastic wrappers.
It's like wow,

738
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:55.740
but you know,
that's what's happened to us in modern society.
So yes,

739
00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:00.120
probably there's no real harm and taking some supplements for regular people,

740
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.253
well there's certain things

741
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:05.750
<v 0>mentally you're just not going to get the right amount.
With foods like fish oil,</v>

742
00:43:05.751 --> 00:43:08.140
like omega three fatty acids and things along those lines,

743
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.220
like you would have to eat a shit load of fish every day to get the proper

744
00:43:12.221 --> 00:43:13.810
amount to reduce inflammation,

745
00:43:13.811 --> 00:43:17.560
to increased cognitive abilities to help muscle growth.

746
00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:21.160
There's a lot of benefits official that's been shown and it's incredibly

747
00:43:21.161 --> 00:43:24.310
difficult to get that amount of fish oil just from eating fish unless written

748
00:43:24.311 --> 00:43:25.840
salmon,
fatty salmon all day

749
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:26.540
<v 4>or,</v>

750
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.100
or getting fish that isn't polluted with mercury and all that crap.

751
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.020
<v 0>I had a problem once I went to a doctor,</v>

752
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.950
I get blood work done just to see where I'm at and check to see if I'm healthy.

753
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.400
You'll look at,
make sure there's no issues in advance.

754
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:45.650
And a doctor told me that I had arsenic in my,
in my body,
and I was like,

755
00:43:45.651 --> 00:43:48.530
what?
Like,
like on being poisoned.
Like were you talking about,
he's like,

756
00:43:48.531 --> 00:43:52.160
it's a very low level.
Um,
do you,
do you eat a lot of fish?
And I said,

757
00:43:52.161 --> 00:43:55.280
I eat sardines.
You always eaten like a can of sardines a day,

758
00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:58.460
sometimes two cans a day.
I love sardines.
And he was like,
well,

759
00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:01.940
stop doing that because the sardines live at the bottom of the ocean and they

760
00:44:01.941 --> 00:44:05.090
collect a lot of heavy metals and a lot of pollution.
And uh,

761
00:44:05.091 --> 00:44:09.620
I stopped and it was gone,
but I was getting arsenic poisoning from sardines.

762
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.310
<v 4>Well,
which is called the Shaker.
Sardines are delicious.</v>

763
00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:16.630
They're a great source of sulfur amino acids,
which you know,

764
00:44:16.631 --> 00:44:21.520
has been tied into,
uh,
anti aging.
So it's a shame.
But yeah,

765
00:44:21.521 --> 00:44:25.840
our food sources are being ruined on the,
on the planet.
Slowly but surely,

766
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.690
slowly but surely.
So as there's no escape from it.

767
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.150
But that's one reason why I like to do the fasting.

768
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:33.930
Remember I mentioned the Paunch Karma,
this detox name,

769
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:38.850
your body is able to throw a lot of these toxins off under the right conditions.

770
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:41.130
How much water are you drinking a day?
You know,

771
00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:44.130
I don't even measure his drink when Thursday.
Pretty much.
You know,

772
00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.120
so you don't like have like a big jug that you can put na.

773
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.950
I think a lot of that was overplayed cause yeah,

774
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.510
I just don't think is all that necessary to drink all that much.

775
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.080
<v 0>Yeah.
When,
when people say it's a weird thing,</v>

776
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:01.770
like they say you should have x amount of glasses of water a day or a gallon of

777
00:45:01.771 --> 00:45:04.410
water a day.
Like what?
What is,
what does that based on?

778
00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.890
<v 4>I have no idea.</v>

779
00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:10.840
But I do know that one of your best sources for hydration is with raw fruits and

780
00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:13.870
raw vegetables.
And when you're getting a lot of this type of plant stuff,

781
00:45:13.871 --> 00:45:15.550
you're getting plenty of hydration right?

782
00:45:15.551 --> 00:45:18.760
From fruits and vegetables of people that don't have any of that stuff.
Yeah,

783
00:45:18.761 --> 00:45:23.080
they probably do need to drink a little bit more,
but yeah,

784
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.150
I mean for the most part there's a lot of misses or perpetrated out there for no

785
00:45:28.151 --> 00:45:29.320
rhyme or reason,
you know?

786
00:45:29.321 --> 00:45:31.630
And you just wonder where does all this stuff come from?

787
00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.070
<v 0>Yeah,
the water one was a big one.</v>

788
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:38.000
Like guys would walk around with these giant jugs of water and they would say

789
00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:40.910
that the average person walks around dehydrated all the time,

790
00:45:40.911 --> 00:45:43.870
but I would watch them and they'd be peeing every 20 minutes.
And I was like,

791
00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:47.210
<v 4>well,
you know,
while you're flushing your body out of toxin,
it's like,</v>

792
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:50.000
are you sure?
Are you sure?

793
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.390
It sounds to me like you're just overloading your kidneys with a lot of water

794
00:45:53.391 --> 00:45:54.580
for no good reason,
but that

795
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.480
<v 0>thing,
you know,</v>

796
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.800
everybody's always worried about the toxins of flushing toxins out.

797
00:45:58.801 --> 00:46:00.450
I'm going to go to the sauna,

798
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:02.820
it's going to flush out the toxins and I'm gonna drink water.

799
00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:05.610
It's going to flush out the toxins.
I'm doing a cleanse.

800
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:07.280
It's going to take care of my toxins.
Like

801
00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:12.520
<v 4>there's all these,
it's worried about it for sure.
Cause you know,
the worry,</v>

802
00:46:12.521 --> 00:46:16.240
we won't change it at the end bit.
I ended in favor of overheating bads.

803
00:46:16.241 --> 00:46:18.370
I think it can be a really good thing for longevity.

804
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:23.730
I mean it's been since the time of American Indians had their sweat lodge,

805
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.460
the Russians and the fins had their,
their,
their saunas.

806
00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:32.620
The Romans were very big on,
on,
uh,
steam,
the Turks and so forth.

807
00:46:32.621 --> 00:46:33.670
The Japanese,
you know,

808
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:37.360
everyone's used heating therapies for producing a good sweat.

809
00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:38.560
And if you think about it,

810
00:46:38.561 --> 00:46:43.540
the skin's the largest organ in the body and you can eliminate a lot of waste

811
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.280
out through the skin,
through press perforation.
And when you,

812
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:52.390
uh,
uh,
get,
stimulate the skin two to sweat,

813
00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:57.370
you can sweat out a lot of stuff.
Uh,
have you ever heard of infrared sauna?
Yes.

814
00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:57.821
Well,
you know,

815
00:46:57.821 --> 00:47:02.230
infrared Saunas so good at helping the body detoxify that a drug and alcohol

816
00:47:02.231 --> 00:47:07.231
clinics actually install infrared Saunas to help people kick drugs and alcohol

817
00:47:07.871 --> 00:47:11.260
and cigarettes and so forth.
That's incredible.
Yeah.
I mean it's,

818
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.140
it's tried and true.
I mean,
it does work.

819
00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:18.640
And a infrared sauna is way different than the old sod as we used to sit in as

820
00:47:18.641 --> 00:47:21.800
wrestlers,
you know,
trying to just the hotbox,

821
00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.260
these infrared Saunas,
the temperatures that doesn't have to be nearly as,

822
00:47:26.261 --> 00:47:30.130
Hi Matt.
My God,
they feel so good.
The very penetrating

823
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.140
<v 3>and uh,
it's really good for recovery after hard training and so forth.</v>

824
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.710
You'll have to drive one.
Sometimes.
I might even want to look into,
uh,

825
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:41.830
putting on like a little mini one in your house or something.
I am actually,

826
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:44.800
my wife has one that she climbs into like a sleeping bag.

827
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.250
It's in some weird sort of infrared sauna and she heats up.
Oh,

828
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:51.460
that she loves this thing.
That's cool,
man.
Doctor Rhonda Patrick,

829
00:47:51.461 --> 00:47:55.240
one of the people that,
uh,
I've had on the podcast as a regular,
um,

830
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.330
she's a fascinating and she's got so much knowledge.
Um,

831
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.420
and one of the things that she wrote a paper that was recently published,

832
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:06.720
it's on the benefits of Sauna and a really incredible on a hyperthermic

833
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:11.440
conditioning on muscle growth.
And,
uh,
oh,
that's fascinating.
Yeah.

834
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:14.440
And she was saying,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,
I would,

835
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.270
I would really not do it justice.

836
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:20.410
Like it's something that should be read and gone over cause it's a very deep and

837
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:24.670
in depth paper that she published.
But it's all about,
uh,

838
00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:28.240
the benefits of a,
of the sauna and the uh,

839
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:31.630
the effect on hormone production and the,
uh,

840
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:35.020
the effect of a heat stress on the brain.
Really,

841
00:48:35.021 --> 00:48:36.760
really interesting stuff.

842
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.350
He stress has been shown to increase the expression of brain derived neurotropic

843
00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:44.310
factor.
Well,
more,

844
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.040
more than exercise alone when used in conjunction with exercise.

845
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:52.300
This is important because this brain derived neurotropic factor increases the

846
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:57.301
growth of new brain cells as well as the survival of existing neurons and

847
00:48:57.431 --> 00:49:00.880
increase in neurogenesis is thought to be responsible for enhancing learning.

848
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:06.190
Wow.
Incredible.
So exercise and sauna enhances learning.
Well,
like I said,

849
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:08.290
the ancients were not stupid people.
You know,

850
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:11.770
we were so smug with our technology.
We are.
Right.
But you know,

851
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:16.090
you take the average person and take him 50 miles out in the wilderness and let

852
00:49:16.091 --> 00:49:19.360
him go.
He would probably die of fright.
He wouldn't even be,
you know,

853
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.010
and you take it shout even as little as 200 years ago and they would be

854
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.180
perfectly comfortable living in their environment.
You know,

855
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.780
that's what technology has done for us.

856
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:32.960
We can't even go from point a to point B with that or iPhone or a gps or,

857
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.750
right.
I wonder what's going on with that.
Um,
you know,

858
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:41.440
when you look at people that used to live a long time ago and you used to be

859
00:49:41.441 --> 00:49:45.100
able to survive out in the woods and survive without technology and then you

860
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:48.790
look at,
you ever watch that show naked and afraid?
I have not.

861
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:52.750
It's a fascinating show cause they take people and they take the clothes off and

862
00:49:52.751 --> 00:49:55.510
then they leave them in the jungle.
Oh I did hear about this.

863
00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.420
It's the most fucking ridiculous shall ever.
Well by how the,

864
00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:01.290
how do they show that kind of note again,
TV,
they just blur,
blur,

865
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:06.490
blur out the breasts and blur out their crotch.
And uh,
you know,
it's a couple,

866
00:50:06.491 --> 00:50:10.690
a man and a woman and um,
I don't,
I don't know if they have any sex.

867
00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:15.730
I would imagine they know each other before the shot.
Nope.
Oh yeah,

868
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:20.620
they're naked together.
Yeah.
It's a fascinating show.
Well,

869
00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:26.470
fascinating.
Depending upon who the contestants are,
you know,
they have a,

870
00:50:26.471 --> 00:50:28.100
I believe it's one days,

871
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.460
<v 0>which is the most amount of time you can go without any food.</v>

872
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.760
So I think they put them in a place that has an abundant amount of water so they

873
00:50:34.761 --> 00:50:37.390
could find water.
They don't put them in the desert for 21 days.

874
00:50:37.391 --> 00:50:40.550
It'd be fucking dead.
And to,
you know,
they're probably dead.
And one,
you know,

875
00:50:40.551 --> 00:50:45.140
you put someone in death valley with no clothes for a day,
no water,
no clothes.

876
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.310
You got 24 hours.
If you're lucky,
you might not even make it 24 hours.
Right.

877
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:53.600
And we get to 128 degrees out there and you could just a heat stroke even with

878
00:50:53.601 --> 00:50:54.890
water.
So yeah.

879
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:58.850
So these people are out there and you know they have to build shelter because

880
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:01.850
there in the rain forest so there's only as fucking bugs and you know,

881
00:51:01.851 --> 00:51:04.700
they see bullet ants,
bullet ants are the,
oh,

882
00:51:04.701 --> 00:51:07.040
some of the most painful stings known demand.

883
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.180
They say it's like getting your hand slammed in a car door for 24 hours.

884
00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:12.920
That's what it feels like.
If one bites you.

885
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:17.130
Well I would definitely be naked and afraid of us around fricking bullet.

886
00:51:17.131 --> 00:51:21.380
And as well they have these rites of passages they do with certain indigenous

887
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:25.820
tribes in the Amazon where they take what looks like oven Mitts and they embed

888
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:29.110
bullet ants in these oven mitts all throughout that.
Like they,

889
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:33.620
they like stick their stingers through so they're trapped and so they just keep

890
00:51:33.621 --> 00:51:38.621
stinging and then they make these guys wear these gloves and get the shit stung

891
00:51:39.321 --> 00:51:42.530
out of them by these bullet ants.
And,
uh,
there was one show,

892
00:51:42.531 --> 00:51:43.490
I forgot what the show was,

893
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:48.491
but the host actually took part in the ritual himself and put these gloves on

894
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:49.461
his hands.

895
00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:52.820
He got his hands all strong and it sounds crazy and you just watch and just

896
00:51:52.821 --> 00:51:57.470
dropped to his knees.
And just the most intense agony,
unimaginable agony.

897
00:51:57.590 --> 00:51:59.540
And it just lasts forever.

898
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.680
Lasts like hours and hours and hours of intense,
intense agony.

899
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:08.930
But in getting through it,
it,
um,
not only is it,

900
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:11.870
um,
like a rite of passage,

901
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:16.310
but it also is what they call it,
certain tribal

902
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:21.290
tribal cultures where they do not have access to psychedelics.

903
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:26.000
So this is like a psychedelic,
the neurotoxins and the venom.

904
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:30.110
Yeah,
kind of puts you on some kind of altered state.

905
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.140
There's a little bit of that.
And there's also the,

906
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:38.170
your body develops so much resistance to all the venom that there's probably

907
00:52:39.561 --> 00:52:44.390
some sort of a,
a serotonin boost.
And there's also,
there's things called,

908
00:52:44.391 --> 00:52:47.200
um,
they're,
they're called the,

909
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:51.830
there's certain certain rituals where it's not a,
it's not called a psychedelic,

910
00:52:51.831 --> 00:52:54.770
it's called a like an ordeal.
Poison and ordeal.

911
00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:59.420
Poison is like what tribes where they don't have access to psychedelics.

912
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.720
Oftentimes they come up with these rituals based on poisoning.

913
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:08.000
So they'll give someone a poison that gets you to the brink of death,

914
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:11.210
like gets you like to you,
you're sweating,
you're dying,

915
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.230
and then it releases you when your body processes it.
Like the IOWASCA almost,

916
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.540
but not because I was,
is not poisoned.

917
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:21.380
I ask it doesn't harm you and in fact I just couldn't use that vomiting,

918
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:25.830
that severe vomiting.
Yeah,
but that's just because it's disgusting.
It's to gross.

919
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:29.430
It's and you're taking all this plant matter and it's just horrible.

920
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:33.270
Foul taste and purging.
Anything that might be in your stomach,

921
00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:37.200
but the active ingredients in,
um,
in Iowasca,

922
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.610
not only is it not toxic,

923
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:43.410
but it's also one of the most transient drugs ever exhibited a or ever observed

924
00:53:43.411 --> 00:53:45.990
in the body because of the fact that it's a normal norm,

925
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:47.500
new human neuro transmitter.

926
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:50.940
Your body knows how to process it so your body just can bring you back to

927
00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:55.070
baseline very quickly.
You know,
I bought some of that stuff one time.
I was it.

928
00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:56.910
<v 4>Yeah,
I was going to do,
I said I got scared.</v>

929
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.100
Well I read where you really should have a shaman that really knows his stuff.

930
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:06.180
And I thought,
you know what if I had a bad trip and this stuff man,

931
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:07.230
where were ya?

932
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.680
But I was living in my camper van at the time out in Arizona in the middle of

933
00:54:10.681 --> 00:54:15.090
the desert.
How long ago was it?
Like what about three and a half,
four years ago.

934
00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:16.870
And I had read about it,

935
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:21.770
Wasco from Stuart Wilde who said that this is where the spiritual teachers got

936
00:54:21.771 --> 00:54:22.800
to go at some point,
you know,

937
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:26.010
once you've reached a certain level and he was talking about it.

938
00:54:26.011 --> 00:54:28.950
I was good and I thought that sounds really fascinating.

939
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:33.480
And it was ridiculously easy to buy over the Internet and have mail ordered

940
00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:36.970
right to my po box.
So was it a fully brood males?

941
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.700
It was just the plant matter,
like the dried herbal stuff,

942
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:42.510
sealed plastic bag.

943
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.120
And then I looked at it and then I read about the processing and I thought,

944
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:47.963
you know what?

945
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:53.390
I probably should just wait on this and do it in Wa wa wait till someone that

946
00:54:53.821 --> 00:54:55.460
really knows what he's doing.
But they,

947
00:54:55.461 --> 00:54:59.520
they had those Iowasca trips that you could take down in Brazil and even in

948
00:54:59.521 --> 00:55:00.130
Mexico,

949
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:03.070
<v 0>we're thinking about starting a treatment center in,</v>

950
00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:07.950
in Peru because uh,
yeah,
my partner from Onnit,

951
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:10.600
Aubrey's been down there so many times his work with these guys.

952
00:55:10.601 --> 00:55:14.110
So many times we're thinking about setting up a program because it's legal
there.

953
00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:14.800
Yeah,
for sure.

954
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.820
Setting up a program through on it where people can travel down there and they

955
00:55:18.821 --> 00:55:23.560
know that they'll have good combinations,
a legit Sharman safe environment.

956
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.513
And you know,

957
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:28.420
we've had so many requests from so many people that we would love to send you

958
00:55:28.421 --> 00:55:31.420
down there.
I might have to take you up on that job.

959
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:36.580
Give me a full report and I would love to go with you.
I spend time,
I'm down,

960
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:38.250
I'm down with it totally fast.

961
00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.840
<v 4>I've been thinking about this for years,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

962
00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:44.770
It's just really something that just sounds fascinating to me because apparently

963
00:55:44.771 --> 00:55:49.120
people have some really amazing psychedelic experiments and just kind of expands

964
00:55:49.121 --> 00:55:53.140
the consciousness and,
and,
and uh,
they have some pretty,
uh,

965
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.300
pretty intense experiences.

966
00:55:55.301 --> 00:55:57.310
But you would definitely want it to be with someone that,

967
00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:00.340
that has taken people through it before.

968
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:03.130
Definitely not something to mess around with on your own man.

969
00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:07.330
<v 0>Well,
it's also,
uh,
the environment that you do it in is really important too.</v>

970
00:56:07.331 --> 00:56:10.600
You don't want to be in an unsafe environment.
You don't want to be tripping.

971
00:56:10.601 --> 00:56:12.520
You Paul's off and then something goes wrong.

972
00:56:12.521 --> 00:56:14.200
There's no one there that can handle everything.

973
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:19.230
Like you don't want to be like caught in a forest fire but flight a tripping on

974
00:56:19.361 --> 00:56:24.340
DMT.
Um,
I've only had the,
um,
the synthesized of it.
The,

975
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:28.210
the,
the,
the hard version of DMT.
I haven't had the orally active version of it,

976
00:56:28.211 --> 00:56:31.540
which is what Iowasca is.
And again,
you're talking about the ancients,
no one,

977
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:33.650
their shit,
the,
the,
they weren't full.

978
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:38.500
They figured out how to combine two different plants to create this,

979
00:56:38.501 --> 00:56:41.980
this mixture.
See DMTs not orally active.

980
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.370
If you took DMT in an oral form model,
Amy knocks days,

981
00:56:45.371 --> 00:56:48.900
which is produced in your gut would,
would kill the DMT.
Um,

982
00:56:48.901 --> 00:56:53.470
so they figured out how to take the leaves of certain plants which have DMT and

983
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.020
or the vines of certain plants which have DMT.

984
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.660
And then the leaves are other plants which have harming,

985
00:56:58.661 --> 00:57:00.250
which is a natural Mao inhibitor.

986
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:04.600
And then they brew it together and this really sort of complicated process and

987
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:05.980
develop this Iowasca,

988
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:10.000
which is essentially it becomes an orally active version of the drug that I
took.

989
00:57:10.001 --> 00:57:14.110
I just smoked it.
You smoke it,
it's intense.
It's very fast.

990
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.640
It hits you within 15,
20 seconds and it only lasts about 15 minutes.

991
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:22.510
It's sort of,
it's like a,
just a quick shot to the center of the universe.

992
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.770
The most amazing,
unbelievable psychedelic experience you could ever imagine.

993
00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:30.250
I describe it as mushrooms times a million plus aliens.

994
00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:35.110
Unbelievably intense.
I a WASC,
uh,
usually it's a little less intense,

995
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.000
but it's okay.

996
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.260
<v 4>Prolonged experience.
Many hours.
Several hours.
Yeah.
I read a,</v>

997
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:43.830
an outside magazine actually about a,
an eye Wasco trip that was organized.

998
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.800
There's a lot of 10 people,
two people didn't get anything.

999
00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:49.200
They just got sick and that was it.

1000
00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:54.290
And then eight of the ten one had a bad trip,
like freaked.

1001
00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:59.040
And then the other seven had fantastic consciousness raising experience.

1002
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.090
I wonder what

1003
00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:00.980
<v 0>makes people trip,</v>

1004
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:05.450
because there's the showman say that the people that have these bad trips of

1005
00:58:05.451 --> 00:58:07.070
what's going on is that the trying to fight it,

1006
00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:12.200
they're trying to control the situation and your ego doesn't want to let go and

1007
00:58:12.201 --> 00:58:17.201
you try to resist and then it just sorta chips away at your inner soul and finds

1008
00:58:17.331 --> 00:58:17.890
out,

1009
00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:21.260
you know what's causing this resistance and then penetrates it and freaks you

1010
00:58:21.261 --> 00:58:24.320
the fuck out.
And you can't,
you can't wrestle with God.

1011
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.320
And that's essentially what you're doing when you're having these psychedelic

1012
00:58:27.321 --> 00:58:27.921
experiences.

1013
00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:32.510
You're trying to wrestle with the creative force of the very universe itself and

1014
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:36.350
this ego thing that people have.
Oh,
don't worry,
I can handle it.

1015
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:40.820
There's so many people that have that I can handle it thing,
you know,
ridiculous.

1016
00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:45.800
<v 4>Overqualified confidence for no fucking reason,
for no reason,
for no reason,</v>

1017
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:47.860
no reason why you think you should be able to handle it,

1018
00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:50.350
but you're running big going in.
They're a little afraid.

1019
00:58:50.351 --> 00:58:54.350
You probably have great experience and humble and hump raid.
Humble and a frame.

1020
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:54.760
Please

1021
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.490
<v 0>be nice to me.
I give up,
you know,
I'll,</v>

1022
00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:00.760
I submit myself to you and then you're going to get through it.

1023
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:04.000
It's not a toxic thing.
It's not a poisonous thing.
The people,
you know,

1024
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:06.320
Terence Mckenna had a line.

1025
00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:11.020
The only fears that you may die from astonishment because it's so fucking crazy.

1026
00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:15.440
We're all going to die.
Not a bad way to go there.
Yeah.
Well that,

1027
00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:18.970
that's what's really crazy is that they believe that the experience that you

1028
00:59:18.971 --> 00:59:22.400
have while you're taking DMT is the exact experience

1029
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.860
<v 3>that people have when they're dying.
Because when you're dying,</v>

1030
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:27.140
your brain produces dimethyltryptamine.

1031
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:32.480
It's produced during rem sleep.
Well,
it's in so many different plants.

1032
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:36.330
The reason why your gut produces this model,
Amy and oxidase or uh,
one of the,

1033
00:59:36.331 --> 00:59:38.960
one of the reasons probably serves many purposes,

1034
00:59:38.961 --> 00:59:42.260
but is that dimethyltryptamine is in a lot of different plants.

1035
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.800
So these plants that we eat would give us DMT.

1036
00:59:45.801 --> 00:59:48.050
Like you would get high off of certain plants,

1037
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.940
like it's in thousands of different plants.

1038
00:59:49.941 --> 00:59:53.270
It's a law that you could extract it from just regular grass,

1039
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:56.150
like full arris grass has DMT in it.
Like a lot of it.

1040
00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.480
And that's why certain sheep will eat grasses that have DMT in it and they die

1041
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:05.610
like immediately.
Like you'll find them like in the field,

1042
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:09.440
they'll the run across a patch of grass that has DMT and their bank legs up,

1043
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:13.400
little little feet twitch.
And so like what might be toxic to a sheep,

1044
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.970
not so much to a yacht at all.
Not at all saying,
yeah,

1045
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:21.290
DMT is not toxic at all to humans,
but to,
to sheet.
But just wow,

1046
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:26.150
that's pretty fascinating.
Kills Him.
Don't be a sheep,
but you know,
going back to,

1047
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:30.950
excuse me.
Well we had mentioned earlier about the ancients not being stupid.

1048
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.710
You know,
that's basically what aerobatic medicine was based on.

1049
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:35.360
[inaudible] in India.
I mean,

1050
01:00:35.361 --> 01:00:39.440
these people had amazing powers of observation and this is,
you know,

1051
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:43.730
pre science.
We put so much faith in science,
but you know,

1052
01:00:43.731 --> 01:00:47.270
sometimes you have to think about these,
these so called studies,
you know,
with,

1053
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:50.640
with the agendas and so forth.
And it was definitely a lot of that.
Right.

1054
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:53.690
You know,
of course,
you know,
some monetary incentive.

1055
01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:59.060
How many times have we seen drugs being Charlie promoted only to find out later

1056
01:00:59.061 --> 01:01:01.700
when they're recalled,
like all these whores,
you know,

1057
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.810
like thalidomide in babies back in the 70s or whatever.

1058
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:09.800
But that happens a lot,
man.
Yeah,
less so now than it used to,

1059
01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:12.530
but now than it used to it.
But it's still happens.
Well,

1060
01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:14.690
there's more transparency now than ever before,

1061
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:19.160
so it makes it much more difficult.
But do you remember a Guy Metzger UFC?
Sure,

1062
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:23.930
sure.
You know,
he got a stroke from Vioxx.
Whoa.
Yeah,
Vioxx.

1063
01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:26.930
He's a,
he was having a arthritis issues with knees,
you know,

1064
01:01:26.931 --> 01:01:30.250
years of martial arts training.
A lot of guys have problems with her knees.

1065
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:31.071
They're very common.

1066
01:01:31.071 --> 01:01:35.240
Chris Weidman recently had both his knee scoped and before that he had gone

1067
01:01:35.241 --> 01:01:38.450
through Regena keen on his knees to,
but he said arthritis in his knees.

1068
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.920
So bad Weidman can't even pull his heel up to his butt,
you know,

1069
01:01:42.921 --> 01:01:47.921
and he's a UFC middleweight champion and his knees are so stiff from all the

1070
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.320
years of wrestling and all the years of what were talking about before plowing

1071
01:01:51.321 --> 01:01:53.170
through injury,
which is something new,

1072
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:57.200
injury that wrestlers are so accustomed to doing.

1073
01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:02.000
No one's in my opinion,
no one's tougher mentally then.
Then amateur wrestlers.

1074
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.530
I think the,
the ability to become a successful amateur wrestler,

1075
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:09.540
there's no hidden secrets.
There's the,
the,

1076
01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:14.541
the techniques have existed from literally the beginning of human time.

1077
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.910
People have learned how to wrestle.

1078
01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:19.980
I mean obviously they refined those techniques,
they passed him down,
but

1079
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:24.870
<v 0>there's no secrets.
It's hard work,
force,
determination,</v>

1080
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:28.740
focus.
That's all it is.
And so who,
who works harder,

1081
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.830
who can endure more,
who can punish their body more,

1082
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.210
who can show up and put in that extra hour of training every day that the other

1083
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:38.520
guy can't do that?
Guy's probably going to wind up winning.

1084
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:41.970
And so these wrestlers have this ability to plow through injuries

1085
01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.850
<v 4>through injury and lot man.
I mean they hurt themselves though.
Yeah,</v>

1086
01:02:46.851 --> 01:02:48.470
well it's very,
very hard in the body.

1087
01:02:48.471 --> 01:02:51.860
I think of the guys that I wrestled with back in the 60s and the 70s so a lot of

1088
01:02:51.861 --> 01:02:55.800
these guys are just,
their bodies are a mess.
You know,

1089
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I went to a reunion not too long ago of my old college guys and it was pitiful

1090
01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.020
off what's happening.
I mean some of these guys just set studs and wow.
They just,

1091
01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.790
just the hoarseness of the regimen,
you know,
they just kind of let themselves go.

1092
01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:13.220
They,
they didn't want to be bothered with that stuff anymore.

1093
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:17.050
<v 0>Well even guys that you know are still studs but this,</v>

1094
01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:20.420
their bodies are slowly giving out that things are breaking off.

1095
01:03:20.421 --> 01:03:23.660
Things that hips the back Mark Coleman just got a hip replacement,

1096
01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.330
<v 4>you know,
more Dan Gable,
their greatest wrestler ever.
You know,</v>

1097
01:03:27.331 --> 01:03:30.810
he went through the Munich Olympics unscored on because it's,

1098
01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.880
I imagine Olympic level tournament and the Russians had swore they're going to

1099
01:03:35.911 --> 01:03:37.170
find a guy to beat him.

1100
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.680
They guy went through the tournament without being scored on unbelievable forms.

1101
01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:47.250
An animal who our guy double hip replacement as saw knees as well.

1102
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:51.060
I think it's Niesr it needs to get his knees replaced as well.
So I mean,

1103
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:55.270
but you know,
sometimes you think like,
was it worth it?
I,

1104
01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:57.960
I think when he asks a lot of these guys,

1105
01:03:57.961 --> 01:04:01.710
you don't have the glory that they have,
they might say,
yeah,

1106
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.660
it was worth it because the long life of never having done anything,

1107
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:11.100
I mean that,
that's not worth,
that's not a life worth living either,

1108
01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:15.460
in my opinion.
Yeah,
it's a tough call because we're all good

1109
01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.430
<v 0>die.
And eventually all of our bodies will give out.</v>

1110
01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:22.610
And that's one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about because you,
uh,

1111
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:26.350
early on in one of your early DVDs,

1112
01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:28.970
one of the first ones that I got,
which boy,
I dunno when,

1113
01:04:28.971 --> 01:04:30.430
when did you put out your first DVD?

1114
01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.260
<v 4>My God,
I don't even know.
It's been a long time.
At least 15 years ago.</v>

1115
01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:38.300
<v 0>I got one of the earliest ones.
So you're probably,</v>

1116
01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:41.750
you were probably about my age actually.
You're probably about 46,

1117
01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:45.570
somewhere around that.
Yeah.
And you were talking about the,
um,

1118
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:48.960
the aging process of fighting off the aging process and uh,

1119
01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.420
exercising to fight off that aging process and being conscious about doing that.

1120
01:04:53.421 --> 01:04:56.270
And that's something that I think very few people do.

1121
01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:59.960
They just work out to be in shape.
They work out the same shape.

1122
01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:03.110
But you were one of the first guys that ever saw that was talking about it

1123
01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:08.111
pretty actively on a DVD and teaching people strategies and techniques to fight

1124
01:05:09.891 --> 01:05:12.620
off the aging process,
not just through exercise,

1125
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:17.030
through manipulating your hormones through certain types of exercise in joint.

1126
01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.050
So I'm

1127
01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:22.930
<v 4>about is so important because all the dead lifts and Kettlebell snatches and</v>

1128
01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:27.250
swings and the water and not going to save,
save you as you begin to get older,

1129
01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.830
you got to keep that mobility workup.

1130
01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.050
A lot of people don't understand what you mean by mobility.

1131
01:05:32.051 --> 01:05:34.720
They get very confused with the flexibility they are,
they are related,

1132
01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.140
but as basically being average to move through full range and,

1133
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:40.030
and keeping complete joint function.

1134
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:43.110
And there's specific exercises that a person can do to,

1135
01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:47.080
to enable them to do this.
And it feels damn good actually.

1136
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.960
And I've studied the Russian systems,
you know,

1137
01:05:49.961 --> 01:05:54.530
there's like a Slavic health system and Russian system.
They,
uh,

1138
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:58.660
really developed the mobility to very,
very,
very high level.

1139
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.970
And I was lucky enough to learn this stuff.

1140
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:04.480
And then of course I added a lot of the stuff I learned from Yoga and so forth

1141
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:08.260
in there.
And uh,
I came up with this system for myself.

1142
01:06:08.261 --> 01:06:11.770
Then I teach to people in my seminars and so forth.
And um,

1143
01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:15.820
it's really kept me going.
I mean I could ended up like all my comrades,
you know,

1144
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:19.210
the guys that wrestled with back in the sixties and seventies and of course I

1145
01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:19.871
been doing,

1146
01:06:19.871 --> 01:06:24.160
she sits there now for almost 23 years and competed pretty high level in the,

1147
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:27.070
in the age group divisions and that takes its toll.

1148
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:32.000
But thank God for the mobility.
It kept me fairly,
uh,

1149
01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.680
I mean I can't say I got through it completely unscathed,

1150
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:41.050
but it definitely kept my joints in tech and I'm able to move pretty damn good.

1151
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:45.370
And when I look at people in my family tree,
you know,
my,
my relatives,

1152
01:06:45.371 --> 01:06:49.420
my grandparents and so forth,
I mean they were moving bad.
I mean,

1153
01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:54.280
just really bad.
And uh,
I,
I vowed that that wasn't going to be me.

1154
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:59.110
So with this system that I use,
if this mobility it,
it keeps me pretty spry.

1155
01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:03.940
Now what do you,
how often do you do it?
Like every single day.
Every single day.

1156
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.530
So give me a,
like a schedule,
like how do you,
what do you do?

1157
01:07:08.531 --> 01:07:11.740
How do you start out your day with it?
Like,
well,
generally speaking,
I'll get up.

1158
01:07:11.741 --> 01:07:15.790
I have a whole era vedic therapy that I go through,
you know,
get up.
Yeah,

1159
01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:18.390
I'll scrape my tongue with a tongue scraper.
This is,
uh,

1160
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:23.320
there's a lot of stuff from the night sleeping all night.
You know,

1161
01:07:23.321 --> 01:07:28.120
you build up,
uh,
substances on the tongue.
You'll be shocked at what you see.

1162
01:07:28.121 --> 01:07:30.730
It comes off the tongue when you wake up in the morning,
you know,

1163
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:35.320
obviously toothbrushing head massage and then I had massage,

1164
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:38.190
head massage.
Do you do it yourself?
Yes.

1165
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:42.310
I also have like a special little scraper thing,
you know,

1166
01:07:42.311 --> 01:07:44.800
like little fingers that you really massage the head.

1167
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.230
Then I use a Neti pot and Eti it's an aerobatic technique where you rinse your

1168
01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:53.860
sinuses so he can breathe through the nose really,
really well.

1169
01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:56.380
And nasal breathing is really important.
Uh,

1170
01:07:56.381 --> 01:08:00.280
then I do a dry brush massage.
Uh,
it's a,

1171
01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:04.510
it's basically a German Swedish Russian thing where you just every inch of the

1172
01:08:04.511 --> 01:08:08.740
skin you brushed with a natural bristle brush because your skin's the biggest

1173
01:08:08.741 --> 01:08:10.600
working in the body.
So you really want to keep it.

1174
01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.860
And this dry brush massage really is quite excellent for the skin,

1175
01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.500
stimulates the skin to,
you know,
to new renewed growth.

1176
01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:20.600
It gets rid of dead skin cells.

1177
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:25.550
It keeps it really nice and you're your complexion.
Good.
And I'll scrape,

1178
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:29.960
you know,
I'll,
I'll brush the body and then I,
I take a cold water therapy,

1179
01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:31.580
very big into cold water.

1180
01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:35.540
I used to do dancing with the ice cold water in a bucket,

1181
01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.810
but since I travel,
I pretty much have to use the shower.

1182
01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:40.650
She'd just take a cold shower.
Oh.

1183
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.300
Sometimes they'll do alternating hot and cold shower La.
It's not too bad.

1184
01:08:44.301 --> 01:08:48.760
You know,
Allie,
you know the waters,
it doesn't get too cold.
But sometimes like a,

1185
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:52.100
as a in Portland,
Oregon,
and before that,
Toronto,
the waters,

1186
01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:56.180
the frosting and then there's a,

1187
01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.940
there's a whole towel treatment that I learned also in a towel treatment.
Yeah.

1188
01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:03.140
There's a way that you can briskly use a uh,

1189
01:09:03.141 --> 01:09:07.790
course towel rather than having these soft towels.
You make him sort of like,

1190
01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:11.240
they're almost sandpaper.
And I learned it from this Russian guy,

1191
01:09:11.241 --> 01:09:14.330
this old Russian sauna and master who show me how to do this.

1192
01:09:14.331 --> 01:09:18.410
Very vigorous Tao rubdown.
Of course,
all of the old timers knew about this stuff.

1193
01:09:18.411 --> 01:09:23.200
You know,
a lot of the,
uh,
you know,
uh,
mighty men of old,
you know,

1194
01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:27.290
George's hacking,
Schmidt,
the Russian lion and,
and you know,
uh,

1195
01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:30.120
air where and,
and painful a roller.

1196
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:34.640
A lot of these old health pioneers,
uh,
brag,
McFadden,

1197
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:38.630
Harvey Kellogg,
all these turn of the century guys.

1198
01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:42.900
<v 0>Harvey Kellogg,
the guy from Kellogg's.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you know how crazy that guy,</v>

1199
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:46.290
he's pretty crazy.
Well,
we were talking about him on the podcast yesterday.

1200
01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.060
That guy,
he used to take,
uh,

1201
01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:53.650
he created Kellogg's and created the bland cornflakes.
Yes.

1202
01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:55.140
To keep people from masturbating.

1203
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.690
He bragged about never having sex with his wife.

1204
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:59.820
[inaudible] they were together for 40 years,

1205
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.480
but he would have a daily enema by his handsome male assistant.
Oh,

1206
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:07.170
give them a daily Anima.
Well,
hey,
it's pretty crazy.
Oh yeah.

1207
01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:08.460
He was about as crazy as you can.

1208
01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:10.790
<v 4>Well they they go and use this towel,</v>

1209
01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:14.510
really overly concerned about bowel function.

1210
01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:19.540
Some of these guys and sex and sex is all that weird Victoria and stuff going on

1211
01:10:20.331 --> 01:10:21.164
there.

1212
01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:26.150
The township we had been and then I'll do the five rights of Tibetan Yoga.

1213
01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:30.950
That's how much time does all this tank.
About 30 minutes for the whole thing.

1214
01:10:30.951 --> 01:10:33.920
Just scraping the tongue and cold shower,
the whole deal.

1215
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:38.270
There's the five rights can be done very quickly.
And what is the five rights?
Uh,

1216
01:10:38.271 --> 01:10:42.080
it's a spinning a,
there's like a leg race type thing,

1217
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:46.210
a thing where you lean back a table maker and uh,
uh,

1218
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:50.780
as an exercise called the pump,
like uptown dogs,
it hits every part of the body.

1219
01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:54.920
It stimulates the hormonal system.
Uh,
the,

1220
01:10:54.921 --> 01:10:59.210
the practitioner who's claimed it realigns the shockers where they call it the

1221
01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:03.440
vortex people can,
if they want to Google it,
they can download a free pdf.

1222
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:08.240
It's a book called the eye of the revelation and they can read all about it.

1223
01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.170
It was written by a British army major that happened to be stationed in the

1224
01:11:13.171 --> 01:11:17.520
northern territories of India and DePaul.
And he observed these,
these monks,

1225
01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:22.521
these Tibetan monks and how spry and how young they were and how even these guys

1226
01:11:22.771 --> 01:11:26.910
in their late eighties were able to bound up and down the side of the Himalayan

1227
01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:28.800
mountains somewhat effortlessly.

1228
01:11:28.801 --> 01:11:32.670
And he noticed it took great note of their exercise system,

1229
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:36.530
which was basically these five exercises every morning along with the,
uh,

1230
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:40.110
are you familiar with the prostration exercise where you,
you,

1231
01:11:40.111 --> 01:11:44.460
you sort of like lay down in your stomach and prostate yourself to a prostrate

1232
01:11:44.461 --> 01:11:48.900
yourself,
a prostate,
frustrate yourself to a Buddha as a,

1233
01:11:48.901 --> 01:11:52.890
as a sign of devotion.
It's pretty,
pretty tough little exercise.

1234
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:55.990
So what do you do?
You,
you lie on your stomach and you lift your legs up.

1235
01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:00.960
It's like doing an ab wheel and it's,
it's pretty tough man.
And uh,
you know,

1236
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:04.440
like one of the things that differentiates old from young is your ability to get

1237
01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:09.000
up and down off the four.
You know,
think about it.
Like my mom for example,
I,
I,

1238
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:13.710
I've visited and she's not listening to podcasts,
but I mean poor soul,
you know,

1239
01:12:13.711 --> 01:12:18.711
she's like almost 80 but she was bent over with their back to the side front.

1240
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.360
I don't think she should get up and down off the four.
I don't believe she could.

1241
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:29.160
I think it'd be really hard.
I don't think my dad could either.
You know?

1242
01:12:29.161 --> 01:12:31.290
And he actually ran and lifted weights most of his life,

1243
01:12:31.291 --> 01:12:35.070
but he didn't pay any attention to mobility or flexibility training and he's

1244
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:37.920
still alive and,
yeah.
Yeah.
Do you talk to him about,
I mean,

1245
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:41.100
there's gotta be weird when you've got a son that's this health and fitness

1246
01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:43.990
expert and you don't pay attention to it at all.
Yeah.

1247
01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.170
It's just the way parents are sometimes.
Yeah.

1248
01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.330
I mean they just don't want to listen to their kids,
but,

1249
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:51.150
but I mean that's what it's in my genetic code.

1250
01:12:51.151 --> 01:12:52.620
That's what it's in my genetic trick.

1251
01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:56.850
So getting up and down off the four is really,
really important.

1252
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.670
And a lot of people can't do it.
When I used to run my gym,

1253
01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:04.260
matricide is that personal training studio in there.
Besides my Jujitsu school,

1254
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.080
I would have people come to me that were only in their forties.

1255
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:11.410
That had a hell of a time getting up and down off the forum.
So bill don't,
well,

1256
01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.760
I mean we're,
we're grapplers you and I,
I mean,
we're used to it.

1257
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:17.550
So most of the people we know,
no problem.

1258
01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.660
It shocking Joe when you see what's going on out there.

1259
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:26.190
I may just utterly shocking every time I'd come from a uh,
uh,
you know,

1260
01:13:26.191 --> 01:13:28.950
from being overseas and I come back to the states,

1261
01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:31.490
I'm just blown away with the obesity and,

1262
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.300
and just the poor general health and just how bad people do you think that's

1263
01:13:36.301 --> 01:13:40.110
just the peripheralization of sugar in the Diet?
Corn,
Corn Syrup?
I mean,

1264
01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:42.360
all those things,
you know,
just the whole,

1265
01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.330
just the whole set and dairy lifestyle sending,
you know,

1266
01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.700
majority of people spend most of the time sitting down,

1267
01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:52.050
they think of it this way.
Imagine you work out an hour a day,
which is a lot.

1268
01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:53.730
Most people do not work out an hour a day.

1269
01:13:53.731 --> 01:13:57.870
I think it's estimated that maybe 14% of the population actually works out at

1270
01:13:57.871 --> 01:14:02.760
all and there's claiming mowing the lawn and walking the dog is exercise.
Right?

1271
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:06.690
So really serious.
Hardcore exercises are few and far between.

1272
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:10.560
It seems like millions of people are doing it to you and I because they're the

1273
01:14:10.561 --> 01:14:13.330
people we hang out with.
Right.
But most,
you know,

1274
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:15.670
most of those other people are not doing it.

1275
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.890
So let's say you do work out an hour a day,

1276
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.700
but then you're sitting most of the day,
right?
It's the new smoking sitting.

1277
01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.550
So you're going,
you're sitting in the car to go to war.

1278
01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:25.690
He's sitting at the breakfast table.

1279
01:14:25.691 --> 01:14:28.150
Then you send the car to go to work or the train or the bus.

1280
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:31.360
You sit at the desk all day.
Then you go to lunch,
you sit some more,

1281
01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:35.080
go back to the office,
sit some more,
sit in the car going home.

1282
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.940
Then you sit down and Facebook or you,
you know,
you answer your emails,
whatever.

1283
01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:43.720
Then you sit down,
watch some television,
then you're lying in bed.

1284
01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:48.880
Once your body going to adapt to 23 hours a pretty much sitting on your ass or

1285
01:14:48.881 --> 01:14:53.881
sleeping in bed or moving for sure you're going to adapt to that setting despite

1286
01:14:55.451 --> 01:14:56.590
the fact that you're working out.

1287
01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:01.270
If not enough people aren't moving enough and any movement patterns that you

1288
01:15:01.271 --> 01:15:06.190
don't use on a regular basis,
you quickly lose.
And a lot of people,

1289
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:09.700
they just never,
you know,
they use exercise machines and so forth.

1290
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:12.940
Well even if they use barbells or whatever cat,
you know,

1291
01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:16.060
they're not getting up and down off the form unless they're doing the turkeys

1292
01:15:16.061 --> 01:15:16.894
get up or something.

1293
01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.110
That's one reason why I think it's such a fantastic exercise.
And by the way,

1294
01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:23.060
<v 0>well unlike Turkish getups as well,
for Jujitsu,</v>

1295
01:15:23.061 --> 01:15:24.500
I think it's one of the best exercises.

1296
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:29.510
What's his best all around core strength and for that every important ability to

1297
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.990
manipulate a body that's on top of you.
You know,
if you can,
you know,

1298
01:15:33.991 --> 01:15:37.340
you can get a kettle bell and you can press that thing and then you could stand,

1299
01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.010
stand up.
I'll holding that kettle bell that that's,
uh,

1300
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:45.030
that goes a long way to be able to get up from the bottom when someone's on top

1301
01:15:45.711 --> 01:15:46.020
of you.

1302
01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.910
<v 4>But even just for the general population,</v>

1303
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.600
I mean just the ability to get up and down off the floor,

1304
01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:56.730
all of those movement patterns that you need to sit up in the elbow on the hand,

1305
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.970
you know,
and it's kind of like standing up in base,
Eh,
you know,
like in,

1306
01:15:59.971 --> 01:16:04.350
in Jujitsu and then transferring the weight and I mean all those things are

1307
01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:06.600
appropriate receptive movements and so forth.

1308
01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:10.740
And I think it's really one to,
as things you can do,

1309
01:16:10.770 --> 01:16:15.330
but just getting up and down even with your body weight using like this.
Um,

1310
01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:19.940
prostration exercise is fantastic.
It's really good stuff.

1311
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:21.250
<v 0>What do you think about,
um,</v>

1312
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:26.340
if you ever seen Steve Cotter has this exercise that I got from him?
Were you?

1313
01:16:26.341 --> 01:16:29.610
Um,
you take two kettle bells.
You lie on your back,
like a,

1314
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:30.463
like you're doing a sit up,

1315
01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:34.140
you press them and then you sit up with the kettle bells.

1316
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:37.590
You sit up with them pressed and you do a sit up essentially,

1317
01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.090
and then you drop back down and then you do it all with your arms fully
extended.

1318
01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:44.940
You know,
it's I think calls it a power sit up or something like that.

1319
01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:46.500
That's a hell of a hell yes.

1320
01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:50.100
<v 4>Yeah.
Some people call him brushing and set ups and it just crush it.
Right,
right.</v>

1321
01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:53.640
Especially with kettle bells.
Right.
Especially with cannabis.
But yeah,

1322
01:16:53.641 --> 01:16:56.780
I mean it's a hell of a movement.
I mean for sure.
Nothing wrong with that.

1323
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:57.870
Then as well I like,

1324
01:16:58.270 --> 01:17:03.270
I mean obviously you wouldn't take a deep condition businessman and start out

1325
01:17:03.361 --> 01:17:04.230
with a movement like that.

1326
01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.870
<v 0>That's a good term,
deconditioned businessman.
I have a friend who's a great guy,</v>

1327
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:10.280
but I went to hug him the other day

1328
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.400
<v 3>and you know,
I hugged him,
I put my hand on his back and I was like,</v>

1329
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:16.010
I was thinking of,
I didn't say anything,
but I was thinking to myself like,

1330
01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.540
how does it even support your spine?
And if there's nothing on your back,

1331
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:24.260
like you grab a grappler or you go hug them and you feel their back,

1332
01:17:24.261 --> 01:17:27.150
you feel muscles,
you feel like you can feel the lats and they're back.

1333
01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.850
Just spinning muscles sticking out there.

1334
01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:33.200
And it was just this gooey like thing like go man,

1335
01:17:33.201 --> 01:17:36.770
keeps his spine just barely hanging on.

1336
01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.670
And is it any wonder that people were in pain or that,
you know,

1337
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:45.470
these pharmaceutical companies are just pumping out painkillers,
right?
Overlap.

1338
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:47.690
Yeah.
Unfortunately,
you know,

1339
01:17:47.691 --> 01:17:51.890
it's just masking the symptoms so people don't have an incentive then to get in

1340
01:17:51.891 --> 01:17:55.380
there and do something about it.
They just covered up with the,
you know,

1341
01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:58.000
but the painkillers,
you know,
I've been,
um,

1342
01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:03.070
pretty shocked at how much I'm decompression or relieves a lot of,
uh,

1343
01:18:03.071 --> 01:18:05.990
a lot of pain in the back and about,
uh,
how much,
uh,

1344
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:09.530
I take one of these harnesses and I attached to the top of a door and a strap my

1345
01:18:09.531 --> 01:18:13.690
neck in it.
And,
uh,
like after I trained especially I like to do that and I just,

1346
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:17.750
it sort of just like pulls on your head and you could pull the string tick,
tick,

1347
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:20.630
tick and it pulls you up and then it puts even more tension.

1348
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.700
I like to give it like a lot of weight.

1349
01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:25.610
I like to put a lot of weight on it and when it's done it's like Ah,

1350
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.450
I feel there's like Russia blood through my neck and it's amazing how good it

1351
01:18:29.451 --> 01:18:33.200
feels like as long as you make sure that sucker is tied down good to the the

1352
01:18:33.201 --> 01:18:33.790
door.

1353
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:38.060
Cause one time it wasn't and it bounced off and clock me on the fucking head.

1354
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:40.580
And I had a cut on my head for like a couple of weeks.

1355
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:43.540
It was right when I was doing my Scifi thing too.
So I was doing all these uh,

1356
01:18:43.570 --> 01:18:47.720
pressed junk or to the big fucking scar on my head.
But um,

1357
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:51.290
when it's,
when it's done correctly,
it's,
it's locked into place.

1358
01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:55.030
It's a real good feeling like to stretch.
I used

1359
01:18:55.050 --> 01:18:55.761
<v 4>inversion boots,</v>

1360
01:18:55.761 --> 01:19:00.230
I loved the inversion boots and there was a time when I actually injured myself.

1361
01:19:00.231 --> 01:19:01.940
I was actually trying to do the AB wheel,

1362
01:19:01.941 --> 01:19:06.170
like Jackie Chan's down from the feet and that was pretty good at it.
But I just,

1363
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:07.610
what's tracking chance?
Oh,

1364
01:19:07.611 --> 01:19:11.330
there was a movie one time with Jackie Chan using an abdominal whale and he

1365
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:14.420
looks like an inchworm.
He's just going like boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.

1366
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.920
It was just amazing.

1367
01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:20.480
And I had developed the ability to go from the toes completely out and come
back.

1368
01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.950
But I went to deep and fatigue and a kink,

1369
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:26.180
kinked my back and get myself a horrible case of Sciatica.

1370
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:30.700
I actually rotated vertebrae,
subluxation rotation.
And uh,

1371
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.580
what spawned your thesis?

1372
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:37.790
I went to my Ra for is the first time I ever heard the word surgery coming out

1373
01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:42.440
of her mouth because she was pretty anti surgery and she said,

1374
01:19:42.441 --> 01:19:44.510
I don't know Steve,
you really did it to yourself.
This title,

1375
01:19:44.511 --> 01:19:46.010
I don't whether I can help you.

1376
01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:51.260
And in the meantime I had this burning sensation down my leg into my knee and my

1377
01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:56.300
big toe just wouldn't stop burning with this chronic aching,

1378
01:19:56.330 --> 01:20:00.560
burning sensation that was just agonizing.
And what is that?
Is that nerves?
Yeah,

1379
01:20:00.561 --> 01:20:04.190
the nerve is pinched off.
So over time I went,

1380
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:07.800
I went to a acupuncture guy to relieve some of the pain.

1381
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.450
It had instant relief,

1382
01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:14.630
but then it would come back and over time she kept working this vertebrae back

1383
01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:20.010
into place with their fingers.
And after about eight weeks,
boom,
it went away.

1384
01:20:20.011 --> 01:20:22.350
Like nothing ever happened.
It just disappeared.

1385
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.520
But after that I was using that.
Um,

1386
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:28.950
I was also sitting on this chair called a back chair.
It may be,

1387
01:20:28.951 --> 01:20:32.160
could bring it up,
but it holds you around the ribs,

1388
01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:36.630
like a clamp and you're sitting on a sling and then you release the sling and

1389
01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:40.290
your back goes into traction and you're being held up underneath your armpits.

1390
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:42.120
So relieving man.

1391
01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:45.700
<v 3>So you're being held under your armpits,
but like a big clamp,</v>

1392
01:20:45.701 --> 01:20:46.780
it kind of clamps onto you.

1393
01:20:46.781 --> 01:20:51.430
And so it's sort of like your body's just kind of hang in there and traction and

1394
01:20:51.431 --> 01:20:54.670
decompressing like a dip almost kind of like it.

1395
01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:57.340
<v 4>Yep.
Except ears.
No stress in your upper body.</v>

1396
01:20:57.341 --> 01:21:01.210
You're just sitting like I am in this chair right now and this back chair was

1397
01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.360
fantastic.
So between acupuncture,

1398
01:21:04.630 --> 01:21:08.710
the back chair and the Rolfing,
she got me out of trouble.

1399
01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:10.840
And needless to say,

1400
01:21:10.841 --> 01:21:14.910
I wasn't too keen about the APP we owe anymore.

1401
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:19.690
Not at least from the feet.
I was a lot more conservative.
Hanging leg raises.

1402
01:21:19.691 --> 01:21:20.710
It's the same damn move.

1403
01:21:20.711 --> 01:21:25.690
And except you're in suspension and your bag is in traction.
Much safer exercise.

1404
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.880
Right.

1405
01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:30.010
<v 3>So what do you were talking about the kind that you put your feet in the wheel.</v>

1406
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:34.400
I was holding on like one of those little cheapy like $10.

1407
01:21:34.401 --> 01:21:36.350
Think what he's doing right here.
Exactly.

1408
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:39.650
Now what I was actually doing it just like that,

1409
01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:43.280
but I just went too deep into fatigue and kicked my lower back.

1410
01:21:43.281 --> 01:21:46.610
And so you were just too tired.
I was too tired.
I've lost my form a little bit.

1411
01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:48.230
I was going too hard.

1412
01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.070
That is the main issue that we talked about before.

1413
01:21:52.071 --> 01:21:53.690
The last time you hear about crossfit,

1414
01:21:53.691 --> 01:21:57.830
I finally brought myself to watch the video of that guy getting paralyzed.

1415
01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:59.600
Oh my God.
And horrible.

1416
01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:03.800
You know what's really telling about that video is not just we're talking about

1417
01:22:03.801 --> 01:22:07.310
is there was a crossfit competition and there was a guy who was a crossfit

1418
01:22:07.311 --> 01:22:11.780
instructor that was doing a clean,
was it a clean press?

1419
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:15.560
What was it?
Was it,
what was the exercise?
I don't know.
Anyway,

1420
01:22:15.561 --> 01:22:19.340
he had the bar over his head lost control of it and it fell on the back of his

1421
01:22:19.341 --> 01:22:22.940
neck.
Yeah,
no,
I hadn't actually seen it.
Was it a thruster or,
I'm not.

1422
01:22:22.941 --> 01:22:23.930
I don't remember what it was,

1423
01:22:23.931 --> 01:22:28.931
but my point is he was in competition with another guy who his body failed on

1424
01:22:29.571 --> 01:22:34.520
him right before this guy,
like the guy next to him in the middle of it.

1425
01:22:34.521 --> 01:22:39.170
His legs just gave out and he dropped the bar and so he drops his bar and it

1426
01:22:39.171 --> 01:22:40.004
hits him on the neck.

1427
01:22:40.190 --> 01:22:44.810
So it's like one guy drops his bar and then the next guy drops his by right next

1428
01:22:44.811 --> 01:22:47.900
to him.
It's just the next guy was a catastrophic injury.
Catastrophic.

1429
01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:51.770
Both guys were so fatigued,
they shouldn't have been doing it in the first place.

1430
01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.890
They shouldn't have been lifting that way.
No Way,
man.

1431
01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:58.700
Not a whole body like that rubber,
you know,
it's like we said last time,
the,

1432
01:22:58.701 --> 01:23:01.700
the,
the risk to benefit ratio,
you know,

1433
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:05.980
are the risk worth it.
You've seen the video.
I haven't

1434
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.220
<v 0>actually seen it.
Let's watch it because I,
I,
well why are you bringing that up?</v>

1435
01:23:09.221 --> 01:23:11.830
I'm going to take a quick,
okay.
Please do.
Please do it.
Yeah,
go ahead.

1436
01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:16.210
Just doing a snatch.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's so horrible to see.

1437
01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:21.160
And by the way,
I'm not down against exercise,
you know,

1438
01:23:21.161 --> 01:23:23.710
in any other,
anybody else's methods.
And I know the people,

1439
01:23:23.711 --> 01:23:27.330
some people like crossfit and they get a great deal of,
uh,

1440
01:23:27.331 --> 01:23:30.520
of pleasure out of that kind of exercise and pushing themselves and all that

1441
01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:35.410
stuff.
And I understand it.
I get it.
Um,
but this is hard to watch,

1442
01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:40.150
man.
Watch this guy.
See,
oh Jesus.
Well this is,

1443
01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:44.380
this is,
um,
this is the guy that got injured.
The guy to the right of him,

1444
01:23:44.381 --> 01:23:47.170
the right on the right of the screen.
He,
uh,

1445
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.710
he heard himself right before this.
See,

1446
01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.770
he's got this and then it just drops and hits is,
oh,

1447
01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:58.090
but his body gave out first and then it hit his back on the way down.

1448
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:59.560
It's so awful,
man.

1449
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:03.760
The guy next to him to his left,

1450
01:24:04.450 --> 01:24:07.620
if there's another video where you could see,
um,

1451
01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:10.480
a few moments before his body gives out,

1452
01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:13.870
the God who has left his body gives out too,
just in a different way.

1453
01:24:13.871 --> 01:24:16.600
His legs just keep,
yeah,
that guy there.
See,
he'd already,

1454
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:20.470
his body had already given out and his legs went rubber on them.

1455
01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:26.380
Exercise is awesome.
It's really awesome.
It's great.
It's great for your body,

1456
01:24:26.381 --> 01:24:27.550
but God damn,
man,

1457
01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:32.080
you gotta be real careful when you're throwing real heavyweights over your head

1458
01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.500
and you're completely,
totally exhausted.
I just,
um,

1459
01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.420
I just don't think it's the right way to do it.

1460
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:42.870
And listening to Steve Talk about the importance of when you're doing these

1461
01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:46.840
Olympic movements like Olympic power lifting movements,

1462
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:50.950
they're supposed to be done like rear very small reps like one and two and three

1463
01:24:50.951 --> 01:24:53.020
reps.
These are like explosive exercises.

1464
01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:57.460
They're supposed to be done just for just,
just for developing strength.

1465
01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:00.430
I don't think you're supposed to do them at high repetition.

1466
01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:04.210
I know some people get away with it.
I know some people do it,
but God damn,

1467
01:25:04.211 --> 01:25:09.010
it just doesn't seem to be the right way to go.
Take care of your meat wagon.

1468
01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:12.070
Ladies and gentlemen.
The problem I have with crossfit,

1469
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.310
most of it is the same problem that I have with people who are vegans.

1470
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:19.120
They cannot shut the fuck up about being involved in crossfit.

1471
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:22.780
They would just ear beat you to death about crossfit.

1472
01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:28.120
But in all fairness,
with all objective thinking and introspective thought,

1473
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:32.380
uh,
when I first started doing Jujitsu,
I couldn't shut the fuck up about Jujitsu.

1474
01:25:32.381 --> 01:25:36.220
So maybe it might just be something that you know when people are excited about

1475
01:25:36.221 --> 01:25:39.220
something.
By the way,
Jamie,
you were wrong.
The over under,

1476
01:25:39.221 --> 01:25:43.090
you said 35 minutes or an hour and a half.
I'll do that.
I'm feeling great.

1477
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.470
This is fine.
You know what's fucking a little bit painful is my shins.

1478
01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:51.490
It's weird to have your shins press down.
Um,

1479
01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:55.150
maybe a home doing it wrong,
but uh,
my back feels great.

1480
01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:57.250
There's definitely feels better than,
uh,

1481
01:25:57.310 --> 01:26:00.010
I usually feel when I'm leaning up against the back of the chair.

1482
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:04.100
I'm usually trying to like keep my posture straight,
but I always fail.

1483
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:09.380
<v 3>But with this thing,
look at me dude.
Fucking locked down.
Sorry.</v>

1484
01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:14.280
Complete straight line kid.
That's what you're supposed to be.
Just like that.

1485
01:26:14.281 --> 01:26:15.290
And that's how he's supposed to set.

1486
01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.770
How many people actually have one of these fucking things in their office
though?

1487
01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.480
No.
The other thing they tell you,
you should stand,
stand at your desk.

1488
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:26.720
That's like you ever go to a concert and you have to fucking stand standing

1489
01:26:26.721 --> 01:26:27.554
sucks.

1490
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.030
It's not fun to stand standing at your desk like it would be so distracting.

1491
01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.650
That's the same thing.
Oh,
there's a different one.
It's the opposite.
What is that?

1492
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:40.470
Oh,
it's leaning a kneeling chair review,
Huh?
Yeah.

1493
01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:43.340
It's a different kind of where she's sitting on it wrong.
Yeah.

1494
01:26:43.341 --> 01:26:44.450
That bitch doesn't know what she's doing.

1495
01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:48.270
Maybe she turned it around or something like that.
Although it,

1496
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:51.450
notice her spine is straight though.
Somehow it's not like hump,

1497
01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:53.930
I like that they caught focuses or anything.

1498
01:26:53.931 --> 01:26:58.490
So I mean it's not as bad as maybe slouching down,
you know?
Right.
So if it,

1499
01:26:58.491 --> 01:27:01.100
her chair was flat instead of like leaned forward.

1500
01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:06.950
Cause I mean it is possible to like lean in this manner and still keep your

1501
01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:09.380
spine straight if you have to.
You've got to talk into the microphone,

1502
01:27:09.381 --> 01:27:13.160
otherwise folks aren't gonna hear what the hell yeah.
Lean forward.

1503
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:14.010
<v 4>Yeah.
Eh,</v>

1504
01:27:14.010 --> 01:27:17.640
but the worst thing is to not your back do this and you're right foot forward.

1505
01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:21.630
And that's what causes that permanent a hump in the upper back day.

1506
01:27:21.631 --> 01:27:25.590
They call it a kyphosis or dowager's hump or whatever.
And uh,

1507
01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.290
so that leaning forward that she was doing it and that chair probably isn't

1508
01:27:31.291 --> 01:27:35.430
nearly as bad as,
oh well I was going on there.

1509
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:40.320
I don't know,
but look at that head.
What does that can't be good.

1510
01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:44.190
That's not good.
That's called forward head.
Okay.
So get that.

1511
01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:48.060
That's not good.
The way she looked,
kind of like this.
You know,

1512
01:27:48.061 --> 01:27:51.600
it's real interesting because,
uh,
I worked with a high powered lawyer one time,

1513
01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:54.360
remember,
I don't know whether you remember this,
but a,

1514
01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:59.400
remember the south Philly Gang?
Uh,
the Nicky Scarfo a mobster,

1515
01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:04.050
I worked out the guy that put him in jail.
Whoa.
Yeah.
He was one of my clients.

1516
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:07.770
My clocks fucking stress.
Uh,
that guy was under stress.

1517
01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:12.270
He was working like these ridiculously long hours.
I mean,
like 14,
15 hours.

1518
01:28:12.271 --> 01:28:15.450
He barely had time to train.
So we came up with a plan and you know,

1519
01:28:15.451 --> 01:28:16.890
we had talked about a stability ball.

1520
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:22.140
So Mike swapped out his desk chair for Stability Ball and we've got them a

1521
01:28:22.141 --> 01:28:25.500
pedometer.
So he was trying to average like 10,000 steps a day.

1522
01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:30.510
And he was like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator.

1523
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:34.800
Uh,
he would park his car as far away as he could just to force himself to walk

1524
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:36.720
extra paces.
Just to go places.

1525
01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:40.080
He would walk during lunch and then eat at his desk.

1526
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:44.520
But he also put it in like one of those standup desk and would pace during phone

1527
01:28:44.521 --> 01:28:49.521
calls and or pace back and forth while we sorted and swapping out his papers and

1528
01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.950
this and that.
Dick doing dictation to a secretary.

1529
01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:58.380
He ended up losing like 14 pounds during that time.
And you know,
he had,

1530
01:28:58.410 --> 01:29:02.550
he had the extra padding on his body and then would come to me and we would do

1531
01:29:02.551 --> 01:29:06.750
two 20 minute workouts a week just to keep his basic strength levels up.

1532
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:09.870
And he was very successful and um,
yeah,

1533
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:13.380
he prosecuted a little Nicky Scarfo put his ass in jail.

1534
01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.750
<v 0>I would just think that the stress of putting away murderers,</v>

1535
01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.910
just the idea that you're the guy who's processing,
especially the mob.

1536
01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.220
Yeah,
that's a real murderer.

1537
01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:27.730
That's a real murder and a murder that's connected to a bunch of other murders

1538
01:29:27.731 --> 01:29:32.290
that,
you know,
have a vested interest in keeping him out of jail.
Did he get,

1539
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:35.080
I mean,
he had to be like threatened all the time.
Right.

1540
01:29:35.730 --> 01:29:39.030
<v 4>You know,
it never came up.
I mean he never talked about that aspect of it.</v>

1541
01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:40.210
But yeah,

1542
01:29:40.211 --> 01:29:43.820
I you would think that there would definitely be like some type of threat there.

1543
01:29:43.821 --> 01:29:44.640
Yeah.
Yeah.

1544
01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:49.640
I mean if you're the guy that's putting a major mob figure in behind bars,

1545
01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.380
you would have to be a little,

1546
01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:56.190
<v 0>little leery.
You know what's shocking to me?
Um,</v>

1547
01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:00.220
I don't know what if different police departments have different standards that

1548
01:30:00.221 --> 01:30:03.610
they have for a physical fitness or for self defense.

1549
01:30:03.611 --> 01:30:05.470
But when training,

1550
01:30:05.471 --> 01:30:09.610
when a guy would come in and they tell me that he's a police officer and he

1551
01:30:09.611 --> 01:30:13.090
literally can't defend himself at all,
it is shocking.
Well,
you know,

1552
01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:13.850
so common though

1553
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:14.690
<v 4>because of the,</v>

1554
01:30:14.691 --> 01:30:18.410
this whole equal rights and all this stuff and I'm not against equal rights,

1555
01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:22.970
but they really dumb some of the standards down in some of the police forces to

1556
01:30:22.971 --> 01:30:24.500
make room for,
for women.

1557
01:30:25.130 --> 01:30:29.420
And there was these little tiny women on the Philadelphia police force.

1558
01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:30.621
I swear to God,

1559
01:30:30.621 --> 01:30:35.150
any 12 or 13 year old kid could just take their gun and beat him up.
I,

1560
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:36.230
it just scared the,

1561
01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:40.310
the only thing they could do and his situation where someone would be resist

1562
01:30:40.311 --> 01:30:45.170
arrest would be lethal force.
What other avenue where they have,

1563
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:48.680
I mean maybe pepper spray or macers you know,
a taser,

1564
01:30:48.681 --> 01:30:51.820
but I mean this is back in the day I,

1565
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:56.870
we did a lot of work with the police and law enforcement with Jujitsu and uh,

1566
01:30:57.450 --> 01:31:02.360
I was utterly shocked sometimes when some of these people would come in the uh,

1567
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:05.330
the national park service guards,
the,
you know,

1568
01:31:05.331 --> 01:31:09.530
the guys that wear the little mounting hats that are hard and all the national

1569
01:31:09.531 --> 01:31:10.730
monuments and so forth.

1570
01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:15.680
How those guys were licensed to carry guns sometimes was just mind blowing.

1571
01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.080
It's like,
wow,
dude,

1572
01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.950
you were so overweight and so obese and so immobile,
you know,

1573
01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:27.970
how are you going to put somebody under arrest when you can just barely even

1574
01:31:28.341 --> 01:31:32.990
mobilize yourself?
You know,
it's,
it's shocking what happens sometimes.

1575
01:31:32.991 --> 01:31:33.501
And you know,

1576
01:31:33.501 --> 01:31:36.440
a lot of the cops that come to my seminars and so forth though are grey.

1577
01:31:36.650 --> 01:31:40.700
You know,
most of the guys that go to my seminars are pretty motivated,
right.

1578
01:31:40.701 --> 01:31:44.780
To stay in shape,
but you know,
not,
not so with their comrades,
it's,
yeah,

1579
01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:48.570
<v 0>no,
I've met a lot of comps through martial arts,
you know,
and uh,</v>

1580
01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:52.410
it's one of the reasons why I have a good opinion of cops is because I know so

1581
01:31:52.411 --> 01:31:54.960
many of them that are good people,
great people,
man.

1582
01:31:54.961 --> 01:31:57.210
There's a lot of folks out there that,
you know,

1583
01:31:57.690 --> 01:32:00.130
really shouldn't be doing that job.
They can't handle that stress.

1584
01:32:00.131 --> 01:32:04.300
Or even if they could handle that look,
stress levels vary day to day.

1585
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:07.150
Who knows what's going on in people's personal lives and how that manifests

1586
01:32:07.151 --> 01:32:09.160
itself in a job like being a police officer.

1587
01:32:09.161 --> 01:32:13.460
But if you're a fat fuck on top of that,
Jesus Christ,
and I mean,

1588
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:17.590
I can't tell you how many times I've seen guys come to the gym and they've never

1589
01:32:17.591 --> 01:32:20.170
had any training before and there were already a police officer and you're like,

1590
01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:23.830
what did,
what would you do if somebody just tackled you?
Like,

1591
01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:27.400
what would you do if you didn't have your hand on your gun at the time?

1592
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:31.530
And even then if a guy smacks it and he goes flying and he's on turn as much

1593
01:32:31.531 --> 01:32:33.850
good,
you're a dead man.
Like you don't have any,

1594
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:38.170
I would think that that would be like a writer who doesn't know how to spell or

1595
01:32:38.171 --> 01:32:40.750
it doesn't know how to type or doesn't literally doesn't know how to write

1596
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:41.830
English language.

1597
01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:45.940
Like to be a police officer and not be physically fit or not have any knowledge

1598
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:48.760
whatsoever of self defense.
It seems insane.

1599
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.360
<v 4>It is insane.
There's a very famous training video that they show the,</v>

1600
01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:56.300
I think it was in Texas where there was a pretty big guy,

1601
01:32:56.301 --> 01:32:58.450
he's probably about two 50 huge cop,

1602
01:32:58.451 --> 01:33:03.100
but obviously very fat and out of shape and these two little guys that tackle

1603
01:33:03.101 --> 01:33:04.780
him down and take his gun and shoot him.

1604
01:33:05.150 --> 01:33:08.530
It's used as a training video for you know,
new recruits and so forth.

1605
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:12.850
And boy that wouldn't give you the incentive to like at least learn some basic

1606
01:33:12.851 --> 01:33:16.120
self defense on top of whatever they show in the police academies and so forth.

1607
01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:21.100
You know,
I mean,
it's pretty crazy,
but you know,
those guys,

1608
01:33:21.101 --> 01:33:23.860
they do have a hell of a hard job.
But you know,
not,

1609
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.900
you don't meet Nice people when you're a cop,

1610
01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:29.950
you're meeting the worst elements of society every single day.

1611
01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:34.410
People just lying to your face.
No wonder they,
you know,

1612
01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:35.830
develop high stress levels,

1613
01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:40.270
having people lying to you and then having to determine are they telling the

1614
01:33:40.271 --> 01:33:42.580
truth or are they lying?
And you know,

1615
01:33:42.581 --> 01:33:45.160
criminals are pretty devious and they're pretty good alliance.

1616
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:48.170
<v 0>Well,
no,
that even most folks that aren't criminals,</v>

1617
01:33:48.171 --> 01:33:51.650
if you get caught doing something that's a crime,
they're going to lie.

1618
01:33:52.130 --> 01:33:56.270
And so the cops are just constantly dealing with people at their worst,

1619
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:59.840
<v 4>at their worst element,
you know?
So,
yeah,
I mean,</v>

1620
01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:04.490
that would definitely have an impact on the way you think and your stress
levels.

1621
01:34:04.491 --> 01:34:08.930
And of course,
we all know that food is a great bomb.
A,
you know,

1622
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:12.800
[inaudible] it's soothing.
It starts when you're a little kid,
you know,

1623
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:14.490
with your,

1624
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:18.700
your dessert or your little treat or in a rewarding kids with the [inaudible].

1625
01:34:18.710 --> 01:34:19.380
I hope you don't don't

1626
01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:23.010
<v 0>do that to your kids.
But anyway,
don't use food as a reward.
No,</v>

1627
01:34:23.011 --> 01:34:26.850
but I don't demonize food either.
No,
of course not.
You know,
I don't,

1628
01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:31.500
I give my kids healthy food most of the time,
but I also say,

1629
01:34:31.501 --> 01:34:33.840
who wants to get ice cream?
Well,
let's do it.
Yeah,
of course.

1630
01:34:33.841 --> 01:34:37.020
Nothing wrong with that too.
I mean,
sugar's not good ever.

1631
01:34:37.021 --> 01:34:40.560
And I tell them that like,
this is not good for you,
but it tastes delicious.

1632
01:34:40.710 --> 01:34:42.710
So we limited.
I try to talk to them like,

1633
01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:45.000
I mean I have a six year old and a four year old,

1634
01:34:45.001 --> 01:34:48.600
so I tried to talk to them like they're adults and then when they,

1635
01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:50.850
what does that mean?
Then I explain it.
You know,

1636
01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:52.260
I treat them like they're children,

1637
01:34:52.261 --> 01:34:55.500
obviously with a lot of love and affection and a lot of patients,

1638
01:34:55.530 --> 01:34:58.700
but I try to talk to in a,
in an advanced way.

1639
01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.970
I don't treat them like they're dummies.
Like I explained to them,
I said,

1640
01:35:01.971 --> 01:35:05.900
you know,
food is exactly what your body is built of your body.

1641
01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:09.680
Whatever you take in,
that's all that your body has to build new cells.

1642
01:35:09.681 --> 01:35:12.050
That's all it has.
It doesn't have any extra stuff.

1643
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.240
It only has what you give in as far as food.

1644
01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:16.430
So it's important to give your body vitamins.

1645
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.660
It's important to give your body all sorts of things like protein and water.

1646
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:24.290
And then,
but I also say,
but it's important to fuck off every now and then.

1647
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:29.270
I don't say fuck off.
My wife wasn't around.
She gets upset at the bad word.

1648
01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:31.600
She doesn't want to learn the bad words early.
But uh,

1649
01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:33.590
I see sooner or later for sure.

1650
01:35:33.591 --> 01:35:36.710
I have a little mouth party with some sugar every now and then,
you know,

1651
01:35:36.711 --> 01:35:40.300
but I don't want it to be a forbidden.
Yeah,
well yeah,
once you forget

1652
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:43.520
<v 4>bid something,
it,
it makes it even more desirable.</v>

1653
01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:47.090
And I had friends that had kids and they did not,
you know,

1654
01:35:47.091 --> 01:35:50.060
they weren't allowed to have any kind of treats or any of that kind of stuff.

1655
01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.880
Guess what they do as soon as it goes to a friend's house,

1656
01:35:52.881 --> 01:35:56.840
freak out and then break out of that stuff.
Man,
it's so funny.

1657
01:35:56.841 --> 01:35:59.720
I had this one lady that was like this really,

1658
01:35:59.721 --> 01:36:02.450
really snippy eater and you know,

1659
01:36:02.451 --> 01:36:07.370
everything was fresh and organic and she was so proud of her son and his diet

1660
01:36:07.371 --> 01:36:11.330
that she had them on.
Man.
Every time I saw that kid,
he was with a friend,

1661
01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:13.790
but they would sneak bags of candy and stuff.

1662
01:36:15.390 --> 01:36:19.230
<v 0>So crazy.
It really true.
So crazy.
How many people do that too?</v>

1663
01:36:19.231 --> 01:36:20.780
It's so crazy how many people just,

1664
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.310
they do that to their kids and they suppress them.

1665
01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.420
I have a friend whose kid is overweight and he's always like on her,

1666
01:36:27.421 --> 01:36:29.460
like telling her,
don't eat this,
don't eat that.

1667
01:36:29.461 --> 01:36:32.970
And he'll do it publicly in front of people and shame the kid and it's a

1668
01:36:32.971 --> 01:36:36.630
terrible way to deal it,
to do it.
And then when no one's around,

1669
01:36:36.631 --> 01:36:39.180
like she was at a party the other day and I watched her just eating,

1670
01:36:39.570 --> 01:36:42.540
eating cupcakes and just looking around and eating like,
like rant.

1671
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:44.970
Just frantically stuffing them in her face.

1672
01:36:44.971 --> 01:36:47.640
He's going to create a bulemia or okay.

1673
01:36:47.641 --> 01:36:52.590
A real problem or someone that has a serious eating disorder.
So yeah.
Shame,

1674
01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:57.600
shame never works,
man.
Yeah.
It's terrible.
It's just a bad thing to do to a kid.

1675
01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.740
It's just,
you know,
children,
they're developing.

1676
01:37:01.741 --> 01:37:06.600
And that's the thing that people don't understand.
Like to,
to raise a kid.
It's,

1677
01:37:06.930 --> 01:37:10.290
you can't just go on your instincts.
He can't like say,
Oh,

1678
01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:12.600
you need to toughen them up and tell him what to do and know you're going to

1679
01:37:12.601 --> 01:37:15.510
develop all sorts of weird,
crazy things in their head.

1680
01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:19.100
You're going to develop blocks and they're going to have these mental blocks.

1681
01:37:19.101 --> 01:37:21.330
They're going to have to work out in therapy for the rest of their life.

1682
01:37:21.331 --> 01:37:23.160
If you fuck with her head too much when they're little.

1683
01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.930
<v 4>Well,
I mean,
think about it.
Most of us didn't have that greater role model.
Yeah.</v>

1684
01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:31.670
You know,
and there's,
there's no directions that come with raising a kid.
Exactly.

1685
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:36.640
And it makes me wonder why so many people think that they are good,
uh,

1686
01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:39.320
or even qualified to be parents.
I mean,

1687
01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:41.480
nowadays with the world being the way it is,

1688
01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:45.620
I would be really reluctant to want to bring another soul into this world.

1689
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:47.870
And I don't know.

1690
01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:53.200
I just don't feel like most people are really that qualified to be be parents.

1691
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:55.860
They should really think about why are they doing this?

1692
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.790
It seems like kids are almost an accessory,
you know,

1693
01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:02.150
something that you show off or as an accessory or,

1694
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:06.600
or they just bring him in because it's the thing to do or whatever,
you know?

1695
01:38:06.730 --> 01:38:10.120
<v 0>It gives them meaning.
It gives our lives meaning I think for a lot of folks,</v>

1696
01:38:10.330 --> 01:38:13.530
they feel like if they don't have children that they're there somehow or another

1697
01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:16.030
not contributing.
And I have,

1698
01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:21.070
I faced that before I had children.
People would say to me like,
Oh,

1699
01:38:21.071 --> 01:38:21.341
you know,

1700
01:38:21.341 --> 01:38:23.500
one day you're going to have to grow up and you're going to have to have kids.

1701
01:38:23.501 --> 01:38:26.740
Right now you're living like Peter Pan.
Let me tell you something.
You know,

1702
01:38:26.741 --> 01:38:28.950
that ain't the way to live.
And,
and they,

1703
01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:32.410
they make it like there's some nobility and to having children.

1704
01:38:32.590 --> 01:38:35.050
I couldn't disagree with that more.

1705
01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:40.200
I think if you want to have a life where you contribute a life where you're a

1706
01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.740
person who is a,
is a beneficial person to society,

1707
01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:49.810
it's a real simple,
have good friends,
do something you love doing,

1708
01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:52.990
inspire others,
you know,
be nice to folks.
That's it.

1709
01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:56.020
That's all you really have to do.
You don't have to have kids like,

1710
01:38:56.021 --> 01:38:58.720
and if you have kids and you fuck up and you have shitty kids,

1711
01:38:58.930 --> 01:39:01.840
you've done the opposite.
Now you've created problems.

1712
01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:06.130
Like I had a friend who used to always rag on people for a,
you know,

1713
01:39:06.131 --> 01:39:07.000
like that hadn't,

1714
01:39:07.330 --> 01:39:11.770
hadn't reproduced but he was a degenerate and is one of his kids smoked crack.

1715
01:39:11.771 --> 01:39:13.390
The other kid was in jail.
I mean,

1716
01:39:13.391 --> 01:39:16.090
and he was like bragging about having kids like you fucking idiot.

1717
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:19.840
You've created disasters when your kids come into the room.
I leave

1718
01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:23.530
<v 4>created more of a problem for sa is this idea that not,
not in his eyes,</v>

1719
01:39:23.710 --> 01:39:27.070
but you know it's,
yeah,
it is funny.
There is a pressure on people.

1720
01:39:27.150 --> 01:39:30.900
<v 0>It's too bad.
It's,
it's unnecessary pressure.
You know?
And by the way,</v>

1721
01:39:30.901 --> 01:39:33.780
you could always just work out,
you know,
all that.

1722
01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.460
You could go in and volunteer your time.
A youth center.

1723
01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:41.640
<v 4>Plenty of people.
Kids rather have,
yeah,
exactly.</v>

1724
01:39:41.641 --> 01:39:46.290
They don't have good mentors or parents or whatever,
fathers,
kids and so forth.

1725
01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:50.760
The thing that really bugs me and you see this and Jujitsu or martial arts a lot

1726
01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:53.970
where guys give up their dreams for the kid.
Like the sacrifice,

1727
01:39:53.971 --> 01:39:58.620
everything for the kid.
What a horrible role model.
What,
what message is that?

1728
01:39:58.950 --> 01:40:00.930
I am this.
I am so important.

1729
01:40:00.931 --> 01:40:05.730
I'm the center of the universe and kids grew up with this,
you know,

1730
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:07.380
they talk about lack of self esteem.

1731
01:40:07.381 --> 01:40:11.800
I think most modern kids have too much esteem.
They've been,
you know,

1732
01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:16.020
they grew up like a little prince or a little princess and it's like man,

1733
01:40:16.050 --> 01:40:19.110
the best thing a guy could do is continue to work out.

1734
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:20.850
Keep yourself in great shape.

1735
01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.700
Take that time for yourself to keep yourself healthy.

1736
01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:28.701
Cause I mean what use is a man to his family if he's broken down and sick and he

1737
01:40:28.771 --> 01:40:31.920
just works his ass off all the time.
And it doesn't keep himself healthy.

1738
01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:36.810
And my God,
go,
go to the Mat and get your time in man.
You know,

1739
01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:39.510
to keep yourself mentally healthy and happy.

1740
01:40:39.511 --> 01:40:43.110
But I can't tell you how it used to bug me when I had my Jujitsu school.

1741
01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:46.420
How many guys,
you know,
they let family,
uh,

1742
01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:50.760
just completely undermine everything that you were doing for the health and

1743
01:40:50.761 --> 01:40:54.010
their wellbeing and their,
their split.
Every,
their kid becomes like

1744
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.880
<v 0>a project and they put tremendous amount of pressure on their kid because of</v>

1745
01:40:57.881 --> 01:41:02.650
that.
You know,
I think it's very important to set an example and one,

1746
01:41:02.651 --> 01:41:05.170
one of the best examples that you could have as a parent.

1747
01:41:05.171 --> 01:41:08.680
It's just to live a balanced life,
to live a fulfilled life,
enjoy yourself,

1748
01:41:08.681 --> 01:41:12.370
enjoy your time.
So the kid has like that in their head.
Like,
Oh,
I,
you know,

1749
01:41:12.371 --> 01:41:16.270
I should,
I should I see how my mom lives her life.

1750
01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.500
I see that she's fulfilled.
I see that she enjoys,
she has hobbies,
she enjoys.

1751
01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:24.310
She likes to educate herself.
She likes to read,
she likes to do things.

1752
01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:27.760
I like to do things too.
And like,
you get stimulated if you have a mom,

1753
01:41:27.761 --> 01:41:30.760
it's a fat fuck that sits around and watching real housewives of Beverly Hills

1754
01:41:30.761 --> 01:41:34.570
and eating Cheetos and complaining about people and Talking Shit.
You know,

1755
01:41:34.571 --> 01:41:36.670
those kids will develop that sort of a habit.

1756
01:41:36.671 --> 01:41:39.550
They'll start talking shit to and they'll start floundering around.

1757
01:41:39.551 --> 01:41:42.670
Two children imitate their atmosphere,
you know,
very much so.

1758
01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.401
<v 4>And you know,</v>

1759
01:41:43.401 --> 01:41:46.160
like the old man has been working all day and he comes home and he's grouchy.

1760
01:41:46.161 --> 01:41:49.760
He's tired,
you know?
Yeah.
And then all of a sudden he's dumped on with all the,

1761
01:41:49.761 --> 01:41:52.580
all the problems.
Oh yeah.
When my kids were little man,

1762
01:41:52.670 --> 01:41:56.030
I would put them in the damn playpen and they could scream their fucking heads

1763
01:41:56.031 --> 01:42:00.470
off and I did my training and they were going to learn that,
hey,
for that time,

1764
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:04.530
Hey,
I'm doing my thing.
I was making sure they weren't hurt.
Right.

1765
01:42:05.150 --> 01:42:08.000
But it wasn't going to kill him.
Right.
You know,
and then I would,

1766
01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:12.670
<v 0>how old were your kids when,
or your kid when you got divorced?</v>

1767
01:42:13.230 --> 01:42:18.030
<v 4>Uh,
let's say the daughter was 12,
going on 13,
and Zach was like,</v>

1768
01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.680
I guess 14.

1769
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:23.050
<v 0>That's it.
Just tough on kids.
That's tough on kids.
And especially at that age,</v>

1770
01:42:23.051 --> 01:42:24.810
right at the high school age,
close to him.

1771
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:28.370
<v 4>Well the girl more so than the boy,
that was tough for her as Zach.</v>

1772
01:42:28.371 --> 01:42:29.930
He was a little bit more philosophical.

1773
01:42:29.931 --> 01:42:33.020
It's a pretty mature kid for his age and he was able to just take it in,

1774
01:42:33.021 --> 01:42:33.460
stride it

1775
01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:37.450
<v 0>a bit more.
Yeah.
When kids see parents that are together too,
you know,
they,</v>

1776
01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:41.980
they look at these like happy households.
Like,
uh,
some of my daughter's friends,

1777
01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:46.330
um,
they're single moms or they're broken up with her husband are going through

1778
01:42:46.331 --> 01:42:49.210
divorce and you can see they,
they hate it.
The kids,
the,
you know,

1779
01:42:49.211 --> 01:42:51.880
especially at that age,
like six,
they are,
they're really suffer.

1780
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:56.950
It's a crazy thing how human beings just a lot of times really desire that

1781
01:42:56.951 --> 01:42:59.890
nuclear household and father,
mother household.

1782
01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:03.190
So much so that people will go through it.
And that's the other,

1783
01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.370
the other side of it is that the folks that go through it where they're just

1784
01:43:06.371 --> 01:43:08.560
getting tortured,
they hate each other,

1785
01:43:08.650 --> 01:43:10.420
but they're sticking together for the kids.
Like,
man,

1786
01:43:10.421 --> 01:43:12.850
you'd probably be better off.
The kids would probably be better off.

1787
01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:16.970
<v 4>Plenty of families that shouldn't be together,
man.
It's so toxic.</v>

1788
01:43:16.971 --> 01:43:19.850
And the kids grow up with the,
you know,
in that toxic environment.

1789
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:21.740
But what you were saying before,

1790
01:43:21.741 --> 01:43:26.180
a kids do emulate what you do and by being a good example,

1791
01:43:26.210 --> 01:43:31.210
by taking care of your health and taking time to work out and pursuing your own

1792
01:43:31.971 --> 01:43:35.060
interests and not just making everything about the kid,
about the kid,

1793
01:43:35.061 --> 01:43:37.430
about the kid,
about the family,
you know?

1794
01:43:38.210 --> 01:43:40.360
<v 0>Yeah.
You also give them a sense of independence too.</v>

1795
01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:44.830
<v 4>Well,
yeah.
Then they can see,
wow,
okay my,
my dad's his own man or my mom's,</v>

1796
01:43:44.831 --> 01:43:48.310
her own woman and you know,
they're,
they're not just all wrapped up in me,

1797
01:43:48.850 --> 01:43:52.190
you know,
so what a,
what go,
what a great role

1798
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:55.280
<v 2>model that is for them to grow up and realize that yeah.</v>

1799
01:43:55.281 --> 01:43:56.330
That that's the way it is.

1800
01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.750
Is there an age where kids shouldn't lift weights because we always heard that

1801
01:43:59.751 --> 01:44:02.330
when we were younger.
I'll give you a lift weights.
When you're a certain age,

1802
01:44:02.331 --> 01:44:05.060
it's bad for your body that it's bad,
it'll stunt your growth.

1803
01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:08.210
You'd always hear like things like that.
Is that,
are those myths?

1804
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:12.530
A lot of it is a myth.
Uh,
I mean obviously kids when they're small,

1805
01:44:12.531 --> 01:44:15.260
they don't have good motor control or but good motor skills.
So you know,

1806
01:44:15.261 --> 01:44:17.660
you don't want them hurting,
hurting themselves.

1807
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:21.440
But certainly doing body weight exercises,
I mean your,

1808
01:44:21.441 --> 01:44:24.400
your daughter probably tries to emulate you already anyway.
You know,

1809
01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:27.170
when she sees daddy and his home gym or whatever,

1810
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:29.750
she wants to do some pushups and stuff and that's,
that's fun.

1811
01:44:30.170 --> 01:44:33.500
Usually by the time a kid is old enough to start doing household chores and

1812
01:44:33.501 --> 01:44:36.650
helping around the house a little bit is a good time to get them into some type

1813
01:44:36.651 --> 01:44:40.700
of formal training.
But it gotta be somewhat fun.
You know,
Scott is,

1814
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:45.590
everything is planned.
We talked about,
uh,
Hickson's a hidden in Jujitsu.
You know,

1815
01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.160
you can kind of do like hidden workouts and stuff.
Yeah,

1816
01:44:48.170 --> 01:44:51.590
chrome would joke around about it with no hidden pressure.

1817
01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:54.650
Pressure was real man.
It's death pressures and real.

1818
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:59.770
But can you imagine growing up the son of the greatest Jujitsu fighter ever has

1819
01:45:00.651 --> 01:45:05.000
to be just on the block,
not in the neighborhood,
not in the state,

1820
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:06.030
not a state Chai.

1821
01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:11.040
Highest expression of the art that there ever was crazy yoga guy too.

1822
01:45:11.721 --> 01:45:14.990
And you know,
this dude is doing this crazy breathwork and shit,
whatever.

1823
01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.130
But also look,
look where it turned out.
I mean he's a world champion himself,

1824
01:45:19.131 --> 01:45:23.720
so obviously,
so something worked out there.
Clearly worked out with my kid.

1825
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:27.470
You know,
I used to play all sorts of fun little games I would take.

1826
01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:30.350
He used to love to go to this dollar store,
you know,

1827
01:45:30.351 --> 01:45:33.500
everything was a buck and it was a a heaven for little kids,
you know,

1828
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:35.630
all that cheap plastic toys and all that stuff.

1829
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:40.930
So I'm a tape dollar bills up on a pole or on the wall and he would have to

1830
01:45:41.061 --> 01:45:43.610
figure out how to Pau furniture up and climb up.

1831
01:45:43.611 --> 01:45:46.930
And she does that tough like a fucking recipe for disaster.
You know,

1832
01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:51.520
I was spotting him,
you know,
but I mean he got good at climate stuff,
man.
Uh,

1833
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:54.590
I used to bet him that he couldn't go from the basement of our four story

1834
01:45:54.591 --> 01:45:58.630
brownstone and Philly from the basement to the top for where my bedroom was

1835
01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:01.790
without touching the stairs.
So here's dealing like Ninja warrior stuff,

1836
01:46:01.791 --> 01:46:06.791
like bracing himself in the wall and are walking with his feeding one wall in

1837
01:46:07.371 --> 01:46:11.510
his hands and the other cat crawling up the railing and mean he was doing this

1838
01:46:11.511 --> 01:46:15.740
stuff when he was really,
really little.
And,
but,
but when he was like,

1839
01:46:15.741 --> 01:46:18.800
in kindergarten,
we play Indiana Jones and the temple of doom.

1840
01:46:18.801 --> 01:46:23.500
I'd have a big stability ball,
like the big uh,
concrete ball or you know,

1841
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:25.010
the granite ball that,
uh,

1842
01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:29.810
there's going to crush Indiana Jones was Zack could jump down a flight of stairs

1843
01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.130
and land in role before I could roll that ball down the stairs and jumped down a

1844
01:46:34.131 --> 01:46:35.030
flight of stairs.

1845
01:46:35.031 --> 01:46:39.500
He learned to do this stuff from a very young age because he started when he was

1846
01:46:39.501 --> 01:46:43.160
like three or four years old.
How many stairs?
I'd be like 14 steps.

1847
01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:44.520
He jumped down,

1848
01:46:44.521 --> 01:46:49.521
he 14 you can hold onto the rail and swing his legs out and jump to the Oh,

1849
01:46:49.891 --> 01:46:54.040
okay.
So he would hold onto the rail and jump over time kind of,
no,
no,
no.

1850
01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:58.530
He would like swing his body in the stairwell and jumped down a flight of
stairs.

1851
01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:02.370
Oh my God.
Eh?
He's kind of cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1852
01:47:02.371 --> 01:47:06.690
That seems like a lot of stress on the,
on your legs though.
Hey,
you know,

1853
01:47:06.691 --> 01:47:10.620
kids of that age,
they're so resilient and he had been built into this stuff.

1854
01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:13.230
You have from the time he was,
I bored,
man.
I was,

1855
01:47:13.231 --> 01:47:15.600
I was thinking that the other day when I was watching their kids play,

1856
01:47:15.601 --> 01:47:15.871
I was like,

1857
01:47:15.871 --> 01:47:19.230
you're very rarely hear about kids getting a knee injury that kids don't get

1858
01:47:19.231 --> 01:47:23.160
hurt.
I mean the film,
you know what,
you know when they start getting hurt,

1859
01:47:23.161 --> 01:47:27.570
when the parents start to put that fear of ground engagement anywhere in the

1860
01:47:27.571 --> 01:47:29.010
world,
you go buy a playground.

1861
01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:31.620
And I don't even have to understand the language to know what these people are

1862
01:47:31.621 --> 01:47:35.940
saying,
mothers and so forth.
Get Down,
look out,
right?

1863
01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:39.060
You're going to get hurt.
All that.
So dangerous gets it.
You know,

1864
01:47:39.061 --> 01:47:43.920
he put this fear,
the kids' minds.
But up to that point,
the body is so resilient.

1865
01:47:43.921 --> 01:47:48.690
Okay,
maybe they'll fall.
They start to learn their own limitations.
But instead,

1866
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:49.681
well meaning,

1867
01:47:49.681 --> 01:47:54.681
but misguided adult put these limitations in their mind already premature.

1868
01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.880
So they never really discover.

1869
01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.550
So they get this inborn fear,

1870
01:48:00.551 --> 01:48:05.320
especially of falling and so forth.
One of the five big human fears,
you know,

1871
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:09.090
and when I used to teach wrestling and Jiu Jitsu and so forth,

1872
01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:10.770
teaching people throws,

1873
01:48:10.771 --> 01:48:15.771
it was really hard as an adult because they had this terrible fear of falling.

1874
01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.210
But it was misguided because,
I mean,

1875
01:48:18.211 --> 01:48:22.470
when you're a little kid and you learn how to fall and wall exacted,
man,

1876
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:25.950
you can take falls and throws and you're,
you're absolutely fine.

1877
01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:29.970
Bodies is so mobile,
so resilient.
They haven't built up all that stiffness.

1878
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:32.610
But when you put that fear in a person's mind,

1879
01:48:32.611 --> 01:48:34.800
you get that fear reactivity for sure.

1880
01:48:34.801 --> 01:48:37.050
You're going to get hurt because you step in if the wrong time.

1881
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:40.440
You know the difference between like dropping a ball on the ground and a brick,

1882
01:48:40.441 --> 01:48:45.180
you know,
the brick shatters and the ball will bounce.
Well,

1883
01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:49.320
he would make people like bricks with all this fearfulness and you hear it all

1884
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:53.960
the time.
I hear parents constantly putting this,
this fear,

1885
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:57.480
well,
I fell off a monkey bars when I was six and snapped my arm in half.

1886
01:48:57.481 --> 01:49:01.260
So it's probably good to have a little bit of fear.
I was like,

1887
01:49:01.261 --> 01:49:05.550
I broke my arm and my mom would always hear me say I broke my arm when I didn't

1888
01:49:05.551 --> 01:49:08.550
break my arm.
But she looked at me and she goes,
wow,
you really broke your arm.

1889
01:49:08.551 --> 01:49:12.000
Really did break your house,
snapped in half.
It was,
hey,
you know,

1890
01:49:12.001 --> 01:49:13.680
you learn a harsh lesson.
You know,

1891
01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:17.960
it still didn't make you completely afraid of climbing and doing stuff.
I mean,

1892
01:49:17.961 --> 01:49:19.470
I bet you within a couple months,

1893
01:49:19.471 --> 01:49:21.900
you right back in there and doing this stuff again.
Yeah.

1894
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:23.700
Actually I remember falling out of trees.

1895
01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:27.930
It felt like every bone in my body broken.
You know?
You know what's amazing is,

1896
01:49:27.931 --> 01:49:32.610
um,
how well kids can manipulate their body to my,
my daughter can do a,

1897
01:49:32.611 --> 01:49:34.440
what is that called?
When you put your feet on the ground,

1898
01:49:34.441 --> 01:49:37.030
your back bends and you put your hand.
Yeah,
right there.

1899
01:49:37.050 --> 01:49:39.780
Little spies are so incredibly flexible and you know,

1900
01:49:39.810 --> 01:49:42.540
and she can go up on their tippy toes and she's only six.

1901
01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.390
She can also climb a rope.
I have a rope in my garage.

1902
01:49:45.391 --> 01:49:47.410
You see my garage is pretty fast.
The great,

1903
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:49.510
she grabs that rope and climbs all the way to the top.

1904
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:52.300
And I was watching her do that.
I was like,
how many women can do that?

1905
01:49:52.450 --> 01:49:55.240
Like she's a tiny little girl.
She's six.

1906
01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:59.500
Like how many grown women can support their own weight like that and climb up.

1907
01:49:59.501 --> 01:50:02.560
Most grown men can't do it.
No.
Most.
Yeah.
Most grown men,

1908
01:50:02.590 --> 01:50:07.120
they couldn't climb a rope if their life depended on it.
Yeah.
And that's sad.

1909
01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:11.170
It is sad and that,
that's one of the best things I ever did for my kid.

1910
01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.510
I just hung a rope in our foyer of our house.

1911
01:50:13.511 --> 01:50:18.460
We had like one of those cargo architecturally designed houses that the kitchen

1912
01:50:18.461 --> 01:50:22.510
went up three fours,
you know,
with uh,
like a uh,
uh,

1913
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:25.720
by level type thing,
split level.
And uh,

1914
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:30.160
took my life in my own hands with my drill.
Tried to hang that damn rope man.

1915
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:34.420
I tied myself a with my Jujitsu about and was leaning over the back and he tried

1916
01:50:34.421 --> 01:50:38.920
to find a,
a beam with a beam finder and the,
you know,
got the drill.

1917
01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:42.670
This is all while they actually wife was out of the house.
She comes home,

1918
01:50:42.671 --> 01:50:46.690
she has this rope hang it down in the middle of her foyer by our kitchen.

1919
01:50:47.170 --> 01:50:49.870
And uh,
you know,
I got both kids climbing.

1920
01:50:49.871 --> 01:50:53.860
That rope is at the beginning of the divorce proceedings.
My whole,

1921
01:50:54.570 --> 01:50:57.250
from the moment I said I do was the beginning of the divorce proceedings.

1922
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:59.980
That's how it works.
That's how it works.

1923
01:50:59.981 --> 01:51:04.270
Sometimes it's just the idea of getting married,
let's,
we're going to be normal.

1924
01:51:04.271 --> 01:51:07.120
We're going to be like everybody else.
We're going to get married.
Well,

1925
01:51:07.121 --> 01:51:10.310
it'll work out once we're married or workout.
It never does,
man.

1926
01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:15.070
I preferred and marriage,
right.
And unmarried is where I have my money.

1927
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.980
She has hers,
I got my credit cards.
She has hers.

1928
01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:23.050
I have my possessions.
She has hers.
I don't tell her what to do.

1929
01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:25.630
She doesn't tell me what to do.
You know,
it's like an agreement.

1930
01:51:25.631 --> 01:51:27.490
We're together because we want to be together.

1931
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:31.360
We don't need a government agency to tell us that we can live together and we

1932
01:51:31.361 --> 01:51:35.350
definitely don't need a government agency telling us that we're allowed to be a

1933
01:51:35.351 --> 01:51:37.840
partner.
Well,
that doesn't sound very romantic style.

1934
01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:41.740
I don't know what kind of woman's can accept that,
but I'll tell you right now,

1935
01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:45.380
I am not going to,
I'll tell you right now,
Steve,
I want a traditional marriage.
I,

1936
01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:45.620
we won't

1937
01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:48.110
<v 0>be able to tell my friends that I'm married.
That's the other thing.</v>

1938
01:51:48.111 --> 01:51:49.610
Chicks love to tell.
Their friends are married.

1939
01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:53.960
Very few guys like you're excited to tell their friends they're getting married.

1940
01:51:54.170 --> 01:51:58.970
Like,
see,
I got her,
she's marrying me.
I did it.
You know,
they go,

1941
01:51:58.971 --> 01:52:01.430
Yay,
we're good.
We're getting married.
Like,
well congratulations.

1942
01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:06.110
But it's never like this milestone accomplishment.
Like wow,

1943
01:52:06.111 --> 01:52:10.700
you pulled it off.
But a girl will like,
look,
I'm getting like,
oh my God,

1944
01:52:10.701 --> 01:52:14.630
I can't believe in girls.
Get so excited.
I'm so happy for you.
They'll hug.

1945
01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.300
It's a two complete different experience for the male.

1946
01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:20.450
Women have got it in their head or some,
I should say,

1947
01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:23.390
because of movies and the stories.

1948
01:52:23.391 --> 01:52:27.410
You know this romantic happily ever after idea that they have to,

1949
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:31.790
they have to get legally bound.
They don't think of it as,
you know,
it's you.

1950
01:52:31.791 --> 01:52:36.620
The way you look at it is so harsh and so jaded.
It's not a legal contract.

1951
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:37.170
It's,

1952
01:52:37.170 --> 01:52:41.300
it's a beautiful agreement and it's you take your relationship to a next level.

1953
01:52:41.690 --> 01:52:45.950
Yeah.
Until you hit those divorce proceedings,
then you realize,

1954
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.840
<v 2>oh,
this is a contract.</v>

1955
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:51.220
Like this is a legal contract with the state and now I've got to bring in

1956
01:52:51.230 --> 01:52:54.800
lawyers and we've got to figure out how to fucking divvy up my money and the

1957
01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:59.600
lawyers get a Gi in chunk of that action.
That's the big scam.

1958
01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:03.620
That's when I'm Phil Hartman,
before his wife killed him,

1959
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:06.170
when he was trying to get divorced,
shot him in his sleep.

1960
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:10.490
He was ranting to me by go just fucking give her half and he's like,

1961
01:53:10.491 --> 01:53:11.840
it's not a half.
That's the thing.

1962
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:16.430
It's a third because the lawyers get a third too.
You'll lose two thirds.

1963
01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:20.510
It's not half pretty much man.
It was just steaming out.

1964
01:53:20.530 --> 01:53:22.820
I liked the non marriage,
you know,

1965
01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:27.850
that's nice to non marriage and keeps their own personality and you don't like

1966
01:53:28.161 --> 01:53:29.000
just get all wrapped up.

1967
01:53:29.001 --> 01:53:32.570
See this Guy Jamie was showing me these yesterday's Russian oligarch.

1968
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:37.550
Oh 4.5 billion EDI in a divorce.

1969
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:38.290
Of course.

1970
01:53:38.290 --> 01:53:41.870
I guess when you have billions and billions is probably not that big of a deal.

1971
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:45.380
It's a big deal.
No matter how much money you got,

1972
01:53:45.710 --> 01:53:49.280
the idea that some chick is going to be going off bang other dudes with your

1973
01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:53.610
money and ride and Ferrari's and flying private jets everywhere and buying

1974
01:53:53.611 --> 01:53:56.870
castles all with your cash.
Why?
Because he had sex with her.

1975
01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:01.880
I guess they don't have prenups and Russia or if they do,
he didn't get one.

1976
01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.980
I mean he's just maybe thought he was going to make,

1977
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:05.090
this is going to be different man.

1978
01:54:05.091 --> 01:54:07.400
Fuck all the other 50% of the people that could make it.

1979
01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:11.960
I'm not even hedging my bets.
I'm all in.
He pushed all his chips on the table.

1980
01:54:11.961 --> 01:54:14.380
And you know,
the thing that,
uh,

1981
01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:18.020
I think sours a lot of marriages and I can speak from experience because I've

1982
01:54:18.021 --> 01:54:21.740
been married and divorced three times,
three times,
three times,
you know,

1983
01:54:21.741 --> 01:54:26.060
fucking crazy,
man,
man.
I keep going back for more.
And I finally got smart,

1984
01:54:26.061 --> 01:54:29.390
you know,
I think pretty crazy.

1985
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:34.070
But so many of us guys,
we,
we get,
we get the,
uh,

1986
01:54:34.090 --> 01:54:38.540
a woman who was the,
what I call it,
the girl,
you know,

1987
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:42.450
really fun to be around very,
you know,
feminine,
uh,

1988
01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:48.230
just you relate to,
uh,
together as friends.
And then what do we do?

1989
01:54:48.231 --> 01:54:52.110
We turn around and change her into a mother,
you know,

1990
01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.180
and mother is a whole different animal,

1991
01:54:56.390 --> 01:55:00.470
a whole different big than that girl that,
that,
that,
that,

1992
01:55:00.471 --> 01:55:04.490
that young girl that was carefree and fun to be around.

1993
01:55:04.491 --> 01:55:07.790
And you'd go to the movies and you'd go out and you'd play and you'd just have a

1994
01:55:07.791 --> 01:55:12.290
great time and all that just goes right out the window once you turn her into a

1995
01:55:12.291 --> 01:55:14.720
mother.
I'm not even talking about kids.
You know,

1996
01:55:14.721 --> 01:55:17.810
I've seen plenty of people without kids.
The woman's still becomes the mother.

1997
01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:20.360
Oh yeah.
You know,
like a mother substitute.

1998
01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:24.220
Will they become a dominant role in the man's decision making and they sort of

1999
01:55:24.221 --> 01:55:26.780
Cook,
Cook control him in a very motherly way.

2000
01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:29.390
I think that becomes very unattractive to women too.

2001
01:55:29.391 --> 01:55:33.410
Like I don't think a lot of women like that man,
they don't like that role.

2002
01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:36.320
I mean they didn't want to be put into that role.
You know,
a lot of women,

2003
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:39.350
you know,
they,
they'd like a strong guy that kind of take care of them.
Right.

2004
01:55:39.370 --> 01:55:42.240
Well I don't know,
I mean I wouldn't want to generalize,
but I the the,

2005
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:44.490
what I've seen from the women

2006
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:46.020
<v 0>that dominate the men,</v>

2007
01:55:46.050 --> 01:55:48.510
the like the guys that I know where the woman tells him what to do.

2008
01:55:48.511 --> 01:55:52.620
And those guys also have a hard time getting sex.
Like almost universally,

2009
01:55:52.650 --> 01:55:53.970
it's almost,
it's almost like a rule.

2010
01:55:53.971 --> 01:55:57.030
Like if the woman dominates and the woman tells you what to do and the woman

2011
01:55:57.031 --> 01:56:01.380
does control your spending and controls,
you know what your hobbies are.

2012
01:56:01.381 --> 01:56:03.390
And tells you what's going to happen and where you're going to go.

2013
01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:05.070
Those guys don't care much sex.

2014
01:56:05.130 --> 01:56:10.130
And I don't know if that's related to like a woman being attracted to a man that

2015
01:56:10.261 --> 01:56:13.890
she can't control or not attracted to a man she can control rather

2016
01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:18.480
<v 4>well.
The mother doesn't like sex.
The mother is against sex.</v>

2017
01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:21.540
And that's what happens so often in these marriages.
And you know,

2018
01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:26.020
I've had a lot of women that are Massachusetts and you know,
the uh,

2019
01:56:26.130 --> 01:56:28.840
bodyworkers and man when,
you know,

2020
01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:33.920
they tell me it's uncanny how many of their male clients will always proposition

2021
01:56:33.961 --> 01:56:38.700
and tried to rankle sex out of them.
He's a legitimate anywhere.

2022
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:41.700
I'm not talking about prostitutes.
Right,
right,
right.
And I mean,

2023
01:56:41.701 --> 01:56:42.650
it's pretty common.
Yeah.

2024
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:46.080
Guys are just sex starved and their relationships and their,
their marriages.

2025
01:56:46.590 --> 01:56:51.450
But the thing that really used to rankle me most more than anything was the way

2026
01:56:51.451 --> 01:56:55.410
women would not want to be.
They would want to separate their guys from their,

2027
01:56:55.411 --> 01:56:56.250
their,
their friends.

2028
01:56:56.790 --> 01:57:01.230
And they really resented the fact that God is come to Shiatsu training as a guy

2029
01:57:01.231 --> 01:57:03.660
that owns it.
You.
She's at school,
man,
the,

2030
01:57:03.670 --> 01:57:07.440
the wives and girlfriends would give the guys such a hard time about gone and

2031
01:57:07.441 --> 01:57:09.270
train it.
If anything,

2032
01:57:09.271 --> 01:57:14.250
they should be encouraged and they got to go as much as possible and you know,

2033
01:57:14.251 --> 01:57:18.930
they pulled these guys out of there and that's a damn shame to do that to a guy.

2034
01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:23.020
<v 0>It's also a damn shame for a guy to pull his woman out of something that she</v>

2035
01:57:23.021 --> 01:57:26.590
loves to do.
Oh,
well yeah,
of course.
I mean,
to be fair,
of course.
Yeah,
it's,

2036
01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:29.920
it's a terrible thing when people try to change the person who they're,

2037
01:57:29.921 --> 01:57:32.290
they love and control them.
I mean,

2038
01:57:32.291 --> 01:57:35.770
could you imagine your friend doing that to you?
Like a friend going,
come on man,

2039
01:57:35.771 --> 01:57:38.200
you're not going to work out.
What are you working out for?

2040
01:57:38.201 --> 01:57:41.260
I don't want you working out.
Hey,
I don't want you working out.
You're my friend.

2041
01:57:41.290 --> 01:57:44.830
You're coming with me.
You're like,
what?
Like,
I don't like you camping.

2042
01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:47.740
Why you camping?
You know,
I don't like you going to ballgames.
He'd be like,

2043
01:57:47.741 --> 01:57:50.020
what the fuck are you talking about?
You're crazy.

2044
01:57:50.230 --> 01:57:53.250
But when that friend happens to be someone that you have sex with or you

2045
01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:57.160
romantically connected to my girlfriend,
fiance,
wife,

2046
01:57:57.161 --> 01:58:00.790
whatever you want to call it,
that person all of a sudden has a some sort of a,

2047
01:58:00.791 --> 01:58:05.380
a role they can dictate like your actual day,
like dictate what you do,

2048
01:58:05.381 --> 01:58:09.370
whether it's a guy doing it to a wife or a girlfriend or a woman doing it to her

2049
01:58:09.371 --> 01:58:12.400
husband or her boyfriend.
It's a weird thing that people just sort of accept

2050
01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:16.000
<v 4>I ed and it happens so often and it's always gross.</v>

2051
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:20.710
No wonder that divorces at its all time highest,
right.
Fucking idiots.

2052
01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:25.210
All of us.
I did it three times.

2053
01:58:25.211 --> 01:58:28.000
Did you think about on number three when that one failed,
would you like,

2054
01:58:28.001 --> 01:58:31.780
motherfucker,
what's wrong with me?
Why don't I do this three times?
Pretty much.

2055
01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:33.250
It was like,
damn,

2056
01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:39.070
I had a lot of shame actually and a lot of feelings of

2057
01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.070
unworthiness or whatever.

2058
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.590
<v 2>You know?</v>

2059
01:58:42.590 --> 01:58:46.150
I like the feeling of being a failure and all that and then I just realized,

2060
01:58:46.151 --> 01:58:48.640
well,
you know,
some people just aren't cut out.

2061
01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:52.500
I should have never been in that situation.
The first point,

2062
01:58:52.530 --> 01:58:54.810
which wife did you have the kids with?
Uh,

2063
01:58:54.850 --> 01:58:59.770
the first one we held the third one.
Oh Wow.
So you had kids with both of them?

2064
01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:03.480
Yeah.
Ooh.
So how was,

2065
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:08.530
how old's your oldest kid right now?
A 45.
Jesus Christ.
You got to 45.

2066
01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:13.630
I was 17 years old.
Wow.
Pretty much knucklehead,

2067
01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:18.970
you know.
So what would that make her?
That would be a,
well,

2068
01:59:19.450 --> 01:59:23.470
she gotta be like 45.
Wow,
that's crazy.

2069
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:28.630
And then Zack blackbelt teacher down at a boiler,

2070
01:59:28.631 --> 01:59:33.190
Gracie school and Hedges Laboratory.
And um,
where's that at on Friday?

2071
01:59:33.191 --> 01:59:36.550
That's a Gracie San Diego.
San Diego.
Yeah.
They just moved into new,

2072
01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:39.070
I haven't even seen their new,
their new school yet.

2073
01:59:39.090 --> 01:59:42.610
The hedges just moved into a new place and especially to be fantastic.

2074
01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:46.090
What a hotbed.
San Diego was for training and his partner was this guy,

2075
01:59:46.150 --> 01:59:48.480
Joe [inaudible].
Johnny Fredda.

2076
01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:53.410
He's one of us nationals and World Nogi.
Think you went up at Dobie?

2077
01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:55.240
I don't know.
He's held,
uh,

2078
01:59:55.330 --> 01:59:58.270
Nogi grappler and Zach teachers for those guys down there.

2079
01:59:58.271 --> 02:00:01.210
And then boiler Glenn's the name to the school when it shows up,
you know,

2080
02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:04.210
I mean he's on the road most of the time and so forth.

2081
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:06.910
Hoist is kind of done that too,
right?
Neither one of those guys,

2082
02:00:06.911 --> 02:00:09.750
they just decided to not have an academy.
Yeah,
it's,

2083
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:13.750
it's hard being tied down to academy and it's better just to have like maybe a

2084
02:00:13.751 --> 02:00:15.080
place where you can,
you know,

2085
02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:18.130
let someone else run it and then you can go out in the road and to get the

2086
02:00:18.131 --> 02:00:22.030
seminar circuit.
And there's still a lot of call for a seminar.

2087
02:00:22.031 --> 02:00:25.130
Circuit is a big thing for venture to guys.
Eddie Bravo,

2088
02:00:25.150 --> 02:00:27.940
it makes a lot of money doing that.
That's a big part of his income.

2089
02:00:27.941 --> 02:00:31.120
He does a lot of travel and a lot of seminars and even myself,

2090
02:00:31.121 --> 02:00:34.000
I mean I get a fair share of Jiu Jitsu calls these days.
I mean,
you know,

2091
02:00:34.001 --> 02:00:36.910
I was one of the first American black belts and so forth.
Uh,

2092
02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:41.940
I don't consider myself an expert in the type of competition game they have now.

2093
02:00:43.210 --> 02:00:47.490
But when it comes to the old school self defense,
the Elliot Gracie self defense,

2094
02:00:47.790 --> 02:00:50.470
I kids just sit in myself,
one of the top authorities.

2095
02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:55.740
I learned it really well from both [inaudible] and Helson Elio himself and uh,

2096
02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:57.730
it's a fantastic system.

2097
02:00:58.030 --> 02:01:02.800
It's shocking how many black belts don't even know the basic standup self

2098
02:01:02.801 --> 02:01:03.430
defense.

2099
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:07.310
They don't realize what a great self defense system Brazilian Jiu Jitsu really

2100
02:01:07.311 --> 02:01:09.400
is.
What do you mean by like standup self defense?

2101
02:01:09.630 --> 02:01:13.510
You fight starts standing it up right PB and grabbed you and bear hugs and

2102
02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:14.980
grabbing me by the hair,

2103
02:01:14.981 --> 02:01:19.020
by the throat or grabbing your jacket or pushing you up against a parked car or

2104
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.720
wall.

2105
02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:24.720
There are self defense systems in place to either prevent those things or to get

2106
02:01:25.931 --> 02:01:27.550
yourself out of a bad situation.

2107
02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:30.730
It doesn't always involve going into the ground per sec.

2108
02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:36.390
And Elliot Gracie was a real master at adapting gold Japanese system and make it

2109
02:01:37.001 --> 02:01:40.400
more applicable to smaller,
weaker people with through the use of leverage.

2110
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:43.200
And it can even be taught to kids.
It's a,

2111
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:45.350
the grades you have that anti bullying system two,

2112
02:01:45.351 --> 02:01:48.290
which was the finest thing you can teach a kid.
I mean,

2113
02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:51.320
think about karate or taekwondo or whatever.

2114
02:01:51.321 --> 02:01:54.290
There are a lot of parents take the kids to,
how's that work?
Well,

2115
02:01:54.291 --> 02:01:57.290
you got to basically bust somebody in the face,
right?
Yeah.

2116
02:01:57.291 --> 02:01:58.790
You kicked him in the head or you know,

2117
02:01:58.791 --> 02:02:00.950
that's going to get you thrown out of school for sure.
Right.

2118
02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:05.390
But at least with Jujitsu,
you know,
you can use other means that isn't,

2119
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:07.890
this is not going to get you suspended from school for,
you know,

2120
02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:12.610
two or three or four weeks or whatever.
I was watching,
um,
one of the,
uh,

2121
02:02:12.650 --> 02:02:15.680
inside the UFC ultimate insider's yesterday.
You know,

2122
02:02:15.681 --> 02:02:18.890
they have those shows where they detailed training camps and stuff and they were

2123
02:02:18.891 --> 02:02:20.580
talking about Tj Dillashaw.

2124
02:02:20.581 --> 02:02:23.690
I was preparing for this fight and they had a scroll at the bottom of the screen

2125
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:26.060
and it was about a football player who got,

2126
02:02:26.061 --> 02:02:29.630
was under arrest for kicking another football player in the head and the other

2127
02:02:29.631 --> 02:02:32.740
guy was in critical condition.
Did you hear about that?
Man?

2128
02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:36.920
I don't know what it was is on the field or in the locker room or no idea.

2129
02:02:36.921 --> 02:02:40.070
It was just the scroll at the bottom and that the player was in critical

2130
02:02:40.071 --> 02:02:42.770
condition and then one one player kicked him in the head.

2131
02:02:42.771 --> 02:02:46.490
I don't know if it was pro or college.
I don't know what it was.
You know?

2132
02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:51.010
Well we have a very litigious society.
So you use a real violent way to,

2133
02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:55.870
to end some type of altercation.
Well,
you know,
you mentioned like the,
the,

2134
02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:58.730
the truck drivers today,
it was blocking you when you pick up your packages.
Yeah.

2135
02:02:58.790 --> 02:03:02.690
Imagine that went south and he started getting really belligerent and getting up

2136
02:03:02.691 --> 02:03:04.970
in your face may be portion around,
right.

2137
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.740
Jujitsu would have enabled you to control the situation without necessarily

2138
02:03:09.741 --> 02:03:10.970
hurting the guy.
Right.

2139
02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:14.420
But if you would have resorted to your Muy Thai and I've seen the way you kick

2140
02:03:14.421 --> 02:03:17.690
and punch,
it's pretty formidable.
You couldn't knock the guy and the next week,

2141
02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:21.260
well you can really kill somebody.
That's the real problem with the prowl down,

2142
02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.120
killing,
killing people in fights.

2143
02:03:23.121 --> 02:03:26.240
A lot of times happens when you hit them and they go unconscious and they hit

2144
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:27.950
their head.
Hit that on the ground.

2145
02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:31.610
Now imagine if you want to punch him in the face and he would have lost one

2146
02:03:31.611 --> 02:03:35.260
tooth.
I mean imagined of tooth replacement,
dental bill.

2147
02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:39.980
There's the thing Rutgers kicks Phillip Nelson off football team after

2148
02:03:39.981 --> 02:03:44.690
quarterback is charged and assault on Minnesota.
Man is,
that is crazy man.

2149
02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:48.290
The Minnesota guy was the linebacker for Minnesota state.
Is this,

2150
02:03:48.291 --> 02:03:53.150
they have a video of it?
Yeah.
Oh,
play the video.
Let's see this.
What happens here?

2151
02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:57.160
That's,
Oh man.
I wonder if they knew what the hell was going on.
Okay.

2152
02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:59.410
<v 5>Fight that happened early Sunday morning as part of their,</v>

2153
02:03:59.510 --> 02:04:02.630
everything's videotape now.
It's crazy.
Crazy.

2154
02:04:02.631 --> 02:04:06.590
Much not much privacy has been arrested and charged with assault.

2155
02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:09.830
Police released surveillance guys ruined his life man or a man was,

2156
02:04:09.831 --> 02:04:10.820
he certainly has it.

2157
02:04:11.150 --> 02:04:14.990
He was on the ground and being after being punched and knocked to the ground by

2158
02:04:14.991 --> 02:04:15.710
another session.

2159
02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:17.630
<v 2>Oh,
it was a nightclub or something.</v>

2160
02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:20.200
<v 5>Former football on a set of statement.</v>

2161
02:04:20.210 --> 02:04:23.560
Cato is in critical condition and doctors say that they're not sure he'll

2162
02:04:23.561 --> 02:04:24.270
survive.

2163
02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:29.070
<v 2>Oh,
Jesus Christ.
So his life is ruined as he knew it.
Oh my God.</v>

2164
02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:32.430
So he'll be out of school,
but they see that the point of,
you know,

2165
02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:36.960
using the violence and punching and kicking.
Yeah,
okay.
It works.
There's no,

2166
02:04:37.590 --> 02:04:38.050
Oh,
definitely

2167
02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:42.060
<v 4>work.
But then after a fan,
don't you know,</v>

2168
02:04:42.061 --> 02:04:46.230
the ramifications of using that type of violent behavior and for children in

2169
02:04:46.231 --> 02:04:48.960
particular to teach them that,
wow,

2170
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:50.550
they're going to be thrown out of school for sure.

2171
02:04:50.551 --> 02:04:52.600
That that's why I was like the wrestling and the shoes yet.

2172
02:04:52.601 --> 02:04:56.700
So you can control it without necessarily to have to,
you know,
smash somebody.

2173
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:58.010
<v 0>Yeah,
they're absolutely.</v>

2174
02:04:58.011 --> 02:05:00.200
The only real problem with that is of course multiple people,

2175
02:05:00.201 --> 02:05:03.500
but multiple people,
most of the time you're fucked no matter what,
pretty much.

2176
02:05:03.501 --> 02:05:04.820
It's very rare that a guy,

2177
02:05:05.130 --> 02:05:10.100
<v 4>it's not like,
you know the movie Jackie Chan Movies,
Jackie Chan or sat them,</v>

2178
02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:10.590
you know,

2179
02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:11.460
<v 0>one video.</v>

2180
02:05:11.461 --> 02:05:16.020
It was from Turkey where this guy was a boxer and he was being attacked by this

2181
02:05:16.021 --> 02:05:18.090
whole group of people we were doing.

2182
02:05:18.091 --> 02:05:22.350
We were watching it during one of the podcasts that we do and I was doing

2183
02:05:22.351 --> 02:05:25.410
commentary on it cause the guy is like really good boxer and all these people

2184
02:05:25.411 --> 02:05:28.320
were chasing after him and he's dropping them left and right.

2185
02:05:28.321 --> 02:05:33.321
This is like fucking 10 or 15 guys chasing after him and he drops like 10 of

2186
02:05:33.511 --> 02:05:36.840
them.
You know they're there,
circled around him and a guy comes forward,
crack.

2187
02:05:36.841 --> 02:05:39.840
He pops,
this guy crack,
he pops.
That guy,
they're trying to grab me.

2188
02:05:39.841 --> 02:05:43.140
He's backing up dropping guys.
It was really like a scene in a movie.

2189
02:05:43.141 --> 02:05:46.560
Like if you saw in the movie you would say,
well this is fun to watch,

2190
02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:49.530
but in real life this never happens.
But this actually did have,

2191
02:05:49.531 --> 02:05:51.660
she did it like that movie old boy.
Here it is.

2192
02:05:51.930 --> 02:05:54.690
Here's a video that they're chasing after this guy.

2193
02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:57.990
And so after they chased him out,
this guy,
they get out,

2194
02:05:58.050 --> 02:06:00.210
people started arguing and they're chasing after him.

2195
02:06:00.211 --> 02:06:03.360
But the guy knows how to fight.
Bam.
He drops that guy,
Bambi drops that guy,

2196
02:06:03.361 --> 02:06:04.470
Bam jumps that guy.

2197
02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.680
They're all chasing after him and now they're getting mad because he keeps

2198
02:06:07.681 --> 02:06:09.750
dropping these guys.
Look,
he's got his hands up,

2199
02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:14.790
he's got a good jab to check this Jab,
Jab,
drops,

2200
02:06:14.791 --> 02:06:19.410
that guy with a jab hook at this Bam.
That's just a stiff jab,
not,

2201
02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:22.890
and they're all running after him and he's moving back and he's got the state of

2202
02:06:22.891 --> 02:06:27.350
Missouri that drops,
that guy drops that guy.
He's got the,
the state of mind to,

2203
02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:30.590
to move back and then pause for a second and fire too.

2204
02:06:30.591 --> 02:06:35.250
Cause you guys come in there,
he's obviously trained.
Look at that jab tray.
Yeah.

2205
02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:39.630
Obviously hands up high and turning left and right and drop and dudes,

2206
02:06:40.110 --> 02:06:40.770
I guess,

2207
02:06:40.770 --> 02:06:43.320
I guess it seems like they're playing the same thing over and over again.

2208
02:06:43.321 --> 02:06:46.140
So it was probably only five or six guys,
but still,

2209
02:06:46.190 --> 02:06:49.880
<v 4>well they're coming at them one at a time and obviously they weren't trained</v>

2210
02:06:49.881 --> 02:06:54.200
people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think if you're,
you know,
imagine trying to fight train guys,

2211
02:06:54.201 --> 02:06:55.034
but you know,

2212
02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:58.460
how often do you ever find train guys out in the street and if you do what a

2213
02:06:58.461 --> 02:07:01.910
terrible situation,
that'd be a horrible situation.
But for the most part,

2214
02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:04.490
you know,
thugs aren't well trained.

2215
02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:08.800
<v 0>I had a friend who got in an argument with a guy whether in their cars and</v>

2216
02:07:08.801 --> 02:07:12.010
they're yelling at each other,
fuck you,
fuck you and pull over.
Fuck you.

2217
02:07:12.070 --> 02:07:12.551
And they put,

2218
02:07:12.551 --> 02:07:16.600
they pulled over and they both got out of the car and both guys could fight.

2219
02:07:17.050 --> 02:07:20.110
One got shot and the other guy,
the other guy stuffed it take down,

2220
02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:23.200
they start duking it out on their feet and they're like holy shit.

2221
02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:25.060
And they were both ways really about,

2222
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.320
and he said we were going at it for like 10 minutes before.

2223
02:07:29.321 --> 02:07:33.250
Both of us are exhausted and they wound up high fiving each other and get back

2224
02:07:33.251 --> 02:07:34.280
in their car and drive it away.

2225
02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:39.080
Think they fucking both realize that like they were going,

2226
02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:41.010
they thought they were going to tee off on some dude.

2227
02:07:41.011 --> 02:07:43.450
He didn't know how to fight.
The guy shoots in for a double.

2228
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:46.510
The other guys gets under hooks and sprawls and then looking at each other like,

2229
02:07:46.511 --> 02:07:49.960
what the fuck is going on here and there like faint and each other leg kicking

2230
02:07:49.961 --> 02:07:50.711
each other and shit.

2231
02:07:50.711 --> 02:07:53.590
They were actually duking it out and then somewhere along the line they were

2232
02:07:53.591 --> 02:07:57.370
having fun and they realize like they were having respect for each other and

2233
02:07:57.371 --> 02:07:59.470
then they high five each other and got back in their cars.

2234
02:07:59.950 --> 02:08:02.740
Why don't have the odd,
it's very rare.
Very,
very rare.

2235
02:08:02.741 --> 02:08:06.700
Also that they could go through that and laugh,
you know,
and go out.

2236
02:08:06.701 --> 02:08:09.790
It was fucking stupid.
Let's get out of here.
And you know,
bruised up.

2237
02:08:09.850 --> 02:08:13.990
It's always stupid,
right?
Oh,
always ends up being stupid.
Those type of things.

2238
02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:15.880
Well the worst is the drunken moments.

2239
02:08:15.881 --> 02:08:18.970
Like probably these guys that were at this nightclub is football player kicking

2240
02:08:18.971 --> 02:08:20.480
this guy while he's down the,

2241
02:08:20.481 --> 02:08:25.150
and also the crazy thing is movies that show head trauma and make it out like

2242
02:08:25.151 --> 02:08:29.080
it's no big deal.
I get pistol whipped and he wakes up later.
What happened?

2243
02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:33.000
Meanwhile,
he's fine,
you know,
and he's just still saving the day.
You know,

2244
02:08:33.001 --> 02:08:33.990
you get pistol whipped,

2245
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.260
you probably fucked up for about six months and to be a serious concussion man.

2246
02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:41.770
Yeah.
I mean Matt Grice,
I don't know if you know who he is,
UFC fighter,

2247
02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:45.980
great guy was hit any collision was rear ended,
uh,

2248
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:50.380
going 65 miles an hour.
Somebody just wasn't paying attention.

2249
02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:53.560
I don't know what the details were,
but his car,
his car was plowed into,

2250
02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:57.580
had brain surgery mean barely made it big scar on his head.

2251
02:08:57.581 --> 02:08:59.830
They had to remove his plate from his head.

2252
02:08:59.831 --> 02:09:02.650
They move a piece of his skull to give his uh,
his,

2253
02:09:02.651 --> 02:09:06.310
his brain of relief from the pressure and then they had to put it back in place.

2254
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:09.610
But you know,
he was talking about how much it affects them,

2255
02:09:09.611 --> 02:09:11.380
how much mental fatigue he has.
Oh

2256
02:09:11.590 --> 02:09:14.970
<v 4>God,
yes.
That creates,
like we were talking about it earlier,
you know,</v>

2257
02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:16.790
like the NFL and the main focus,

2258
02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:20.350
they can cut the whole concussion controversy right now.
It's going to change.

2259
02:09:20.370 --> 02:09:21.203
Football's really not.

2260
02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:24.760
<v 0>Yeah.
What are they going to do about that?
Because the sport,
it's like it all.</v>

2261
02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:28.140
You're like MMA.
Like how would you take away the concussions?
Yeah.

2262
02:09:28.450 --> 02:09:30.940
<v 4>I don't even know how that would happen.
You can't,
you know,</v>

2263
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:35.230
unless it would be some kind of like body shots only in wrestling or something.

2264
02:09:35.231 --> 02:09:39.100
But that,
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't think the fans would buy it.

2265
02:09:39.170 --> 02:09:44.090
<v 0>And the other thing that happens that you see in MMA is when a guy gets knocked</v>

2266
02:09:44.091 --> 02:09:47.240
out,
how easy it is for him to get hurt after that.

2267
02:09:47.690 --> 02:09:51.320
Like Anderson Silva is a perfect example,
goes through his entire career.

2268
02:09:51.321 --> 02:09:55.460
It looks like it an a chain of iron,
you know,
fights.
Everybody never gets hurt.

2269
02:09:55.610 --> 02:09:59.150
Even if he gets dropped,
gets right back up.
Seems like he's fine,
you know,

2270
02:09:59.151 --> 02:10:00.590
fights all of these killers.

2271
02:10:00.890 --> 02:10:05.270
And then Chris Weidman shuts his lights out and then the next fight Chris

2272
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:08.570
Weidman drops him with a punch that looks like he would absorb that punch under

2273
02:10:08.571 --> 02:10:10.910
any other circumstances.
If you look at these entire career,

2274
02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:14.810
it was hit with harder punches,
hit with cleaner punches,
seem to be fine,

2275
02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.580
but he takes that one shot from Weidman.

2276
02:10:16.581 --> 02:10:19.490
And he see his eyes roll back and he goes down,
he recovered,

2277
02:10:19.491 --> 02:10:21.470
he's hanging on for dear life and clenching.

2278
02:10:21.471 --> 02:10:24.860
But you got a sense that he's damaged as a human right.

2279
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:25.500
<v 4>You know,</v>

2280
02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:29.060
the nervous system gets insulted like that and it just builds and builds and

2281
02:10:29.061 --> 02:10:32.210
builds.
I remember as a college wrestler my senior year,

2282
02:10:32.211 --> 02:10:36.530
I was illegally slammed on my head and had a pretty bad concussion.

2283
02:10:37.190 --> 02:10:41.790
And,
uh,
I had another incident in training,
same thing.
And they,

2284
02:10:41.791 --> 02:10:45.950
they,
they told me even back then,
and this is back in the 70s,
that one more.

2285
02:10:45.951 --> 02:10:48.920
I was banned for the season.
That was it.
Wow.
Yeah.

2286
02:10:49.150 --> 02:10:50.570
<v 0>But not an MMA though.</v>

2287
02:10:51.130 --> 02:10:54.940
So many guys get knocked out and training and then wind up fighting,
you know.

2288
02:10:54.941 --> 02:10:55.450
So a few more.

2289
02:10:55.450 --> 02:10:58.840
Eddie Alvarez just pulled out of his big fight with Michael Chandler and one of

2290
02:10:58.841 --> 02:11:00.250
the things that he was talking about was a,

2291
02:11:00.251 --> 02:11:02.860
that he had gotten knocked out before their last fight.

2292
02:11:02.861 --> 02:11:05.890
He got knocked out and training a few weeks before the fight and got through it.

2293
02:11:05.891 --> 02:11:10.540
Okay.
But that this one was,
uh,
he had gotten hit and training,

2294
02:11:10.630 --> 02:11:12.670
wrestling,
uh,
you know,
uh,

2295
02:11:12.730 --> 02:11:16.990
someone sprawled and he got hit in the head by when a guy used his hips and it

2296
02:11:16.991 --> 02:11:19.540
just a collision,
you know,
it's the random collision.

2297
02:11:19.570 --> 02:11:22.690
And then another random collision while he was trying to get a single,

2298
02:11:22.691 --> 02:11:25.720
the guy pulled his leg out and as the guys kicking his leg out,

2299
02:11:25.721 --> 02:11:28.720
he hit him on the Chin and you know,
thinks he's fine,

2300
02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:33.550
just training hard like normal but then can't get over the headaches and it just

2301
02:11:33.551 --> 02:11:35.440
like it hurts him to move his head around.

2302
02:11:35.441 --> 02:11:37.600
And then he goes to a neurologist and he needed to,

2303
02:11:37.601 --> 02:11:41.110
he gets cat scans done the whole deal and they realize like,
you know,

2304
02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:41.953
you're not going to be,

2305
02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:45.650
<v 4>it's going to be very interesting to see what happens in these next 10 years</v>

2306
02:11:45.710 --> 02:11:50.620
with the first crop of mixed martial arts fighters and how they age and what a,

2307
02:11:50.630 --> 02:11:50.960
you know,

2308
02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:54.860
some of these guys are getting a little bit older now and what the permanent

2309
02:11:54.890 --> 02:11:58.130
ramifications there going to be from all of those brain injuries and so forth.

2310
02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:01.640
And I think it's going to be similar to what we saw in boxing with a lot of

2311
02:12:01.641 --> 02:12:05.720
these guys,
you know,
having dementia and you know,
the,
the,

2312
02:12:05.721 --> 02:12:08.900
the classic punch drunk.
It's,
it'd be interesting

2313
02:12:09.190 --> 02:12:11.330
<v 0>I think I agree with you and I think that,
um,
it,</v>

2314
02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:14.500
it kind of brings up the question that we're talking about with Dan Gable.
Like,

2315
02:12:14.501 --> 02:12:16.990
is that glory worth having those hip replacements?

2316
02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:20.260
There's one thing to have your body aching,

2317
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:23.800
but it's another thing to have your mind compromise to the point where the

2318
02:12:23.801 --> 02:12:26.050
quality of your thinking has greatly deteriorated.

2319
02:12:26.051 --> 02:12:27.880
Not just your ability to move your body,

2320
02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:30.100
but your ability to communicate with people.

2321
02:12:30.370 --> 02:12:34.420
Like when you used to hear Joe Frazier before he died,
it was painful to listen.

2322
02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:37.750
<v 4>I actually saw him out of the street,
you know,
cause I lived in Philly and I,</v>

2323
02:12:37.751 --> 02:12:41.950
you know,
I asked,
you saw him walking down Passyunk avenue,
right where I live.

2324
02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:45.670
Papers said,
hey Joe.
And the poor guy,
he couldn't understand a word he said,

2325
02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:51.070
the way he swore his speech.
And it was like really,
really weird.
Sad.
Do you,

2326
02:12:51.130 --> 02:12:53.780
do you ever foresee in the future,
um,

2327
02:12:54.850 --> 02:12:59.850
remember how McCain was trying to band MMA for the longest time right after the

2328
02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:04.300
initial thing got started?
Do you think,

2329
02:13:04.570 --> 02:13:09.100
do you foresee any of that happening again as,
as this type of thing happens?

2330
02:13:09.101 --> 02:13:11.920
I'm just curious.
It could,
but it would be burying sod.

2331
02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:12.671
<v 0>It would be,</v>

2332
02:13:12.671 --> 02:13:16.720
the only way that would be possible is if someone figured out a way to make

2333
02:13:16.721 --> 02:13:17.554
football safe.

2334
02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:20.290
Because if they don't make football safe and they're not going to banned

2335
02:13:20.291 --> 02:13:24.700
football,
football's the national gas is too big a sport.
Too Big,
too huge.

2336
02:13:24.701 --> 02:13:26.800
Too many people love it.
Too many people look forward to at football.

2337
02:13:26.801 --> 02:13:29.520
Season's just a huge part of being American.
Um,

2338
02:13:29.650 --> 02:13:32.430
if they don't ban that and someone wants a band MMA,

2339
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:35.880
<v 3>it's going to be a real problem.
She's going to be hard to reconcile.</v>

2340
02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:39.510
But you know,
they say that,
well,
the difference is that football,

2341
02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:41.460
the goal is not to knock a man unconscious.

2342
02:13:41.890 --> 02:13:44.610
The goal is to get a ball across the line to score.
Correct.

2343
02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:48.120
Sort of like organized team warfare.
Yeah.
That's all well and good,

2344
02:13:48.121 --> 02:13:50.760
but what's happening?
What is actually happening?

2345
02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.360
What's actually happening is giant people are slamming into each other.

2346
02:13:54.630 --> 02:13:56.590
And one of the things that this guy told me,
um,

2347
02:13:56.700 --> 02:14:00.300
that I found incredibly fascinating about concussions.
He's like,

2348
02:14:01.110 --> 02:14:04.680
the big misconception about concussions is that it has to be from head injury.

2349
02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:05.521
He's like,

2350
02:14:05.521 --> 02:14:08.340
well you don't realize is you can get a concussion from getting hit in the
chest.

2351
02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:10.830
Oh yeah.
A hard shot to the chest.

2352
02:14:10.831 --> 02:14:13.020
Like football players colliding with each other.

2353
02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:16.890
Not even making contact with the head,
but just the,
the boom,

2354
02:14:16.891 --> 02:14:21.891
the impact of these enormous ball or full body slamming into each other causes

2355
02:14:23.311 --> 02:14:27.330
the brain to rattle around inside your squash up against the side of the brain

2356
02:14:27.331 --> 02:14:29.010
path.
And that causes concussions.

2357
02:14:29.011 --> 02:14:32.550
And there's was a lot of guys who suffer concussions with no head trauma.

2358
02:14:32.551 --> 02:14:36.690
Their head doesn't actually get caught.
It's not a direct head contact.
They,

2359
02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:40.580
it's just the body getting rocked by an impact.
How are you,

2360
02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:42.510
how are you going to take that out of sports?
Any sport?

2361
02:14:42.511 --> 02:14:46.560
Even basketball guys fall down.
Combat Sports.
Yeah.
I mean,

2362
02:14:47.070 --> 02:14:52.020
one of the things that the guys can do this,
boom,
there's a perfect example,

2363
02:14:52.021 --> 02:14:56.370
Jamie.
That's that guy got a concussion.
That's right.
Watch this.
Look at this.

2364
02:14:56.910 --> 02:15:01.230
Look at his head.
Boom.
The way it snap.

2365
02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:05.770
Oh my goodness.
In the size of that man who grabbed him,
Jesus.
Louisa.

2366
02:15:07.150 --> 02:15:11.760
Like if you'd think about a guy like Lawrence Taylor going full clip or Ray

2367
02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:13.260
Lewis,
that it's just like a nightmare.

2368
02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:20.860
Ms guys can go a hundred yards in like sprinter time,

2369
02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:26.190
elite sprinter time,
and they're 300 pounds of muscle.
It's,
yeah,
it's shocking.

2370
02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:29.160
The forces that go in go into the whole thing,
by the way.

2371
02:15:29.161 --> 02:15:31.650
Not Possible without steroids.
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.

2372
02:15:31.651 --> 02:15:34.830
You don't get that big,
you know,
get that strong.
You don't get that fast.

2373
02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:37.710
Test them all you want.
There's some shit going on.

2374
02:15:38.010 --> 02:15:40.380
There's a lot of those fucking dudes that are on the juice.

2375
02:15:40.381 --> 02:15:44.250
If you go back in time and you look at the football players from the 1960s and

2376
02:15:44.251 --> 02:15:48.270
you look at the football players of today,
sure you had your guys,

2377
02:15:48.271 --> 02:15:53.010
you know you had,
yeah.
You had your,
your,
your,
you,
you know,
who was the,
um,

2378
02:15:53.370 --> 02:15:57.930
the guy who was a,
who did a commentary in a UFC one,
Jim Brown,

2379
02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:00.600
Jim Brown,
Jim Brown,
super athletes,
super natural.

2380
02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:03.180
What I try to sever fantastic athlete.

2381
02:16:04.130 --> 02:16:07.090
[inaudible] guys today are so much bigger than him there just,

2382
02:16:07.170 --> 02:16:11.460
he's a little guy by their status back even further.
Let's take Jim Thorpe.

2383
02:16:11.490 --> 02:16:15.660
Oh yeah.
You know,
I went to gym.
I went to,
uh,
I grew up in Carlisle,
Pennsylvania.

2384
02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:19.350
Where Jim through,
I went to the Indian school there and Carlisle Pa,

2385
02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:22.830
no kin and I went to school with his,
uh,
his nephews,
his grandnephews.

2386
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:25.980
Both boys were,
what was he like as he got older?

2387
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:29.970
He became an alcoholic.
Unfortunately.
You know,

2388
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:30.760
<v 4>he was penniless.</v>

2389
02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:34.900
He was stripped of his Olympic medals for playing a one pro baseball game or

2390
02:16:34.901 --> 02:16:37.360
something.
Getting paid for a game.
Yeah.

2391
02:16:37.361 --> 02:16:39.730
They had stripped his metals from him for the,

2392
02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:44.080
his amazing Olympic performance because he did the baseball game before the

2393
02:16:44.081 --> 02:16:45.290
Olympics or after the lump.

2394
02:16:45.291 --> 02:16:49.930
And I know before he had actually got paid like Medo nominal amount of money.

2395
02:16:49.931 --> 02:16:52.300
I don't know,
$15 and 700 for playing the game.

2396
02:16:52.301 --> 02:16:55.690
And he was stripped of his medals and,
but he had died a,

2397
02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:58.600
just basically a ditch digger and a pending list,
Scott.

2398
02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:02.030
But to give you an idea of how versatile football,

2399
02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:06.490
porous border in those days by,
uh,
my friend,

2400
02:17:06.670 --> 02:17:10.810
there's the nephew of Jim Thorpe told me it was a story that he missed the bus

2401
02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:13.060
from Carlisle to Harrisburg to play the game.

2402
02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:16.840
So he ran from Carlisle to Harrisburg,

2403
02:17:16.841 --> 02:17:21.841
which is about 18 and a half miles to the game and got there in time to play the

2404
02:17:22.211 --> 02:17:26.740
second half and scored several touchdowns.
How far is that?
18 miles.

2405
02:17:26.890 --> 02:17:31.630
18 miles.
Ran 18 miles.
Try Dog tried at 18 miles,

2406
02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:35.370
got there in time to play the second half and actually won a,
uh,

2407
02:17:35.530 --> 02:17:40.360
did a couple of scores.
Insane.
Talk about an insane athlete.
How big was he?
Uh,

2408
02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:45.430
you know,
I don't know,
bring it up.
It Jim Thorpe,
he wasn't a big guy,
but he,

2409
02:17:45.431 --> 02:17:47.050
you know,
they played both ways.
You know,

2410
02:17:47.051 --> 02:17:49.750
you played authentic and he played defense.
They'll look at that.

2411
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:53.620
It looks like a UFC welterweight and he was a damn good boxer.
A wrestler too.

2412
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:55.120
Wow.
And,

2413
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:59.500
but I mean that was back in the day where they didn't suffer the terrible head

2414
02:17:59.501 --> 02:18:02.800
traumas because it was more of an arm grabbing wrestling kind of game.

2415
02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:07.420
And we're guys smaller too and smaller.
And you know,
I stayed in Sydney,

2416
02:18:07.421 --> 02:18:08.890
I love Australia,

2417
02:18:08.891 --> 02:18:12.430
I love the ozzies and up is teaching Jujitsu down there and they're really into

2418
02:18:12.431 --> 02:18:15.700
Australian rules football.
And it's very similar to rugby.

2419
02:18:15.970 --> 02:18:19.180
The guys don't get nearly the trauma traumatic injuries that they do.

2420
02:18:19.181 --> 02:18:22.360
And like NFL,
it's more like organized team wrestling.

2421
02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:26.560
They're out there wrestling and in fact they train a lot of wrestler wrestling

2422
02:18:26.561 --> 02:18:30.160
for these guys.
They bring wrestlers in to teach them basic wrestling holds.

2423
02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:32.650
And um,
you don't get the,

2424
02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:36.190
I think it's the modern equipment that allows these guys to hit each other with

2425
02:18:36.191 --> 02:18:37.024
such force.

2426
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:40.420
Well that is the big argument about football that if you really wanted to make

2427
02:18:40.421 --> 02:18:42.490
football safe or you would take away the helmets and people are like,

2428
02:18:42.491 --> 02:18:44.160
that's so counterintuitive.
Like how,

2429
02:18:44.161 --> 02:18:47.290
how can you protect people by taking away protection?

2430
02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:50.880
But the reality is that protection is,
it's a fake sense of security.

2431
02:18:50.881 --> 02:18:51.750
The fake sense of security.

2432
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:55.720
Take the gloves off the UFC fighters like he did in the first four.
You okay?

2433
02:18:55.721 --> 02:19:00.160
You're going to see a lot of surface cuts,
right?
You know,
facial cuts,
you know,

2434
02:19:00.161 --> 02:19:00.940
for the knuckles,

2435
02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:05.620
but you're not going to see the traumatic head injuries like you do with the

2436
02:19:05.621 --> 02:19:07.780
gloves.
There's gloves,
a lot of guys to punch.

2437
02:19:07.781 --> 02:19:11.470
So freaking hard that make the hands like weapons.

2438
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:14.920
But you take the gloves off,
man,
the hands pretty fragile.

2439
02:19:15.250 --> 02:19:17.980
You're not going to just be granted a patent of like,
uh,
you know.

2440
02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:21.400
Do you think if they did that you'd start to see guys practicing on the Maki?

2441
02:19:21.401 --> 02:19:24.370
Wara remember those,
uh,
those Japanese probably would.

2442
02:19:24.371 --> 02:19:25.660
You'd have to definitely touch cheetahs.

2443
02:19:25.661 --> 02:19:28.190
Still does a lot of that still practices on

2444
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:31.820
<v 3>the,
I think you'd see a lot of open hand strikes as well.
I think you're right.</v>

2445
02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:33.770
I remember when mom Hales,
Keith Hackney,

2446
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:37.970
fuck that gigantic sumo dude and essentially bitch slapped him,

2447
02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:41.870
bitch slapped him,
dropped him.
The guy was like 600 pounds a manual Yarbrough,

2448
02:19:41.871 --> 02:19:45.890
he hit him with this gigantic like swinging bitch slap,

2449
02:19:45.891 --> 02:19:48.440
which is a great self defense techniques.
Your Palm,

2450
02:19:48.590 --> 02:19:52.430
it's amazing how much impact your palm can take and not get hurt.
I mean,

2451
02:19:52.431 --> 02:19:55.730
you could do that.
Look,
I'm doing this on this hard oak table.

2452
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:59.780
If I did that with my knuckles it would fucking hurt.
Oh yeah.
And plus you know,

2453
02:19:59.781 --> 02:20:04.340
you,
you can so easily break your head by my,
uh,
my Jujitsu measure.

2454
02:20:04.341 --> 02:20:09.341
Helson Gracie was renounced street fighter in his own right and he used to

2455
02:20:09.471 --> 02:20:11.810
practice open hand techniques all the time.
He used to,

2456
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:14.410
he call it slap in the bag so to speak.
And he,

2457
02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:19.540
he always taught us not to use closed fist in any type of realistic

2458
02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:24.060
confrontation.
Open hand strikes are quite effective for self defense.
Yeah,

2459
02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:26.570
you could certainly fuck somebody up.
The best example of that.

2460
02:20:26.571 --> 02:20:31.571
His boss Rutan rooting in pond Crace and palm Crace wine making a named pancreas

2461
02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:36.380
boss figured out boss has like really flexible risks in some way and he figured

2462
02:20:36.381 --> 02:20:40.520
out how to pull his hands.
His hands go like,
you see how my hand,

2463
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:43.160
like if I was striking,
my hand goes out.

2464
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:46.160
It's like sort of like not even 90 degrees,
not quite.

2465
02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:49.070
Bosses would go way back like this.

2466
02:20:49.071 --> 02:20:51.320
I don't know how the hell he did it when he stretched his wrists out,

2467
02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:55.940
probably did.
But when he was striking,
he was doing boxing techniques,

2468
02:20:55.970 --> 02:20:59.690
whereas in pancreas everybody else was kind of slapping and swinging.

2469
02:20:59.930 --> 02:21:03.860
Boss was throwing straight palm strikes and palm hooks,

2470
02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:08.870
so he was throwing them in a very traditional boxing way and knocking guys

2471
02:21:08.871 --> 02:21:10.980
senseless.
I just whomp technique,

2472
02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:15.200
incredible power behind his straight right palm technique,
you know,

2473
02:21:15.201 --> 02:21:18.950
he was a great puncher,
so he just pulled his hands back and threw punches,

2474
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:22.700
but threw punches with his palm and was able to really date.

2475
02:21:22.701 --> 02:21:25.640
That was the thing about pancreas is like,
you know that they were,

2476
02:21:25.650 --> 02:21:29.360
we're not allowed to use closed fists on the ground they were using to the body,

2477
02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:32.770
but they were not allowed to use them on the face standing up or on the ground.

2478
02:21:32.771 --> 02:21:34.430
So everything had to be these kind of slabs.

2479
02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:38.960
But boss just throw the whole fucking system out of whack because he would just

2480
02:21:38.961 --> 02:21:41.420
crush guys with that.
Paul Pilcher,
Dan,

2481
02:21:41.430 --> 02:21:43.630
he's another guy that's in some serious pain right now.

2482
02:21:43.870 --> 02:21:45.950
He's got one atrophied arm,

2483
02:21:45.980 --> 02:21:49.520
his arm is a shriveled up and he's going through all these different treatments

2484
02:21:49.521 --> 02:21:53.660
to try to regenerate the nerves and the tissue in his,
in his arm.
So real sad.

2485
02:21:53.661 --> 02:21:55.160
And he's,
yeah,
I mean there's a hell of,

2486
02:21:55.161 --> 02:21:57.380
and no one ever said that these sports are healthy.
You know,

2487
02:21:57.381 --> 02:21:58.520
you do it cause you love it.

2488
02:21:58.521 --> 02:22:02.420
There's something inside you that makes you want to do it.
But,
uh,
you know,

2489
02:22:02.421 --> 02:22:05.540
I mean truth be known and grappling is something he could do pretty well and

2490
02:22:05.541 --> 02:22:10.430
advanced age by Leo was like 90 and they're still grappling is,
yeah,

2491
02:22:10.431 --> 02:22:13.340
it was like 95,
96.
Oh is he like rolling and right.

2492
02:22:13.341 --> 02:22:17.240
You rolled around with him right when he was,
it was that old.
He was amazing.

2493
02:22:17.241 --> 02:22:19.580
He liked to lay there and let you tried to do stuff to him.

2494
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:23.240
He loved to play that game and it was like he could read your mind.

2495
02:22:23.241 --> 02:22:26.160
He already knew what you wanted to do before you even it.
But he moved well,

2496
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:28.950
<v 4>even though he's really,
oh wow.
He moved really,
really well.</v>

2497
02:22:28.951 --> 02:22:33.820
He had hurt his knee jumping off the back of a truck and uh,
yeah,
so he,

2498
02:22:33.821 --> 02:22:35.670
he was so stiff in his knee,

2499
02:22:35.671 --> 02:22:38.880
but he was pretty mobile guy even in his nineties.

2500
02:22:38.881 --> 02:22:41.010
It was amazing how well he moved around.

2501
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:42.930
<v 0>What do you think about,
like there's,</v>

2502
02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:47.960
there's techniques today that you're seeing in Jujitsu and MMA,

2503
02:22:48.041 --> 02:22:52.090
the,
all these Jujitsu techniques that,
um,
we're not in the original systems.

2504
02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:57.070
There's all these new found movements that some guys just don't want to adapt.

2505
02:22:57.220 --> 02:23:00.800
They don't want to incorporate them into their,
uh,
their strategy,
uh,

2506
02:23:00.850 --> 02:23:03.440
or into their game.
You know,
what do,
what do you think about that?
I,

2507
02:23:03.441 --> 02:23:08.441
I find that to be incredibly weird because Jujitsu itself was like this new

2508
02:23:08.561 --> 02:23:08.951
thing,

2509
02:23:08.951 --> 02:23:13.840
these new effective techniques that the folks that were originally learning them

2510
02:23:13.841 --> 02:23:17.950
didn't know.
You know,
Leo Gracie,
Carlos,
Gracie,
they take these techniques,

2511
02:23:17.951 --> 02:23:19.660
they modify them,
they make them even better.

2512
02:23:19.661 --> 02:23:22.220
So they essentially have this completely new system.
Well,

2513
02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:25.780
they brought it to America like especially in 1993 when the UFC came along,

2514
02:23:26.050 --> 02:23:27.260
that's what the whole thing was about.

2515
02:23:27.350 --> 02:23:30.580
It was about these new techniques that people couldn't defend against because

2516
02:23:30.581 --> 02:23:31.540
they weren't aware of them,

2517
02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:35.950
but now they don't incorporate new techniques into this system.

2518
02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:40.750
And the idea that it's perfect as is and then it can't be improved upon.

2519
02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:45.220
I think that's a little short sided and little weird considering how the system

2520
02:23:45.221 --> 02:23:46.960
started in the first place.
Well,

2521
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:50.230
<v 4>you have to think of it like this combat versus sport,</v>

2522
02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:54.640
real fighting versus sport fighting the rules will dictate the techniques.

2523
02:23:54.670 --> 02:23:56.110
Just like taekwondo.

2524
02:23:56.380 --> 02:24:00.550
At one time it was a fairly formidable martial art but because once it became an

2525
02:24:00.551 --> 02:24:05.551
Olympic sport it just became so stylized at taekwondo must became useless as a

2526
02:24:05.651 --> 02:24:08.080
martial art take geared up.
For example,

2527
02:24:08.081 --> 02:24:12.520
the original judo was based in identical to Jujitsu but once it became an

2528
02:24:12.521 --> 02:24:16.600
Olympic sport and people started practicing it within the roles,

2529
02:24:16.930 --> 02:24:20.560
they became more and more stylized to the point where Judah lost any semblance

2530
02:24:20.561 --> 02:24:23.950
of being a real martial art that you could use for self defense.

2531
02:24:24.190 --> 02:24:28.570
So I think what the Gracie Jujitsu practitioners are saying is we don't want to

2532
02:24:28.571 --> 02:24:33.571
take some of these new found techniques and incorporate it in our style because

2533
02:24:33.730 --> 02:24:35.710
this is for sport only.

2534
02:24:36.010 --> 02:24:41.010
This is stuff that you would only do in the sport itself and that we want to

2535
02:24:41.081 --> 02:24:45.280
stay with the more traditional combat oriented techniques that have been tried

2536
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:50.140
true and proven for for many,
many centuries.
Really,
if you think about it,

2537
02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:54.620
that being said,
my,
my son said something to me cause I,

2538
02:24:54.621 --> 02:24:59.350
I was kind of ragging on 50,
50 and bear and buffalo and he says,
yeah,

2539
02:24:59.351 --> 02:25:01.180
but pop,
if you don't know this stuff,

2540
02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:04.240
you're going to get your ass handed up to get by some guy that does.

2541
02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:07.450
So it's best to be familiar with all of this stuff.

2542
02:25:07.451 --> 02:25:10.300
So I thought that made an interesting point.
But you know,

2543
02:25:10.301 --> 02:25:12.850
when it comes to the UFC,
I mean obviously you're not going to bear on ball.

2544
02:25:12.851 --> 02:25:15.950
Oh somebody you're going to get your lights punched out or you know,

2545
02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:19.140
I'm not going to jump guard in the parking lot out here.
If something,

2546
02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:20.440
God would give me a hard time.

2547
02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:24.190
<v 0>Right.
But if you do wind up scrambling,
you fall on the ground.</v>

2548
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:27.850
<v 2>The guys on top of you,
the guard does work in a street fight.
Oh hell yeah.
Man,</v>

2549
02:25:27.851 --> 02:25:32.050
I've Fed,
I can't tell you how many students in Philadelphia,
uh,
I,
my salad,

2550
02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:35.250
a few scrapes and blade,
it worked beautifully.
But once again,

2551
02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:37.760
we're not fighting trained fighters.
Yes.
You know,

2552
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:42.040
we're not entering into a contract to put on the show and to fight each other.

2553
02:25:42.090 --> 02:25:44.800
Right.
You know what I mean by that logic like the guard,

2554
02:25:44.801 --> 02:25:47.260
you would never use the garden the street,
like why would you use the gardens?

2555
02:25:47.261 --> 02:25:50.760
Treat the guard.
Seems like something that you would use in a sport only.

2556
02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:53.380
I mean you're on your back.
Why would you ever put yourself in that position?

2557
02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:57.680
Only because it got flooded.
Exactly.
Because he had no choice but in that,

2558
02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:00.550
in that respect,
then the 50 50 which is for folks who don't know,

2559
02:26:00.551 --> 02:26:03.610
it's almost like a two guys going for heel hooks at the same time to set up

2560
02:26:03.611 --> 02:26:05.110
pretty much under locked leg position.

2561
02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:08.440
If you're in a situation where somehow or another in a mad scramble,

2562
02:26:08.441 --> 02:26:10.450
you wind up with a guy like that boy,

2563
02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:14.240
a heel hook in the fucking street would be absolutely devastating.
Well,

2564
02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:16.450
the guy who didn't know it happened,
chase you.

2565
02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:18.910
You could just walk away and he'd be Atlanta there.
Oh,

2566
02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:24.580
he'll look is one of the worst techniques ever as far as the going from like not

2567
02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:30.310
feeling any pain to irreparable damage or damage that you're going to have to

2568
02:26:30.311 --> 02:26:31.900
get surgery for.
It's like that.

2569
02:26:31.930 --> 02:26:35.290
Like the difference you don't have play or if you have a little bit of play in

2570
02:26:35.291 --> 02:26:38.650
an arm bar,
like here you're okay here.
You're like,
fuck,

2571
02:26:38.651 --> 02:26:42.260
I might have to tap tapping with a heels.
Look,
by the time it gives,

2572
02:26:42.270 --> 02:26:47.270
the things are ripping apart the injury cause you don't have set the sensory

2573
02:26:47.321 --> 02:26:51.570
nerves not well developed.
They heal the leg.
A lot of the leg locks were,

2574
02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:54.340
were originally Russian sambo.
Really?
Yeah.

2575
02:26:54.370 --> 02:26:59.280
They were very highly developed by the,
the,
the Russian sound bogus.

2576
02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:04.400
They had their own grappling style and the Gracies actually learned a lot of

2577
02:27:04.421 --> 02:27:05.770
these techniques and took,

2578
02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:09.190
took the song bow and embraced it and put it as part of Gracie Jujitsu.

2579
02:27:09.540 --> 02:27:12.550
The [inaudible] did an awful lot of that toe.
They studied samba.

2580
02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:13.331
They can paint it.

2581
02:27:13.331 --> 02:27:18.331
I actually saw a couple early Gracie videos of Hickson and John Shock and Hagan

2582
02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:25.060
competing in Samba Tournament's uh,
California.
And,
uh,

2583
02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:28.210
yeah,
it's real interesting.
This Russian guy beat both.

2584
02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:32.860
He beat two Machado's and then met Hickson in the finals and Hixson beat the guy

2585
02:27:32.970 --> 02:27:36.150
and,
and,
and the finals.
The interesting.
Yeah,
it was real.
Real.
It really good.

2586
02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:38.590
This Russian guy is pretty good.
What's his name?
Ah,
man.

2587
02:27:38.591 --> 02:27:40.840
I don't know if this is years ago I saw this video.

2588
02:27:40.930 --> 02:27:43.900
This is an old footage that I saw in Jorge Office,

2589
02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:48.490
but at any rate they were made,
they were military technique.

2590
02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:51.240
If you maim to soldier maimed them,

2591
02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:54.250
then it would take at least two comrades to take him out.

2592
02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:58.390
So now you've put three people out of the picture.
Uh,

2593
02:27:58.391 --> 02:28:00.000
so they would rip apart the knees.

2594
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:04.990
So now the guys all maimed and so now it takes at least two buddies to help get

2595
02:28:04.991 --> 02:28:08.530
the guy back.
So you put three people out of the fight with one maiming.

2596
02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:12.550
I said it's,
you know,
it's when,
oh,
here it is.
Is this a,
this might be,

2597
02:28:12.551 --> 02:28:14.180
it does that Hixon

2598
02:28:17.260 --> 02:28:18.790
on does John Jock,

2599
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:22.520
there was a blonde Russian dude that was kicking everyone's ass.
And this one.

2600
02:28:22.570 --> 02:28:27.350
It's usually,
it's a tournament.
Oh yeah.
They're going after leg locks.

2601
02:28:27.470 --> 02:28:31.310
I as as the Sambas are devastating with this freaking legs,
man.
Yeah,

2602
02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:34.760
that's true.
That's all that.
Oh,
like chick Tara does.

2603
02:28:34.761 --> 02:28:37.970
John Joc though that that just did a John Jock in the blue.

2604
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:41.350
I remember Hickson was wearing this.
You remember the color for shorts?

2605
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:44.960
He was wearing the one,
the one tournament that I saw,

2606
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:47.900
there was a blonde Russian guy that was pretty much kicking everyone's ass and

2607
02:28:47.901 --> 02:28:50.120
then a Hickson was wearing this,

2608
02:28:50.121 --> 02:28:54.710
a multicolored shorts that he was famous for that beach and beach fight in Rio

2609
02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:58.910
when he fought you go Duarte.
Yeah,
there's this is Hagen.

2610
02:28:59.180 --> 02:29:02.810
He getting in his day was a bad motherfucker.
All my guys still is probably.
Yeah.

2611
02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:07.220
I haven't seen in a way and he's a big guy now,
but yeah.
That's interesting.

2612
02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:08.360
That was very interesting.

2613
02:29:09.470 --> 02:29:12.530
How familiar are you with prolotherapy?

2614
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:16.370
I don't know much about it or maybe I knew it by another name.

2615
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:19.130
Proliferation therapy.
Prolotherapy is a,

2616
02:29:19.131 --> 02:29:24.131
the inject this glucose solution into joints into into ligaments and it actually

2617
02:29:24.561 --> 02:29:25.670
thickens the ligaments.

2618
02:29:25.710 --> 02:29:29.300
That's interesting because I have read a lot about the hydrochloric acid that

2619
02:29:29.301 --> 02:29:32.480
they inject into joints for osteoarthritis and so forth.

2620
02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:36.290
I think that it works on a similar way,

2621
02:29:36.291 --> 02:29:40.910
I think to a kind of hydrate the,
the connected tissue in there.

2622
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:45.390
Um,
what I was bringing it up is because I knew a dude who,
uh,

2623
02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:47.930
used to get it done,
even though he didn't have injuries,

2624
02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:49.910
he would get it done on his elbows,
on his knees,

2625
02:29:49.911 --> 02:29:53.180
just to thicken up and strengthened the tag,
the tendons and ligaments,

2626
02:29:53.450 --> 02:29:57.890
just a for training because a,
apparently it can strengthen it as much as 40%.

2627
02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:01.100
Well,
that's pretty impressive.
That's very impressive.
Right?
Wow.
Yeah,

2628
02:30:01.101 --> 02:30:04.580
and they would,
it wouldn't you inject it.
It's really painful.

2629
02:30:04.610 --> 02:30:06.380
I had it done on my knee and I hadn't done on my wrist.

2630
02:30:06.381 --> 02:30:10.340
It did wonders for my wrist.
I broke my wrist when I was a kickboxing,

2631
02:30:10.341 --> 02:30:15.341
like in 1988 or 89 if fucked with me for a long time until I got this

2632
02:30:17.181 --> 02:30:20.710
prolotherapy on it and whatever it did,
it really wasn't right.
Yeah.
I mean,

2633
02:30:20.711 --> 02:30:23.000
it went away a little bit on its own.
It got better on its own,

2634
02:30:23.001 --> 02:30:24.530
but it would click all the time and it would just,

2635
02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:27.260
it would ache after I would train for a long time.

2636
02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:30.230
But this prolotherapy somehow or another,

2637
02:30:30.231 --> 02:30:32.750
by injecting it directly into the ligaments,

2638
02:30:32.751 --> 02:30:36.440
it forces the ligaments to swell and then stepped something sorta like the

2639
02:30:36.441 --> 02:30:39.110
hydraulic has it now.
There's these states tasted thick.

2640
02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:42.410
There's another therapy that a lot of people don't know of.
But back in the 70s,

2641
02:30:42.411 --> 02:30:46.710
it was huge.
It's the Dso,
dimethyl sulfur oxide.
Uh,

2642
02:30:46.711 --> 02:30:49.520
I'm a big advocate of this stuff and you can still buy it.

2643
02:30:49.521 --> 02:30:52.150
And some health food stores.
Why did they stop selling that?
Well,

2644
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:57.370
the FDA at one point wanted the big pharma companies can't make any money on it.

2645
02:30:57.381 --> 02:30:58.340
They can't do it in the patent.

2646
02:30:58.580 --> 02:31:03.440
And this is about the time when all the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs,

2647
02:31:03.441 --> 02:31:06.530
you know,
like I per profit or Advil or whatever,
you know,

2648
02:31:06.531 --> 02:31:07.400
it was coming into play.

2649
02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:10.730
So they put the Chi Bosch in this stuff and got them to ban it.

2650
02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:13.490
And then at some point,

2651
02:31:13.491 --> 02:31:17.230
I guess the ban lifted or whatever and it became popular again.
But I,

2652
02:31:17.231 --> 02:31:20.100
I remember like hearing like some of my age had aunts

2653
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:24.450
<v 4>and uncles talking to me about dms.
Oh.
When as a kid and wow,</v>

2654
02:31:24.451 --> 02:31:29.370
this stuff works and it works well and uh,
yeah,
it's like for horses,
right?

2655
02:31:29.430 --> 02:31:29.641
Yeah.

2656
02:31:29.641 --> 02:31:34.230
They used to use it as a limit for race horses and you put it topically on the

2657
02:31:34.231 --> 02:31:37.890
skin and has this unique property of sinking right through into the connective

2658
02:31:37.891 --> 02:31:42.710
tissues and it has an amazing antiinflammatory effect at a,

2659
02:31:42.780 --> 02:31:47.150
really helps the body,
uh,
with its own healing process.
Yeah.

2660
02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.520
I remember guys used to use it back in the,
uh,

2661
02:31:49.580 --> 02:31:52.530
the taekwondo days when they would get injuries to their feet,

2662
02:31:52.590 --> 02:31:55.620
like kicking things,
kick elbows and stuff like that.

2663
02:31:55.621 --> 02:31:59.000
Guys would rub it on their feet and their shins.
Things along those lines.
Yeah,
I,

2664
02:31:59.230 --> 02:32:02.730
I'm using it now.
I hadn't used it for years,
but I decided to try it again.

2665
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:06.750
I've been putting on the shoulder had been bothering me and wow.

2666
02:32:06.810 --> 02:32:10.290
I can't believe it's just one week.
How much better the shoulder feels,

2667
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:12.980
more pain free.
That has been in a while and it,

2668
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:15.790
which makes me wonder why I wasn't doing it early,

2669
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:20.550
but say when I was doing it before I was still doing the kettlebell snatches and

2670
02:32:20.551 --> 02:32:21.270
I become a,

2671
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:25.740
a bit of a critic about the Kettlebell snatch as an exercise.

2672
02:32:25.950 --> 02:32:28.770
I think it puts an awful lot of trauma on the wrist,
elbow,

2673
02:32:28.771 --> 02:32:32.250
and shoulder for no good reason.
You know,
people say,
oh,

2674
02:32:32.251 --> 02:32:35.850
the snatches depending ultimate left and Kettlebell,
the and all this and that.

2675
02:32:36.210 --> 02:32:39.090
Man,
I can't tell you how many people I've seen injured themselves.

2676
02:32:39.330 --> 02:32:42.840
I'm not talking about people using crappy technique using the technique,

2677
02:32:42.930 --> 02:32:45.210
you know,
really good technique and still suffering,

2678
02:32:45.250 --> 02:32:49.740
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid problems.
I mean,
you think about it,

2679
02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:53.940
you take a heavy weight and you continuously throw it over your head

2680
02:32:54.330 --> 02:32:58.020
continuously over time.
And of course you're going to get repeated trauma.

2681
02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:02.790
What about presses?
No precedent.
Fantastic.
So you think that,
what is the,

2682
02:33:02.791 --> 02:33:06.690
about the motion while you're swinging this kettlebell overhead and it suddenly

2683
02:33:06.691 --> 02:33:10.560
stops and you get all this,
this uh,
loading of the,

2684
02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:13.770
the connective tissues at the top,
it's like a dead stop.

2685
02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:16.380
The momentum and you know,

2686
02:33:16.381 --> 02:33:20.430
I mean there's always people that can seem to seem to waltz through life doing

2687
02:33:20.431 --> 02:33:25.410
these type of lips and so forth.
But yeah,
it seems to skate through it.
But man,

2688
02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:30.440
there's thousands of people that suffer and I think all of the benefits of the

2689
02:33:30.721 --> 02:33:33.660
snatch can be certainly had in the swing.
You don't need to,

2690
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:38.580
to traumatize your shoulders in order to get benefits from,
from the kettle,

2691
02:33:38.581 --> 02:33:41.520
the swing where it stays horizontal.
Yeah,
exactly.

2692
02:33:41.730 --> 02:33:45.240
There's a momentum just dies out.
It's all,
it's all hip and button,

2693
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:49.200
hamstrings lower back and you've,
you know,
you've generated the force.
So,

2694
02:33:49.350 --> 02:33:52.710
you know,
for me,
I was really into the snatch thing for longest time,

2695
02:33:52.980 --> 02:33:54.960
but it was definitely a traumatizing my shoulder.

2696
02:33:55.380 --> 02:33:59.530
What other exercises do you think maybe should be avoided?
Kettlebell exercise.

2697
02:33:59.540 --> 02:34:02.790
I'm beginning to think that the windmill with really heavy weights is it should

2698
02:34:02.791 --> 02:34:04.350
be avoided.
That's really,
yeah.

2699
02:34:04.351 --> 02:34:06.720
I mean I'm not talking about like just doing it with lighter weights,

2700
02:34:07.050 --> 02:34:10.490
but some of these guys,
you know,
they're,
they're into 40 kilogram kit.
Uh,

2701
02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:15.690
Ken about that's the 90 pounds.
Uh,
what is it,
like 88 pounds?

2702
02:34:15.691 --> 02:34:18.000
I think that's pretty,
yeah,
they

2703
02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.110
<v 2>are needed to subject your,
your body.</v>

2704
02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:24.430
It's like a rotation and a twist.
The spine.

2705
02:34:24.431 --> 02:34:27.490
So you gotta be really careful with the,
when you're loading up these,

2706
02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:30.490
these type of Flexi bendy postures like that.

2707
02:34:30.970 --> 02:34:35.390
A lot of the overhead squat stuff,
I mean,
you know,
just cause he can discuss,

2708
02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:38.620
you can do it doesn't mean you should,
you know,
I was going to,

2709
02:34:38.621 --> 02:34:40.870
a guy was saying that a for shoulder stability,

2710
02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:43.810
that it's really great one because of the fact that it's got all this twist to

2711
02:34:43.811 --> 02:34:44.830
it.
You know,
that you're,

2712
02:34:45.460 --> 02:34:48.960
I mean the getup is going to get all that everything the window does to kind of

2713
02:34:48.961 --> 02:34:53.170
get us even better.
Plus you get the benefit of moving your body from the ground,

2714
02:34:53.230 --> 02:34:54.790
standing up and back down and so forth.

2715
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:58.240
The window has a weird sort of hamstring thing going on with it though.
Oh yeah,

2716
02:34:58.241 --> 02:35:01.600
for sure.
Because I get a lot of hamstring soreness when I do heavy windows.

2717
02:35:01.700 --> 02:35:04.990
But yeah,
you're,
you're lengthening of the hamstrings out really good.
So it's,

2718
02:35:04.991 --> 02:35:06.160
you know,
quite a severe stretch,

2719
02:35:06.161 --> 02:35:09.910
like a form of gloated stretching or weighted stretching and so forth.

2720
02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:13.870
But I mean,
if you're really,
if you're really wanting to get down to brass tacks,

2721
02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:16.690
if you're pretty much just doing getups and swings,

2722
02:35:16.691 --> 02:35:18.670
you pretty much had the perfect workout right there.

2723
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:23.120
You don't need a whole lot else.
Just get up swings.
What about presses?
Well,

2724
02:35:23.150 --> 02:35:26.230
presses are always a good thing,
but I mean,
he can do presses,
but anyway,
right,

2725
02:35:26.231 --> 02:35:30.040
you can do handstand pushups,
you can do dumbbell barbell.
But yeah,

2726
02:35:30.041 --> 02:35:32.950
kettlebell about presses a fantastic exercise.
There's no doubt about it.

2727
02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:34.420
And I think the,
uh,

2728
02:35:34.470 --> 02:35:39.370
Kate about double front squat is a beautiful way to squat.

2729
02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:41.170
Um,
the,
the,

2730
02:35:41.171 --> 02:35:45.380
the double front squat where you claim two kettlebells and you hold it in what's

2731
02:35:45.490 --> 02:35:48.480
referred to this as the rack position and do squats.

2732
02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:53.110
It's a really user friendly way of doing it.
That's what I do.

2733
02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:57.010
All My,
my squats that I do with weights,
I do them all that way.

2734
02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:58.750
I was using the squat rack,

2735
02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:03.370
but I felt like it's harder to do it this way and I feel like I'm engaging my

2736
02:36:03.371 --> 02:36:06.840
core more because I'm keeping him in front of me.
Absolutely.
I,

2737
02:36:06.870 --> 02:36:09.040
your posture has to be correct to do it.

2738
02:36:09.041 --> 02:36:12.310
So I just went with all of them and I just do with two seventies,

2739
02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:14.740
I just use to 70 and my age now.
I see no reason to.

2740
02:36:14.830 --> 02:36:17.920
My sister's right there to load my spine up with a really,

2741
02:36:17.921 --> 02:36:20.950
really my friend Mike Waller,
he was a strong dude.
Oh my God.

2742
02:36:20.951 --> 02:36:22.180
Mike is ridiculously so,

2743
02:36:22.181 --> 02:36:26.110
and a Vegan to anyone that thinks you can't be strong and be a Vegan.

2744
02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:31.150
Just check out Mike.
Ridiculously strong and Vegan for,
I mean he's,

2745
02:36:31.151 --> 02:36:31.984
you know,

2746
02:36:32.110 --> 02:36:35.890
he's really dedicated your whole lifestyle of being in a vacant and very

2747
02:36:35.891 --> 02:36:38.650
knowledgeable and not even annoying about it then.
No,
not at all.

2748
02:36:39.070 --> 02:36:41.260
Now he doesn't push his agenda whatsoever.
No,
it's great.

2749
02:36:41.290 --> 02:36:44.890
If anything people ask him.
Yeah.
Well you are,
um,
your website.

2750
02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:48.490
What do you have on there as far as,
I know that you develop,
uh,

2751
02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:52.980
you have like people that you train online,
you develop programs for them.
I go,

2752
02:36:53.130 --> 02:36:55.510
how does that work and how could someone sign up for that?
Well,

2753
02:36:55.511 --> 02:36:59.170
I called up my freedom business because I could do it pretty much anywhere in

2754
02:36:59.171 --> 02:36:59.471
the world.

2755
02:36:59.471 --> 02:37:03.300
That's one reason why I'm able to keep up my nomadic existence because,
you know,

2756
02:37:03.310 --> 02:37:05.830
as long as I have Wifi,
I'm good to go.

2757
02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:09.040
I still have the 62 liter drum or whatever.

2758
02:37:09.041 --> 02:37:12.510
They'll say she five liter spray bag.
Yeah.

2759
02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.280
By my girlfriend's beat me now.
She just down downsize

2760
02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:20.710
<v 4>to a 45 later.
She said,
dammit.
Since when to,
you know,
you have a,</v>

2761
02:37:20.711 --> 02:37:23.720
a woman traveling with less stuff than a guy.
That's ridiculous.

2762
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:27.260
Of course I have workout equipment in my bag.
So,
uh,
well there you go.

2763
02:37:27.261 --> 02:37:29.740
Abdominal wheel rubber band suspension.

2764
02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:31.090
<v 0>Keep an AB wheel with you.</v>

2765
02:37:31.091 --> 02:37:33.670
Out of all the things you can keep with you and ab wheel is that important?

2766
02:37:33.671 --> 02:37:34.230
They decided

2767
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:36.930
<v 4>I like it.
You know what I mean?
It's so light and you know,</v>

2768
02:37:36.931 --> 02:37:41.550
and I used the I a motto,
a task with it,
the little,

2769
02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:43.140
the little bar that you use for it.

2770
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:46.200
I use it with my rubber band to do rubber band,
Desert Wilson.

2771
02:37:46.230 --> 02:37:50.430
Such a cool stuff he can do with that,
with that little handle.

2772
02:37:50.930 --> 02:37:53.930
<v 0>You,
you uh,
you showed me a bunch of stuff that you could do in hotel rooms.</v>

2773
02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:55.400
Like you throw a towel over it

2774
02:37:55.460 --> 02:37:58.730
<v 4>door.
Oh Hey chin ups off the door.
Oh,</v>

2775
02:37:58.731 --> 02:38:00.980
you're really truly need is just your body weight.

2776
02:38:01.130 --> 02:38:02.990
I just carry this stuff around cause I can,

2777
02:38:02.991 --> 02:38:07.330
but maybe I was dump it and go even warm and it was like a,
like Teresa,
you know.

2778
02:38:07.710 --> 02:38:11.370
<v 0>So how do you,
when you,
uh,
develop these programs for someone,
say I'm a,</v>

2779
02:38:11.371 --> 02:38:16.350
I'm Jamie over here who,
uh,
likes to exercise.
If you,
uh,
wanted to,
uh,

2780
02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:20.760
build a,
a program for someone,
what do you,
do you let them fill out a form?

2781
02:38:20.761 --> 02:38:22.500
How active are you?
How in shape?

2782
02:38:22.740 --> 02:38:26.490
<v 4>Oh yeah.
I mean,
first of all,
I want to make sure that I can help the gut.</v>

2783
02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:30.570
There's no sense of him wasting his time or money or may wasting my time with

2784
02:38:30.571 --> 02:38:31.500
the guy that I can't help.

2785
02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:34.980
So it sends me a little bio what it is he's interested in.

2786
02:38:35.340 --> 02:38:38.460
It gives me a chance to see if the guy has realistic goals and ideas.

2787
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:41.790
And if he's like way out there,
you know,

2788
02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:43.920
maybe he'd be better off going to somebody else.

2789
02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:48.450
But if he's pretty much in line with what I think I can do as far as helping the

2790
02:38:48.451 --> 02:38:51.420
guy,
the next step then is I send them a questionnaire,

2791
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:53.400
which is extensive lifestyle questionnaire.

2792
02:38:53.730 --> 02:38:58.470
Everything from you know your work too.
You know,
I almost like that era.

2793
02:38:58.471 --> 02:39:03.000
Vedic tests you took,
you know,
I want to know.
And then he sends me a diet log.

2794
02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:06.720
I want to see what he's putting in his body and then I send a fitness
assessment.

2795
02:39:07.140 --> 02:39:11.790
In the meantime he takes three photos.
No unposed just like in a pair of shorts.

2796
02:39:11.791 --> 02:39:12.960
So I can look at this structure.

2797
02:39:13.230 --> 02:39:17.790
I particularly need to see the feet and the knees and see how the guy standing,

2798
02:39:17.791 --> 02:39:22.140
his posture,
you know,
uh,
back front side.
So I need to look at his spine,

2799
02:39:22.141 --> 02:39:25.080
his shoulders and looking for is any structural stuff going on.

2800
02:39:25.530 --> 02:39:26.680
And based on those photos,

2801
02:39:26.681 --> 02:39:30.900
sometimes I'll have different fitness assessments cause before I can take him

2802
02:39:30.901 --> 02:39:34.260
where he thinks he wants to go,
I got to know where he's at.

2803
02:39:34.410 --> 02:39:37.680
Do you watch him do a video?
Do you like make I sometimes,
yeah,
sometimes.

2804
02:39:37.681 --> 02:39:40.500
But for the most part,
you know it's unnecessary.

2805
02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:42.240
Once he does this fitness assessment,

2806
02:39:42.241 --> 02:39:47.160
I have a really good handle on where he's at and then I'll send them a program

2807
02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:51.630
and then he sends a training log in anywhere between once a week to some people

2808
02:39:51.631 --> 02:39:56.631
are like to send something every day and they have recovery days after recovery

2809
02:39:56.730 --> 02:39:58.980
days as long as uh,
as well as their workouts.

2810
02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.860
A lot of the guys that are participating in Jujitsu,

2811
02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:04.380
some guys are participating in MMA,

2812
02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:09.480
but a lot of the guys are just regular guys,
businessmen,
business women,

2813
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:11.640
housewives.
They just want to be healthy.

2814
02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:16.470
How many clients do you have that you do with?
Right now I haven't counted,

2815
02:40:16.471 --> 02:40:20.800
but it's close to 60 I know there's a lot of time on that.

2816
02:40:21.130 --> 02:40:25.600
A lot of hours a day,
man.
How many hours a day do you do that for?
I,
you know,

2817
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:30.020
I don't,
I don't track cause it's different each day.
Some days it's like six,

2818
02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:32.340
eight hours.
Other days it's like three or four.

2819
02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:34.050
Depends on how many logs to come in.

2820
02:40:34.350 --> 02:40:37.740
But I tried to have a turnaround time of never more than 24 hours.

2821
02:40:37.741 --> 02:40:41.400
But it's all you.
It's just me.
So you don't ever go on vacation,

2822
02:40:41.430 --> 02:40:46.090
like you don't say,
Hey,
I'm taking a week off for life.
Yeah.
Wow.
But I like it.

2823
02:40:46.170 --> 02:40:50.190
Say it's different.
So your life is kind of a big question.
Anything.
I'll be like,

2824
02:40:50.191 --> 02:40:53.640
I'm leaving from here to Ikaria Greece.
Whoa.

2825
02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:57.510
In the GNC off the coast of Turkey.
Beautiful,

2826
02:40:57.870 --> 02:41:02.140
pristine little quiet island.
A lot of people never heard him.
And uh,

2827
02:41:02.850 --> 02:41:04.860
it's named after the mythological figure,

2828
02:41:04.861 --> 02:41:09.840
Icarus that flew too close to the sun with his wings and plunged into the ocean.

2829
02:41:10.110 --> 02:41:14.820
His wings melted or something.
Wings melted.
Well,
this,
uh,
island,
uh,
uh,

2830
02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:19.350
uncle had to be there for three weeks doing it like a lifestyle training camp

2831
02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:23.340
and the Wifi is a little sketchy,
but uh,
I'll be okay.

2832
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:28.670
So I'll be doing my iPad while looking out at the beautiful blue a GNC or uh,

2833
02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:32.370
you know,
I was in a high rise in Sydney.
You're looking out over the harbor.

2834
02:41:32.371 --> 02:41:33.630
So it's,
you know,

2835
02:41:33.631 --> 02:41:37.830
it's pretty easy to do your work when you pick really nice places like that.

2836
02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:42.330
So when you,
plus I love donuts so it's not like a chore or anything.
It's,

2837
02:41:42.390 --> 02:41:47.040
I really enjoy communicating with these people and I,
you know,

2838
02:41:47.041 --> 02:41:48.510
you almost become friends,
you,

2839
02:41:48.570 --> 02:41:51.330
you kind of sometimes like I'll meet them at seminars,

2840
02:41:51.331 --> 02:41:54.390
which is always really cold,
you know,
to,
to actually meet the person.

2841
02:41:54.810 --> 02:41:58.590
But you really develop a closeness and a camaraderie through the,

2842
02:41:58.890 --> 02:42:00.780
through the emails.
That's interesting.

2843
02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:03.300
When you go to a place where they speak a different language,

2844
02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:06.170
do you have a translator?
Like how do you,
how do you have a universe?

2845
02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:10.830
Like I just got back from Russia not too long ago.
I was in Novosibirsk,

2846
02:42:11.250 --> 02:42:16.020
that's the very heart of Russia.
Remember that Guy Alexander Karelin?

2847
02:42:16.050 --> 02:42:20.310
Yes.
He,
that's where he's from.
It's what a scary fuck that guy,

2848
02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:24.960
that guy up Alexandra [inaudible] amazing photos.
Most of crazy,

2849
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:28.980
scariest Reza.
People would turn themselves over and pinned themselves.

2850
02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:31.830
So not to be thrown with his patented gut wrenched throw.

2851
02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:35.490
There would be fee belly down and he would get his hands underneath them and

2852
02:42:35.491 --> 02:42:38.940
take a 250 pound man and he was like,

2853
02:42:39.050 --> 02:42:41.280
like nothing and smashed them under the ground.

2854
02:42:41.310 --> 02:42:45.210
So there is in Novosibirsk the Russian experiment,

2855
02:42:45.750 --> 02:42:49.260
he uh,
no one spoke any English whatsoever.

2856
02:42:49.950 --> 02:42:54.090
So I have a universal translator,
my iPad and iPhone that I can

2857
02:42:55.740 --> 02:43:00.740
write a question down and then show it in Russian and then hit a button and

2858
02:43:01.441 --> 02:43:06.060
change the keyboard to Russian and then they can type back and be in English so

2859
02:43:06.061 --> 02:43:09.810
you can communicate with this modern technology.
That's crazy though.

2860
02:43:09.811 --> 02:43:12.160
But like what if you want to get something eat or you want

2861
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:15.040
<v 3>to get a room in a hotel or something like that?
Yeah,</v>

2862
02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:16.230
<v 4>well usually we'll go to them.</v>

2863
02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:19.500
Usually hotel personnel do sound one there speaks English.

2864
02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:23.450
That's one of the nice things about being a u s citizen.
I mean I,

2865
02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:26.920
there's a lot of things I don't like about this country but it's still a super

2866
02:43:26.921 --> 02:43:31.050
power and it's still,
you know,
the,
the countries so to speak.

2867
02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:33.960
So most people speak English in these,

2868
02:43:34.050 --> 02:43:38.130
in these hotels because tourism is a real big thing for a lot of these places.

2869
02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:40.500
<v 3>That's so fascinating that you do though.</v>

2870
02:43:40.501 --> 02:43:43.250
You go from one place or another like that with no stops.

2871
02:43:43.490 --> 02:43:47.660
Like you don't watch none because you're living out of this 65 liter bag,

2872
02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:51.920
everything.
I,
you don't really have a place where you like,
well we're done work.

2873
02:43:52.130 --> 02:43:54.770
We're going to just hang out at home for a few days.
You don't,

2874
02:43:55.250 --> 02:43:57.150
there is no hope everywhere.
I'm at his home.

2875
02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:00.800
Do you foresee that for the rest of your life?
I mean,
you're 62 now.

2876
02:44:00.801 --> 02:44:05.300
Is that what you are at a 61 61 one and a half.
Give you an extra year there.

2877
02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:09.650
61 and a half like a kid.
I could a kid.
Um,
do you,

2878
02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:13.460
do you foresee living the rest of your life like that?
Yeah,
I mean,

2879
02:44:13.461 --> 02:44:14.780
I enjoy it that much.
I mean,

2880
02:44:15.290 --> 02:44:19.400
<v 4>really nice not to be tied down.
Once you get that,
that roaming spirit,</v>

2881
02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:21.490
I can't even imagine

2882
02:44:21.530 --> 02:44:25.130
<v 3>to settle it down.
But what about your body?
I mean you're,</v>

2883
02:44:25.131 --> 02:44:29.210
you're essentially teaching people health and physical fitness.

2884
02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:33.230
How long do you think you'll be able to do that for at 61 years old?

2885
02:44:33.231 --> 02:44:35.670
That's a very unusual to,

2886
02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:39.530
for someone to be teaching people how to lift weights and exercise.
And I mean,

2887
02:44:39.531 --> 02:44:41.030
I've seen some of the shit that you've done.

2888
02:44:41.210 --> 02:44:45.050
Somebody posted a video of you working out with those guys that do the round

2889
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:48.590
workouts,
which is an incredible,
those guys I got a year ago,
man,
that was,

2890
02:44:49.010 --> 02:44:50.950
the guys are so fit.
I mean,
it stays,

2891
02:44:50.951 --> 02:44:54.550
it's amazing watching some of those playground workouts that those guys do.

2892
02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:56.660
Urban gymnastics.
Yeah.
They have no legs though.

2893
02:44:56.661 --> 02:44:59.300
You ever notice that little skinny ass fucking toothpick legs.

2894
02:44:59.540 --> 02:45:01.280
The other thing too,
a lot of these guys are

2895
02:45:01.290 --> 02:45:04.870
<v 4>or hurt a lot.
You know,</v>

2896
02:45:04.900 --> 02:45:06.600
it puts a lot of stress in your body,
right?

2897
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:10.650
It's not necessarily the kind of thing that you'd want to do,

2898
02:45:11.190 --> 02:45:14.130
<v 3>but I mean,
it's amazing how these guys,</v>

2899
02:45:14.131 --> 02:45:17.610
I mean essentially they're just doing this for their own fun,
right?
I mean,

2900
02:45:17.900 --> 02:45:22.070
they lobbied fabs,
will they,
that that is incredible as a stone dude.
Huh?

2901
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:24.300
It's that guy can put his legs up there in the air.

2902
02:45:24.450 --> 02:45:26.490
What do they do for their lower Bonnie though?

2903
02:45:26.850 --> 02:45:29.730
There's so much upper body stuff and all these exercises.

2904
02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:32.220
You very rarely see them doing lower bodies.

2905
02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:37.330
<v 4>Yeah.
She has actually said,
ah,
you know what they did for the lower body.
But uh,</v>

2906
02:45:38.020 --> 02:45:40.540
I mean for sure what they do is pretty amazing,

2907
02:45:40.541 --> 02:45:45.520
but might not be the best way to go for especially people over 40 because the

2908
02:45:45.521 --> 02:45:46.670
joint trauma,
you know,

2909
02:45:46.940 --> 02:45:50.260
cause remember there's the difference between working for strength and

2910
02:45:50.261 --> 02:45:55.261
demonstrating strain and doing feats and stents versus just regular exercise.

2911
02:45:56.280 --> 02:45:59.440
And it's Thompson feeds to take its toll over time.
You know,

2912
02:45:59.441 --> 02:46:01.090
like Olympic lifting,
power lifting,

2913
02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:04.090
those guys are pretty bogged up by the time they get to their forties or 50s.

2914
02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:07.810
<v 3>So you consider what those guys are doing with this playground work?
A stunt.</v>

2915
02:46:08.170 --> 02:46:10.040
Yeah.
I mean the whole thing is built towards

2916
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:14.680
<v 2>developing these tricks,
right.
To show that like that's incredible.
Yeah.
The,</v>

2917
02:46:14.681 --> 02:46:17.060
the ability to hold your legs up like that.

2918
02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:20.540
Like folks don't know what kind of core strength that required.
That requires.

2919
02:46:20.570 --> 02:46:24.750
Incredible.
Man doing that stripper thing where you're on the pole.
Yeah.

2920
02:46:25.310 --> 02:46:30.260
I mean,
it's no joke.
These guys are incredibly fit for that.
They,
they truly,

2921
02:46:30.261 --> 02:46:34.670
oh,
that's amazing.
These flags are just like,
wow,
it's so hard to do.

2922
02:46:34.970 --> 02:46:38.960
It's really hard to do.
But the torque and the pressure on your shoulders.

2923
02:46:39.470 --> 02:46:43.950
Yeah.
Incredible.
Well,
look at you and not bad for an old guy.

2924
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:46.400
Not Bad at all,
quite as high as that guy was,

2925
02:46:46.470 --> 02:46:49.820
but amazing that you never did this before.
And I hear you're doing that.
Nah,

2926
02:46:49.821 --> 02:46:51.650
I'd never done any of this stuff.
You know,
most,

2927
02:46:51.651 --> 02:46:54.490
most of my training was all geared towards,
uh,

2928
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:58.940
trying to make myself a better wrestler and,
or better Jujitsu fighter.

2929
02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:02.670
So it's a slightly different energy system and a whole different emphasis with

2930
02:47:02.671 --> 02:47:03.504
the workout.
So

2931
02:47:05.390 --> 02:47:10.390
that's incredible that these guys have developed a sort of a way to work out on

2932
02:47:10.491 --> 02:47:13.760
these playground workouts that has gone worldwide.
I mean,

2933
02:47:13.761 --> 02:47:16.600
there's so many of these people that,
oh yeah,
there's the bars,

2934
02:47:16.610 --> 02:47:19.470
stars and then there's,
when it was in Australia,
there was the,
uh,

2935
02:47:20.110 --> 02:47:23.710
<v 4>what was it?
The,
uh,
the bar's bese down in Bondai beach,</v>

2936
02:47:23.711 --> 02:47:28.630
these Australian guys that well,
you know,
so,
and every country,

2937
02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:30.310
especially the poorer countries,
you know,

2938
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:33.880
most of these outdoor playgrounds and gems are pretty available to a lot of

2939
02:47:33.881 --> 02:47:37.150
these guys.
Where as they couldn't even afford a regular commercial gym.
Right.

2940
02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:41.200
But I was in Russia,
I was really pleasantly surprised.

2941
02:47:41.740 --> 02:47:46.090
You could find a pull up bar and dip bar everywhere.
Not for kids,

2942
02:47:46.210 --> 02:47:49.840
for adults.
And you'd see people using them.
I mean,

2943
02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:51.760
just all over the place like this,
this,

2944
02:47:51.930 --> 02:47:54.700
she's doing dip bars and pull up bars and all that kind of stuff.

2945
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:58.210
That's incredible.
Pretty incredible.
Incredible stuff on it.

2946
02:47:58.860 --> 02:48:01.780
<v 2>Yeah.
This is amazing.
This guy's hanging on this other guy.</v>

2947
02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:06.270
Some of these guys are crazy strong.
Yeah.
But in a lot of these eastern,
yeah.

2948
02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:09.210
<v 4>All countries that,
you know,
they,
they don't have a lot to do,
you know,</v>

2949
02:48:09.390 --> 02:48:13.530
and they're not big guys are looking at us then why really?
But you know,

2950
02:48:13.650 --> 02:48:16.530
bodyweight training has a way of kind of,
I mean,

2951
02:48:16.531 --> 02:48:19.680
obviously different physique types are going to be attracted to different

2952
02:48:19.681 --> 02:48:20.514
activities.

2953
02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:24.810
A lot of times people have this mistaken notion that if I do this,

2954
02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:27.120
I'm going to look like this.
In reality,

2955
02:48:27.121 --> 02:48:32.000
the physique type has success at a particular activity and then stays with

2956
02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:33.510
Brian,
for example,

2957
02:48:33.511 --> 02:48:38.511
women often like a wants to do dance because they want to look like a dancer,

2958
02:48:38.940 --> 02:48:43.080
but if you don't have that proportionate dancers type body to begin with,

2959
02:48:43.290 --> 02:48:45.900
you'll never be successful at dance.

2960
02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:49.510
<v 2>Right?
Look,
if you're short and squat and you have big thick legs,</v>

2961
02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:52.210
<v 4>exactly,
Eh,
I don't care how much dance you do,</v>

2962
02:48:52.211 --> 02:48:55.960
you're never going to develop the long lean vines of a a dancer.

2963
02:48:56.470 --> 02:48:59.140
And the same thing with the urban gymnastics,
you know,

2964
02:48:59.170 --> 02:49:03.070
really big boned guys flair,
laying heavy legs,

2965
02:49:03.310 --> 02:49:06.370
they're never going to be successful.
That's how activity,
no matter what they do,

2966
02:49:06.750 --> 02:49:09.890
is just as,
they wouldn't be able to do what the football player does.

2967
02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:13.260
<v 0>Isn't it also a case for guys that want to compete in MMA,</v>

2968
02:49:13.290 --> 02:49:15.720
like those big bulky football player type dudes,

2969
02:49:15.750 --> 02:49:18.060
they're never going to be able to have good endurance,

2970
02:49:18.630 --> 02:49:20.900
<v 4>really hard for those guys,
you know,
because I,
you know,
they're,</v>

2971
02:49:20.901 --> 02:49:22.840
they're kind of like it just naturally fast,

2972
02:49:22.841 --> 02:49:27.200
which guys with a well anaerobic endurance levels and no matter how much they

2973
02:49:27.201 --> 02:49:28.730
train for endurance,

2974
02:49:29.060 --> 02:49:33.110
they're always going to be lacking in that particular department.
You know,

2975
02:49:33.950 --> 02:49:38.600
different.
Uh,
the cool thing about combat martial arts though,
uh,

2976
02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:39.830
and combat sport,

2977
02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:43.490
there's a whole array of physique types of seem to do pretty well.

2978
02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:47.990
You have like little fireplug guys at two pretty good who some are Paul Horez

2979
02:49:48.050 --> 02:49:52.880
and then tall,
thin wirey kinda guides.
Yeah,
exactly that too.
Wow.

2980
02:49:52.881 --> 02:49:55.280
So you find like what's good for your,

2981
02:49:55.281 --> 02:49:58.790
you start to develop a style for your particular physique type and all that,

2982
02:49:58.820 --> 02:50:03.320
which makes combat martial arts different than any other sport in the planet

2983
02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:07.850
because you won't find a big riff is each playing NBA basketball for example.

2984
02:50:08.210 --> 02:50:11.030
They're all tall guy.
Occasionally you'll see a little guy but rare.

2985
02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:14.540
You only see huge behemoths playing NFL football.

2986
02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:19.670
Once in a while you might have some little guy,
but he's like one in millions.

2987
02:50:19.671 --> 02:50:20.151
You know what I mean?

2988
02:50:20.151 --> 02:50:24.710
They can make it so it's the sport attracts the physique type.

2989
02:50:25.100 --> 02:50:30.100
These people are good at it because they had the body that does well with that

2990
02:50:30.201 --> 02:50:31.130
particular activity.

2991
02:50:31.460 --> 02:50:35.360
<v 0>It's interesting when you see a guy who was an elite football player or</v>

2992
02:50:35.361 --> 02:50:39.860
something like that get into MMA,
their bodies change there.
They slim down,

2993
02:50:39.861 --> 02:50:41.780
they become a little little.
There's still big and bulky.

2994
02:50:41.781 --> 02:50:43.580
They become a little bit smaller.
We'll,

2995
02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:46.610
the guy who's freaked me out the most is Herschel Walker.

2996
02:50:46.670 --> 02:50:50.540
That was pretty amazing because he was like 47 or something when he started

2997
02:50:50.541 --> 02:50:52.400
finding Ken.
I know,
man.
Yeah,

2998
02:50:52.940 --> 02:50:57.940
just Yo Uhg at 47 shredded six pack and just throwing guys around and training

2999
02:51:01.041 --> 02:51:05.720
at Aka.
I mean wasn't looking that that's him at like 48 years old fighting in

3000
02:51:05.721 --> 02:51:10.490
Strikeforce.
That's pretty remarkable,
isn't it?
What a super athlete that guy was,

3001
02:51:10.491 --> 02:51:15.380
wouldn't have been incredible to see him as a 20 something year old competing in

3002
02:51:15.381 --> 02:51:17.330
the UFC for sure.
Boy

3003
02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:23.720
<v 4>with his genetic propensity for size and strength and endurance and explosivity,</v>

3004
02:51:24.260 --> 02:51:28.430
they would probably wouldn't be drawn to mixed martial arts because of the money

3005
02:51:28.431 --> 02:51:32.720
factor.
I don't know,
make like 10 times the money playing NFL football

3006
02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:36.340
<v 0>probably,
but he probably could have made that kind of money.</v>

3007
02:51:36.410 --> 02:51:39.200
Look at the fucking sides.
That guy 48 years old,

3008
02:51:39.470 --> 02:51:42.690
he could have probably made that kind of money doing anything cause he's so,

3009
02:51:42.890 --> 02:51:47.390
he would've been so dominant,
successful at almost any sport.
You're,
you are,

3010
02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:48.440
you do have a point there.

3011
02:51:48.441 --> 02:51:53.441
How does a guy stay that big look at the size of him at 48 years of age without

3012
02:51:54.711 --> 02:51:58.640
lifting weights because that's what he always claimed.
He always claimed it.

3013
02:51:58.641 --> 02:52:01.370
Everything he did was body weight.
Do you think that's bullshit?

3014
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:06.010
<v 4>I,
you know,
I just don't know.
Uh,
I,
I really couldn't that one way or</v>

3015
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:10.420
<v 3>another.
Uh,
but there's a lot of people have called bullshit on him.</v>

3016
02:52:10.450 --> 02:52:13.750
There's no doubt that bodyweight training can make you pretty,

3017
02:52:13.751 --> 02:52:17.100
pretty muscular and oh yeah.
Well those bars,
stars guys.
Yeah,

3018
02:52:17.430 --> 02:52:20.140
they're really yolked up,
man.
Look at that.
That's him when he was younger.

3019
02:52:20.200 --> 02:52:22.990
That's a good picture.
Thank you Jamie.
Perfect picture.

3020
02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:27.160
How the fuck does that guy become that other guy?
Show that other picture again.

3021
02:52:27.910 --> 02:52:30.310
How the fuck does the other,
those two,

3022
02:52:30.430 --> 02:52:33.180
one is the young guy and one's the old guy.
Why?

3023
02:52:33.181 --> 02:52:36.660
You'd almost have to start suspecting some type of enhancement there.

3024
02:52:39.130 --> 02:52:41.410
Just go back to that other picture.
Jammy.
They'll picture of him.

3025
02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:44.740
Swole up and come on son.

3026
02:52:44.980 --> 02:52:49.750
One is when he's young and one is when he's 48 and they open a new tab and go

3027
02:52:49.751 --> 02:52:54.040
back and forth between the two photos and then may just not build that type of

3028
02:52:54.041 --> 02:52:55.990
physique.
I'm sorry.
Well he's doing,

3029
02:52:55.991 --> 02:52:59.020
obviously he's doing some sort of body weight conditioning,

3030
02:52:59.021 --> 02:53:02.380
strength and conditioning.
There's no doubt that he works really hard.
Yeah,

3031
02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:04.810
but the other thing about Herschel Walker,
that's really crazy.
As he said,

3032
02:53:04.811 --> 02:53:09.730
he eats like a bowl of soup and a salad every day and that's it.
Ah,

3033
02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:13.140
it's hard to hard.
I understand.
Double hard to believe,

3034
02:53:14.380 --> 02:53:16.320
but maybe,
I mean fucking,
you know,

3035
02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:21.210
I'm the guy that only slept three hours a night.
Who?
Dr Ken Listener.

3036
02:53:21.510 --> 02:53:25.530
Look at these two pictures.
Look at that one and then look at the other one.

3037
02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:29.490
Jamie,
do you want to do tabs?
You mother fucker too big.

3038
02:53:30.450 --> 02:53:35.200
Can you just go back and forth?
Look at that.
What the fuck man?

3039
02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:39.010
Jesus,
that's when he's young and here's when he's older.

3040
02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:44.350
I'm confused.
I get super confused.

3041
02:53:44.650 --> 02:53:46.940
I mean that looks like a guy who probably doesn't actually the way,

3042
02:53:46.960 --> 02:53:51.910
how long is he in that picture right there,
young?
1982 that's crazy.

3043
02:53:52.030 --> 02:53:56.740
So he would have been something now he might not have been too is true man

3044
02:53:56.741 --> 02:53:58.800
strength and so forth at that age.
Didn't want,

3045
02:53:58.801 --> 02:54:01.690
he's got some fucking man's drink going on right there Jody though.

3046
02:54:03.790 --> 02:54:07.570
And they say,
you know,
go,
he would go to Aka,
he works out with the team,

3047
02:54:07.571 --> 02:54:11.770
works out with everybody.
I don't know why he's not doing it anymore.
Well,

3048
02:54:12.130 --> 02:54:16.380
maybe he started having some joint problems and they,
you know,
there,
there,

3049
02:54:16.381 --> 02:54:19.360
there is a reason why there's a due date and cottage cheese,
you know,

3050
02:54:19.950 --> 02:54:23.290
I had a few jobs,
you know,
that's a good way of putting it.
You can't,
uh,

3051
02:54:23.291 --> 02:54:25.000
you can't out run father time.

3052
02:54:25.060 --> 02:54:29.080
He's so big at 48 with no body weight or no a weightlifting.

3053
02:54:29.260 --> 02:54:30.970
It seems like to be that big,

3054
02:54:30.971 --> 02:54:34.030
you'd have to throw some weights around you would think.
Yeah.
I mean,

3055
02:54:34.031 --> 02:54:36.820
I've never seen anyone go to that type of musculature that just did it and I'm

3056
02:54:36.830 --> 02:54:39.790
bodyweight training.
But that's not to say that maybe he,

3057
02:54:39.820 --> 02:54:44.050
maybe he's an exception to the rule.
You just might be that type of,
uh,
you know,

3058
02:54:44.170 --> 02:54:47.050
I had that type of genetics,
you know?
Yeah.
That is the other thing too,

3059
02:54:47.051 --> 02:54:51.680
is that some folk,
Larry is doing some body weight exercises.
Looks Damn good.

3060
02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:55.180
Even there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's,
he's not quite as ripped as he was back in the day,

3061
02:54:55.181 --> 02:54:59.020
but he hooks freaking phenomenal dude.
It was a super athlete.
I mean,

3062
02:54:59.350 --> 02:55:03.890
that's the thing about football is that they get the big super athletes,

3063
02:55:04.030 --> 02:55:08.480
<v 2>the really big guys,
strong guys,
they get your strongest,
fastest athletes,</v>

3064
02:55:08.481 --> 02:55:12.200
pretty much go NFL and this in this country.
I think it makes so much money.

3065
02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:14.960
I mean that's just what I mean.
Yeah.
That's where,
that's where the money is.

3066
02:55:14.961 --> 02:55:18.230
I mean,
NBA guys are pretty big too,
but they're taller and more ranger,
you know?

3067
02:55:18.231 --> 02:55:22.490
But the real power guys are just making him run sprints.

3068
02:55:22.730 --> 02:55:25.250
Jesus Christ.
That's not a sprinter with sides of them.

3069
02:55:25.251 --> 02:55:28.510
That's a God damn water buffalo.
But for sure,
you know,
I,

3070
02:55:28.530 --> 02:55:32.240
I've seen guys build a tremendous physiques just with bodyweight training.

3071
02:55:33.020 --> 02:55:35.300
One of my all time favorites was this guy.
What he strode,

3072
02:55:35.301 --> 02:55:39.380
he was the black gladiator and the original Spartacus opposite Kirk Douglas.

3073
02:55:39.410 --> 02:55:43.460
Oh Wow.
He strode.
He was at spell his last name.

3074
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:45.950
S.
T.
R.
O.
D.
E strode.

3075
02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:50.980
He was one of the original body weight trainers and a lot of people don't

3076
02:55:51.051 --> 02:55:51.561
realize,

3077
02:55:51.561 --> 02:55:55.910
but that fight scene in the original Spartacus with one of the most dangerous

3078
02:55:55.911 --> 02:55:57.840
fight scenes ever film,

3079
02:55:58.190 --> 02:56:02.240
they actually fought with real weapons and they had trained for three months,

3080
02:56:02.270 --> 02:56:04.040
according to Kirk Douglas,
his biography,

3081
02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:08.450
they had trained for three months with those weapons in order to put on that

3082
02:56:08.451 --> 02:56:12.230
fight scene.
And a strategy has had an a magnificent physique.

3083
02:56:12.270 --> 02:56:16.280
That's terrifying.
They use real weapons,
no weapons seen.
Yeah.

3084
02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:21.260
And they did the fight and they had rehearsed that magic three months now of

3085
02:56:21.261 --> 02:56:25.050
rehearsing and a stroad was uh,
uh,

3086
02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:28.310
also a stunt man.
Wow.

3087
02:56:28.370 --> 02:56:33.110
And that scene where he jumps up to remember,
he defies the,
the,

3088
02:56:33.140 --> 02:56:35.550
the uh,
the Roman patrician,
I don't remember the order.

3089
02:56:35.551 --> 02:56:39.590
A Sparty cause his death and a stroad runs up and grabs the wall and pulls

3090
02:56:39.591 --> 02:56:42.380
himself up.
He says he's probably the only stunt guy in Hollywood.

3091
02:56:42.381 --> 02:56:44.930
They could have pulled that off at that time.
It's like a 10 foot wall.

3092
02:56:44.931 --> 02:56:48.110
He jumps up there and grabs it with his fingers and it does like this kind of

3093
02:56:48.111 --> 02:56:49.070
like almost like a muscle up.

3094
02:56:49.071 --> 02:56:52.430
Like he's trying to get this guy cause he's defying Rome,
you know,

3095
02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:56.660
he refuses to kill the character of Spartacus.
Cool movie man.

3096
02:56:56.690 --> 02:57:01.190
Kirk Douglas was in pretty good shape back then to correct.
He did his training.

3097
02:57:01.191 --> 02:57:03.350
He was trained with what he at the time during the bodyweight journey.

3098
02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:07.880
Do you work out a with any other athletes at any other sports besides a,

3099
02:57:07.881 --> 02:57:11.750
I'm a May guys.
I know you've uh,
you know,
you've trained quite a few MMA guys.

3100
02:57:11.751 --> 02:57:15.260
Diego Sanchez,
he trained him influence only for is Bj Penn fight.

3101
02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:19.340
But what about other athletes and other sports?
I've changed a couple NFL guys,

3102
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:23.090
David acres,
they used to be the famous field goal kicker.

3103
02:57:23.390 --> 02:57:27.110
He used to come and do Jujitsu with us as well as do some conditioning work.

3104
02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:31.310
You have an issue with him where he was kicking with one leg all the time

3105
02:57:31.311 --> 02:57:33.760
because,
so he was developing problems.
A,
he,

3106
02:57:33.761 --> 02:57:37.430
he had a chronic hamstring pulls on his non kicking leg,

3107
02:57:37.431 --> 02:57:41.180
which was his right leg was his non kicking it like he was a left foot kicker.

3108
02:57:41.780 --> 02:57:46.490
And uh,
so at my suggestion and I said,
hey,
why not balance yourself out?

3109
02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:49.550
You're kicking like 50 kicks a day,

3110
02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:53.360
which is a lot of kicks but you're not doing anything for the other side.

3111
02:57:53.710 --> 02:57:57.020
So start kicking with the other side and Lo and behold,

3112
02:57:57.350 --> 02:57:58.820
hamstring problems disappear.

3113
02:57:58.970 --> 02:58:02.130
Well I wanted to ask you about that because I'm getting into archery and I've

3114
02:58:02.131 --> 02:58:04.650
got this bow is 90 pounds.

3115
02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:07.830
Well that's a pretty hefty about pulling 90 pounds all the time with my right

3116
02:58:07.831 --> 02:58:10.520
arm.
Is this a con Pampa with a pulley system?
Yeah.

3117
02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:14.040
I should probably get a 90 pound both of my left arm.
What happened to have,

3118
02:58:14.041 --> 02:58:18.030
it's just hold the bow and just do some rows,
but yet you can't,

3119
02:58:18.031 --> 02:58:20.600
can't grab it with your other hand.
It's the way it's,
I'll show,

3120
02:58:21.060 --> 02:58:21.960
I'll show you afterwards.

3121
02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:26.760
Get yourself over like a chest expander kept good enough.
What about road?

3122
02:58:26.780 --> 02:58:28.440
I've been doing rows,
two rows.

3123
02:58:28.470 --> 02:58:32.550
I do 10 or 15 he was one a similar movement pattern.
Right.

3124
02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:34.490
Why do it like that?
I do it like this.

3125
02:58:34.491 --> 02:58:36.240
So you holding it with your right hand or your left yet?

3126
02:58:36.450 --> 02:58:39.190
I hold the boat with my left and I have to pull to the right.
My right.
Okay.

3127
02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:44.160
So take a chest or like the old school rubber chest expanders and just start

3128
02:58:44.370 --> 02:58:47.790
pulling just to balance yourself out.
Okay.
Yeah.

3129
02:58:47.791 --> 02:58:51.440
You know I worked a fairly well known baseball player by the name of David Belt.

3130
02:58:51.950 --> 02:58:54.300
I had been working his wife out for a couple of years.

3131
02:58:54.540 --> 02:58:57.120
I didn't even realize that she was married to a Philadelphia Philly.

3132
02:58:57.660 --> 02:58:58.950
And then one day she says,
Hey man,

3133
02:58:58.951 --> 02:59:02.400
Matt husband's having some serious problems and he's in pain a lot and I'd like

3134
02:59:02.401 --> 02:59:06.420
you to take a look at them.
So David comes up and ask them,
hey,

3135
02:59:06.421 --> 02:59:10.830
how many times a week do you throw a baseball with your right hand?

3136
02:59:11.220 --> 02:59:15.750
And he looked at me like thousands of reps and I,
it just,

3137
02:59:15.800 --> 02:59:18.480
it just simply said,
what are you doing for your opposite side?

3138
02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:22.800
And you'll look at me like,
wow,
I never thought about that.
And I'm thinking,

3139
02:59:22.801 --> 02:59:25.830
well for sure baseball,
God,
it has some top trainers.
Right?

3140
02:59:26.050 --> 02:59:29.440
What do you think that one of those guys would have figured that out then?

3141
02:59:29.450 --> 02:59:33.540
If you have a guy throwed thousands and thousands of balls with your one side,

3142
02:59:33.900 --> 02:59:35.970
what did it make sense to do something with your lap?

3143
02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:38.370
They don't want to look like a girl.
So with your left,

3144
02:59:38.700 --> 02:59:42.330
I gave him one of those little clubs,
you know,
little Indian club.
What's that?
Oh,

3145
02:59:42.410 --> 02:59:46.140
we're running at a time.
Oh my gosh.
We did three hours.
Holy Shit.

3146
02:59:47.490 --> 02:59:52.320
Look,
go to Maxwell sc doc on how much time we got left?
10 seconds.
