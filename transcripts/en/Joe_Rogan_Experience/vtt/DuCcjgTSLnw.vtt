00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Speaker 1>They say that infinity is so intense,</v>

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>like the idea of infinity and this is the best way to wrap your head around it.</v>

4
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>If infinity Israel,</v>

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>that means that in the universe not only has everything that we've said in the</v>

6
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:20.601
<v Speaker 1>exact same order and the exact same pauses in the exact same</v>

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>timeframe and fuck up of words or slip of the tongue,</v>

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>it's happened exactly that way in exactly that order.</v>

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>An infinite number of times,</v>

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>not just one,</v>

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>but an infinite number of times that everything that's ever taken place down to</v>

12
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>the millisecond has not just happened once somewhere else,</v>

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>but infinite times somewhere else.</v>

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>That's how big infinity is.</v>

16
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what no end means.</v>

17
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

18
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Like it just like when you're doing some mundane thing like jerking off,</v>

19
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>coming to porn.</v>

20
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking this is infinite.</v>

21
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>It's an infinite loop of Tj's that's happening.</v>

22
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.571
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

23
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:03.001
<v Speaker 1>shins,</v>

24
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.190
<v Speaker 1>oceans of ges.</v>

25
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>You could just see like just a universe filled with you squirting ah,</v>

26
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.223
<v Speaker 1>fractal,</v>

27
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>like literally a universe that's real like so the sky would be absolutely filled</v>

28
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>from horizon to horizon with with you coming more than this.</v>

29
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>All the come from all the Dunkin's in all over the world at once.</v>

30
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Drenched the earth.</v>

31
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>We would drown and seaman.</v>

32
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

33
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>how's the entire population would drown.</v>

34
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>We would be coded in like a million miles thick of com because if you think</v>

35
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>about what infinity means,</v>

36
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>how many different Dunkin's would be coming,</v>

37
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>there's no end to it.</v>

38
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>So one ounce of calm equals 100 billion oceans filled with come instantaneously</v>

39
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>raining down upon those oceans would be filled with more me's coming.</v>

40
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>So not only that,</v>

41
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>the universe itself would not be big enough to contain the earth size.</v>

42
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Just from the sheer amount of calm it was covered it.</v>

43
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>it would push the atmosphere way past the sun.</v>

45
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>It would light the earth on fire and turn it into a big come.</v>

46
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>One of those fucking hush puppy.</v>

47
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It was a big come hush puppy when the come got so big.</v>

48
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It touched the side of the deep fryer is so big,</v>

49
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>it touches this time and then puts the sun out and presses out into the outer</v>

50
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:27.684
<v Speaker 1>galaxy.</v>

51
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>That's how much come.</v>

52
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 1>And then infinite amount of people coming in.</v>

53
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:32.011
<v Speaker 1>And then some,</v>

54
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>like some God chef would just come and eat it.</v>

55
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a cooking show.</v>

56
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

57
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

58
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>he lives in another world where you're coming on and it just goes on forever.</v>

60
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.741
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

61
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 1>that's how you impregnate the sun.</v>

62
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You fill up planet with come to the,</v>

63
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>stop up a black hole.</v>

64
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what to do about a black hole.</v>

65
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get an infinite amount of Dunkin's to come in it.</v>

66
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.811
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:55.021
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

68
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 1>mass broken down to the smallest part.</v>

70
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

71
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to stop an infinite amount of carb.</v>

72
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.503
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

73
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole other universe inside.</v>

74
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>They're still not big enough for infinite amounts of calm.</v>

75
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.133
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

76
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>The black holes,</v>

77
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck?</v>

78
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>The black hole is like Sasha drag and the fucking giant black cock being force</v>

79
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>fed while she's lying on her back.</v>

80
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Snots going down into her eyelashes.</v>

81
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the he lived verse is</v>

82
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>so symbolic.</v>

83
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>So some bog of gag porn,</v>

84
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.200
<v Speaker 1>you're coming into a black hole,</v>

85
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>the fucking whole of Van and starts sputtering.</v>

86
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

87
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>that's spinning.</v>

88
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>The spinning of the black hole absorbing matter just gets all choked up like a</v>

89
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:51.210
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

90
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

91
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>like a dishwasher disposal system with a spoon in it.</v>

92
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>You know when those garbage disposals,</v>

93
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.330
<v Speaker 1>the spoon drops in it.</v>

94
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>You scared to put your hand in there to try to unstop it.</v>

95
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>

96
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's how the universe was created.</v>

97
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>His infinite,</v>

98
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 1>infinite come looped went into a black hole.</v>

99
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that ever come into a black hole in the future?</v>

100
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:20.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

101
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>If we live long enough,</v>

102
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:22.380
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to want to do that.</v>

103
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna want to be the first guy,</v>

104
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 1>some Richard Branson type asshole,</v>

105
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.550
<v Speaker 1>the first guy to show the world.</v>

106
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to inspire you that you too can come in a black hole.</v>

107
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Him with a fucking black socks on.</v>

108
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>So I always come,</v>

109
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.060
<v Speaker 1>he sends like a shuttle from his pod and he's got like,</v>

110
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like a glory hole into the next shuttle and he's wearing an aqua man t</v>

111
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:45.410
<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>

112
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It's way too small and he's a little slightly embarrassing roll of fat,</v>

113
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>pulls out of the bar of like a little waterfall and he's just jerking off with</v>

114
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>his black socks on into it until</v>

115
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>you never know until you try.</v>

116
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I seek to inspire.</v>

117
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeking to inspire you that you too humble,</v>

118
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
