<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I had a transformative experience that first time I went to Alaska,</v>

11
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I was in college in New York,</v>

12
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I was studying literature and one of my teachers was a visiting professor that I</v>

13
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>got to be friends with.</v>

14
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Was the youngest person to ever be a professor at Oxford.</v>

15
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>He's like a real big shot at Oxford.</v>

16
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>since 12 slash 61 or something.</v>

18
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>This guy's the youngest person to ever be a professor.</v>

19
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Then how old was he?</v>

20
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Twenty one when he was a full focus on.</v>

21
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.151
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

23
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>he's very well known guy.</v>

24
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Indira Gandhi was his godmother.</v>

25
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>He's written a bunch of books and all this and he was a friend of mine and he</v>

26
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>was uh,</v>

27
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I was in my,</v>

28
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.751
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

29
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>skipped my junior year of college and the,</v>

30
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>so I had a one more year of undergraduate and then I was going to go to Oxford</v>

31
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>for my phd,</v>

32
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>thanks to this guy and his connections and I was going to study literature</v>

33
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

34
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>do a phd and by the time I was 30 be teaching somewhere hopefully have tenure</v>

35
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>and be all set for life.</v>

36
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>And so I skipped my junior year because I found a loophole in the student</v>

37
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>handbook where I could like scan through,</v>

38
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>which I've done like every school I've ever been in,</v>

39
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>every job I've ever had I find some scam.</v>

40
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

41
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

42
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I a scam my way out of junior year and I said I'm going to go to Alaska because</v>

43
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the frontier.</v>

44
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>So I hitchhiked from New York to Alaska.</v>

45
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Had all these freaky adventures as you can imagine.</v>

46
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

47
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Went to prison,</v>

48
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>got shot at all this crazy shit happen.</v>

49
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>And I met people along the way who picked me up,</v>

50
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>especially like in the Yukon and in Alaska who were so fucking kind.</v>

51
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:47.871
<v Speaker 1>the kids that,</v>

58
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>or women who'd stopped and picked me up.</v>

60
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Just trusting like,</v>

61
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:51.211
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

62
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:51.571
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

63
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>really self sufficient people.</v>

65
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>They built their own houses,</v>

66
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>they had healthy relationships.</v>

67
00:01:57.811 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>They knew how to fix their own cars.</v>

68
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>They were really self sufficient.</v>

69
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>None of them knew anything about the fancy schmancy literature and philosophy</v>

70
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:06.770
<v Speaker 1>that I was studying.</v>

71
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

72
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

73
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

74
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>the collected poems of Dh Lawrence and my backpack and they'd never heard any of</v>

76
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:12.331
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>

77
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.164
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

78
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>But when I compared them to my professor friends back at school and I was like,</v>

79
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

80
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>these people don't know any of this,</v>

81
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>the elites knowledge.</v>

83
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>But they're really happy people and they're healthy people and they have good</v>

84
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>families and they're decent and they're kind and they're generous to me.</v>

85
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>And then I imagine one of them,</v>

86
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>stumbles into Princeton,</v>

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:36.271
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>

89
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>or you're aware I was going to school in upstate New York and my professor</v>

90
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:40.644
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

91
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.783
<v Speaker 1>come upon them,</v>

93
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>they'd,</v>

94
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>they'd laugh at them,</v>

95
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't help them,</v>

96
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be kind to them.</v>

97
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>They went and my professor friends like had to call the fucking electrician to</v>

98
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>change a light bulb.</v>

99
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

100
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.821
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

101
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.091

105
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Where am I going?</v>

106
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's when I just said,</v>

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm quite honestly,</v>

138
00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I felt that way as well about the people that self sufficiency to a lot of the</v>

147
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:49.010
<v Speaker 2>folks that live up there that eat meat.</v>

148
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Even in Anchorage,</v>

149

155
00:03:57.291 --> 00:03:58.124
<v Speaker 2>It was bright out.</v>

156
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

157

163
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.060
<v Speaker 2>And people will make better decisions if there was a light on them.</v>

164
00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:11.780
<v Speaker 2>We don't want that.</v>

165
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.960
<v Speaker 2>So do they still have a handgun permits where you have to leave your gun at the</v>

166
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:16.190
<v Speaker 2>door when you go into the bar?</v>

167
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Someplaces gun check?</v>

168
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

169
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you have to check your guns and you come in because everybody's got guns.</v>

170
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Get Shit faced.</v>

171
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Then you pick up your gun on your way out.</v>

172
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

173
00:04:24.141 --> 00:04:25.280
<v Speaker 2>that's the best time to get it.</v>

174
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.720
<v Speaker 2>After you've got an apar architects that you find people there,</v>

175
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:33.750
<v Speaker 2>they were very kind and very cool and very competent as you were saying,</v>

176
00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:34.610
<v Speaker 2>and they're just.</v>

177
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.900
<v Speaker 2>There are people that are also dealing with nature in a way different level</v>

178
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 2>they're dealing with whether it's real,</v>

179
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.380
<v Speaker 2>whether.</v>

180
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

181
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.420
<v Speaker 2>and we don't have to do that.</v>

182
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.750
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

183
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.890
<v Speaker 2>especially in California,</v>

184
00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:50.891
<v Speaker 2>which is the most ridiculous and retarded state in the country as far as the way</v>

185
00:04:51.021 --> 00:04:52.370
<v Speaker 2>people behave on the norm,</v>

186
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.271
<v Speaker 2>and don't get me wrong,</v>

187
00:04:53.271 --> 00:04:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I love it here and there's a lot of cool people here and you know,</v>

188
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.290
<v Speaker 2>all my best friends are here,</v>

189
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.310
<v Speaker 2>but the reality of California is that we don't have to deal with weather at all.</v>

190
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.140
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing we have to do is press a button.</v>

191
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.591
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

192
00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:04.220
<v Speaker 2>it's hot.</v>

193
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.971
<v Speaker 2>You press a button.</v>

194
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:05.804
<v Speaker 2>It's not hot anymore.</v>

195
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

196
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:07.280
<v Speaker 2>it's really.</v>

197
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.250
<v Speaker 2>As long as the power stays on really not that fucking hard to deal,</v>

198
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.810
<v Speaker 2>but if you're living in Alaska,</v>

199
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.910
<v Speaker 2>you have to take precautions every year.</v>

200
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:16.070
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep a candle in the back of your car.</v>

201
00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:17.120
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep matches.</v>

202
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.780
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep blankets with you at all times because your car could break</v>

203
00:05:20.781 --> 00:05:21.050
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

204
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.950
<v Speaker 2>You could be at the side of the road,</v>

205
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.900
<v Speaker 2>no one could be on the road and that candle,</v>

206
00:05:23.901 --> 00:05:25.100
<v Speaker 2>it might keep you alive.</v>

207
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.490
<v Speaker 2>You have the light that candle in your car with all the doors shut and that's</v>

208
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 2>the only way you're going to stay warm,</v>

209
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.613
<v Speaker 2>stay alive.</v>

210
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Like there's A.</v>

211
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.140
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that kind of thinking going on there.</v>

212
00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:35.790
<v Speaker 2>And then when someone sees you pulled over to the side of the road,</v>

213
00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:36.201
<v Speaker 2>they're not like,</v>

214
00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:36.351
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

215
00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:37.430

216
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.360
<v Speaker 2>in Sherman oaks that pulled over to the side of the road with his hazards on,</v>

218
00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm not stopping to this guy,</v>

219
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

220
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.221
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

221
00:05:43.221 --> 00:05:43.401
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

222
00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:44.780
<v Speaker 2>who is this person,</v>

223
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
<v Speaker 2>this kindred soul out here in the middle of the woods that got fucked and this</v>

224
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:51.014
<v Speaker 2>could be me.</v>

225
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.263
<v Speaker 2>Come on in.</v>

226
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys have cell phone service?</v>

227
00:05:53.871 --> 00:05:53.991
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

228
00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:55.100
<v Speaker 2>If we drive five more miles,</v>

229
00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:56.000
<v Speaker 2>we get cell phone service.</v>

230
00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:56.571
<v Speaker 2>Hop in the car.</v>

231
00:05:56.571 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I'll take you where we can call somebody.</v>

232
00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.950
<v Speaker 2>there's not that,</v>

234
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 2>but you're right.</v>

235
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Your professor friends,</v>

236
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 2>to not pick them up would be right where they live.</v>

237
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the crazy thing about it.</v>

238
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're right that the professor was probably wouldn't pick up someone</v>

239
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 2>who has broken down the side of the road,</v>

240
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 2>but they're right too and not doing that.</v>

241
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>If you live in a city because you never know what the fuck you're going to get.</v>

242
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

243
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

245
00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:20.851
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>

246
00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:24.480
<v Speaker 1>You got to participate in the world you're born into whether you agree with it</v>

247
00:06:24.481 --> 00:06:25.020
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

248
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.620
<v Speaker 1>How's that smell?</v>

249
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.453
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>

250
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.211
<v Speaker 1>I don't even smell it.</v>

251
00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

252
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.490

253
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.191
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

254
00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:30.024
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with you?</v>

255
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Because someone,</v>

256
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

257
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.380
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>

258
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>you should smell the fuck out of that.</v>

259
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.563
<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>

260
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.311
<v Speaker 1>I don't lie to me,</v>

261
00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:35.521
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll put it right out.</v>

263
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Hardly noticed that.</v>

264
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.631
<v Speaker 1>I tell you.</v>

265
00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

266
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I know it must be the coke.</v>

267
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

268
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

269
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad drug.</v>

270
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a drug I had access.</v>

271
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

272

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.250
<v Speaker 1>you're in this position all the time,</v>

274
00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:50.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

275
00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:51.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

276
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.180
<v Speaker 1>having access to the best of the best of something.</v>

277
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I knew a guy in college who was the son of an oil minister from a country I</v>

278
00:06:59.131 --> 00:06:59.671
<v Speaker 1>won't name,</v>

279
00:06:59.671 --> 00:07:01.050
<v Speaker 1>just to keep me out of trouble.</v>

280
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.910
<v Speaker 1>He had a private jet.</v>

281
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.040
<v Speaker 1>He used to fly to Columbia.</v>

282
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.250
<v Speaker 1>He had a diplomatic bag so he could bring anything into the country.</v>

283
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.020
<v Speaker 1>He'd bring the shit into the country and he was like in this frat and I knew</v>

284
00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:16.110
<v Speaker 1>someone who was in the Frat and I was never a frat boy at all,</v>

285
00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:17.910
<v Speaker 1>but they would invite me and like these,</v>

286
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>like yellow rocks of cocaine.</v>

287
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And it was the.</v>

288
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean I went to this dumb ass college where everybody was rich.</v>

289
00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:31.221
<v Speaker 1>So the drug scene there was off the charts and I've done the best coke there is,</v>

290
00:07:32.191 --> 00:07:32.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean I know the guy who invented Mtma I got,</v>

292
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I had these really good connections for drugs and coke sucks the best in the</v>

293
00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:45.654
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

294
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Don't get it.</v>

295
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.763
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

296
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

297
00:07:50.251 --> 00:07:50.560
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

298
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 1>in my sense is that it,</v>

299
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 1>it affects a certain personality structure in a really pleasant way and I don't</v>

300
00:07:58.591 --> 00:07:59.490
<v Speaker 1>have that structure.</v>

301
00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:00.151
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

302
00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:01.950
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogens are like boom,</v>

303
00:08:01.951 --> 00:08:03.280
<v Speaker 1>that's pushing my button,</v>

304
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:04.114
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

305
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Coke,</v>

306
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.590
<v Speaker 1>it just made me fucking nervous and drink too much.</v>

307
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 2>You're a self deprecating guy and you joke around about a lot and you also</v>

308
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:16.510
<v Speaker 2>introspective and I think that one of the things that people don't like about</v>

309
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.360
<v Speaker 2>people that are cooked up is that they want to talk about themselves.</v>

310
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:22.760
<v Speaker 2>They want to tell you how fucking bad ass they are.</v>

311
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 2>They want to brag,</v>

312
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 2>they want,</v>

313
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 2>they want to talk about like making money.</v>

314
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 2>We're going to buy this forest,</v>

315
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:29.024
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fucking,</v>

316
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.081
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

317
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Like Mike Young used to always talk about how uh,</v>

318
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 2>people on Coke always want to start a business with you.</v>

319
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.480
<v Speaker 2>And it's really kind of true.</v>

320
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like they always have these.</v>

321
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

322
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 2>they have these crazy grand plans and it just,</v>

323
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

324
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I've never been interested in it.</v>

325
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky and I ducked it when I was a kid.</v>

326
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 2>I've told the story a hundred times,</v>

327
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:51.470
<v Speaker 2>but I had a friend,</v>

328
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 2>my friend that I'm still friends with in high school,</v>

329
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 2>his cousin used to sell it in his life,</v>

330
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 2>went down the toilet and I watched him wither away,</v>

331
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 2>lost a shitload of weight and became weird,</v>

332
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.380
<v Speaker 2>just always on coke and when they weren't,</v>

334
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.081
<v Speaker 2>wasn't on coke,</v>

335
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 2>he was just exhausted,</v>

336
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.090
<v Speaker 2>it's just like Jesus that looks like a,</v>

338
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.990
<v Speaker 2>like no one.</v>

339
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Someone who got bit by a vampire like,</v>

340
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

341
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>like you got you get that bug.</v>

342
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.950
<v Speaker 2>They got you.</v>

343
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

344
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're taking all the energy from of your life and concentrating it in</v>

345
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:19.460
<v Speaker 1>the few hours after you do the coke and like,</v>

346
00:09:19.461 --> 00:09:19.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

347
00:09:19.611 --> 00:09:21.050
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with all that energy?</v>

348
00:09:21.051 --> 00:09:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Except irritate</v>

349
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.430
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

350
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.410
<v Speaker 2>But I knew a girl and she was a great girl.</v>

351
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.760
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't a mean person.</v>

352
00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:26.690
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't nasty,</v>

353
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:27.351
<v Speaker 2>materialistic.</v>

354
00:09:27.351 --> 00:09:27.981
<v Speaker 2>She's beautiful.</v>

355
00:09:27.981 --> 00:09:29.720
<v Speaker 2>She's really nice and sweet and kind.</v>

356
00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:30.181
<v Speaker 2>But fuck.</v>

357
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:31.030
<v Speaker 2>She loved coke.</v>

358
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.210
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

359
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.860
<v Speaker 2>And she would feel bad about it.</v>

360
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.880
<v Speaker 2>She'd got fucking love it.</v>

361
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I love doing coke and they're like,</v>

362
00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:36.350
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

363
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

364
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

365
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I was not curious enough to want to do it,</v>

367
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:40.220
<v Speaker 2>but listening to her,</v>

368
00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:40.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

369
00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:42.050
<v Speaker 2>she knew it was bad news.</v>

370
00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:42.771
<v Speaker 2>She shouldn't do it,</v>

371
00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:43.940
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to do it anymore,</v>

372
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.310
<v Speaker 2>but she'd tell you,</v>

373
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.173
<v Speaker 2>God damn what I'm doing,</v>

374
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.013
<v Speaker 2>I love doing coke.</v>

375
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 1>In my experience,</v>

376
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>the people who tend to get really hooked on coke are people who have,</v>

377
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.153
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

378
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>issues with,</v>

379
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

380
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 1>they feel bad about themselves.</v>

381
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 1>They feel they've got a lack of self esteem.</v>

382
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:00.131
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

383
00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>they feel like they,</v>

384
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 1>they're not good enough.</v>

385
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:03.121
<v Speaker 1>They're not whatever.</v>

386
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:06.210
<v Speaker 1>There's shame and all that because the coke takes that away for awhile.</v>

387
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 2>That totally makes sense in this case because this woman,</v>

388
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 2>her mother was like really overbearing and her mother was like Super Alpha</v>

389
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:15.294
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

390
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Her mother was a single mom and was like,</v>

391
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.351
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

392
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:23.940
<v Speaker 2>no man is going to fucking run me and show she was a lawyer and she ran</v>

393
00:10:23.941 --> 00:10:24.960
<v Speaker 2>successful business.</v>

394
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 2>She had a law firm and she was like super,</v>

395
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 2>like intense with her daughter about achievement,</v>

396
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:31.710
<v Speaker 2>about pursuing things,</v>

397
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:32.110
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

398
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

399
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.540
<v Speaker 2>don't eat the wrong foods.</v>

400
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

401
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:34.550
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

402
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 2>it was like really like,</v>

403
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 2>overbearing and gave her a hard time about her weight.</v>

404
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.281
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

405
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:39.001
<v Speaker 2>you're too fat,</v>

406
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to be a model.</v>

407
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:40.620
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

408
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.453
<v Speaker 2>Uhm,</v>

409
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 2>and so I guess the coke was like,</v>

410
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

411
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.393
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

412
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.220
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to think about it.</v>

413
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.063
<v Speaker 2>Give her.</v>

414
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she had a deficit created by her mom's constant,</v>

415
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 2>just never letting her just be herself.</v>

416
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

417
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.380
<v Speaker 1>You ever,</v>

418
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:54.830

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.393

433
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:11.150
<v Speaker 1>He's a doctor who works with addicts and he's been working with addicts in</v>

434
00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver in the slum part of Vancouver for a long time.</v>

435
00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:17.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of like real down and out people.</v>

436
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

437
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>and he also is very interested in alternative approaches to addiction.</v>

438
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:27.081
<v Speaker 1>And he's written about Iowasca as a way of dealing with addiction,</v>

439
00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:29.210
<v Speaker 1>treating addicts and all that.</v>

440
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.591
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

441
00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:30.861
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

442
00:11:30.861 --> 00:11:31.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

443
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.150
<v Speaker 1>his theory is that all addiction is due to trauma.</v>

444
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

445
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.720
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with the substance or the activity,</v>

446
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

447
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.210
<v Speaker 1>that's just how it manifests,</v>

448
00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:41.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

449
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.820
<v Speaker 1>But it's all about psychological trauma.</v>

450
00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:47.840
<v Speaker 1>It's all trying to alleviate suffering of some point of some kind.</v>

451
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.230
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

452
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.430
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

453
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.091
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting,</v>

454
00:11:50.091 --> 00:11:55.091
<v Speaker 1>his research a sort of meshes well with this experiment that was done also in</v>

455
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:56.704
<v Speaker 1>British Columbia.</v>

456
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.031
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

457
00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:58.751
<v Speaker 1>Marie Williamson,</v>

458
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I think was the scientist's name,</v>

459
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:01.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:04.580
<v Speaker 1>those famous studies where they give rats like a,</v>

461
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 1>they've got a water bottle,</v>

462
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.850
<v Speaker 1>it's just water and then another one that's got coke in it and the rats will</v>

463
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 1>just keep doing the coke and they'll forget to eat and then they like die.</v>

464
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Like these people you're talking about lost all this weight and just like</v>

465
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 1>completely focused.</v>

466
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 1>This guy looked at that.</v>

467
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

468
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.650
<v Speaker 1>he was a professor scientist.</v>

469
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 1>He looked at it and he's like,</v>

470
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:22.931
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

471
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 1>well that,</v>

472
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:28.771
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of main study that everybody cites that shows that coke is</v>

473
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 1>addictive and it's coke the causes of the problem and it's the substance and</v>

474
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:33.670
<v Speaker 1>molecular problems.</v>

475
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.200
<v Speaker 1>But what if we took those rats a same kind of rats,</v>

476
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 1>but instead of just being in a cage where there's nothing to do,</v>

477
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 1>put them in a really interesting environment where there are lots of other</v>

478
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:45.821
<v Speaker 1>options,</v>

479
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:49.900
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of other rats they're tubes to go through and things to climb and</v>

480
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:52.660
<v Speaker 1>things to hide under and lots of stimulation.</v>

481
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

482
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.220
<v Speaker 1>And then let's try it.</v>

483
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 1>They try it.</v>

484
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.420
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

485
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 1>The rats through the coke once or twice and then walk away from it.</v>

486
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.943
<v Speaker 1>Never go back.</v>

487
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.143
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

488
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.680
<v Speaker 1>So there's an argument to be made that a strong argument that it's not about</v>

489
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 1>substances.</v>

490
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:07.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like I was saying,</v>

491
00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:08.800
<v Speaker 1>it's about the way this substance,</v>

492
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 1>inner sex with whatever your particular suffering is,</v>

493
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.951
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

494
00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:16.070
<v Speaker 3>So these rats in a cage are obviously suffering because they're not in a natural</v>

495
00:13:16.071 --> 00:13:17.390
<v Speaker 3>environment or in a fucking cage.</v>

496
00:13:17.391 --> 00:13:19.370
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to do except like get high.</v>

497
00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:20.210
<v Speaker 3>So they get high.</v>

498
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.640
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good point that I never considered.</v>

499
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.660
<v Speaker 3>That is a very,</v>

500
00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:24.530
<v Speaker 3>very good point.</v>

501
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.880
<v Speaker 3>It's called rat park.</v>

502
00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:27.170
<v Speaker 3>If anyone wants to google it,</v>

503
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 3>just google rat park.</v>

504
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:28.571
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

505
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:29.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what he called this.</v>

506
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

507
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.220
<v Speaker 3>like sort of enclosure that he made for the rat and a rat being stuck in a</v>

508
00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:39.221
<v Speaker 3>fucking fluorescent lighting room and fucking metal cage and the little water</v>

509
00:13:40.041 --> 00:13:44.600
<v Speaker 3>bottle you gotta suck on big to the fucking life they live is dog shit.</v>

510
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.621
<v Speaker 3>You're in a prison.</v>

511
00:13:45.621 --> 00:13:46.600
<v Speaker 3>So you got,</v>

512
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.691
<v Speaker 3>you got to prison,</v>

513
00:13:47.691 --> 00:13:49.370
<v Speaker 3>a guy in solitary confinement,</v>

514
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

515
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.010
<v Speaker 3>And you're offering them to get high.</v>

516
00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Of course it's going to get high and you're being surrounded by giants</v>

517
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.593
<v Speaker 3>everywhere you go.</v>

518
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.680
<v Speaker 3>This is enormous creatures who can easily reach in and just snuff your life out</v>

519
00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:02.600
<v Speaker 3>of squeezing.</v>

520
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.830
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

521
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.720
<v Speaker 3>And by nature you're terrified,</v>

522
00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:05.901
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

523
00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:07.040
<v Speaker 3>Because you're a prey animal.</v>

524
00:14:07.041 --> 00:14:07.340
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

525
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:07.960
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

526
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

527
00:14:08.211 --> 00:14:10.940
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be running from everything and all of a sudden you can't run.</v>

528
00:14:10.941 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 3>You can't hide.</v>

529
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.573
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

530
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.370
<v Speaker 3>And they just reach in and grab you and they fucking give you a coke.</v>

531
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

532
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Which makes even more pair.</v>

533
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Shitty life.</v>

534
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.900
<v Speaker 3>God Damn Pita might have a point.</v>

535
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:24.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

536
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:25.600
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

537
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

538
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 1>when the dusk,</v>

539
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.100
<v Speaker 1>when the mosquitoes come out and you can see a swarm,</v>

540
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you're setting up your tent,</v>

541
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:32.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:37.831
<v Speaker 1>and like I remember setting up my tent and like every second moving my shirt so</v>

543
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't like get in through the shirt,</v>

544
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:40.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

545
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I had to keep moving the shirt while I'm setting up the tent and then you get in</v>

546
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:44.940
<v Speaker 1>there and you can hear it.</v>

547
00:14:44.941 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like hail banging against the side of the tenant.</v>

548
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.510
<v Speaker 1>You can hear them banging on the tent.</v>

549
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

550
00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

551
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.523
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

552
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.780
<v Speaker 1>they're little helicopters.</v>

553
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 1>The fuck did people do before they figured out tense?</v>

554
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

555
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>well the Eskimos,</v>

556
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I believe they smeared fat on their skin that would,</v>

557
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.060
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of fat would keep the mosquitoes off of them and they've got all</v>

558
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 1>sorts of really clever adaptations,</v>

559
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:08.834
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

560
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

561
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:09.600
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

562
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 1>we sort of assume that we would be helpless,</v>

563
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 1>but that's because we didn't grow up there and our culture didn't,</v>

564
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:16.334
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

565
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.190
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

566
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

567
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Wade Davis is a,</v>

568
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

569
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Speaker 1>he's an anthropologist,</v>

570
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 1>he's written a bunch of books,</v>

571
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 1>really interesting guy.</v>

572
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:23.271
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

573
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

574
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:28.250
<v Speaker 1>like anthropologists in residence at the Smithsonian in Washington.</v>

575
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called the wayfarers I think was his last book about</v>

576
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.623
<v Speaker 1>traditional,</v>

577
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.021
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

578
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:35.900
<v Speaker 1>about how these guys could navigate across the Pacific,</v>

579
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.440
<v Speaker 1>just looking at the stars and the color of the water and smelling and whatever</v>

580
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.293
<v Speaker 1>they'd.</v>

581
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:41.961
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

582
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:42.291
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

583
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:42.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

584
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 1>one of the stories he tells us about this,</v>

585
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:45.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

586
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Eskimo guy,</v>

587
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.760
<v Speaker 1>old guy and the family sort of took the keys to the car away from him.</v>

588
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't go anymore.</v>

589
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:58.220
<v Speaker 1>They were afraid he would go out and die the traditional way when Eskimo people</v>

590
00:15:58.221 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 1>got old,</v>

591
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.310
<v Speaker 1>they would just like wander off into the ice and die.</v>

592
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.560
<v Speaker 1>So as not to be a burden to the family.</v>

593
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

594
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.710
<v Speaker 1>And he was a traditional guy and they were worried that he would take the,</v>

595
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.930
<v Speaker 1>the snow machine out and just die out there somewhere or hurt himself hunting or</v>

596
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:12.764
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

597
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.130
<v Speaker 1>So they had this whole intervention.</v>

598
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 1>And so that night he goes out,</v>

599
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.480
<v Speaker 1>gets out of the house,</v>

600
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.000
<v Speaker 1>takes a shit in his hand,</v>

601
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.880
<v Speaker 1>forms the shit into a knife,</v>

602
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:26.714
<v Speaker 1>blade,</v>

603
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.220
<v Speaker 1>spits on it,</v>

604
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.400
<v Speaker 1>and the spit a is freezing along the edge and he hones that down.</v>

605
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:36.560
<v Speaker 1>So he gets a nice sharp edge with his sped,</v>

606
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.960
<v Speaker 1>takes his shit knife,</v>

607
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.320
<v Speaker 1>kills a dog or a couple of dogs and takes their ribs and makes us a sled out of</v>

608
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

609
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 1>And with the sinews and whatever other pieces of the dogs,</v>

610
00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:50.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 1>he knew all this stuff from his childhood,</v>

612
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 1>hooks up a couple of other dogs to the sled and he takes off into the,</v>

613
00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.410
<v Speaker 1>into the snow,</v>

614
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.040
<v Speaker 1>on his sled with his shit knife.</v>

615
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

616
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:07.010
<v Speaker 1>That might be the most insane story I've ever heard.</v>

617
00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:07.970
<v Speaker 1>And they're so clever.</v>

618
00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 1>You know how they killed polar bears.</v>

619
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I know they take blood and put it on a blade.</v>

620
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I know that method that was actually wolves.</v>

621
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.150
<v Speaker 1>The wolves would lick the blade and uh,</v>

622
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:19.461
<v Speaker 1>we would,</v>

623
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

624
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 1>they would cut themselves to death,</v>

625
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 1>similar kind of thing.</v>

626
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:24.350
<v Speaker 1>What they would do is they take a little,</v>

627
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>they'd make a wooden box and they would take a seal,</v>

628
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.280
<v Speaker 1>a rib and sharpen the two ends of the seal rib and they're pretty flexible.</v>

629
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.310
<v Speaker 1>They bend it and stick it into the box,</v>

630
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:34.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

631
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.830
<v Speaker 1>And then they'd pour melted fat into the box and let it solidify freeze and then</v>

632
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:40.731
<v Speaker 1>knock it out.</v>

633
00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:45.731
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a fat cube with this flexed to bladed thing inside it and they</v>

634
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:47.380
<v Speaker 1>leave that in the snow.</v>

635
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Polar bear come along,</v>

636
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:49.050
<v Speaker 1>swallow it,</v>

637
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and opens in the polar bear and they just follow the blood drops and it would</v>

638
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 1>kill them.</v>

639
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

640
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Internal hemorrhaging.</v>

641
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 1>What would it take to kill him?</v>

642
00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:58.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

643
00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.433
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

644
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I just remember that.</v>

645
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:01.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

646
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 1>there are stories like that all over the world.</v>

647
00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:03.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

648
00:18:03.121 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 1>the Indian monkey trap,</v>

649
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.400
<v Speaker 1>the East Indian monkey.</v>

650
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how interested your readers or your listeners.</v>

651
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

652
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 1>that system is,</v>

653
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 1>and this is a good metaphor to.</v>

654
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I always remember this one.</v>

655
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 1>They would take,</v>

656
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

657
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:16.531
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

658
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:21.531
<v Speaker 1>take a box with a hole about a little smaller than a fist in the mail.</v>

659
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 1>In the box,</v>

660
00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:29.250
<v Speaker 1>and then they put a mango in the box and then hammer it shot and tight to a</v>

661
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:30.084
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

662
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.560
<v Speaker 1>So the mango starts rotting,</v>

663
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 1>the monkey smells it.</v>

664
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Monkey comes along,</v>

665
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 1>can stick his hand in and feel the mango,</v>

666
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 1>but he can't get his hand out as long as he's holding onto the mango and they</v>

667
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 1>won't let go of the mango.</v>

668
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.940
<v Speaker 1>All they have to do is let go and they could leave,</v>

669
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 1>but they've got the mango in their hands and they won't let go.</v>

670
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 1>And so the guy comes around to check the traps.</v>

671
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:52.590
<v Speaker 1>There's the monkey standing there with his hand in the box.</v>

672
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:53.251
<v Speaker 1>Hit It on the head.</v>

673
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:54.084
<v Speaker 1>You've got your monkey.</v>

674
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:55.063
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

675
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Sort of something about greed there.</v>

676
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.110
<v Speaker 3>That's an awesome story.</v>

677
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.070
<v Speaker 3>That is a perfect metaphor to him.</v>

678
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

679
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.530
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

680
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:04.491
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

681
00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:05.510
<v Speaker 3>Let go of the mango.</v>

682
00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:06.500
<v Speaker 3>That's my advice.</v>

683
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.970
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

684
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:08.721
<v Speaker 3>All Right Gentlemen,</v>

685
00:19:08.721 --> 00:19:09.231
<v Speaker 3>I think we're,</v>

686
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:09.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

687
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.390
<v Speaker 3>we're at three hours,</v>

688
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.553
<v Speaker 3>three hours.</v>

689
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.840
<v Speaker 3>These things fucking fly.</v>

690
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.100
<v Speaker 3>They fly by.</v>

691
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.870
<v Speaker 3>They'd been amongst the most popular podcast that I do.</v>

692
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.450
<v Speaker 3>And I know you guys are saying the same thing.</v>

693
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:20.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

694
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.260
<v Speaker 3>he's pretty good at the one we did together last time.</v>

695
00:19:24.261 --> 00:19:25.370
<v Speaker 3>I guess mine was the third,</v>

696
00:19:25.371 --> 00:19:25.910
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

697
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

698
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.980
<v Speaker 3>has twice as many downloads as any other that have been up forever.</v>

699
00:19:30.981 --> 00:19:32.460
<v Speaker 3>And the second is you,</v>

700
00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:33.294
<v Speaker 3>you and me</v>

701
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.290
<v Speaker 3>the same thing with us.</v>

702
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean these,</v>

703
00:19:36.981 --> 00:19:40.190
<v Speaker 3>these podcasts that we have are amongst the highest downloaded ones that we</v>

704
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:40.580
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

705
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

706
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.380
<v Speaker 3>just take effect.</v>

707
00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.990
<v Speaker 3>The one we did for sure is the most direct downloads.</v>

708
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.280
<v Speaker 3>They're really fun,</v>

709
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.203
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

710
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:47.960
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

711
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.793
<v Speaker 3>They're bizarre.</v>

712
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.630
<v Speaker 3>It's very bizarre.</v>

713
00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:51.890
<v Speaker 3>A combination.</v>

714
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you guys saw,</v>

715
00:19:53.121 --> 00:19:55.100
<v Speaker 3>I created a page that archives them.</v>

716
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.581
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

717
00:19:55.581 --> 00:19:56.414
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

718
00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to transfer it wherever we decided to do it,</v>

719
00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:00.650
<v Speaker 3>but for the moment it's on Chris Ryan,</v>

720
00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:01.790
<v Speaker 3>Ph d dot Com.</v>

721
00:20:01.791 --> 00:20:06.490
<v Speaker 3>And you'll see tripod cast tab and that's where the first three are archive.</v>

722
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just a link that leads back to your site and your site.</v>

723
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.260
<v Speaker 3>We were talking before the podcast started about trying to figure out a name,</v>

724
00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:14.030
<v Speaker 3>but we're not even close old men in the snow.</v>

725
00:20:14.031 --> 00:20:17.090
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty bad ass because of your description of what it is.</v>

726
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

727
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 3>But with people,</v>

728
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.400
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>

729
00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:20.600
<v Speaker 3>without knowing the story.</v>

730
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:20.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

731
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.950
<v Speaker 3>you have to tell the story though,</v>

732
00:20:21.951 --> 00:20:24.470
<v Speaker 3>just tell people to start because I don't think he did while the podcast was</v>

733
00:20:24.471 --> 00:20:24.861
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

734
00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 3>It was before the POC.</v>

735
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.290
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about,</v>

736
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

737
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.970
<v Speaker 3>techniques that,</v>

738
00:20:28.971 --> 00:20:29.211
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

739
00:20:29.211 --> 00:20:33.590
<v Speaker 3>that adolescent boys develop the good ones anyway for not coming.</v>

740
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.143
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

741
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.260
<v Speaker 3>and like some people like think of baseball stats or whatever.</v>

742
00:20:39.261 --> 00:20:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Just something like nonsexual to get your head away from what you're doing,</v>

743
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.320
<v Speaker 3>which in itself is kind of a weird thing to be,</v>

744
00:20:45.321 --> 00:20:45.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

745
00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 3>you're having the best experience of life and you're trying not to notice.</v>

746
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Nature wants you to come instantly and just shoot a load into a chicken,</v>

747
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:52.211
<v Speaker 3>make a kid,</v>

748
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 3>and you want to have a good time,</v>

749
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.313
<v Speaker 3>a strategy,</v>

750
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.210
<v Speaker 3>very zen.</v>

751
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:55.481
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

752
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:56.830
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to sex at dawn.</v>

753
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.161
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

754
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

755
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.750
<v Speaker 3>a sperm competition.</v>

756
00:20:58.751 --> 00:20:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

757
00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Nature has designed you to shoot your load,</v>

758
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:01.741
<v Speaker 3>get out of the way.</v>

759
00:21:01.741 --> 00:21:02.850
<v Speaker 3>So the next guy can.</v>

760
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.520
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

761
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.540
<v Speaker 3>And that's why by the way,</v>

762
00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:08.120
<v Speaker 3>were turned on by seeing gang bangs and dude's fucking a b.</v>

763
00:21:08.121 --> 00:21:08.810
<v Speaker 3>You are.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

766
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:15.310
<v Speaker 3>so my technique was to think about old people trudging through the snow,</v>

767
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.480
<v Speaker 3>like World War II,</v>

768
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Crimean refugees,</v>

770
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.420
<v Speaker 3>trudging through the Russian winter freeze.</v>

771
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Any of that.</v>

772
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

773
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.540

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:24.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

775
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.100
<v Speaker 3>That makes me not want to come and go with that guys.</v>

777
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Sorry guys.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're always be like no right here to the right.</v>

794
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.691
<v Speaker 3>You can move it around,</v>

795
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:52.750
<v Speaker 3>but it always has to stay like sorta like the moon is in your orbit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>After a week or two,</v>

800
00:21:57.641 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't even notice it and say that I would kill myself.</v>

801
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.843
<v Speaker 3>I would kill myself.</v>

807
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.670
<v Speaker 3>Everlands in the wrong place.</v>

808
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.720
<v Speaker 3>That's what the Buddhists say.</v>

809
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Speaker 3>Hot Air conditioner.</v>

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:14.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

815
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I can't go to prison for saying this.</v>

816
00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:16.491
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

817
00:22:16.491 --> 00:22:17.350
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about this.</v>

818
00:22:17.351 --> 00:22:18.310
<v Speaker 1>This is a serious thing,</v>

819
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.410
<v Speaker 1>but you know what non-americans,</v>

820
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.110
<v Speaker 1>if you admit that you have ever used illegal drugs,</v>

821
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:24.460
<v Speaker 1>they can stamp your passport.</v>

822
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:25.630
<v Speaker 1>You're never allowed in the country.</v>

823
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I have two friends that happened to.</v>

824
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.130
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in another country and you start talking about using drugs,</v>

825
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 2>like on another podcast,</v>

826
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.433
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>

827
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about podcasts,</v>

828
00:22:33.951 --> 00:22:35.130
<v Speaker 1>but what happened with his friends,</v>

829
00:22:35.131 --> 00:22:36.640
<v Speaker 1>she was coming back from Amsterdam.</v>

830
00:22:36.641 --> 00:22:41.641
<v Speaker 1>She was a judge in the cannabis cup competition and she lives in Vancouver and</v>

831
00:22:41.921 --> 00:22:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the plane,</v>

832
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 1>she changed planes in Seattle and they took her and said,</v>

833
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:48.550
<v Speaker 1>so where are you doing in Amsterdam?</v>

834
00:22:48.551 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And she told them and they said,</v>

835
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:51.010
<v Speaker 1>so have you smoked marijuana?</v>

836
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.431
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

837
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:51.851
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

838
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:53.020
<v Speaker 1>and they stamped her password.</v>

839
00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:57.490
<v Speaker 1>She has never landed in the US again because she smoked marijuana in Amsterdam.</v>

840
00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

843
00:23:06.141 --> 00:23:07.850

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo had an arrest for having a gun on him legally.</v>

873
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

874
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.710
<v Speaker 2>He was working for a check cashing place and he used to have to carry large sums</v>

875
00:23:57.711 --> 00:24:02.030
<v Speaker 2>of cash in his car to another location and so he would leave with the check</v>

876
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 2>cashing company and he had a registered concealed carry permit for a gun.</v>

877
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.000
<v Speaker 2>And so he got pulled over for something and he had to tell the,</v>

878
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:11.181
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

883
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.133
<v Speaker 2>It's loaded.</v>

884
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 2>And then they go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to run this.</v>

889
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.381
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

890
00:24:22.381 --> 00:24:23.110
<v Speaker 2>they run it,</v>

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 2>They let them go because it was not even supposed to be on his record because it</v>

895
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:28.844
<v Speaker 2>was all legal.</v>

896
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>

897
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Every time he goes to Canada,</v>

898
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 2>they sit him down.</v>

899
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.280

<v Speaker 2>I was working for a company I was allowed to have like it.</v>

916
00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.560
<v Speaker 1>That happened to me quickly in immigration going into Canada.</v>

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 1>What'd you get a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what was your issue?</v>

919
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:53.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

920
00:24:53.421 --> 00:24:56.750
<v Speaker 1>they asked me if I'd ever been convicted of a crime and I said no.</v>

921
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.640
<v Speaker 1>And I go sit down and then they call me over and they said,</v>

922
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:01.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

923

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.880
<v Speaker 1>you said you'd never been convicted of a crime,</v>

926
00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:05.241
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

927
00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:05.511
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

928
00:25:05.511 --> 00:25:06.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

929
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

930
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 1>is there anything you'd like to say about Fairbanks Alaska in 1983?</v>

931
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.833
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

932
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

933
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:14.421
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

934
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I got busted in Fairbank's,</v>

935
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:25:16.811 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

937
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.210
<v Speaker 1>for eating a snickers bar and the fucking grocery store and not paying for it.</v>

938
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

939
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.700
<v Speaker 1>but I did three days.</v>

940
00:25:22.701 --> 00:25:23.900
<v Speaker 1>It was Memorial Day weekend.</v>

941
00:25:23.901 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I did three,</v>

942
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.030
<v Speaker 1>four nights in the prison,</v>

943
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and then the guy said,</v>

944
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:28.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

945
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.640
<v Speaker 1>20 hours of community service and this will disappear from your record.</v>

946
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

947
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.290
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get arrested in a year.</v>

948
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.930
<v Speaker 1>So I always say no because that's,</v>

949
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:36.081
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

950
00:25:36.081 --> 00:25:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't convicted of anything and they said it would be taken from my record.</v>

951
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:41.421
<v Speaker 1>And the guy's like,</v>

952
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:41.990
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

953
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you were not Alaskan so you're from out of state meant they</v>

954
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 1>couldn't strike it from your record and it's on your FBI record,</v>

955
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:51.800
<v Speaker 1>which is what we get in Canada.</v>

956
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.390
<v Speaker 1>So he was knicker thief.</v>

957
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:53.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

958
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sneaker thief,</v>

959
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.460
<v Speaker 1>so he's a cool guy.</v>

960
00:25:55.461 --> 00:26:00.410
<v Speaker 1>I did four days in effect in a federal medium security prison with no underwear</v>

961
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.230
<v Speaker 1>for a snickers for sneakers.</v>

962
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.200
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean with no underwear?</v>

963
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Were you wearing anything or just naked?</v>

964
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing why have pants at the grocery store?</v>

965
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Because it makes it more harrowing.</v>

966
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.333
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

967
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

968
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I was 19 years old.</v>

969
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:16.320
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

970
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

971
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Will you liked very twink?</v>

972
00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Ish.</v>

973
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I was twinkie.</v>

974
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I was very twinkie.</v>

975
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.430
<v Speaker 1>So you were worried it was all going to go down.</v>

976
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I would have been worried if I were wearing,</v>

977
00:26:24.351 --> 00:26:26.200
<v Speaker 1>you know what anything</v>

978
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.090
<v Speaker 1>is that even.</v>

979
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that under the amount of money that they could even bust you for</v>

980
00:26:32.031 --> 00:26:32.240
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

981
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not in the eighties.</v>

982
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Reagan was president.</v>

983
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to fucking be tough on crime.</v>

984
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.003
<v Speaker 2>Just say no.</v>

985
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:37.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

986
00:26:37.531 --> 00:26:38.400
<v Speaker 1>and also I had a,</v>

987
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean what happened was we got in from this 10 day hitch with these two,</v>

988
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I'd met on the ferry coming up the inside passage and we had this long hitch</v>

989
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:49.200
<v Speaker 1>through the Yukon territory,</v>

990
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:50.870
<v Speaker 1>all this crazy shit in the.</v>

991
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And we get to fairbanks,</v>

992
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.360
<v Speaker 1>so the first place we go to the laundromat,</v>

993
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.160
<v Speaker 1>because we stank,</v>

994
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

995
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:58.410
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have that special soap,</v>

996
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.120
<v Speaker 1>your defense defense.</v>

997
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:00.954
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

998
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.521
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

999
00:27:01.521 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 1>so we went to the laundry mat.</v>

1000
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:04.890
<v Speaker 1>We put everything possible in the Washer,</v>

1001
00:27:04.891 --> 00:27:07.500
<v Speaker 1>so all three of us were wearing shorts with no underwear,</v>

1002
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:09.720
<v Speaker 1>boots with no socks and a jacket with no shirt.</v>

1003
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the guys was like,</v>

1004
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:11.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1005
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to go to the grocery store because there was a pe fund.</v>

1006
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.490
<v Speaker 1>He was going to call his girlfriend to let her know that he'd arrived on time.</v>

1007
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.610
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1008
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1009
00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over with you and the other guy's going to stay with the bags or</v>

1010
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:22.650
<v Speaker 1>backpacks and all that shit.</v>

1011
00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1012
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.300
<v Speaker 1>watch the clothes.</v>

1013
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.700
<v Speaker 1>So I went with him.</v>

1014
00:27:25.701 --> 00:27:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who's on the phone,</v>

1015
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 1>we start pushing a cart around.</v>

1016
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:30.750
<v Speaker 1>We were like Soviet immigrants,</v>

1017
00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:30.901
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1018
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:31.141
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1019
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:35.520
<v Speaker 1>so many kinds of food here because we'd been living in the woods eating nuts and</v>

1020
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:37.500
<v Speaker 1>chocolate and lsd for the last 10 days.</v>

1021
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.640
<v Speaker 1>And so he,</v>

1022
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.900
<v Speaker 1>he opened a,</v>

1023
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.240
<v Speaker 1>a thing of Keifer.</v>

1024
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.790
<v Speaker 1>First time I'd ever heard of Keifer,</v>

1025
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.060
<v Speaker 1>which is like liquid yogurt.</v>

1026
00:27:45.061 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.860
<v Speaker 1>And drank that great for your body Acidophilus and I uh,</v>

1028
00:27:49.861 --> 00:27:51.220
<v Speaker 1>I for some reason eight,</v>

1029
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.460
<v Speaker 1>a snickers bar even though I'd been eating chocolate,</v>

1030
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.120
<v Speaker 1>not much.</v>

1031
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Imagination there.</v>

1032
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>

1033
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:57.810
<v Speaker 1>he used the phone,</v>

1034
00:27:57.811 --> 00:28:01.650
<v Speaker 1>we ditched the cart and we left and so there's some security guy had seen us and</v>

1035
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 1>turned into a thing.</v>

1036
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.910
<v Speaker 1>This cop showed up and I had a knife in my boot and some grass in my pocket,</v>

1037
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 1>both of which were illegal at the time in Alaska,</v>

1038
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:16.650
<v Speaker 1>but it was enough to make this cup not like me at all.</v>

1039
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And he was like this,</v>

1040
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1041
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:23.690
<v Speaker 1>he napoleonic cop kind of situation and he didn't like smart ass college kids</v>

1042
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:26.430
<v Speaker 1>from outside coming into Alaska in the summer.</v>

1043
00:28:26.431 --> 00:28:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And you want a snickers bar fucking around fucking around with Kiefer.</v>

1044
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.570
<v Speaker 1>So he took us,</v>

1045
00:28:30.571 --> 00:28:33.270
<v Speaker 1>he handcuffed us and took us to prison.</v>

1046
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Fairbank's correctional center.</v>

1047
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Did you not have the money for the snickers bar?</v>

1048
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1049
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.530
<v Speaker 1>we had plenty of money.</v>

1050
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.550
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't want to pay for it,</v>

1051
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:39.091
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

1052
00:28:39.091 --> 00:28:39.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1053
00:28:39.331 --> 00:28:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you tell it to the magistrate.</v>

1054
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.551
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1055
00:28:41.551 --> 00:28:42.271
<v Speaker 1>you mean for that.</v>

1056
00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Now that was just like,</v>

1057
00:28:43.351 --> 00:28:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck you're just young and we're just filling.</v>

1058
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.011
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1059
00:28:46.011 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1060
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1061
00:28:46.651 --> 00:28:48.930
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there was a line or something I don't remember,</v>

1062
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:53.931
<v Speaker 1>but we pretended we were shopping so we put like dog food and Shit in the cart,</v>

1063
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1064
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.040
<v Speaker 1>and we ate our stuff and put the,</v>

1065
00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:57.390
<v Speaker 1>the package,</v>

1066
00:28:57.391 --> 00:28:59.220
<v Speaker 1>like we were going to pay for it when we checked out.</v>

1067
00:28:59.410 --> 00:28:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1068
00:28:59.680 --> 00:28:59.861
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1069
00:28:59.861 --> 00:29:00.330
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1070
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.130
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what we were just being dumb.</v>

1071
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1072
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:04.251
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1073
00:29:04.251 --> 00:29:09.251
<v Speaker 1>So we ended up being taken to this prison and I had a pipe to.</v>

1074
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:09.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1075
00:29:09.511 --> 00:29:10.860
<v Speaker 1>because I remember when we were,</v>

1076
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 1>did the intake,</v>

1077
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.210
<v Speaker 1>the guy that liked the prison dude who booked us and you know,</v>

1078
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>do the whole intake thing.</v>

1079
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I was joking with him,</v>

1080
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:19.081
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1081
00:29:19.081 --> 00:29:19.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1082
00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get that pipe and grasp back,</v>

1083
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:21.691
<v Speaker 1>am I?</v>

1084
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:22.231
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

1085
00:29:22.231 --> 00:29:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so man.</v>

1086
00:29:23.311 --> 00:29:23.581
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1087
00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 1>well know it wouldn't bother me if it just disappeared and was never even</v>

1088
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:29.100
<v Speaker 1>registered because grass is hard to come by.</v>

1089
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.800
<v Speaker 1>And Alaska wasn't then and so we sort of had a little understanding like,</v>

1090
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:34.261
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool,</v>

1091
00:29:34.261 --> 00:29:34.620
<v Speaker 1>you're cool.</v>

1092
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.453
<v Speaker 1>Because he was like,</v>

1093
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.271
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1094
00:29:36.271 --> 00:29:37.170
<v Speaker 1>You have snickers bar,</v>

1095
00:29:37.171 --> 00:29:38.004
<v Speaker 1>why would this guy,</v>

1096
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.360
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with that cop?</v>

1097
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Did you like hit him or something?</v>

1098
00:29:40.701 --> 00:29:40.960
<v Speaker 1>You like?</v>

1099
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1100
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:41.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1101
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 1>he just had a hair up his ass.</v>

1102
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1103
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 1>So this guy was cool.</v>

1104
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 1>He saved us because what he did is he said,</v>

1105
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:47.740
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1106
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to put you guys in with the general population.</v>

1107
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 1>You're going to sleep in the gym at night.</v>

1108
00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I've got some cots.</v>

1109
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.540
<v Speaker 1>You Sleep in the gym,</v>

1110
00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 1>you never let the other one out of your sight the whole time you're here,</v>

1111
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.720
<v Speaker 1>you go to the bathroom together,</v>

1112
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you go to the showers together,</v>

1113
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you watch each other's back and you'll get through it.</v>

1114
00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:06.484
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

1115
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.860
<v Speaker 1>And we did anyway,</v>

1116
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.350
<v Speaker 1>it was wild and this was like 83 I guess.</v>

1117
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1118
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:13.150
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

1119
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of money in Alaska,</v>

1120
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 1>right from all the oil.</v>

1121
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.100
<v Speaker 1>So the prison was plush.</v>

1122
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 1>It was like every meal was all you can eat,</v>

1123
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.150
<v Speaker 1>salad bar,</v>

1124
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:23.290
<v Speaker 1>whole wheat rolls,</v>

1125
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:24.220
<v Speaker 1>white rolls.</v>

1126
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday was prime rib day where the cops could pay a buck to eat with the</v>

1127
00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.293
<v Speaker 1>prisoners.</v>

1128
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.730
<v Speaker 1>But the catch was you only have 20 minutes each meal.</v>

1129
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.710
<v Speaker 1>So I'm married like one day we're sitting there at this table and we're in like</v>

1130
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.261
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

1131
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:39.094
<v Speaker 1>maybe 20,</v>

1132
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:39.941
<v Speaker 1>maybe 20,</v>

1133
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 1>something like that where we're sitting at this table and the guy across the</v>

1134
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:46.000
<v Speaker 1>table looked like Charles Bronson,</v>

1135
00:30:46.001 --> 00:30:46.610
<v Speaker 1>you remember him,</v>

1136
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.340
<v Speaker 1>the stash and the tats and all that.</v>

1137
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.030
<v Speaker 1>And we're just like this dude who is shoveling it in and he looks up at one</v>

1138
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:52.840
<v Speaker 1>point he says,</v>

1139
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 1>this is the best fucking prison I've ever been in</v>

1140
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:57.663
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

1141
00:30:59.160 --> 00:30:59.810
<v Speaker 1>yikes.</v>

1142
00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.840
<v Speaker 1>You've got a laundry list of prisons that don't,</v>

1143
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 1>don't meet that criteria.</v>

1144
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Standard.</v>

1145
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1146
00:31:04.391 --> 00:31:04.660
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1147
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.110
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1148
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:10.110
<v Speaker 1>his story was he founded dude with his wife and he beat him with a lead pipe and</v>

1149
00:31:11.951 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know if he was dead,</v>

1150
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.220
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as it happened,</v>

1151
00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:16.050
<v Speaker 1>he got in his car.</v>

1152
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.430
<v Speaker 1>He was from New Mexico or Arizona.</v>

1153
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:22.570
<v Speaker 1>He got in his car and drove to Alaska because he knew he'd get picked up and he</v>

1154
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 1>wanted to get picked up in Alaska because he'd heard the prisons were much</v>

1155
00:31:25.331 --> 00:31:25.640
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1156
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.830
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1157
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.750
