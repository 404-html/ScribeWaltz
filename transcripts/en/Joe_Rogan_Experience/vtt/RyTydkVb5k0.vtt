00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I'm at the UFC and somebody gets kicked in the face,</v>

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I just always,</v>

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I just think about how disappointed I be if I got kicked in the face of it,</v>

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.581
<v Speaker 2>what did I do?</v>

6
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.021
<v Speaker 2>Am I alive?</v>

7
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Why somebody kicking me in the face?</v>

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Even especially,</v>

9
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean you never been kicked in the face which has been kicked in the face.</v>

10
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Especially like that's why I'm glad I didn't fight that guy and I'm glad I</v>

11
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:28.121
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

12
00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

13
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

14
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 2>put myself in situations where I've got to fight a stranger because you never</v>

15
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 2>know where.</v>

16
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

17
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 2>if I was to be fighting,</v>

18
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to throw hands poorly,</v>

19
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody just kicked me in the face and I'm like,</v>

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.881
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

21
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

22
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know you were going to do that.</v>

23
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>This Donald Cerrone combination.</v>

24
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.611
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

25
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:47.444
<v Speaker 1>that's beautiful.</v>

26
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Left high kick,</v>

27
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.113
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

28
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Turn his back.</v>

29
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>That is Matrix Shit.</v>

30
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Donald Cerrone lives in the fucking Matrix,</v>

31
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

32
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

33
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he's coming on the podcast next week.</v>

34
00:00:59.031 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

35
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>he's here on next Tuesday.</v>

36
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking convince him.</v>

37
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Live on the Internet.</v>

38
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Don't drop down from one 70 and one 70 is a fucking wizard.</v>

39
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell is stopping and Rick story like this?</v>

40
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

41
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Donald Cerrone is a fucking wizard.</v>

42
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>He's a wizard at one 70.</v>

43
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 2>If it felt it felt kind of barbaric or archaic,</v>

44
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:26.661
<v Speaker 2>but when you have money on somebody and they're beating the shit out of somebody</v>

45
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 2>else and you're winning,</v>

46
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a different type of emotion.</v>

47
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 2>When he went Serone started fucking that dude up,</v>

48
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:37.674
<v Speaker 2>I stood up like</v>

49
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>you were in there with them.</v>

50
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 2>I was in there in there with him for a couple thousand dollars.</v>

51
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:45.291
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>

52
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:46.124
<v Speaker 2>I was with him.</v>

53
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 2>I was in Flint.</v>

54
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.943
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>

55
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate your loyalty.</v>

56
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.133
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

57
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>it's both on it and Donald Ronnie Dope.</v>

58
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

59
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.353
<v Speaker 2>Johnson,</v>

61
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

62
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I bet on Johnson right before the fight started.</v>

63
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

64
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

65
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.143
<v Speaker 2>what would the aunt,</v>

66
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 2>he was minus two 50.</v>

67
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.763
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

68
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.720
<v Speaker 1>pretty reasonable considering how hard</v>

69
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.110
<v Speaker 2>and the one,</v>

70
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.943
<v Speaker 2>it's so fast.</v>

71
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I got on it.</v>

72
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.841
<v Speaker 1>We think it's,</v>

73
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>somebody told me I have to research it.</v>

74
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.863
<v Speaker 1>Please do.</v>

75
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Was that the fastest knockout in the history of the light heavyweight division?</v>

76
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>It was 13 seconds or something longer to place my bet.</v>

77
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 1>He hit so hard.</v>

78
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>That happened so fast.</v>

79
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:28.730
<v Speaker 1>It was like he hit so hard.</v>

80
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>It happens so quick.</v>

81
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>When Glover started pressuring him,</v>

82
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.080
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

83
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 1>When I score a fight or rather a commentator fight when I watch something like</v>

84
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:37.491
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

85
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

86
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.301
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

87
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:41.210
<v Speaker 1>what can glow overdue and what can rumble too?</v>

88
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.550
<v Speaker 1>We know rumble has awesome stand up skills.</v>

89
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 1>We know we had a college wrestling background.</v>

90
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.890
<v Speaker 1>We know he's a really powerful and he's probably the hardest hit are ever.</v>

91
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 1>So what can glow over do?</v>

92
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 1>He's really technical.</v>

93
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>He can survive a storm.</v>

94
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he could take him down.</v>

95
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he can get them into deep water.</v>

96
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>So he starts out super aggressive.</v>

97
00:02:59.531 --> 00:02:59.921
<v Speaker 1>Bob and,</v>

98
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:04.921
<v Speaker 1>and we even Tyson style and one haymaker one haymaker uppercut.</v>

99
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So Start Brian Jimmo third.</v>

100
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.701
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

101
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Seven seconds.</v>

102
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn Brian Chimo uh,</v>

103
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.451
<v Speaker 1>rest in peace.</v>

104
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:13.991
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Gmo.</v>

105
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>He just died recently.</v>

106
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I run over by a car and Canada.</v>

107
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.853
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

108
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.460
<v Speaker 1>That's James Irvin Sandman.</v>

109
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Eight seconds.</v>

110
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.713
<v Speaker 1>Who did he fight?</v>

111
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>And then John's rumbled jobs that gamble.</v>

112
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a gamble on that.</v>

113
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And then have it happen that fast.</v>

114
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>That's like fucking crabs.</v>

115
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>They should put like a 32nd over under on summer rumbles fights does is</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's so scary.</v>

118
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>He hits guys in a totally different way.</v>

119
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like he knows something that nobody knows about how to hit people because</v>

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.891

131
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>He had a five round fight with Jon Jones.</v>

132
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Went to the distance.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's the human frame.</v>

142
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

143
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 1>like the skull,</v>

144
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

145
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 1>the neck can only take so much.</v>

146
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>It just can only take so much.</v>

147
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

148
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 1>and most people can't hit that bell.</v>

149
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>You know that bell when you go to the carnival and he slammed down on that bell</v>

150
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.460
<v Speaker 1>and the little thing goes up and</v>

151
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>most people can't make that thing.</v>

152
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Dang.</v>

153
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>In this world for Rumble Johnson,</v>

154
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>he can make that thing ding every time with is open barrage.</v>

155
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>With his first,</v>

157
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>name the number 200 punches and kicks,</v>

159
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:01.504
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

160
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>he can knock you the fuck out.</v>

161
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.310
<v Speaker 1>The question with a guy like that is if he gets past that 200 number and the</v>

162
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>opponent is still there,</v>

163
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>can he make it through it?</v>

164
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened in the Cormier fight.</v>

165
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like rumble hit core me with everything but the kitchen sink.</v>

166
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>But Cohlmia is so fucking tough.</v>

167
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>He's so tough from being in a world class Olympic wrestler from a guy who</v>

168
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>competed all over the world.</v>

169
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>He's just got this,</v>

170
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.650
<v Speaker 1>this is like a level of toughness that you can't recreate and he takes a big</v>

171
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>bomb but figures out how to scramble and survive.</v>

172
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And so he makes it into,</v>

174
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

175
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.331
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

176
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:39.561
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

177
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>what rounded core may submit rumble.</v>

178
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>See the thing about a guy like rumble though is you could submit them once,</v>

179
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.970
<v Speaker 1>but once he figures out what you did and he remembers how much it sucked when</v>

180
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>you did that to him,</v>

181
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 1>can you do it again?</v>

182
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't do it again,</v>

183
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>what if he can figure out how to keep it standing?</v>

184
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>What if he could figure out how to keep hitting you with those barrages of heavy</v>

186
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>bones common flying at you with perfect technique.</v>

187
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>He hit us so fucking hard,</v>

188
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:15.224
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

189
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>What third round?</v>

190
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

191
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Cormy took them into deep water,</v>

192
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

193
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.183
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

194
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.170
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
