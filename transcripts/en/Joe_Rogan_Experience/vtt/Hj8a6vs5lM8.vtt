<v Speaker 1>mushroom that actually tricks your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>into thinking your body has a cold and </v>

<v Speaker 1>think about making money.</v>

50
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>And these are all things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken.</v>

51
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I've taken a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always talk about a bill,</v>

52
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Roman [inaudible] neuro one a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great one.</v>

53
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started taking that years ago and </v>

54
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>that's how I actually do name no name </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

55
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:41.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

56
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Alice Morning Radio Show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>

57
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>no name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

58
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:49.131
<v Speaker 1>No name was working out with Roman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his turned me onto that neuro one </v>

60
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was when I first got interested</v>

61
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 1>in nootropics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

62
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complex and fascinating area</v>
<v Speaker 1>of study.</v>

63
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

64
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.130
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's debates on both sides of the </v>

65
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>arguments that are fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been using them for a long time</v>

66
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:07.321
<v Speaker 1>and I absolutely believe in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can feel the difference between when </v>

67
00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:07.321
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I am,</v>

68
00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think clear.</v>

69
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:12.871
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it gives me a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more fluid connection with my </v>

70
00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that makes any sense.</v>

71
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's different if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really hold up water for you.</v>

72
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Like we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent money back guarantee.</v>

80
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Just to clear things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people in the MMA </v>

81
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.090
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>

82
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.350
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz no show to a match with </v>

83
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Braulio esteem when they were supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a Jujitsu superfight and Nick </v>

84
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Diaz no showed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

85
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.380
<v Speaker 1>are you going to take him off your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opening your podcast?</v>

86
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.420
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you,</v>

87
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.350
<v Speaker 1>how dare you suggest that I would ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>take Nick Diaz off the opening of my </v>

88
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.061
<v Speaker 1>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the greatest moments of </v>

89
00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:14.061
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my,</v>

91
00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite parts and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know why he knows,</v>

92
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:16.860
<v Speaker 1>showed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he had his reasons.</v>

93
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

94
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes.</v>

95
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who pissed him off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't piss that dude off.</v>

96
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want,</v>

97
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:24.600
<v Speaker 1>if you want that to defy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has to be smooth as silk,</v>

98
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:25.650
<v Speaker 1>like the UFC.</v>

99
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's handled.</v>

100
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's smooth and professional and </v>

101
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.400
<v Speaker 1>it goes off without a hitch and he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>no problems with anybody,</v>

102
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but you can't be pissing that dude off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then expecting him to show up.</v>

103
00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>He'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll just vanish on you.</v>

104
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Speaker 1>What was the wizard some controversy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like was there a reason that he got </v>

105
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Speaker 1>pissed off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a weight issue.</v>

106
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they were supposed to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

107
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:48.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were supposed to weigh in at 180 </v>

108
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:50.811
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 85 pounds a day of the </v>

109
00:04:50.811 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you had to weigh ins and apparently</v>

110
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 1>braulio esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this.</v>

111
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he weighed in in the morning,</v>

112
00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:57.690
<v Speaker 1>he lost the weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to cut weight.</v>

113
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:02.691
<v Speaker 1>He had a cut like nine pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he cut the weight and he waited in </v>

114
00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:03.930
<v Speaker 1>the morning and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he rehydrated and,</v>

115
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>but the confusion of him not being on </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight or not knowing what the weight is</v>

116
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>or when to weigh in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

117
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.470
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets confusing because </v>

118
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.510
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's the fault of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizers.</v>

119
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:20.511
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big confusion as to like when </v>

120
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:21.960
<v Speaker 1>this was all supposed to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course with Nick Diaz,</v>

121
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.950
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

122
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:24.480
<v Speaker 1>he can't piss them off if you piss him </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

123
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:26.430
<v Speaker 1>He's just not just show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:28.800
<v Speaker 1>and they fuck they fucked up in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>

125
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.660
<v Speaker 1>They should have had everything working </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice and smooth.</v>

126
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.790
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't excuse it.</v>

128
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have loved to seen it,</v>

129
00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:36.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick is a bad motherfucker,</v>

130
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for him to have the kind of </v>

131
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.611
<v Speaker 1>confidence to get in there with Braulio </v>
<v Speaker 1>Braulio is one of the two or three best </v>

132
00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu guys in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

133
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:50.301
<v Speaker 1>he's amazing and it is a pure grappler </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean he taps out other amazing,</v>

134
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:53.280
<v Speaker 1>pure grapplers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy,</v>

135
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

136
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>it sucks for him more than anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

137
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came over here from England for this.</v>

138
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.620
<v Speaker 1>This is like a big moment for him as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the best Jujitsu </v>

139
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.511
<v Speaker 1>that's currently available to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling match against what is a </v>

140
00:06:10.511 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>representative of the best martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists to mixed martial arts.</v>

141
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>We have available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

142
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz is in the elite of the elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>he's right up there with the top guys in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world as far as MMA is concerned,</v>

144
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.520
<v Speaker 1>as is Braulio in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be so fascinating to </v>

145
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.760
<v Speaker 1>see them go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sucks that it didn't work out.</v>

146
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it didn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

147
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.630
<v Speaker 1>it seems like all these guys have weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

148
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>so like that's a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they just have like four girls</v>

149
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:38.981
<v Speaker 1>on staff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have to focus on weight </v>

150
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.471
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem like they would be pros at </v>

151
00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:41.471
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they won't,</v>

152
00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:44.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta leave that shit up to a </v>

153
00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:44.021
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:46.481
<v Speaker 1>and this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a different sort of situation </v>

155
00:06:46.481 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 1>because there was a lot of confusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently as to when they were supposed</v>

156
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:49.570
<v Speaker 1>to weigh in and different people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz waiting in one day and Braulio</v>

157
00:06:49.571 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>awaiting in the morning and the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>days there's obvious confusion.</v>

158
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what happened.</v>

159
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>You would have to sit both guys down at </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of piece the argument out,</v>

160
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:03.161
<v Speaker 1>but it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to get an idea that </v>

161
00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>has some girls on staff just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help the guy out.</v>

162
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael per tier.</v>

163
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And he's going to get down to the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>

164
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Michael Rupert's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that Fox magic is </v>

165
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>particularly strong this type of month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox magic been working,</v>

166
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.970
<v Speaker 1>so this time when the Fox magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's has been magic and all over the </v>

167
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:27.100
<v Speaker 1>place and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

168
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.440
<v Speaker 1>but as far as what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I came down here to find </v>

169
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:32.440
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to talk to you to figure it out.</v>

170
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I have any answers for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

171
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>So I have a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that we come out of my mouth is</v>

172
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:42.101
<v Speaker 1>pure speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good from someone who's completely </v>

173
00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:42.101
<v Speaker 1>unqualified.</v>

174
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's speculate at all over the place.</v>

175
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Just a ton of shit going on and there've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been some major changes and,</v>

176
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as far as my life goes,</v>

177
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 3>things are changing for the good all </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the place.</v>

178
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 3>I've left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Collapsed net.</v>

179
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explain for the folks who are </v>

180
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>uninitiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is collapsed?</v>

181
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Net</v>

182
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.350
<v Speaker 3>collapsing network,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a collapsed net.com.</v>

183
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Naco lapse.net.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

184
00:08:07.171 --> 00:08:07.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

185
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:11.310
<v Speaker 3>it's a company we started two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

186
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.610
<v Speaker 3>after the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the duck collapse came out and it,</v>

187
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.670
<v Speaker 3>it's purpose was to help people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepare for the collapse of human </v>

188
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.410
<v Speaker 3>industrial civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is well underway right now.</v>

189
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.950
<v Speaker 3>And over the two years we've grown to </v>
<v Speaker 3>six members in 68 countries and we got </v>

190
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:34.171
<v Speaker 3>really busy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We specialize in bringing a really </v>

191
00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:35.530
<v Speaker 3>accurate news reports from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

192
00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:38.200
<v Speaker 3>It gives us a real picture and telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>people what's really going on,</v>

193
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.900
<v Speaker 3>but also connecting them through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>directory,</v>

194
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.460
<v Speaker 3>a with 1600 handpicked entries that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>free the lighthouse directory for.</v>

195
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 3>So the lights are just going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's a good idea to grow food or </v>

196
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.070
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's going to be more blackouts</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe this,</v>

197
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 3>that so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of work has been done or the </v>

198
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 3>course of a couple of decades by a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>

199
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 3>So we bring all that data there so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to reinvent the wheel.</v>

200
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 3>And then we bring a lot of great feature</v>
<v Speaker 3>writers and stuff.</v>

201
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

202
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 3>it got to be big and we had some big </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenges.</v>

203
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 3>We got a massively cyber attack this </v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

204
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

205
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just laid into us twice this year.</v>

206
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had some big struggles,</v>

207
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:22.311
<v Speaker 3>but the way it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it all evolved and one of my </v>

208
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:23.470
<v Speaker 3>lines is like evolve or perish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

209
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.670
<v Speaker 3>grow up or die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of my big spiritual lessons now </v>

210
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 3>it's about letting go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

211
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

212
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 3>it's letting go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That really gives me more options.</v>

213
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:38.001
<v Speaker 3>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it funny that you figured it out </v>

214
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:38.001
<v Speaker 3>like later in life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody does.</v>

215
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well when you're young,</v>

216
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 3>it's like the big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent,</v>

217
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:43.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>21 years in 12 step and,</v>

218
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 3>and I lived that program.</v>

219
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 3>So letting go came to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

220
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 3>something you practice when confronted </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

221
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so letting go of collapse,</v>

222
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 3>that turned out to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave the ownership back to the,</v>

223
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm out completely,</v>

224
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:01.590
<v Speaker 3>but now they don't have to pay my salary</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're all on their own and they're</v>

225
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 3>just so energized and they're just so on</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>

226
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 3>And now I get to step back a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I'm a tired motherfucker,</v>

227
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been at this a long time.</v>

228
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.660
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever put nice stories on like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone found a box of kittens and </v>

229
00:10:17.831 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 3>they were powering and beautiful smile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went home and they had a great time</v>

230
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.440
<v Speaker 1>day and a new episode of game of thrones</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on and we watched it and it was </v>

231
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.790
<v Speaker 1>awesome and they had fox news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

232
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.250
<v Speaker 1>What kind of music is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox Magic Song.</v>

233
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a sound for it now.</v>

234
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's possible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization one arms?</v>

235
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that we're just stumbling</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that will,</v>

236
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will balance out?</v>

237
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

238
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

239
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why I'm going </v>

240
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.090
<v Speaker 3>through this big change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we not only did I in two books in</v>

241
00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:59.491
<v Speaker 3>the movie and everything else kinda </v>
<v Speaker 3>predict all of this stuff based upon a </v>

242
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:01.030
<v Speaker 3>model that said that that means </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization is collapsing.</v>

243
00:11:01.031 --> 00:11:04.000
<v Speaker 3>So if you see these symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a pretty good chance that's what</v>

244
00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:08.500
<v Speaker 3>the disease is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now just recently,</v>

245
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Fukushima is so totally out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reactor number two is so hot that any </v>

246
00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:19.420
<v Speaker 3>robots they send to the reactor get </v>
<v Speaker 3>fried and so they can't get into work on</v>

247
00:11:19.421 --> 00:11:22.210
<v Speaker 3>this melted core that's lying at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom and,</v>

248
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.600
<v Speaker 3>and then they've said no machines that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can handle that.</v>

249
00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Radiation have even been designed yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

250
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:32.791
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That leaves a reactor to act building </v>

251
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:32.791
<v Speaker 3>for with all the raw.</v>

252
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:36.610
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amazing that someone made </v>

253
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.460
<v Speaker 1>nuclear reactors in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amazing.</v>

254
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

255
00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a joke about it in my act,</v>

256
00:11:39.921 --> 00:11:44.921
<v Speaker 1>but it really is fascinating that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can build something like that,</v>

257
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.500
<v Speaker 1>that you can't shut off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone allowed them to build </v>

258
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.651
<v Speaker 1>something like that where in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>unmeasurable event or the power gets </v>

259
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>shut off and can't</v>

260
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 4>get back on and time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked forever.</v>

261
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.100
<v Speaker 4>There are 450 more reactors around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Santa no phrase just had a major </v>

262
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 4>breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's that?</v>

263
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 4>That's in San Clemente on the way to San</v>
<v Speaker 4>Diego.</v>

264
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they had a major.</v>

265
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.060
<v Speaker 4>It's down all seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you guys in Los Angeles are going to </v>

266
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 4>be having some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some humongous blackouts this summer.</v>

267
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.490
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Brownouts.</v>

268
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm surprised.</v>

269
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had that on collapsed in it,</v>

270
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 4>but they hide it from you in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mainstream news here.</v>

271
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 4>That's why collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so good at what we do.</v>

272
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.130
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So because of the.</v>

273
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.510
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with the reactor?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the one though.</v>

274
00:12:30.511 --> 00:12:35.511
<v Speaker 4>You see when you drive down the reactor </v>
<v Speaker 4>number two at Santa Ana for a right by </v>

275
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:38.821
<v Speaker 4>Camp Pendleton on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a weird feeling to drive by and </v>

276
00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:38.821
<v Speaker 4>see a nuclear reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two,</v>

277
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.830
<v Speaker 4>there was problems with the cooling </v>
<v Speaker 4>pipes and then I think they were </v>

278
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 4>checking another reactor g,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the x rays showed some faulty piping,</v>

279
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:49.540
<v Speaker 4>but now the reactor is offline </v>
<v Speaker 4>indefinitely.</v>

280
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:54.630
<v Speaker 4>It is such a stupid fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you can make something.</v>

281
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 4>You can never shut off the the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That you would do that.</v>

282
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so arrogant.</v>

283
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 4>It's so incredibly arrogant because if </v>
<v Speaker 4>it fucks up and people were like,</v>

284
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.830
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time it's clean and safe.</v>

285
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.100
<v Speaker 4>What are you banking on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the permanence of any </v>

286
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.361
<v Speaker 4>fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would a massive amount of time it </v>

287
00:13:18.361 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 4>takes before that area is not deadly to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go near.</v>

288
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:24.870
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's we're talking about thousands of </v>

289
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.870
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan is dead.</v>

290
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.930
<v Speaker 4>Japan is mortally wounded and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying so far and it's clear.</v>

291
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.310
<v Speaker 4>J Japan's economy is imploding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

292
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are now a net importer.</v>

293
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Their debt is like a 280 percent of GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how are they getting their power </v>

294
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very good question.</v>

295
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.440
<v Speaker 4>Japan has replaced a was at a Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 4>impression by the way.</v>

296
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do better one if you don't do</v>

297
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:54.870
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

298
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

299
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.510
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Japan was what happened,</v>

300
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.370
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're running emergency diesel widely,</v>

301
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a diesel is a whole separate </v>

302
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 4>issue worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're running a diesel.</v>

303
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 4>They're burning now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuel oil and coal oil,</v>

304
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

305
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.310
<v Speaker 4>two grades of Oil but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're importing liquefied natural </v>

306
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.870
<v Speaker 4>gas now that's where you build this </v>
<v Speaker 4>$450,</v>

307
00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:27.871
<v Speaker 4>million dollar floating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic bomb of liquid liquified </v>

308
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:30.610
<v Speaker 4>natural gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you floated across and you know,</v>

309
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.670
<v Speaker 4>one of those things would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is almost the size of an atom bomb </v>

310
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 4>goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is energy desperation,</v>

311
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:41.830
<v Speaker 4>but once and when you talk about diesel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

312
00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:46.831
<v Speaker 4>don't buy a diesel now and here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Diesel shortage all over the world in </v>

313
00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 4>India,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got 30,000</v>

314
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:48.980
<v Speaker 4>generators to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

315
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 4>to handle blackouts at the Taj Mahal</v>

316
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.440
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

317
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 3>and the city that's around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We ran that story twice on,</v>

318
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.570
<v Speaker 3>on collapsed net and there are so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>blackouts in India and Pakistan,</v>

319
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 3>they're all burning diesel and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>shorter coal.</v>

320
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's happening all around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world right now.</v>

321
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 3>But diesel's in really short supply.</v>

322
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.760
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do with all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear power plants?</v>

323
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.260
<v Speaker 1>They can't shut them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

324
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.820
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

325
00:15:11.821 --> 00:15:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not.</v>

326
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't shut it off</v>

327
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.300
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

328
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.230
<v Speaker 3>if you combine that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just take it a little bit further</v>

329
00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:20.910
<v Speaker 3>ahead to where the point of all this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>

330
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because from four different directions,</v>

331
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 3>they ain't gonna shut the nuclear power </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants off.</v>

332
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.280
<v Speaker 3>They can't control what the got a and B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because electricity is industrial </v>

333
00:15:31.951 --> 00:15:32.820
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

334
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.980
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have industrial articulates.</v>

335
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 1>To put something like that in an area </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's close to humans,</v>

336
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.670
<v Speaker 1>it seeds the idea that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely contain that insane amount of</v>

337
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:51.671
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's so arrogant that that's </v>

338
00:15:51.671 --> 00:15:52.300
<v Speaker 1>one prong of a fork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

339
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Fukushima here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second prompt,</v>

340
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 1>one of the aides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened?</v>

341
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 1>AIDS AIDS just put it out and come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the gate like Tyson.</v>

342
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AIDS was killing people left and right,</v>

343
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:04.940
<v Speaker 1>but now you hardly hear about aids </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

344
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.910
<v Speaker 1>It's the best diet in Hollywood right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

345
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.830
<v Speaker 1>It also generates a lot of medical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>money in the.</v>

346
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>In the medical business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever read like that?</v>

347
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Peter Duesberg stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A long time.</v>

348
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy.</v>

349
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:19.730
<v Speaker 1>He's the biologist from the University </v>
<v Speaker 1>of California Berkeley,</v>

350
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.880
<v Speaker 1>and his claim is something along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines of that HIV is like a weak virus </v>

351
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.730
<v Speaker 1>and I may be paraphrasing here and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're seeing it in people,</v>

352
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:32.290
<v Speaker 1>most likely it's because they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakened immune system.</v>

353
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.300
<v Speaker 1>That nor a strong healthy immune system </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights off HIV fairly easily that it's </v>

354
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.951
<v Speaker 1>not the culprit of aids but rather a </v>
<v Speaker 1>symptom of a depleted immune system </v>

355
00:16:41.951 --> 00:16:43.550
<v Speaker 1>that's from a variety of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and you know,</v>

356
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy argument because if it's </v>

357
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.891
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like how could this only this guy </v>

358
00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:51.260
<v Speaker 1>be figuring that out is one biologist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these other guys,</v>

359
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 1>they haven't noticed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust that tricky.</v>

360
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust any of the science behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's possible.</v>

361
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 3>That's not possible though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

362
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not possible that that AIDS </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a hoax.</v>

363
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Speaker 3>That's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not possible,</v>

364
00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 3>but it is definitely possible and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>man made.</v>

365
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a real diversity is definitely </v>

366
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.830
<v Speaker 3>possible that it was intentionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>released.</v>

367
00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 3>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you feel like,</v>

368
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen this was goes way,</v>

369
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.190
<v Speaker 3>way back to like the nineties when I saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

370
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:24.191
<v Speaker 3>but these were who document showing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first outbreak of aids and at know and </v>

371
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.600
<v Speaker 3>superimposed were who vaccination </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs and there was a like a perfect </v>

372
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.560
<v Speaker 3>match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

373
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want A.</v>

374
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Obviously</v>

375
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm no biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see how one guy could be out</v>

376
00:17:37.571 --> 00:17:41.440
<v Speaker 1>there saying something like that and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his peers disagree.</v>

377
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Is that how it works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

378
00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:47.590
<v Speaker 1>obviously people think that HIV causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>AIDS isn't this guy's mind.</v>

379
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.910
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people were all.</v>

380
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it's is that it was a drug abuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

381
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partying and he was,</v>

382
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 1>that's what he was attributing to their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

383
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.430
<v Speaker 1>their depleted states that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing like crystal meth and rappers and </v>

384
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Emile nitrate stuff and that apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>his immune system crushing this aim on </v>

385
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 1>nitrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was big in the eight seventies.</v>

386
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

387
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:11.670
<v Speaker 1>when I was a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran into a mill on the street.</v>

388
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:16.850
<v Speaker 1>What would they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pop it and then they smell it or </v>

389
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.850
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see it.</v>

390
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kennison had a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the funniest dead body I </v>

391
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:21.800
<v Speaker 1>have ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to.</v>

392
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Are you sending my life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

393
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.750
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

394
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I swear this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working Wilshire Division and I </v>

395
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.310
<v Speaker 3>was a p three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had two stripes and every Christmas cops</v>

399
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:45.911
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm driving up around Hollywood and we </v>

400
00:18:45.911 --> 00:18:45.911
<v Speaker 3>get a call six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

401
00:18:45.911 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 3>42,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

402
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.740
<v Speaker 3>meet the Ra dead body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such and such address and maybe on </v>

403
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.241
<v Speaker 3>Cherokee some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Ra is a rescue ambulance so we </v>

404
00:18:55.241 --> 00:18:58.370
<v Speaker 3>pull up and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a three story standard,</v>

405
00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:01.940
<v Speaker 3>California really bare bones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interior courtyard,</v>

406
00:19:01.941 --> 00:19:06.080
<v Speaker 3>open about balconies and it's up on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>third floor.</v>

407
00:19:06.081 --> 00:19:11.081
<v Speaker 3>And so me and my partner would go </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking down and I noticed that the </v>

408
00:19:11.081 --> 00:19:13.430
<v Speaker 3>paramedics are just outside the laughing</v>
<v Speaker 3>their asses off.</v>

409
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.060
<v Speaker 3>They're down on their knees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're laughing so hard.</v>

410
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't go on.</v>

411
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the dead body called right.</v>

412
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:28.850
<v Speaker 3>And at what point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I go in and there's this dead guy</v>

413
00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:32.090
<v Speaker 3>on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was a,</v>

414
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young twentyish light skin African </v>

415
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.391
<v Speaker 3>American guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a in a Frederick's of Hollywood </v>

416
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.060
<v Speaker 3>negligee.</v>

417
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

418
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:47.710
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was laying on the floor and kind </v>

419
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.740
<v Speaker 3>of Spread Eagle and I looked in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a broomstick pool protruding </v>

420
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.340
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

421
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

422
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.640
<v Speaker 3>But there's only about a foot of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>protruding from,</v>

423
00:19:58.641 --> 00:19:59.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where.</v>

424
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

425
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.700
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

426
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.520
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

427
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.350
<v Speaker 3>the table had been pushed up against a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

428
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.160
<v Speaker 3>It was easy to figure it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

429
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.330
<v Speaker 3>I guess this will be for a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could buy a sex toy or something,</v>

430
00:20:11.331 --> 00:20:16.331
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had been up masturbating on the </v>

431
00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:19.841
<v Speaker 3>table with the broom and the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the aml was to strike it right as you </v>

432
00:20:19.841 --> 00:20:20.360
<v Speaker 3>come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

433
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.090
<v Speaker 3>But what it does is it gives you an </v>
<v Speaker 3>involuntary back spasm.</v>

434
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.720
<v Speaker 3>And Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my aim.</v>

435
00:20:28.721 --> 00:20:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nitrate story and the broomstick went up</v>

436
00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:35.960
<v Speaker 3>his ass and killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks satisfied.</v>

437
00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a,</v>

438
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.320
<v Speaker 3>what a to way to</v>

439
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.950
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

440
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a bunch of dudes that have </v>

441
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:43.220
<v Speaker 1>gone as fixation style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

442
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.630
<v Speaker 1>That's like the nxs guy</v>

443
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 5>carrying a pussy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because like a real guy would do it the </v>

444
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.750
<v Speaker 5>other way with the broom coming at you </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the Bristol part side.</v>

445
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.290
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the real way to know.</v>

446
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.340
<v Speaker 5>Look like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men.</v>

447
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.360
<v Speaker 5>It is West Hollywood shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how I can talk a gay samoans </v>

448
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:10.120
<v Speaker 5>handle it until you to rite of passage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got to use a broom the other way.</v>

449
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.920
<v Speaker 5>Humor was good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you chick.</v>

450
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a dumb way to die.</v>

451
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.500
<v Speaker 5>Do you think one of the things I heard </v>
<v Speaker 5>is like the big,</v>

452
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.990
<v Speaker 5>the big conspiracy that would be that if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wanted to shame a person you would </v>

453
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.140
<v Speaker 5>kill them and make it look like they </v>
<v Speaker 5>died.</v>

454
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 5>Masturbating like an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's like in a couple of Nwa,</v>

455
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:35.671
<v Speaker 5>so gay porns around like that would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be the ultimate joke if you </v>

456
00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 5>found your buddy dead like alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's dead.</v>

457
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:41.170
<v Speaker 5>So listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing I can do about that,</v>

458
00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:46.171
<v Speaker 5>but what I can do is put his dick in his</v>
<v Speaker 5>hand and put a bunch of gay porns all </v>

459
00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 5>around them and then take pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 5>him and they'll put it online.</v>

460
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.130
<v Speaker 5>I got you the last,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last one.</v>

461
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be high.</v>

462
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.620

<v Speaker 5>Probably going to be.</v>

510
00:23:53.621 --> 00:23:54.920
<v Speaker 5>We're going to be in certain shit into </v>
<v Speaker 5>our bodies.</v>

<v Speaker 5>something that just works way better </v>

512
00:23:59.921 --> 00:24:02.590
<v Speaker 5>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All you need is this one little </v>

513
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 5>microprocessor in your body and you will</v>
<v Speaker 5>never have a disease again.</v>

514
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.340
<v Speaker 5>It just bang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have like this microprocessor that </v>

515
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.291
<v Speaker 5>regulates your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put it right in your pituitary </v>

516
00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:11.291
<v Speaker 5>gland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your body,</v>

517
00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:15.941
<v Speaker 5>like a little micro messenger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then that shit's going to start </v>

518
00:24:15.941 --> 00:24:15.941
<v Speaker 5>getting viruses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every 10 years they have to give you</v>

519
00:24:15.941 --> 00:24:17.690
<v Speaker 5>a brain surgery and opening up to change</v>
<v Speaker 5>the battery.</v>

520
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:18.910
<v Speaker 5>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

521
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.170
<v Speaker 5>but imagine if that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that computer,</v>

522
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.160
<v Speaker 5>that computer inside you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that computer inside your fixes all the </v>

523
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.350
<v Speaker 5>diseases and all this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then that computer gets.</v>

524
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.780
<v Speaker 5>He gets a virus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you have to start making medicine to </v>

525
00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.440
<v Speaker 5>help that computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you put the virus,</v>

526
00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:40.441
<v Speaker 5>it turns you gay minds in that all of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sudden you just could not stop your gay </v>

527
00:24:40.641 --> 00:24:42.590
<v Speaker 5>urges.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would probably be the first thing.</v>

528
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 5>Virus John Travolta had that and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>this time people were just being mean to</v>

529
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:49.130
<v Speaker 5>him and they don't know that he has a </v>
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>

530
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:54.460
<v Speaker 5>He has a genetically designed like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>disease from like the Russians.</v>

531
00:24:57.021 --> 00:25:02.021
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you wanted to do that and make some </v>

532
00:25:02.021 --> 00:25:02.780
<v Speaker 5>like super aggressively gay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The government has worked on this,</v>

533
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:03.890
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not a joke.</v>

534
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:05.000
<v Speaker 5>Michael Rupert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're back me up.</v>

535
00:25:05.001 --> 00:25:06.860
<v Speaker 5>I remember in during a rack they were.</v>

536
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 5>They were trying to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make a gay bomb.</v>

537
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:14.620
<v Speaker 5>This is not a joke they have using God </v>
<v Speaker 5>can guarantee that with all of the </v>

538
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.200
<v Speaker 5>hundreds and hundreds of billions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollars that the black ops community has</v>

539
00:25:18.201 --> 00:25:21.110
<v Speaker 5>had to work with in the secret budget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these years,</v>

540
00:25:21.111 --> 00:25:24.740
<v Speaker 5>they have tried every stupid fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing in the world.</v>

541
00:25:24.741 --> 00:25:29.180
<v Speaker 5>You could think of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This idea was that they were going to be</v>

542
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:33.830
<v Speaker 5>able to spray something down like </v>
<v Speaker 5>something blows up over these guys.</v>

543
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:35.960
<v Speaker 5>It sprays all over them and it makes him</v>
<v Speaker 5>gay.</v>

544
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:41.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean they were really like looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the possibility that they thought </v>

545
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.931
<v Speaker 5>it would demoralize them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they ever hear about the Greeks and </v>

546
00:25:43.931 --> 00:25:45.200
<v Speaker 5>the Romans?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the greatest fucking soldiers of</v>

547
00:25:45.201 --> 00:25:47.060
<v Speaker 5>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were bone in each other constantly.</v>

548
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.940
<v Speaker 5>The Samurai's boned each other too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's dudes,</v>

549
00:25:49.941 --> 00:25:52.670
<v Speaker 5>bone dudes back then and they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>cutting heads off every day.</v>

550
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 5>There was a wild time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

551
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:56.780
<v Speaker 5>you can't think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

552
00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.440
<v Speaker 5>making these people guy is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make a better fighters.</v>

553
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.270
<v Speaker 5>Well you don't want to fight for their </v>
<v Speaker 5>boyfriend now.</v>

554
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.540
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the system does with pretty </v>

555
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.580
<v Speaker 5>much everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes something and it bends it.</v>

556
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 5>It twists it so that you accept a way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at it.</v>

557
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.900
<v Speaker 5>That is a basic fundamental lie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>

558
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think gay or non gay has shit to</v>

559
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:19.310
<v Speaker 5>do with how good a warrior you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

560
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.140

563
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:32.270
<v Speaker 5>she was six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two and she could bench like to 60 or </v>

564
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:32.270
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

565
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.130
<v Speaker 5>Did you underestimate her?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did she charge you like what happened?</v>

566
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 5>We just call,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a 4:15</v>

567
00:26:36.951 --> 00:26:39.280

<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that</v>

571
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.580
<v Speaker 3>had nothing to do with police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that's a colloquialism.</v>

572
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a native,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

573
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.520

576
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.220
<v Speaker 3>might be a code in some county in </v>
<v Speaker 3>northern California.</v>

577
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I didn't realize how bad it wasn't </v>

694
00:32:18.501 --> 00:32:21.061
<v Speaker 1>till I was taking a leak after training </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blood was all over my jock strap.</v>

695
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.290
<v Speaker 1>My Josh trap was like filled with blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

696
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.710
<v Speaker 1>oh great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dick's bleeding,</v>

697
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.440
<v Speaker 1>this is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a retard.</v>

698
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even go to the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead what I did was I went to see if </v>

699
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I could beat off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

700
00:32:33.541 --> 00:32:35.880
<v Speaker 1>well if I could beat off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be good.</v>

701
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:41.310
<v Speaker 1>It can't be broken if I could beat off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I beat off and it didn't even hurt </v>

702
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:45.791
<v Speaker 1>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I came was like blood and come </v>

703
00:32:45.791 --> 00:32:46.040
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a chicken,</v>

704
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Speaker 1>like a little chicken egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

705
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's see if this heals up.</v>

706
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:52.430
<v Speaker 1>If it feels even a little bit funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.</v>

707
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.850
<v Speaker 1>So I peed blood for like two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>more days.</v>

708
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.340
<v Speaker 1>But I felt great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they didn't,</v>

709
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.980
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just checking for any inflammation</v>

710
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:03.710
<v Speaker 1>or feeling of irritation or I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

711
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:04.840
<v Speaker 1>you just heal up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like.</v>

712
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would I go to the doctor if I did that </v>

713
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.000
<v Speaker 1>with my nose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in the answer was no.</v>

714
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I would have done it with my nose 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

715
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I did drink a lot of orange juice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to make orange p,</v>

716
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.230
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to make lemonade.</v>

717
00:33:17.231 --> 00:33:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

718
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 1>It would be like pink lemonade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

719
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but seriously that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that you probably,</v>

720
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:27.670
<v Speaker 1>you probably didn't want to get checked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out because he didn't want them to like </v>

721
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:27.670
<v Speaker 1>have to put something in your penis hole</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

722
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:27.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be.</v>

723
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be a posting.</v>

724
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was my ear,</v>

725
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go to the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was my nos,</v>

726
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.550
<v Speaker 1>why am I going to the doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's my Dick,</v>

727
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want him to go to the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's like infected,</v>

728
00:33:36.801 --> 00:33:38.330
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are they going to fix it?</v>

729
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:43.350
<v Speaker 1>What are they to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to put a splint on his </v>

730
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.760
<v Speaker 1>finger and put it into popsicle sticks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and send it back in like a wounded </v>

731
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.780
<v Speaker 1>soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

732
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:51.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they would </v>

733
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:51.790
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

734
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:51.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was nothing wrong with it.</v>

735
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 1>It was just hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

736
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Just needed to heal up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it was hurt,</v>

737
00:33:55.251 --> 00:34:00.251
<v Speaker 1>if it was more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have noticed after awhile I </v>

738
00:34:00.251 --> 00:34:03.161
<v Speaker 1>would have felt I was pretty sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great physical metaphor for </v>

739
00:34:03.161 --> 00:34:06.311
<v Speaker 1>what happens emotionally a few times in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life when you get kicked in the </v>

740
00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:06.311
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

741
00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:07.810
<v Speaker 1>You heal up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you heal up.</v>

742
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

743
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that's a good fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physical Metaphor for that.</v>

744
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:16.230
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for people to accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that sometimes people don't </v>

745
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.270
<v Speaker 1>want to be around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

746
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Some people aren't meant for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking personalities clash and </v>

747
00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:25.100
<v Speaker 1>some people have different ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to find someone that</v>

748
00:34:25.101 --> 00:34:27.050
<v Speaker 1>you can hang with for any long period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

749
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just got to learn to be nicer about </v>

750
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:32.080
<v Speaker 1>the whole process.</v>

751
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the getting kicked in the Dick </v>

752
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure out how to.</v>

753
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

754
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I had a party recently at my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little kid's party and a couple </v>

755
00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.080
<v Speaker 1>friends came over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a two friends that are ex's.</v>

756
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ex boyfriend,</v>

757
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.650
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>married to different people now,</v>

758
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 1>but still great friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so cool to see that when people</v>

759
00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.390
<v Speaker 1>can connect like that and keep being can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually really be close friends.</v>

760
00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Like their kids play together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go out to dinner together,</v>

761
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go on double dates together.</v>

762
00:35:04.401 --> 00:35:06.470
<v Speaker 1>They were genuinely friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

763
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 1>it is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Goddamn for the most part,</v>

764
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:14.590
<v Speaker 1>most of them end up like fucking like </v>
<v Speaker 1>those air shows where they touch wings </v>

765
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 1>and fucking go into the crowd and a ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fire.</v>

766
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You have to go to an air show man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You going to an air?</v>

767
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in an air force family,</v>

768
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

769
00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I've been to quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a wreck like that?</v>

770
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.570
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

771
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a.</v>

772
00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:33.890
<v Speaker 1>What kind of jets did you fly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

773
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.480
<v Speaker 1>My father did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd never been in one.</v>

774
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in a fighter jet?</v>

775
00:35:37.171 --> 00:35:37.960
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

776
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 4>Did I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did a thing for the blue angels.</v>

777
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.840
<v Speaker 4>They would take celebrities up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

778
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went seven and a half cheese and they</v>

779
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:47.550
<v Speaker 4>don't wear suits either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

780
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:48.570
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they do their shit,</v>

781
00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:51.330
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most places they were like,</v>

782
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a compression suit that </v>

783
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 4>allows you to deal with the pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't,</v>

784
00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:01.131
<v Speaker 4>they don't wear them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just do it all with their body and </v>

785
00:36:01.131 --> 00:36:01.131
<v Speaker 4>La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to be like really,</v>

786
00:36:01.131 --> 00:36:01.820
<v Speaker 4>really good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

787
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:06.830
<v Speaker 4>It's just all kinds of gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lifting weights you have to like really </v>

788
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.300
<v Speaker 4>strengthen your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to deal with the g force is fucking</v>

789
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:10.110
<v Speaker 4>incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

790
00:36:10.111 --> 00:36:15.111
<v Speaker 4>The feeling is it's amazing how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure it is when you realize that </v>

791
00:36:15.111 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 4>like going fast doesn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't come freight.</v>

792
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.920
<v Speaker 4>Like if you want to really go that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to move your body in a way </v>

793
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.870
<v Speaker 4>that's completely unaccustomed to moving</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the universe.</v>

794
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 4>Like the amount of pressure that comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>from that kind of speed.</v>

795
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like monumental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to even wrap your head around </v>

796
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:36.620
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it,</v>

797
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:36.620
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven and a half.</v>

798
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Insane.</v>

799
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:40.620
<v Speaker 4>And it feels like consciousness field </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally feels like an elevator door.</v>

800
00:36:40.621 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 4>You could see black on each side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

801
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.810
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy feeling man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when they rack,</v>

802
00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 4>they were at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>

803
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

804
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.600
<v Speaker 4>my dad was a radar intercept officer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fat,</v>

805
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:53.430
<v Speaker 4>nines and half nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

806
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:58.431
<v Speaker 4>those are two seat interceptors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to fly over the North Pole </v>

807
00:36:58.431 --> 00:36:59.220
<v Speaker 4>waiting for the Russians to attack her </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Korean War.</v>

808
00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:03.610
<v Speaker 4>That was his mission and we saw a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ufo Isn't some strange thing.</v>

809
00:37:03.611 --> 00:37:05.460
<v Speaker 4>She needs us anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

810
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

811
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.700
<v Speaker 4>so the worst and it was all air force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was in the late seventies,</v>

812
00:37:11.701 --> 00:37:12.640
<v Speaker 4>early eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

813
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.730
<v Speaker 4>the thunderbirds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

814
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:20.930
<v Speaker 4>We're doing a of a five for formation </v>
<v Speaker 4>loop,</v>

815
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 4>ground loop and something went off in </v>
<v Speaker 4>all five.</v>

816
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.710
<v Speaker 4>Flew straight into the ground and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

817
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:32.040
<v Speaker 4>that was just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

818
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

819
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:36.120
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fail.</v>

820
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.680
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

821
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.560
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck does that happen?</v>

822
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:45.570
<v Speaker 4>Something I'm not gonna say it wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 4>combination of pilot error and </v>

823
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:50.910
<v Speaker 4>mechanical failure because everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>follows the lead.</v>

824
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:55.990
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody else is paying any attention to </v>

825
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:55.990
<v Speaker 4>anything except the lead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

826
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is so fucking crazy.</v>

827
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hard to even think about.</v>

828
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.790
<v Speaker 4>That's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to wrap your head around,</v>

829
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that must've been like to be a part</v>

830
00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:08.610
<v Speaker 4>of and know that it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like right before the fucking plane hits</v>

831
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:10.010
<v Speaker 4>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

832
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:15.860
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might have had a microsecond to </v>

833
00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.711
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy that took me on the blue angels </v>

834
00:38:18.711 --> 00:38:21.201
<v Speaker 4>flight was a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could remember his name and I </v>

835
00:38:21.201 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 4>have it at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on a signed photo,</v>

836
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:25.470
<v Speaker 4>but we went through these canyons and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>were going.</v>

837
00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:31.110
<v Speaker 4>It was so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was ridiculous and we're only like a </v>

838
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:31.110
<v Speaker 4>couple hundred feet off the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it just.</v>

839
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 4>When you realize what those things can </v>
<v Speaker 4>do and think about if you were on</v>

840
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 3>the ground and one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers was looking for you,</v>

841
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 3>holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn,</v>

842
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:47.221
<v Speaker 3>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those fighter jets looking for </v>

843
00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:51.271
<v Speaker 3>you while you're on the ground would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be one of the most frightening </v>

844
00:38:51.271 --> 00:38:51.271
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

845
00:38:51.271 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 3>they fly too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is.</v>

846
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:57.250
<v Speaker 3>This is where I have some expertise </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the life I've led hanging </v>

847
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 3>with some green beanie guys and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

848
00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 3>they can't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fly too fast,</v>

849
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 3>too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you need helicopters.</v>

850
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you,</v>

851
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 3>you would want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

852
00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:09.391
<v Speaker 3>Hilo where the flir for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at infrared radar for </v>

853
00:39:09.391 --> 00:39:09.680
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a third gen night vision where,</v>

854
00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 3>where you can pick out the heat moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>very easily.</v>

855
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Could they use like a blimp or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>just floated up above the sky and get a </v>

856
00:39:18.911 --> 00:39:21.570
<v Speaker 3>big view of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

857
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:26.610
<v Speaker 3>they really aren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do that little micro copters and they </v>

858
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:26.610
<v Speaker 3>got all the money.</v>

859
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like Jack Nicholson in Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where did they get all the toys?</v>

860
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:35.260
<v Speaker 3>Just that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did they feel like they have to </v>

861
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:35.260
<v Speaker 3>control things so much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

862
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Because it has to be so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much resources spent on this aspect </v>

863
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.900
<v Speaker 3>of society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the infinite growth of monetary </v>

864
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.841
<v Speaker 3>paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also a people who who have </v>

865
00:39:49.061 --> 00:39:50.260
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

866
00:39:50.261 --> 00:39:52.870
<v Speaker 3>We have someone call them the powers </v>
<v Speaker 3>that be.</v>

867
00:39:52.871 --> 00:39:57.871
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting a call them the powers that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were because they're failing </v>

868
00:39:57.871 --> 00:39:57.930
<v Speaker 3>monumentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

869
00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:02.970
<v Speaker 3>but they must maintain control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise all of the crimes that have </v>

870
00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:07.801
<v Speaker 3>been committed for eons will come </v>
<v Speaker 3>starkly clear to a lot of people all at </v>

871
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:09.200
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

872
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.190
<v Speaker 3>that's like the awakening of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundredth monkey.</v>

873
00:40:12.191 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

874
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:15.790
<v Speaker 3>we are human beings really have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>farmed.</v>

875
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:20.791
<v Speaker 3>What does that expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weakened over the hungry 100th </v>

876
00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:20.791
<v Speaker 3>monkey because I've heard it more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>once now.</v>

877
00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:23.580
<v Speaker 3>That was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was in the Daca,</v>

878
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:28.820
<v Speaker 3>collapsing it after the Second World War</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were playing with the atom </v>

879
00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:33.661
<v Speaker 3>bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to see how long it would </v>

880
00:40:33.661 --> 00:40:36.301
<v Speaker 3>take to repopulate an island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they went back to this island and a </v>

881
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:41.470
<v Speaker 3>four or five years after and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced trees and they got things </v>

882
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:42.900
<v Speaker 3>grow and then they brought in like </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>

883
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:47.440
<v Speaker 3>monkeys to see how they would survive a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was enough for everything,</v>

884
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:52.441
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coconuts were slightly radioactive </v>

885
00:40:52.441 --> 00:40:54.991
<v Speaker 3>on the husks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the safe way to eat the coconut was </v>

886
00:40:54.991 --> 00:40:57.781
<v Speaker 3>to wash it in the stream and they taught</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 10 monkeys to wash the coconut.</v>

887
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:04.590
<v Speaker 3>And so they and then other monkeys look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then pretty soon there's 15 and then</v>

888
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.500
<v Speaker 3>47 and then a 200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or excuse me,</v>

889
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:09.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>88.</v>

890
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.950
<v Speaker 3>But when they reached the hundredth </v>
<v Speaker 3>monkey,</v>

891
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.290
<v Speaker 3>all 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>got it all at once.</v>

892
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

893
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then they all started washing the </v>

894
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.230
<v Speaker 3>coconut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

895
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.230
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

896
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a parable about,</v>

897
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.700
<v Speaker 3>you didn't tell me the story the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>time you were here.</v>

898
00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 3>What did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

899
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.400
<v Speaker 3>it was in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

900
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:28.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

901
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.380
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

902
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.540
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

903
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a</v>

904
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 4>parable about a radical shift in </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>

905
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:43.450
<v Speaker 4>And right now a radical shift in human </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness is the only thing that can</v>

906
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:48.850
<v Speaker 4>possibly save us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a part of me for all of the </v>

907
00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 4>stuff that I've done bringing the bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>news.</v>

908
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.070
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was my mission.</v>

909
00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:54.650
<v Speaker 4>That was my duty for like 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like to warn.</v>

910
00:41:54.651 --> 00:41:59.651
<v Speaker 4>And now this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now the Fox medicine spiritual message </v>

911
00:41:59.651 --> 00:41:59.960
<v Speaker 4>says they've had all the warnings </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to get.</v>

912
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:05.560
<v Speaker 4>But now I'm also very aware that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>change of consciousness is happening and</v>

913
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing enormously encouraging signs </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

914
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:13.220
<v Speaker 4>One day we won't have to think about how</v>
<v Speaker 4>we suddenly try to get governments to be</v>

915
00:42:13.221 --> 00:42:16.220
<v Speaker 4>honest or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one day,</v>

916
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this government right now,</v>

917
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.790
<v Speaker 4>one day is going to be embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be embarrassed.</v>

918
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.930
<v Speaker 4>They're going to look back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

919
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

920
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:29.430
<v Speaker 4>All of them have been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to look back on this time </v>

921
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.800
<v Speaker 4>with shame because the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>running this country,</v>

922
00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.020
<v Speaker 4>that's very small percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

923
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.820
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to be able to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

924
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:39.910
<v Speaker 4>It's just too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's too much access to information </v>

925
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.341
<v Speaker 4>these days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same animal as it was when </v>

926
00:42:42.341 --> 00:42:42.341
<v Speaker 4>this whole monster was created.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look,</v>

927
00:42:42.341 --> 00:42:45.620
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm anywhere in the world.</v>

928
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Every government is failing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is not a government anywhere in </v>

929
00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.900
<v Speaker 4>the world that's succeeding because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way they're set up is ridiculous.</v>

930
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:55.920
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is ridiculous and after </v>
<v Speaker 4>a while,</v>

931
00:42:55.921 --> 00:42:58.250
<v Speaker 4>people just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't take the inequity of it.</v>

932
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.170
<v Speaker 4>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people snap everywhere.</v>

933
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 4>This is even this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The best one.</v>

934
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:03.890
<v Speaker 4>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without a doubt,</v>

935
00:43:03.891 --> 00:43:05.450
<v Speaker 4>I think Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best setup there is.</v>

936
00:43:05.451 --> 00:43:07.460
<v Speaker 4>I love it here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the greatest country in the world,</v>

937
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.380
<v Speaker 4>but God damn it could be better.</v>

938
00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.380
<v Speaker 4>It can be better by a million fold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could easily be better.</v>

939
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:17.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't think America can be fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that I'm on American.</v>

940
00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:22.980
<v Speaker 4>What I mean is I think the United States</v>
<v Speaker 4>of America as it's operating now is not </v>

941
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:27.480
<v Speaker 4>fixable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's set up on a bullshit financial </v>

942
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:27.480
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real big part of it.</v>

943
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.090
<v Speaker 4>It's utterly corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Thomas Jefferson here.</v>

944
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thomas Jefferson said you need a </v>

945
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.540
<v Speaker 4>revolution every generation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever thought about just moving </v>

946
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.930
<v Speaker 4>to Hawaii saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

947
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.740
<v Speaker 4>You ever thought about doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

948
00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.510
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

949
00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:43.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent four months in Venezuela.</v>

950
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 4>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an unusual story.</v>

951
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:46.290
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

952
00:43:46.291 --> 00:43:48.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm where I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm up in northern California.</v>

953
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 4>That's where I'm staying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Staying.</v>

954
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to asteroid.</v>

955
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:57.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm planting my ass in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have to come with a </v>

956
00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:57.060
<v Speaker 4>bulldozer and take me out of there.</v>

957
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.660
<v Speaker 4>You're out there making it happen while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you sure that this is all gonna fall </v>

958
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.960
<v Speaker 4>apart though it is falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the.</v>

959
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:11.050
<v Speaker 4>What is the possibility that something </v>
<v Speaker 4>can happen that can pull us out of the </v>

960
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 4>fire?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that's gonna.</v>

961
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.310
<v Speaker 4>Keep us from the only laminate to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain.</v>

962
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:21.340
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that can keep us from </v>
<v Speaker 4>slamming into the mountain is for the </v>

963
00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:26.141
<v Speaker 4>human race collectively to see it </v>
<v Speaker 4>slamming itself into the mountain and </v>

964
00:44:26.141 --> 00:44:30.281
<v Speaker 4>decided to do differently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be a change of </v>

965
00:44:30.281 --> 00:44:32.771
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not going to be a message </v>

966
00:44:32.771 --> 00:44:32.771
<v Speaker 4>written in a letter put out</v>

967
00:44:32.771 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 1>in a broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put out.</v>

968
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally think the Internet itself </v>

969
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:42.770
<v Speaker 1>is very psychedelic and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's responsible for a massive expansion</v>

970
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.590
<v Speaker 1>of human consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not from a drug form,</v>

971
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.600
<v Speaker 1>but from an information for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you're the access to </v>

972
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 1>information is so spectacular and so the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole viral aspect of it.</v>

973
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that that human beings right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

974
00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 1>what was a very rare time where we're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a balancing act right now,</v>

975
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:07.730
<v Speaker 1>but I think the information that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting from the Internet is expanding </v>

976
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 1>consciousness as much almost as a drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

977
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an influx of you look back,</v>

978
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 1>unlike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

979
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:18.381
<v Speaker 1>19 between like 1994 and now what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive change in our society has come </v>

980
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:25.971
<v Speaker 1>about because of youtube and twitter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook and the interconnectedness of </v>

981
00:45:25.971 --> 00:45:30.471
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The massive extent of it is so much </v>

982
00:45:30.471 --> 00:45:30.471
<v Speaker 1>different than it was.</v>

983
00:45:30.471 --> 00:45:34.890
<v Speaker 1>The evolution of en via the net are </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

984
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that's going to </v>

985
00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.451
<v Speaker 1>influence the way the government works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to influence who are </v>

986
00:45:41.451 --> 00:45:42.240
<v Speaker 1>the people that are in positions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

987
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's slowly going to root out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old.</v>

988
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:50.030
<v Speaker 1>The old system that's in place was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fuckers were around before the </v>

989
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them except Obama,</v>

990
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.120
<v Speaker 1>the Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

991
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 1>he should have been just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a little bit older than me,</v>

992
00:45:56.761 --> 00:46:00.690
<v Speaker 1>so he was a grown man while the internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out and you should have maybe maybe</v>

993
00:46:00.691 --> 00:46:05.691
<v Speaker 1>it was too late for him to maybe maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one more generation after this </v>

994
00:46:05.691 --> 00:46:09.501
<v Speaker 1>where they they realize you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking lie anymore because there's new </v>

995
00:46:09.501 --> 00:46:12.081
<v Speaker 1>technology that lists or read thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then everything has to be done </v>

996
00:46:12.081 --> 00:46:14.721
<v Speaker 1>transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to take </v>

997
00:46:14.721 --> 00:46:14.721
<v Speaker 1>anywhere near that long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

998
00:46:14.721 --> 00:46:17.660
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this old system is going to collapse </v>

999
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:17.660
<v Speaker 1>because it will be satisfied with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing less.</v>

1000
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.650
<v Speaker 1>It's seeking its own death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's doing everything to kill itself </v>

1001
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:22.920
<v Speaker 1>intellectually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything running this world right now is</v>

1002
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:27.921
<v Speaker 1>being defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's because the current </v>

1003
00:46:27.921 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 1>people are greedy and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking out for themselves and trying to</v>

1004
00:46:28.141 --> 00:46:32.070
<v Speaker 1>just score short term and just get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's where the money's at.</v>

1005
00:46:32.071 --> 00:46:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Michael Rupert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they're trying as good.</v>

1006
00:46:34.641 --> 00:46:39.641
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was good that they're trying to do </v>

1007
00:46:39.641 --> 00:46:41.871
<v Speaker 1>anything they can to hold on to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and what information they have </v>

1008
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:47.750
<v Speaker 1>because they do not want the power or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the information that they have to be </v>

1009
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:52.401
<v Speaker 1>shared and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a total desperation move and </v>

1010
00:46:52.401 --> 00:46:55.611
<v Speaker 1>they're going to fail if I was a doctor </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the world and I looked at this </v>

1011
00:46:56.401 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 1>problem and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

1012
00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I see we got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a bunch of cunts that haven't </v>

1013
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:03.330
<v Speaker 1>done mushrooms and they're running </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1014
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have a bunch of old greedy fuck</v>

1015
00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:08.880
<v Speaker 1>heads that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are just unsightly,</v>

1016
00:47:08.881 --> 00:47:13.881
<v Speaker 1>delicately inclined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never had consciousness </v>

1017
00:47:13.881 --> 00:47:16.341
<v Speaker 1>expanding experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know the beauty and the love </v>

1018
00:47:16.341 --> 00:47:18.520
<v Speaker 1>that you get from a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience with friends where you,</v>

1019
00:47:18.521 --> 00:47:23.521
<v Speaker 1>you realize how much of the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave and live and interact with </v>

1020
00:47:23.521 --> 00:47:24.270
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an insecurity.</v>

1021
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:25.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just stupidity.</v>

1022
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.410
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not sure.</v>

1023
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1024
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.400
<v Speaker 4>it would cure it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Baby Lord.</v>

1025
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:36.520
<v Speaker 4>Seven billion doses of DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1026
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.210
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1027
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:38.680
<v Speaker 4>I think it would kill the ego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1028
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:43.681
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really what what you have today </v>

1029
00:47:43.681 --> 00:47:43.681
<v Speaker 4>or you go to kill the ego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the dilemma.</v>

1030
00:47:43.681 --> 00:47:47.971
<v Speaker 4>That's the issue that you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I'm writing a third book </v>

1031
00:47:47.971 --> 00:47:48.120
<v Speaker 4>now because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1032
00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 4>that's why everybody hates a chicken </v>
<v Speaker 4>hawk.</v>

1033
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:54.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of someone who wants to send </v>

1034
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:54.780
<v Speaker 4>people into battle that's never been in </v>
<v Speaker 4>battle themselves,</v>

1035
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:59.281
<v Speaker 4>but of course you're so confident and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course you're so aggressive about </v>

1036
00:47:59.281 --> 00:47:59.281
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not yours to risk.</v>

1037
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

1038
00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:01.110
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1039
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:04.510
<v Speaker 4>the ego has no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't understand what a war is.</v>

1040
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:09.511
<v Speaker 4>If maybe if you had been there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would have a completely different </v>

1041
00:48:09.511 --> 00:48:09.511
<v Speaker 4>sort of appreciation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:48:09.511 --> 00:48:11.570
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't be so callous and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be such an easy option.</v>

1043
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've come to a darker conclusion than </v>

1044
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

1045
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1046
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:18.490
<v Speaker 4>and that is that these people literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at us as cattle,</v>

1047
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.270
<v Speaker 4>expendable cattle that have been farmed </v>
<v Speaker 4>for Millennia.</v>

1048
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.770
<v Speaker 4>This is real or well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1049
00:48:23.771 --> 00:48:25.780
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what it really is,</v>

1050
00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.880
<v Speaker 4>is all about human beings are born and </v>
<v Speaker 4>bred to be slaves and consumers to </v>

1051
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 4>generate wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the way it's always been.</v>

1052
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.850
<v Speaker 4>Roughly since there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since we started doing money,</v>

1053
00:48:36.851 --> 00:48:37.060
<v Speaker 4>this one</v>

1054
00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:42.140
<v Speaker 1>or who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a vein or is it just a series of </v>

1055
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:47.480
<v Speaker 1>shit choices that have left us in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where people are copying </v>

1056
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.150
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1057
00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.400
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a thing we talked about really</v>

1058
00:48:50.401 --> 00:48:53.190
<v Speaker 1>recently on this show about the Salem </v>
<v Speaker 1>witch trials,</v>

1059
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.520
<v Speaker 1>the Salem witch trials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a woman who wrote a paper for </v>

1060
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.771
<v Speaker 1>a history class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of solved one of the major </v>

1061
00:49:01.771 --> 00:49:04.911
<v Speaker 1>puzzles of the Salem witchcraft trials </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was that there was an ergot </v>

1062
00:49:04.911 --> 00:49:08.430
<v Speaker 1>poisoning of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was causing people to have a LSD type</v>

1063
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:13.450
<v Speaker 1>effects and that they thought that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was responsible for the original </v>

1064
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:17.511
<v Speaker 1>murders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they kept it up as a tradition </v>

1065
00:49:17.511 --> 00:49:21.501
<v Speaker 1>for years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it became a hysteria and then even </v>

1066
00:49:21.501 --> 00:49:24.801
<v Speaker 1>though people weren't even ergot </v>
<v Speaker 1>poisoning would actually become a </v>

1067
00:49:24.801 --> 00:49:27.471
<v Speaker 1>learned behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that in situations like </v>

1068
00:49:27.471 --> 00:49:30.630
<v Speaker 1>where you have greedy business people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they set up corporations and there's</v>

1069
00:49:30.631 --> 00:49:35.631
<v Speaker 1>patterns of learned behavior that come </v>
<v Speaker 1>about from the way these corporations </v>

1070
00:49:35.631 --> 00:49:37.690
<v Speaker 1>interact with their consumers and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that they have there,</v>

1071
00:49:37.691 --> 00:49:42.691
<v Speaker 1>their businesses set up in and that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum gets carried away to a point </v>

1072
00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:49.290
<v Speaker 1>where the greed and the bottom line </v>
<v Speaker 1>supersedes human nature at supersedes.</v>

1073
00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:54.290
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you are a group of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know in the documentary the </v>

1074
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:55.110
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went over this,</v>

1075
00:49:55.111 --> 00:49:57.870
<v Speaker 1>that a corporation tends to act as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociopath.</v>

1076
00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we just have to make everyone </v>

1077
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.540
<v Speaker 1>aware of the accountability of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions in that situation and remove </v>

1078
00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:06.780
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remove that as a design.</v>

1079
00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Remove that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1080
00:50:08.341 --> 00:50:13.341
<v Speaker 1>that diffusion of responsibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get by being a part of a big </v>

1081
00:50:13.341 --> 00:50:13.470
<v Speaker 1>group that does something really fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1082
00:50:13.471 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 1>but you don't feel responsible for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're just one piece.</v>

1083
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1084
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:18.780
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from my spiritual perspective,</v>

1085
00:50:18.781 --> 00:50:23.340
<v Speaker 4>and let me just add that my DNA,</v>

1105
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.180

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1106
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 5>I do medicine journeys as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as part of my spiritual practice.</v>

1107
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:24.371
<v Speaker 5>And it's very important for me that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>always approach a medicine with a clear </v>

1108
00:51:24.371 --> 00:51:28.190
<v Speaker 5>intent and it's always to seek and learn</v>
<v Speaker 5>something better.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>house as a commentator.</v>

1133
00:52:26.961 --> 00:52:31.961
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

<v Speaker 5>same time.</v>

<v Speaker 5>spiritual trip,</v>

1149
00:53:05.931 --> 00:53:09.080
<v Speaker 5>it also is a part of the IOWASCA ritual </v>
<v Speaker 5>for some reason,</v>

1150
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.950
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of Iowasca arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's how they say them.</v>

1151
00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1152
00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.030
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they blow tobacco,</v>

1153
00:53:14.031 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 5>smoke on people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's part of the whole thing.</v>

1154
00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:22.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean nicotine or tobacco in of itself </v>

1155
00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.510
<v Speaker 5>and even nicotine is proven to have some</v>
<v Speaker 5>really positive health effects and there</v>

1156
00:53:23.511 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 5>was something about nicotine that </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually is good for your heart</v>

1157
00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.370
<v Speaker 1>and now some like it's not nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really the problem.</v>

1158
00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caffeine is not bad.</v>

1159
00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 1>If you have just a little bit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>by an to all the propaganda I'm sold </v>

1183
00:54:30.161 --> 00:54:35.161
<v Speaker 3>people that run this world operate is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do it 90 percent truth and 10 </v>

<v Speaker 3>percent bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because you're not trained to </v>

<v Speaker 3>separate the bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bullshit winds upstair in you.</v>

1186
00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:45.840
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite articles that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out during the time that the Patriot Act</v>

1187
00:54:46.901 --> 00:54:49.390
<v Speaker 1>was administered was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on CNN.</v>

1188
00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:54.450
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about how the CIA has </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced that it's going to leak fake </v>

1189
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:58.231
<v Speaker 1>new stories in order to send terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wrong direction.</v>

1190
00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading that and I was like,</v>

1191
00:55:03.401 --> 00:55:04.990
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like game over.</v>

1192
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Like they just came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to lie to you.</v>

1193
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:12.690
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was right at the same time that a</v>

1194
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:14.120
<v Speaker 3>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1195
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:19.310
<v Speaker 3>let it be known that the Department of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Defense was permanently stationing </v>

1196
00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:20.490
<v Speaker 3>military intelligence personnel in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN newsroom.</v>

1197
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I screamed about that from the </v>

1198
00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:26.410
<v Speaker 3>wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my newsletter for eight years.</v>

1199
00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:30.261
<v Speaker 3>We had some great people there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were just kicking Bush Cheney in the </v>

1200
00:55:30.261 --> 00:55:31.050
<v Speaker 3>balls every chance we could get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why was it from the Wilderness?</v>

1201
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:36.210
<v Speaker 3>Why'd you call it from the Wilderness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because for my personal story I had been</v>

1202
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:41.211
<v Speaker 3>trying to expose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cei was bringing drugs into the country </v>

1203
00:55:41.211 --> 00:55:41.220
<v Speaker 3>for like 18 years and nobody would </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to me.</v>

1204
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Then Gary Webb stories broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I confronted the CIA director at Locke </v>

1205
00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:47.790
<v Speaker 3>High School.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the game changed a little bit.</v>

1206
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I started ftw,</v>

1207
00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:55.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a year and a half after I </v>

1208
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.600
<v Speaker 3>confronted John Deutch and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a voice crying in the wilderness,</v>

1209
00:55:57.601 --> 00:56:00.820
<v Speaker 3>but I was the guy from the wilderness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that nobody had listened to and,</v>

1210
00:56:00.821 --> 00:56:02.670
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1211
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:06.590
<v Speaker 3>and so that came to stand for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1212
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:11.520
<v Speaker 3>over the course of my career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many hundreds of people in organizations</v>

1213
00:56:11.521 --> 00:56:12.720
<v Speaker 3>who were all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1214
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.690
<v Speaker 3>voices in the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody was listening to.</v>

1215
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.240
<v Speaker 3>And Damn,</v>

<v Speaker 3>met along the way.</v>

1219
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first found out about it,</v>

1220
00:56:26.111 --> 00:56:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is,</v>

1229
00:56:44.361 --> 00:56:47.360
<v Speaker 3>We got to have 60 members of Congress </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we broke the Pat Tillman,</v>

1230
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:50.360
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole cover up with Pat Tillman was,</v>

1231
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:53.150
<v Speaker 3>was a seven part series.</v>

<v Speaker 3>about giving collapsed that over to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>employees.</v>

1234
00:56:58.491 --> 00:57:03.491
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a chance to do that with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few because our computers were smashed </v>

1235
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:05.030
<v Speaker 3>in the Tillman series.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean police falsified reports,</v>

<v Speaker 3>with my children and for defrauding them</v>

1237
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:15.110
<v Speaker 3>and they really threw everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the kitchen sink at me up.</v>

1238
00:57:15.111 --> 00:57:16.910
<v Speaker 3>And I actually talked to editors that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>of the tilghman series.</v>

1242
00:57:22.281 --> 00:57:25.460
<v Speaker 3>That's right when we were nailing Donald</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rumsfeld and he was eventually forced to</v>

1243
00:57:25.461 --> 00:57:30.461
<v Speaker 3>resign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was forced to resign because of the </v>

1244
00:57:30.461 --> 00:57:30.461
<v Speaker 3>Pat Tillman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>

1246
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:32.780

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1247
00:57:32.781 --> 00:57:37.781
<v Speaker 3>When Henry Waxman's a committee on </v>
<v Speaker 3>governmental affairs was getting ready </v>

1248
00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:37.781
<v Speaker 3>to call him.</v>

1249
00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:40.190
<v Speaker 1>What was the issue that he had created?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1256
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.790
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Danny,</v>

1265
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:22.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>contacted me trying to get in touch with</v>

1266
00:58:22.641 --> 00:58:23.990
<v Speaker 3>stamp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1267
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:29.100
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I immediately said we'd publish </v>

1268
00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:29.100
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1269
00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I drove down to the Tillman House in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1270
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:37.150
<v Speaker 3>south of the bay and a copied overnight </v>
<v Speaker 3>2000,</v>

1271
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.740
<v Speaker 3>200 pages of army records that she had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been given all redacted,</v>

1272
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all blacked out and pages and stuff.</v>

1273
00:58:45.441 --> 00:58:47.990
<v Speaker 3>But they were in files and sections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all this stuff.</v>

1274
00:58:47.991 --> 00:58:52.991
<v Speaker 3>So I returned the papers and drove back </v>
<v Speaker 3>up to my offices and I flew stand golf </v>

1275
00:58:52.991 --> 00:58:52.991
<v Speaker 3>into Ashland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oregon,</v>

1276
00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:55.550
<v Speaker 3>and we stand.</v>

1277
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:59.000
<v Speaker 3>Did most of the work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but absolutely because Stan knew at all.</v>

1278
00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:04.030
<v Speaker 3>So he decoded the documents and figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out who was who and what was what and </v>

1279
00:59:04.491 --> 00:59:05.210
<v Speaker 3>where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1280
00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:08.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I caught some things that help but stand</v>

1281
00:59:08.421 --> 00:59:13.421
<v Speaker 3>wrote the seven part series a that </v>
<v Speaker 3>proved that a stand that uh,</v>

1282
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:19.700
<v Speaker 3>pat had been killed by friendly fire at </v>
<v Speaker 3>close range,</v>

1283
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Silver Star awarded him was,</v>

1284
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:28.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that was probably the most </v>

1285
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:28.990
<v Speaker 3>offensive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1286
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.040
<v Speaker 3>for many in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1287
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:34.060
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the military was that that silver </v>

1288
00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:36.101
<v Speaker 3>star was fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just destroys the value of the </v>

1289
00:59:36.101 --> 00:59:36.130
<v Speaker 3>silver star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1290
00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:37.820
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1291
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:42.590
<v Speaker 4>we broke that story and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is similar to what they mean,</v>

1292
00:59:42.591 --> 00:59:47.591
<v Speaker 4>it's been the Jessica Lynch story that </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed that story around to apparently </v>

1293
00:59:47.661 --> 00:59:52.661
<v Speaker 4>any story that gets released,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any big story gets doctored up </v>

1294
00:59:52.661 --> 00:59:57.130
<v Speaker 4>favorably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this one was an unfortunate </v>

1295
00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:57.130
<v Speaker 4>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a murder,</v>

1296
00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's claiming it wasn't murder.</v>

1297
00:59:58.050 --> 00:59:58.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1298
00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:03.860
<v Speaker 4>I think people claim it's Samaritan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Danny believes that it's </v>

1299
01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.450
<v Speaker 4>possible that her son was murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she said so.</v>

1300
01:00:05.451 --> 01:00:07.560
<v Speaker 4>She said so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1301
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.280
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could not have been premeditated,</v>

1302
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:15.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was in a full bar situation </v>

1303
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:15.970
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not really combat,</v>

1304
01:00:15.971 --> 01:00:18.760
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't exaggerated stage play in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>respects.</v>

1305
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there had been some incoming fire,</v>

1306
01:00:21.731 --> 01:00:23.710
<v Speaker 3>but it was like three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>400 yards away,</v>

1307
01:00:23.711 --> 01:00:27.170
<v Speaker 3>take a couple of mortgage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fired a couple rounds and ran away and,</v>

1308
01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:27.670
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1309
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
<v Speaker 3>and hear a whole lot of rangers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just start opening up on a lot of </v>

1310
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.481
<v Speaker 3>everything all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is basically the way that played a </v>

1311
01:00:36.481 --> 01:00:38.170
<v Speaker 3>and a but pat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat Tillman's last words,</v>

1312
01:00:38.171 --> 01:00:43.090
<v Speaker 3>when he stood up before he took a three </v>
<v Speaker 3>round burst from a sauce squad automatic</v>

1313
01:00:43.091 --> 01:00:48.091
<v Speaker 3>weapon right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just took his head off where </v>

1314
01:00:48.091 --> 01:00:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm pat fucking tillman</v>

1315
01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:55.250
<v Speaker 4>and that's not disputed that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fully in the record.</v>

1316
01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was the guy that pulled the trigger?</v>

1317
01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:03.500
<v Speaker 4>It was a sergeant in his cereal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was he just,</v>

1318
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.020
<v Speaker 4>was he on edge or was he trying to kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>him?</v>

1319
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.030
<v Speaker 4>I can only speculate here.</v>

1320
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

1321
01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.390
<v Speaker 4>if you add a space that was a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart guy and he was honorable.</v>

1322
01:01:15.391 --> 01:01:16.470
<v Speaker 4>He had seen that,</v>

1323
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.040
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1324
01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.320
<v Speaker 3>the war was all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all lies that,</v>

1325
01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:22.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was disheartened.</v>

1326
01:01:22.911 --> 01:01:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I hear he was a pro football star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1327
01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:26.220
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1328
01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:31.250
<v Speaker 4>I quit the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a huge move to join the army to defend </v>

1329
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.670
<v Speaker 4>his country because he thinks that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1330
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:37.100
<v Speaker 4>everything that you see in the movies is</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it works out and you're supposed to </v>

1331
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:37.570
<v Speaker 4>rise up when your country gets attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As,</v>

1332
01:01:37.571 --> 01:01:40.200
<v Speaker 4>as a patriotic American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to do his part.</v>

1333
01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.990
<v Speaker 4>Well let me just continue with that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

1334
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:51.230
<v Speaker 3>And he kept a diary and so there would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be naturally be fear that he would come </v>

1335
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:55.401
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rejoined the NFL and start bad and the </v>

1336
01:01:55.401 --> 01:01:55.401
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1337
01:01:55.401 --> 01:01:55.630
<v Speaker 2>But that</v>

1338
01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.940
<v Speaker 3>didn't really factor into it that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could have been controlled in many other</v>

1339
01:02:00.941 --> 01:02:05.941
<v Speaker 3>ways than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat Hung around frequently with special </v>

1340
01:02:05.941 --> 01:02:05.941
<v Speaker 3>forces and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

1341
01:02:05.941 --> 01:02:07.350
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of a no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1342
01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:11.390
<v Speaker 3>In theater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because one group does what they do and,</v>

1343
01:02:11.391 --> 01:02:13.690
<v Speaker 3>and anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just the way it works.</v>

1344
01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1345
01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:18.130
<v Speaker 3>I think he was something of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandstander,</v>

1346
01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:18.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1347
01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:19.160
<v Speaker 3>a bit.</v>

1348
01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1349
01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.160
<v Speaker 4>so I think he was making a lot of noise </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was pissing some people off and </v>

1350
01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.790
<v Speaker 4>he was complaining about how fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>things were on.</v>

1351
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:31.300
<v Speaker 4>Somebody might've put it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1352
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:33.780
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1353
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:38.781
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he became a ranger before he </v>

1354
01:02:38.781 --> 01:02:41.211
<v Speaker 4>became a soldier and maybe only Rangers </v>
<v Speaker 4>would understand that or SF would </v>

1355
01:02:41.211 --> 01:02:42.580
<v Speaker 4>understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1356
01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:43.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1357
01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.280
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a totally Shakespearean tragedy.</v>

1358
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:52.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like so fucked up all the way </v>

1359
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380
<v Speaker 4>around for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1360
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:56.010
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever hear the eulogy the brother</v>
<v Speaker 4>gave?</v>

1361
01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:02.210
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty intense too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it was something to that </v>

1362
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.210
<v Speaker 4>extent of Pat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1363
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:03.710
<v Speaker 4>pat sat and Heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pat's fucking dead.</v>

1364
01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.540
<v Speaker 4>Something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1365
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:11.630
<v Speaker 4>he's an atheist or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad you didn't know him because </v>

1366
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:12.500
<v Speaker 4>then he would have like lipstick all </v>
<v Speaker 4>over him and they had</v>

1367
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:18.360
<v Speaker 5>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even want to joke about this.</v>

1368
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't even want to joke about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately.</v>

1369
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:22.420
<v Speaker 5>But your joke about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I almost,</v>

1370
01:03:22.421 --> 01:03:24.780
<v Speaker 5>I came close to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you joke about it with me.</v>

1371
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 5>No matter if you've got blown off your </v>
<v Speaker 5>head got blown off.</v>

1372
01:03:28.801 --> 01:03:33.801
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't put a big deck like damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So try to suck it a smaller Dick Bitch.</v>

1373
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:36.960
<v Speaker 5>That'd be the last thing I would do for </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1374
01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.140
<v Speaker 4>But it's like an American hero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1375
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.790
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing was sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very,</v>

1376
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1377
01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was sad that he,</v>

1378
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:48.460
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1379
01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:54.040
<v Speaker 4>he chose to jump in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was sad that it wasn't what he </v>

1380
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.341
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The truth is is that everything about </v>

1381
01:03:58.341 --> 01:03:58.341
<v Speaker 4>those wars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1382
01:03:58.341 --> 01:04:03.220
<v Speaker 4>the post nine slash 11 wars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything about those wars is fucked </v>

1383
01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:03.220
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>

1384
01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:07.870
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you start off with everything on </v>

1385
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:10.161
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the floor of your building on that </v>

1386
01:04:10.161 --> 01:04:12.531
<v Speaker 4>fucked up the war that takes place on </v>
<v Speaker 4>top of that field can't be anything but </v>

1387
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:17.750
<v Speaker 4>more compoundedly fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you have a just war when you go </v>

1388
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:21.020
<v Speaker 4>into it with no ulterior motives?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Analyze.</v>

1389
01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that this is not like a </v>

1390
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:26.380
<v Speaker 4>fucking army of people in jail right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>know it's,</v>

1391
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.590
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that they can get away with</v>

1392
01:04:28.591 --> 01:04:30.930
<v Speaker 4>that level of corruption and not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>accountable,</v>

1393
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.850
<v Speaker 4>but they do in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in ones and Zeros,</v>

1394
01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Cartesian world,</v>

1395
01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:38.410
<v Speaker 4>measurable matter.</v>

1396
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.100
<v Speaker 4>And of course we know there's such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing as spirit.</v>

1397
01:04:41.101 --> 01:04:46.101
<v Speaker 4>There are things other than matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they operate as if everything is </v>

1398
01:04:46.101 --> 01:04:46.440
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we gotta do,</v>

1399
01:04:46.441 --> 01:04:51.441
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to bring them into the </v>

1400
01:04:51.441 --> 01:04:51.441
<v Speaker 4>light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we got to do.</v>

1401
01:04:51.441 --> 01:04:51.990
<v Speaker 4>That's the solution to all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not as.</v>

1402
01:04:51.991 --> 01:04:54.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they are us.</v>

1403
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:58.290
<v Speaker 4>They're just us in the worst case </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenario and the worst possible position</v>

1404
01:04:58.291 --> 01:05:00.060
<v Speaker 4>doing the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1405
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:05.880
<v Speaker 4>That we are at one of the most ethical </v>
<v Speaker 4>times in human history,</v>

1406
01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:07.980
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps all of human history.</v>

1407
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:11.100
<v Speaker 4>And I really believe that what I said in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie,</v>

1408
01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:12.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is happening,</v>

1409
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:17.870
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that our species is being forced to </v>

1410
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.870
<v Speaker 4>choose</v>

1411
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.100
<v Speaker 4>to evolve or portrait parish to grow up </v>
<v Speaker 4>or fucking die.</v>

1412
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:28.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's obvious when you look at like what </v>

1413
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.210
<v Speaker 4>we're doing as far as like and fish out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the ocean and depleting resources and</v>

1414
01:05:30.211 --> 01:05:31.610
<v Speaker 4>polluting things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're.</v>

1415
01:05:31.611 --> 01:05:36.611
<v Speaker 4>We're certainly not doing it in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sustainable way right now and now I </v>

1416
01:05:36.611 --> 01:05:38.010
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's impossible if,</v>

1417
01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:40.080
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we kept the population exactly.</v>

1418
01:05:40.081 --> 01:05:41.430
<v Speaker 4>How is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is right now.</v>

1419
01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:46.880
<v Speaker 4>It might even be possible to run the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world the way it is and use the </v>

1420
01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.420
<v Speaker 4>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but know what might be possible do as we</v>

1421
01:05:48.421 --> 01:05:53.421
<v Speaker 4>move along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's not how we doing it right now </v>

1422
01:05:53.421 --> 01:05:54.810
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are overextended,</v>

1423
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:55.760
<v Speaker 4>but we're doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1424
01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.770
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1425
01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:59.340
<v Speaker 4>We are about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is imploding right now,</v>

1426
01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:02.370
<v Speaker 4>but right now we're doing fine right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1427
01:06:02.371 --> 01:06:05.960
<v Speaker 4>We have electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We the food.</v>

1428
01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:07.620
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not everybody.</v>

1429
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:12.730
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the ego bomb because this is </v>

1430
01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:14.130
<v Speaker 4>where I have the hardest trouble getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>through to people,</v>

1431
01:06:14.131 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 4>but because they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

1432
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:18.210
<v Speaker 4>how long do we have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When is it going to happen?</v>

1433
01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.310
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And subconsciously,</v>

1434
01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:23.970
<v Speaker 4>all they're really saying is how long </v>
<v Speaker 4>before it fucks with me.</v>

1435
01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long before I'm uncomfortable </v>

1436
01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:30.250
<v Speaker 4>exactly by like here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1437
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:34.470
<v Speaker 4>that's why collapsed net exists because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we bear witness to the fact that,</v>

1438
01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all over Pakistan,</v>

1439
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:40.160
<v Speaker 4>cities are having blackouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That by the way was very authentic.</v>

1440
01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.110
<v Speaker 4>Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pakistan,</v>

1441
01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:46.010
<v Speaker 4>the blackouts lasting weeks at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same in Mindanao,</v>

1442
01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:47.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>India,</v>

1443
01:06:47.521 --> 01:06:52.521
<v Speaker 4>major power blackouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A civilization is collapsing all around </v>

1444
01:06:53.161 --> 01:06:58.161
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just because people choose not to </v>

1445
01:06:58.161 --> 01:06:59.460
<v Speaker 4>hold it in their consciousness don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean it ain't going on.</v>

1446
01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:03.420
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you recognize it as an inescapable trend</v>

1447
01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:05.940
<v Speaker 4>that only a shift in consciousness can </v>
<v Speaker 4>alter.</v>

1448
01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:08.730
<v Speaker 4>So if the shift of consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 4>occurred,</v>

1449
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:12.510
<v Speaker 4>how would that alter what would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would be the correct thing to do if</v>

1450
01:07:12.511 --> 01:07:17.511
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human population was brought into </v>

1451
01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:17.511
<v Speaker 4>the light and everybody's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>figured it out and said,</v>

1452
01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:22.101
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to act responsibly and stopped </v>

1453
01:07:22.101 --> 01:07:22.101
<v Speaker 4>being a bunch of greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cons,</v>

1454
01:07:22.101 --> 01:07:26.300
<v Speaker 4>what would we do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it would all spring from a </v>

1455
01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:29.030
<v Speaker 4>fundamental</v>

1456
01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.850
<v Speaker 4>overriding awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a conviction,</v>

1457
01:07:31.851 --> 01:07:33.200
<v Speaker 4>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just awareness,</v>

1458
01:07:33.201 --> 01:07:34.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're living it,</v>

1459
01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:35.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1460
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:37.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of</v>

1461
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:43.100
<v Speaker 4>the oneness of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the connectedness of everything.</v>

1462
01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1463
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:48.080
<v Speaker 4>that's the place where you start</v>

1464
01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.250
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1465
01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.980
<v Speaker 4>once you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>among other things,</v>

1466
01:07:54.981 --> 01:07:57.980
<v Speaker 4>you overcome the pairs of opposites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>

1467
01:07:57.981 --> 01:07:58.640
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rich,</v>

1468
01:07:58.641 --> 01:07:59.780
<v Speaker 4>poor fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thin,</v>

1469
01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.010
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1470
01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.160
<v Speaker 4>this world of duality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1471
01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.800
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I hit,</v>

1472
01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:10.810
<v Speaker 4>there's some amazing work being done in </v>
<v Speaker 4>quantum physics that is totally bearing </v>

1473
01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:13.610
<v Speaker 4>this out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1474
01:08:13.611 --> 01:08:15.530
<v Speaker 4>there's some amazing research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1475
01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:16.030
<v Speaker 4>amit</v>

1476
01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:16.930
<v Speaker 3>go twomey is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1477
01:08:16.931 --> 01:08:17.980
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1478
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:23.280
<v Speaker 3>a quantum physicist and great book out </v>
<v Speaker 3>by David Wilcock and other stuff that,</v>

1479
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.510
<v Speaker 3>a lot of stuff that I kind of became </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of along the way.</v>

1480
01:08:26.511 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the awareness of that.</v>

1481
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Once it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once it comes or at flowers in the </v>

1482
01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:36.320
<v Speaker 3>species and pray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pray,</v>

1483
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.360
<v Speaker 3>God's got a spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

1484
01:08:38.361 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1485
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:44.390
<v Speaker 3>we just won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will just automatically stopped doing</v>

1486
01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.530
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff that we're doing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>turning this planet into a living hell.</v>

1487
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Gulf of Mexico is totally destroyed.</v>

1488
01:08:51.921 --> 01:08:56.360
<v Speaker 3>They got shrimp with our guts hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in one eye and that eye in their ass</v>

1489
01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:58.280
<v Speaker 3>and crabs with half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shell,</v>

1490
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been running the photos of this </v>

1491
01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:03.520
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1492
01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.200
<v Speaker 3>on collapsed net.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it climatologically there's,</v>

1493
01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:10.100
<v Speaker 3>there are a plumes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1494
01:09:10.101 --> 01:09:12.410
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two kilometers across 20,</v>

1495
01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:17.411
<v Speaker 3>30 of them have methane venting directly</v>
<v Speaker 3>up from Tundra in Siberia.</v>

1496
01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:23.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like methane is 20 times </v>
<v Speaker 3>more powerful greenhouse gas than co </v>

1497
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:27.710
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This mess is out of control.</v>

1498
01:09:27.711 --> 01:09:30.590
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come crashing down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing,</v>

1499
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:34.220
<v Speaker 3>because by calculation I had a guest on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my radio show.</v>

1500
01:09:34.221 --> 01:09:39.221
<v Speaker 3>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a professor from Arizona State and </v>

1501
01:09:39.221 --> 01:09:42.410
<v Speaker 3>so I'm having a brain fart on his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll come up in a minute.</v>

1502
01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1503
01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:50.850
<v Speaker 3>but climatological that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible study that says you have to </v>

1504
01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:54.761
<v Speaker 3>stop all economic activity now or else </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the everything dies irreversibly </v>

1505
01:09:55.220 --> 01:10:00.220
<v Speaker 3>as a result of temperature rise as it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard science.</v>

1506
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:04.760
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on all these fronts,</v>

1507
01:10:04.761 --> 01:10:06.760
<v Speaker 3>with all that stuff happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just stood back,</v>

1508
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:11.830
<v Speaker 3>reason I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this train wreck cannot be prevented at </v>

1509
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:16.571
<v Speaker 3>this level of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that can save us now </v>

1510
01:10:16.571 --> 01:10:16.820
<v Speaker 3>literally is a miracle,</v>

1511
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A miracle,</v>

1512
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:22.790
<v Speaker 1>a revolution of human consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if that does happen,</v>

1513
01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:24.570
<v Speaker 1>if there's revelations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>

1514
01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:26.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would want to call it.</v>

1515
01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.950
<v Speaker 1>If that did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would we do?</v>

1516
01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.820
<v Speaker 1>How would we fix everything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just seems to me that the,</v>

1517
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the we have to ship things.</v>

1518
01:10:33.111 --> 01:10:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to move,</v>

1519
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.920
<v Speaker 1>we have to manufacture shit and we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move it around places because people </v>

1520
01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:38.920
<v Speaker 1>need stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1521
01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.890
<v Speaker 1>you got to get food to supermarkets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>

1522
01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:42.230
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa keep growing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep it can keep a good cycle</v>

1523
01:10:42.231 --> 01:10:44.300
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to burn something.</v>

1524
01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.250
<v Speaker 1>You gotta use something's got to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>those engines.</v>

1525
01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least public transportation.</v>

1526
01:10:49.641 --> 01:10:51.740
<v Speaker 1>And then people were going to want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have cars.</v>

1527
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to get all this shit?</v>

1528
01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Just drives you crazy thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doughnut.</v>

1529
01:10:55.490 --> 01:11:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that we got so out of hand </v>

1530
01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:00.490
<v Speaker 1>and we got out as a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

1531
01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:04.631
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like someone who was just at a </v>

1532
01:11:04.631 --> 01:11:05.900
<v Speaker 1>college and you gave them an unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastercard and you don't have to pay for</v>

1533
01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 1>the first year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just fucking went bananas,</v>

1534
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:13.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went bananas to the point where </v>

1535
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>it's completely unsustainable and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize you have this debt of</v>

1536
01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.850
<v Speaker 5>the way you're living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just so disproportionate resources.</v>

1537
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:24.080
<v Speaker 5>Here's the ultimate kicker to all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are not enough resources in the </v>

1538
01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:28.650
<v Speaker 5>world to pay off the debt that has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>printed since 2008.</v>

1539
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:33.980
<v Speaker 5>All the bailouts or debt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So all the resources in the world like </v>

1540
01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:34.740
<v Speaker 5>as far as all the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the diamonds,</v>

1541
01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:38.070
<v Speaker 5>all the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about iron and copper and food.</v>

1542
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:43.310
<v Speaker 5>But energy is the first resource because</v>
<v Speaker 5>without energy you can't use anything </v>

1543
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:45.120
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's amazing.</v>

1544
01:11:45.121 --> 01:11:50.121
<v Speaker 5>So how is that possible that we have an </v>
<v Speaker 5>economy that's not based on an entirely </v>

1545
01:11:50.121 --> 01:11:50.700
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1546
01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:55.701
<v Speaker 5>Anything can be worth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that just shows you how completely </v>

1547
01:11:55.701 --> 01:11:56.580
<v Speaker 5>full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole idea of the economy is,</v>

1548
01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:01.820
<v Speaker 5>if they're the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the resources of the world and you </v>

1549
01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:01.820
<v Speaker 5>owe more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone got fucked.</v>

1550
01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:02.750
<v Speaker 5>Someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone,</v>

1551
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:05.190
<v Speaker 5>someone fucked you out of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1552
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:06.050
<v Speaker 5>Plus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1553
01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.960
<v Speaker 5>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about how strong the fuckery is in</v>

1554
01:12:09.961 --> 01:12:14.961
<v Speaker 5>this economy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is so bad that literally we owe </v>

1555
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.120
<v Speaker 5>more than there is value in anything in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world to pay off.</v>

1556
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.240
<v Speaker 5>It costs more to make a penny than a </v>
<v Speaker 5>penny's worth the same thing.</v>

1557
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:27.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean it seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's,</v>

1558
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:29.190
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

1559
01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.160
<v Speaker 5>here's the catch to all of that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>founded,</v>

1560
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:36.240
<v Speaker 5>founded on a premise of infinite growth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1561
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:42.270
<v Speaker 5>Infinite growth on a finite planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is not possible with finite </v>

1562
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:43.140
<v Speaker 5>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:45.240
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever read black gold </v>
<v Speaker 5>stranglehold?</v>

1564
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.110
<v Speaker 5>Do you know the premise behind that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1565
01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:48.920
<v Speaker 5>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who was that?</v>

1566
01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.370
<v Speaker 5>Was that your room course?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1567
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:52.890
<v Speaker 5>that was sinful book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't really.</v>

1568
01:12:52.891 --> 01:12:54.870
<v Speaker 5>I had it on my disinfect show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1569
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:57.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was a book that was,</v>

1570
01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:00.960
<v Speaker 5>it was still completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1571
01:13:00.961 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you,</v>

1572
01:13:01.351 --> 01:13:02.870
<v Speaker 5>how is that guy that knows it?</v>

1573
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:03.540
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1574
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:08.550
<v Speaker 5>the premise was that goal that oil was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a byproduct of fossil fuels or a</v>

1575
01:13:09.001 --> 01:13:09.780
<v Speaker 5>biotic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1576
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:10.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

1577
01:13:10.561 --> 01:13:15.561
<v Speaker 5>it was a process of the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like literally the blood of the </v>

1578
01:13:15.561 --> 01:13:16.230
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Earth has an endlessly filled,</v>

1579
01:13:16.231 --> 01:13:21.231
<v Speaker 5>creamy nougat center that will satisfy </v>
<v Speaker 5>your every desire for as long as you're </v>

1580
01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:21.690
<v Speaker 5>Kinky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as should crave it.</v>

1581
01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.800
<v Speaker 5>What dirty evil vampire cons people are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just suck the oil out of the earth </v>

1582
01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:29.700
<v Speaker 5>until it's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're doing.</v>

1583
01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:33.870
<v Speaker 5>We're running our entire crazy business </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the blood of the earth.</v>

1584
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.140
<v Speaker 5>We're like the craziest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly what it is to.</v>

1585
01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is the blood of the earth.</v>

1586
01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:42.180
<v Speaker 5>Soil is life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All we're doing is burning ancient </v>

1587
01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.481
<v Speaker 5>sunlight that was stored in light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all solar energy in one form or </v>

1588
01:13:44.481 --> 01:13:48.141
<v Speaker 5>another on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy when you really stop and </v>

1589
01:13:48.141 --> 01:13:48.141
<v Speaker 5>think about it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is God.</v>

1590
01:13:48.141 --> 01:13:50.220
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing when you really think about</v>

1591
01:13:50.221 --> 01:13:52.230
<v Speaker 5>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think they're natives?</v>

1592
01:13:52.231 --> 01:13:54.540
<v Speaker 5>Call it father sky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they were dumb.</v>

1593
01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.120
<v Speaker 5>They didn't shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know.</v>

1594
01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:00.380
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't even have fucking horses,</v>

1595
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:02.730
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had given them horses settled down.</v>

1596
01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.670
<v Speaker 5>Fucking magic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That might be all fake.</v>

1597
01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.800
<v Speaker 5>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are the people that came across </v>

1598
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:10.800
<v Speaker 5>the bering strait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was proven recently actually when</v>

1599
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.120
<v Speaker 5>this Mormon tried</v>

1600
01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:12.520
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1601
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.320
<v Speaker 1>tried to flex because he in the Mormon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Book of Mormon,</v>

1602
01:14:17.321 --> 01:14:20.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck that nonsense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Smith character wrote when he was</v>

1603
01:14:20.621 --> 01:14:24.220
<v Speaker 1>14 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody followed along with a,</v>

1604
01:14:24.221 --> 01:14:29.221
<v Speaker 1>it was said that they believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American Indian was actually the lost </v>

1605
01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:34.690
<v Speaker 1>tribe of Israel and that he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prove it with a genetic test.</v>

1606
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.400
<v Speaker 1>So he ran a DNA sequence on an American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian.</v>

1607
01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of it is a actually Asian.</v>

1608
01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Most American Indians are actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came down from the street hockey.</v>

1609
01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.730
<v Speaker 3>Joe was 18 sixties running a DNA test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1610
01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:51.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1611
01:14:51.181 --> 01:14:51.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1612
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Recently ran a DNA test on American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians and find out the origin because </v>

1613
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.680
<v Speaker 1>if they were Israelis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could like see this is the lost tribe</v>

1614
01:14:58.681 --> 01:15:01.020
<v Speaker 1>of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there were some medic and he could,</v>

1615
01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I guess they could find that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was not.</v>

1616
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:06.540
<v Speaker 1>It was the most likely that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian religions or business.</v>

1617
01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 3>And I really think overall Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 3>had the best business plan.</v>

1618
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:17.011
<v Speaker 3>That's what it boils down to a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's happening now is people are </v>

1619
01:15:17.011 --> 01:15:21.721
<v Speaker 3>also beginning to understand that part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this great awakening is that many of </v>

1620
01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:27.751
<v Speaker 3>us are returning to wisdom that existed </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the word religion even existed.</v>

1621
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:33.541
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the knowledge of the ancients </v>

1622
01:15:33.541 --> 01:15:35.440
<v Speaker 3>living in direct connection with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet and everything on it.</v>

1623
01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:40.560
<v Speaker 1>You can adjust the tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can absolutely learn from other </v>

1624
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.290
<v Speaker 1>people's revelations that are written </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and recorded,</v>

1625
01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but the moment that people start </v>
<v Speaker 1>attaching gods to them,</v>

1626
01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.260
<v Speaker 1>and sorry that you were talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of Shit,</v>

1627
01:15:47.261 --> 01:15:48.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>

1628
01:15:48.641 --> 01:15:53.641
<v Speaker 1>If you're a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you really don't know what you're </v>

1629
01:15:53.641 --> 01:15:55.861
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you're saying a bunch of </v>

1630
01:15:55.861 --> 01:15:55.861
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1631
01:15:55.861 --> 01:15:55.861
<v Speaker 1>Either you learned something or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

1632
01:15:55.861 --> 01:15:56.680
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

1633
01:15:56.681 --> 01:16:01.681
<v Speaker 1>when you start thinking about things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mormons are scientologists or </v>

1634
01:16:01.681 --> 01:16:04.030
<v Speaker 1>anything where it's like just even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiff of crazy.</v>

1635
01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you address that?</v>

1636
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Had Dog allow it to happen is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell Ya,</v>

1637
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I've never met nicer folks than Mormons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the nicest people I know are </v>

1638
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:17.041
<v Speaker 1>Mormons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a great sense of community in </v>

1639
01:16:17.041 --> 01:16:17.041
<v Speaker 1>the Mormon Church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1640
01:16:17.041 --> 01:16:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been to services before </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had friends that were Mormon.</v>

1641
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I've been to a mormon funeral before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are very polite and nice people,</v>

1642
01:16:22.421 --> 01:16:24.110
<v Speaker 1>and if you wanted to find like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

1643
01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:24.550
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1644
01:16:24.551 --> 01:16:26.440
<v Speaker 1>here's a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it.</v>

1645
01:16:26.441 --> 01:16:29.890
<v Speaker 1>It enhances family life a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do a lot of things together.</v>

1646
01:16:29.891 --> 01:16:34.891
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a lot of benefits to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get past the fact that it's </v>

1647
01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:36.890
<v Speaker 1>based on some nonsense fairy tale </v>
<v Speaker 1>written by a young con man.</v>

1648
01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Mormons are also very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1649
01:16:39.071 --> 01:16:44.071
<v Speaker 3>very smart in that they have focused on </v>
<v Speaker 3>food storage and food preparation for a </v>

1650
01:16:45.941 --> 01:16:50.941
<v Speaker 3>long time and that is the single most </v>
<v Speaker 3>critical factor for who's going to make </v>

1651
01:16:50.941 --> 01:16:51.850
<v Speaker 3>it and who's not in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>

1652
01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:52.420
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>

1653
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.130
<v Speaker 3>You have to bring everyone back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the world.</v>

1654
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Doom and gloom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1655
01:16:55.781 --> 01:16:57.190
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to take.</v>

1656
01:16:57.210 --> 01:17:02.210
<v Speaker 3>You might have a wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the last time you were at </v>

1657
01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1658
01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1659
01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:03.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works today.</v>

1660
01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:08.610
<v Speaker 1>But you should go to Disneyland before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fucking planet of the apes </v>

1661
01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:12.531
<v Speaker 1>stocks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking ghost town and you have to get </v>

1664
01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:18.230
<v Speaker 1>in the car because the zombies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

1665

1672
01:17:31.551 --> 01:17:33.040

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1673
01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I can think of a couple more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather party assets.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Did you know it was really.</v>

1680
01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:46.170
<v Speaker 1>The lines were easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1681
01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I go on little kid rides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A totally different experience.</v>

1682
01:17:49.221 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not waiting for space mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember waiting like 10 minutes to go</v>

1683
01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:57.011
<v Speaker 1>in the submarine the submarine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I liked the teacups that just kids </v>

1684
01:17:57.011 --> 01:17:57.770
<v Speaker 1>love tea kills her fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are fun.</v>

1685
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun when you,</v>

1686
01:17:59.071 --> 01:18:04.071
<v Speaker 1>when they're your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really an amazing thing that </v>

1687
01:18:04.071 --> 01:18:05.840
<v Speaker 1>happens when you have kids is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the actual joy of them having joy.</v>

1688
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:11.050
<v Speaker 1>It's really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I used to see kids having fun and </v>

1689
01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:11.050
<v Speaker 1>not go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1690
01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:11.960
<v Speaker 1>that kid looks like he's having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks awesome.</v>

1691
01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And it would make me feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't make you feel good.</v>

1692
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Like you're a little kid experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the happiness when you have a kid and </v>

1693
01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:24.131
<v Speaker 1>they're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like jumping around and laughing and </v>

1694
01:18:24.131 --> 01:18:24.131
<v Speaker 1>having a good time.</v>

1695
01:18:24.131 --> 01:18:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You actually experienced that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you live through it.</v>

1696
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I don't like?</v>

1697
01:18:27.831 --> 01:18:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't like when kids have that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>

1698
01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:33.450
<v Speaker 1>out of nowhere they just start grabbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your leg and like,</v>

1699
01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:38.480
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like holding onto you and you're like a </v>

1700
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.211
<v Speaker 1>random stranger kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're at the garden or something like </v>

1701
01:18:40.211 --> 01:18:40.211
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just grabbing it.</v>

1702
01:18:40.211 --> 01:18:40.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uncomfortable.</v>

1703
01:18:40.211 --> 01:18:41.050
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

1838
01:25:01.981 --> 01:25:03.630
<v Speaker 3>but he was definitely not a suicide.</v>

1839
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:06.380
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you slash your throat and then</v>

1840
01:25:06.381 --> 01:25:11.381
<v Speaker 5>cut your own risks?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you do risk and then throw it out </v>

1841
01:25:11.381 --> 01:25:11.381
<v Speaker 5>too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll bleed out too fast.</v>

1842
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:12.920
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make the movies.</v>

1843
01:25:12.921 --> 01:25:17.921
<v Speaker 5>Make it seem like you could like </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually play a piano song before you </v>

1844
01:25:17.921 --> 01:25:20.771
<v Speaker 5>die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She must have been a bad ass bitch </v>

1845
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:20.771
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She could pull that off.</v>

1846
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:20.771
<v Speaker 5>Cut a guy's wrist and his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

1847
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:22.790
<v Speaker 5>And people get tired of kicking their </v>
<v Speaker 5>ass.</v>

1848
01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:25.760
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing what raged can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1849
01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:30.980
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking assholes out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have whatever we have stopped that </v>

1850
01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:35.381
<v Speaker 5>Michael Rupert is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my number one goal in life </v>

1851
01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:37.841
<v Speaker 5>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So figuring out how to diminish the </v>

1852
01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:37.841
<v Speaker 5>amount of assholes in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1853
01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:40.100
<v Speaker 5>I get off the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Internet has the secret.</v>

1854
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:43.010
<v Speaker 5>I became a cop trying to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1855
01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.960
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clearly that's a losing battle.</v>

1856
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:46.840
<v Speaker 5>That was your motivation to become </v>
<v Speaker 5>himself,</v>

1857
01:25:47.150 --> 01:25:48.890
<v Speaker 5>to try to make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1858
01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.460
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember when you started to </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize that the system was almost like </v>

1859
01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:55.760
<v Speaker 5>unfixable?</v>

1860
01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:00.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1861
01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:02.180
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you require that in stages.</v>

1862
01:26:02.181 --> 01:26:04.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pulled worm out of a can,</v>

1863
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.650
<v Speaker 3>CIA bringing drugs into the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1864
01:26:06.651 --> 01:26:11.651
<v Speaker 3>this is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as I get this to the right </v>

1865
01:26:11.651 --> 01:26:11.651
<v Speaker 3>people's attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll stop it immediately.</v>

1866
01:26:11.651 --> 01:26:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

1867
01:26:12.711 --> 01:26:14.940
<v Speaker 3>That was before Iran Contra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1868
01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:19.190
<v Speaker 3>and so that worm turned out to be all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>human industrial civilization.</v>

1869
01:26:19.191 --> 01:26:24.191
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turned out to be the whole economic </v>

1870
01:26:24.191 --> 01:26:24.191
<v Speaker 3>paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turned out to be.</v>

1871
01:26:24.191 --> 01:26:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Everything was crooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was a lie.</v>

1872
01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Everything was manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a CIA friend recently who I was </v>

1873
01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:34.140
<v Speaker 3>talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a former CIA guy and,</v>

1874
01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:37.150
<v Speaker 3>and he had been in a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1875
01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:42.410
<v Speaker 3>that was the first briefing of Bill </v>
<v Speaker 3>Casey as a DCI under Ronald Reagan,</v>

1876
01:26:42.651 --> 01:26:45.530
<v Speaker 3>director of Central Intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Casey wore the glasses,</v>

1877
01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.240
<v Speaker 3>start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran around contract.</v>

1878
01:26:47.241 --> 01:26:50.570
<v Speaker 3>He had been a stock broker before he </v>
<v Speaker 3>became CIA director.</v>

1879
01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:55.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Bill Casey took a US domestic </v>

1880
01:26:55.671 --> 01:27:00.671
<v Speaker 3>cocaine consumption from 60 metric tons </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1979 to 600 metric tons.</v>

1881
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:06.340
<v Speaker 3>And that money went to Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1882
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Casey had his first briefing as DCI and </v>

1883
01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:11.480
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen,</v>

1884
01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.850
<v Speaker 3>we will know that everything that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we are successful,</v>

1885
01:27:13.851 --> 01:27:17.720
<v Speaker 3>when everything that the American people</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe is true is false.</v>

1886
01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been around,</v>

1887
01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:25.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept good notes.</v>

1888
01:27:25.811 --> 01:27:30.811
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took really good notes and I left a </v>

1889
01:27:30.811 --> 01:27:30.811
<v Speaker 3>good solid record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1890
01:27:32.490 --> 01:27:37.490
<v Speaker 1>so you think you're alive because you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>said too much already and there's </v>

1891
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.490
<v Speaker 1>nothing they could do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1892
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out there.</v>

1893
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:38.550
<v Speaker 1>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let him live.</v>

1894
01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I also think I'm alive because spirit </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants me alive.</v>

1895
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:45.080
<v Speaker 3>The spirit I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had spirit intervened so many times</v>

1896
01:27:45.081 --> 01:27:47.240
<v Speaker 3>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of what the story is now</v>

1897
01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:52.241
<v Speaker 3>that I have to tell in my next book </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there is something powerful and,</v>

1898
01:27:53.611 --> 01:27:57.410
<v Speaker 3>and I think wonderful a foot here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all I can do is tell the truth about</v>

1899
01:27:57.411 --> 01:28:02.411
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be dishonest of me as a </v>

1900
01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:02.411
<v Speaker 3>journalist to leave that out of the work</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've already done.</v>

1901
01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:06.010
<v Speaker 1>When you exposed all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you expose the CIA,</v>

1902
01:28:06.011 --> 01:28:08.150
<v Speaker 1>when you stepped in front of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1903
01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.780
<v Speaker 1>what was the man's a designation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy that you,</v>

1904
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:11.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1905
01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:14.210
<v Speaker 3>and John John Deutch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was DCI,</v>

1906
01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:17.360
<v Speaker 3>director of Central Intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>appointed by Bill Clinton.</v>

1907
01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:19.690
<v Speaker 1>That was an incredibly courageous thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do on camera,</v>

1908
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:21.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to step in and,</v>

1909
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:26.410
<v Speaker 1>and not just say that you were a former </v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles police,</v>

1910
01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:31.420
<v Speaker 1>narcotics officers that when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it caught the CIA doing this,</v>

1911
01:28:31.421 --> 01:28:33.230
<v Speaker 1>but you named operations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1912
01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.060
<v Speaker 1>mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1913
01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you gave out information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just,</v>

1914
01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:38.910
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blank slate.</v>

1915
01:28:39.130 --> 01:28:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:28:40.901 --> 01:28:45.840
<v Speaker 1>That must be the worst fucking case </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario for the,</v>

1917
01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.360
<v Speaker 1>the creepy industrialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constant run the world.</v>

1918
01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Some dude who wants to be a superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some dude who wants to save the world.</v>

1919
01:28:54.641 --> 01:28:59.641
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm just pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear him just fucking pissed off for</v>

1920
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.540
<v Speaker 4>a good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you don't,</v>

1921
01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:05.730
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to recognize this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's a hero move.</v>

1922
01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:08.040
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When a guy does that and stands in front</v>

1923
01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:10.590
<v Speaker 4>of a motherfucker like that and you say </v>

1926
01:29:15.061 --> 01:29:19.140
<v Speaker 4>Because for people who don't know who </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't heard this or seen this,</v>

1927

<v Speaker 4>was it like when you finally got that </v>

1936
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.380
<v Speaker 4>information now when it came out of your</v>

<v Speaker 4>courtroom was cheering?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't,</v>

1940
01:29:44.811 --> 01:29:46.590
<v Speaker 4>you knew that he was the high school </v>
<v Speaker 4>auditorium.</v>

1941
01:29:46.591 --> 01:29:51.591
<v Speaker 4>There were 12 slash 12 and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was unbelievably high.</v>

1943
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:57.170
<v Speaker 4>It was like super peak awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1944
01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.830
<v Speaker 4>how it is when you know how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1945
01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.350
<v Speaker 4>and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

1946
01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:06.920
<v Speaker 4>It was like one of my favorite maxims is</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't shoot unless you've got a </v>

1947
01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.280
<v Speaker 4>headshot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I had John Deutch and a headshot and</v>

1948
01:30:08.281 --> 01:30:12.030
<v Speaker 4>I pulled the fucking trigger and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>cost him his appointment as secretary of</v>

1949
01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:13.200
<v Speaker 4>defense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and because he clowned him like that.</v>
