00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:32.101
<v Speaker 4>saw away the tips of the bones and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>scar tissue forms on each bone and it </v>

74

<v Speaker 4>acts as a new cartilage.</v>

<v Speaker 3>get prescribed them and how insane the </v>
<v Speaker 3>businesses and how over prescribed they </v>

237
00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:42.731
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

238
00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:46.570
<v Speaker 3>While he's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to get hip replacement surgery </v>

239
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:46.630
<v Speaker 3>and he gets hooked now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

240
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.820
<v Speaker 3>he's doing the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's hooked on pills and he's got to </v>

241
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.530
<v Speaker 3>kind of cover it up and these kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot.</v>

242
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.690
<v Speaker 3>He's embarrassed because like he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to put together this documentary </v>

243
00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.480
<v Speaker 3>and he's hooked on pills and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally in the documentary,</v>

244
00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:04.481
<v Speaker 3>once he becomes clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he just comes clean in the </v>

245
00:11:04.481 --> 00:11:04.481
<v Speaker 3>documentary and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

246
00:11:04.481 --> 00:11:05.720
<v Speaker 3>He was on pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

247
00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:06.770
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

248
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:09.560
<v Speaker 3>He takes you out to his car and he shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>you his car,</v>

249
00:11:09.561 --> 00:11:12.590
<v Speaker 3>like how we fucking collided in the shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was all pilled up.</v>

250
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shows all the dense and his </v>

251
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 3>headlight's hanging off and it's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

252
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.241
<v Speaker 3>Philip Seymour Hoffman got back on drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was doing a role that was </v>

253
00:11:22.241 --> 00:11:22.241
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

254
00:11:22.241 --> 00:11:25.880
<v Speaker 3>he on drugs in the role or was he drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But whatever it was,</v>

255
00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:30.881
<v Speaker 3>he'd been sober for like 20 years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>going into this place night after night </v>

256
00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:35.561
<v Speaker 3>doing this play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started taking pills again and you </v>

257
00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:35.561
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any.</v>

258
00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:39.800
<v Speaker 3>I just don't get why doctors prescribe </v>
<v Speaker 3>pills to somebody who's a known addict.</v>

259
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.350
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a shit that.</v>

260
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I think doctors get so used to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>being sick and people dying and it's,</v>

261
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just becomes normal to them.</v>

262
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.450
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

263
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Speaker 3>I had this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Rhonda Patrick in the other day.</v>

264
00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:54.460
<v Speaker 3>She's a research scientist</v>

265
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.300
<v Speaker 5>and she was talking about a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiments that they had to do with.</v>

266
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 5>He had to kill mice and when she first </v>
<v Speaker 5>started doing these experiments,</v>

267
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.500
<v Speaker 5>should we get really sad and she'd cry </v>
<v Speaker 5>and this like.</v>

268
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just really upsetting.</v>

269
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.860
<v Speaker 5>After a couple months she says gas and </v>
<v Speaker 5>these motherfuckers looking at </v>

270
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:10.860
<v Speaker 5>Auschwitz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She didn't even care.</v>

271
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.910
<v Speaker 5>You just get totally used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

272
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 5>and I think for doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a doctor for 10 years,</v>

273
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 5>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>30 years,</v>

274
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:21.511
<v Speaker 5>40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these patients are sick and dying </v>

275
00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:21.511
<v Speaker 5>and all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one sees you.</v>

276
00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:25.801
<v Speaker 5>If they're doing great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody sees you because they got a </v>

277
00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:27.280
<v Speaker 5>tumor or a broken leg and he just take </v>
<v Speaker 5>these pills and get the fuck outta here.</v>

278
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 1>You're just a mouse here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have some cheese and some pills.</v>

279
00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.540
<v Speaker 5>Chris Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy who made that documentary just </v>

280
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.720
<v Speaker 5>sent me a text yesterday saying that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say I'll forward it to you,</v>

281
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.360
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can put it up here,</v>

282
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.860
<v Speaker 5>but he was saying that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a new law that just got passed.</v>

283
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.780
<v Speaker 5>A doctors are urged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

284
00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:49.880
<v Speaker 5>this is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's on US USA Today.</v>

285
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.920
<v Speaker 5>You could find it from yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm new guidelines for prescription,</v>

286
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.700
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to reduce abuse and overdoses.</v>

287
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.340
<v Speaker 5>So there are urgent doctors to try to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>something about this because there's,</v>

288
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 5>they're finally starting to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think a lot of it is just because </v>

289
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.180
<v Speaker 5>of all these documentaries and all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>internet blogs that are,</v>

290
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.120
<v Speaker 5>that are coming out and youtube videos </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all these,</v>

291
00:13:14.121 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>new stories where people are really kind</v>

292
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.880
<v Speaker 5>of grasping the magnitude of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>

293
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand why there's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>one database where you can have multiple</v>

294
00:13:25.251 --> 00:13:27.710
<v Speaker 1>doctors writing prescriptions for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same patient.</v>

295
00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to cvs or rite aid,</v>

296
00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:34.841
<v Speaker 1>there should be a listing of any time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were specifically for the </v>

297
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.230
<v Speaker 1>recipients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

298
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:41.350
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it didn't stop me and I can </v>

299
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.910
<v Speaker 1>remember getting a fresh bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:13:41.911 --> 00:13:43.920
<v Speaker 1>30 pills in it and just holding your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand like,</v>

301
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.200
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>joy bottle.</v>

302
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.420
<v Speaker 5>It never took anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

303
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:53.421
<v Speaker 5>never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took one time when I had my knee </v>

304
00:13:53.421 --> 00:13:55.560
<v Speaker 5>operated on my first knee operation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was the Patella tendon graft,</v>

305
00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.800
<v Speaker 5>which is particularly painful because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they take a piece of bone out of your </v>

306
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.461
<v Speaker 5>shin and a piece of bone out of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>kneecap attached to a strip of your </v>

307
00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:10.191
<v Speaker 5>patella tendon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your patella tendon is a large tenant </v>

308
00:14:10.191 --> 00:14:13.671
<v Speaker 5>that's in the front of your knee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this one that goes from your knee </v>

309
00:14:13.671 --> 00:14:13.770
<v Speaker 5>down to your Shin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

310
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:19.030
<v Speaker 5>Fat One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what they do is they take a slice </v>

311
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.030
<v Speaker 5>out of that and then they open you up </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a fish and then they use that slice</v>

312
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:26.090
<v Speaker 5>and that replaces your acl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that becomes a new acl because this </v>

313
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.800
<v Speaker 5>patella tendon graft is really big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really don't need the whole thing,</v>

314
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.260
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing.</v>

315
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.440
<v Speaker 5>So they take a slice of that and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>creates a new acl and the pain was </v>

316
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.390
<v Speaker 5>pretty insane around the places where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they cut the bone out.</v>

317
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just like fire.</v>

318
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.780
<v Speaker 5>So they gave me something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember,</v>

319
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 5>it was Vicodin or percocet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

320
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.750
<v Speaker 5>but I remember I took it once and I felt</v>
<v Speaker 5>so stupid,</v>

321
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.290
<v Speaker 5>like I was just like dirt or you think </v>
<v Speaker 5>it was Vicodin?</v>

322
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 5>I was so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just my own biology.</v>

323
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 5>The way I reacted to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

324
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.560
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather take the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I sold them to this dude at the pool </v>

325
00:14:59.560 --> 00:14:59.560
<v Speaker 5>hall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy named Jeff,</v>

326
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.680
<v Speaker 5>this Guy Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he always,</v>

327
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 5>he would buy and sell pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a pill head.</v>

328
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 5>He looked like a classic dirt bag from a</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking Beavis and butthead cartoon.</v>

329
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:14.290
<v Speaker 5>He had like long hair that will go down </v>
<v Speaker 5>like this and one of those mustaches </v>

330
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 5>that curled all the way down to like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom of his like.</v>

331
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.000
<v Speaker 5>Whereas Chin.</v>

332
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:18.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

333
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was such a dirt bag.</v>

334
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.700
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a pickup truck rusted out,</v>

335
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.880
<v Speaker 4>probably had a one of those El Camino's </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll pick up and he would drink beer </v>

336
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:31.610
<v Speaker 4>out of the back of it with some friends </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he definitely.</v>

337
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 4>He was a dirt bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nice guy though.</v>

338
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:34.950
<v Speaker 4>But he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

339
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.020
<v Speaker 4>just a classic classic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

340
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.620
<v Speaker 4>I can't fucking take these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

341
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:41.390
<v Speaker 4>you got them at home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bring them in.</v>

342
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:42.990
<v Speaker 4>I'll buy him off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

343
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.570
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I sold them.</v>

344
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.720
<v Speaker 4>I became a drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She given me a bottle with your name on </v>

345
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:49.720
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Standup comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He liked to play pool selling drugs,</v>

351
00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 4>selling drugs to a dirt bag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slang in the pool hall.</v>

352
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 4>I was psyched to get that money to tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>ya know.</v>

353
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:13.040
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like 50 bucks is when you really need it</v>

354
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 4>and is 50 bucks when you don't need it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

355
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 4>money loses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean anything.</v>

356
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.900
<v Speaker 4>Like that's why I never understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone that works incredibly hard,</v>

357
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:28.580
<v Speaker 4>but they're already insanely wealthy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing something they don't enjoy</v>

358
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:33.581
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like constantly trying to </v>

359
00:16:33.581 --> 00:16:34.400
<v Speaker 4>conquer and build a business and keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>going and going,</v>

360
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.670
<v Speaker 4>but they already have billions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars in what they're doing is making </v>

361
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.100
<v Speaker 4>them miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

362
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 4>take it to a next level where you got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy like the Koch brothers.</v>

363
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they are not only working way harder</v>

364
00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:51.161
<v Speaker 4>than they need to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've already covered the next 50 </v>

365
00:16:51.161 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 4>generations of kids did never have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>work and their family,</v>

366
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 4>but they're killing the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're thinking about a legacy for</v>

367
00:16:57.081 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 4>your great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great grandkids,</v>

368
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.640
<v Speaker 4>they're going to live in a 140 degree </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth with no water surrounded by </v>

369
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.120
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

370
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.670
<v Speaker 4>killers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mad max.</v>

371
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.430
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen?</v>

372
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

373
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.960
<v Speaker 4>And it's all gonna fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not stressed out about it.</v>

374
00:17:14.961 --> 00:17:16.460
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

375
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:21.461
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna encourage my kids not to </v>

376
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:21.461
<v Speaker 4>reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that they're going to skate,</v>

377
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:25.810
<v Speaker 4>they're going to skate through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There'll be a lot of terrorism and </v>

378
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:26.510
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a lot of flooding </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some crazy storms.</v>

379
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.800
<v Speaker 4>We have third world countries are all </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna be in an upheaval because you know</v>

380
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 4>the environment is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's gonna affect the poor first.</v>

381
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.330
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

382
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.120
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how much it was blown out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>proportion and how much of it can be </v>

383
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.420
<v Speaker 5>mitigated by new discoveries and new </v>
<v Speaker 5>science and new technology.</v>

384
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.790
<v Speaker 5>Solar power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know?</v>

385
00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know this until Eddie Bravo </v>

386
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 5>came over here and I went down to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>God damn hole about</v>

387
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Rockefeller grandson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

388
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that Rockefeller made there</v>

389
00:17:55.711 --> 00:18:00.711
<v Speaker 3>was a conspiracy to get people to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>oil instead of alcohol and that most </v>

390
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:06.570
<v Speaker 3>combustion engines work on alcohol and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they work just as good,</v>

391
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 3>if not better on alcohol than they do on</v>
<v Speaker 3>gasoline and alcohol.</v>

392
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:16.191
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you don't need fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need or whatever you want to </v>

393
00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:16.520
<v Speaker 3>call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegetable.</v>

394
00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Porn,</v>

395
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they run just as good on that.</v>

396
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

397
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>

398
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>between him doing that and then um,</v>

399
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it,</v>

400
00:18:27.371 --> 00:18:31.870
<v Speaker 3>didn't Ford buy up all the train the </v>
<v Speaker 3>train tracks in Los Angeles to create a,</v>

401
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 3>a car society instead of a train </v>
<v Speaker 3>society?</v>

402
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some sort of conspiracy or were </v>

403
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 3>they the auto?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's conspiracy.</v>

404
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it definitely happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that it's a conspiracy that</v>

405
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.530
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist.</v>

406
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they conspired that they could conspire </v>

407
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 3>to do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know too much about that though.</v>

408
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Is a film about it.</v>

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.740
<v Speaker 3>Last videos of him like whacking these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fenders with a hammer because hemp is </v>

421
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 3>hemp fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Insanely powerful,</v>

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.070
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably strong and really </v>
<v Speaker 3>lightweight.</v>

423
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.680

429
00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:41.511
<v Speaker 3>this emerging industry and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>see anything bad about just trying to </v>

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 3>It was either explorers or might've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cruise,</v>

447
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 3>but they watched it and they were </v>

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

466
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 3>So we're just going to watch it on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>

467
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.430
<v Speaker 3>If we put it on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you go full screen with it though?</v>

468
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

469
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

470
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:13.060
<v Speaker 3>that's the mom trying to head off </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying,</v>

471
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.440
<v Speaker 3>but he's like kid out here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

472
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.630
<v Speaker 3>She can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like twice her size.</v>

473
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.600
<v Speaker 3>The honest stay tune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

474
00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:21.610
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do.</v>

475
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.090
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eat them.</v>

476
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when bears come out of hibernation,</v>

477
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:32.440
<v Speaker 3>one of the first things they do is head </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the cubs.</v>

478
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:38.130
<v Speaker 3>For Haley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the male bears immediately go and kill </v>

479
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:38.130
<v Speaker 3>the cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eat them.</v>

480
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.360
<v Speaker 3>That mom is trying to put up a fight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit,</v>

481
00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:41.830
<v Speaker 3>but she's just so much smaller.</v>

482
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Speaker 3>She's scared and she knows the baby's </v>
<v Speaker 3>already dead.</v>

483
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.350
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing she could do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she turns and then just runs.</v>

484
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.620
<v Speaker 3>She realizes at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker might eat her too,</v>

485
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.750
<v Speaker 3>which does happen by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

486
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They cannibalize each other.</v>

487
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.170
<v Speaker 3>They kill each other and cannibalize </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

488
00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:01.350
<v Speaker 3>Oftentimes when you hunt bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you kill one bear and you leave it </v>

489
00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:04.570
<v Speaker 3>like to go back and get a truck to pull </v>
<v Speaker 3>it out of the woods.</v>

490
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.310
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come back.</v>

491
00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Other bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we eating it.</v>

492
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:13.170
<v Speaker 3>Bears were all cannibals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point was that like people have </v>

493
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.200
<v Speaker 3>this idea of what these wild animals are</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

494
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.310
<v Speaker 3>they live in harmony in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's chaos.</v>

495
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.800
<v Speaker 3>It's chaos and conflict and murder all </v>
<v Speaker 3>day long and cannibalism especially </v>

496
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 3>bears a 100 percent cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them,</v>

497
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.520
<v Speaker 3>not only with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were in Alberta,</v>

498
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.640
<v Speaker 3>my friend who runs a hunting camp up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there watched a male bear killer cub in </v>

499
00:22:35.981 --> 00:22:36.700
<v Speaker 3>front of the female.</v>

500
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.370
<v Speaker 3>The female tried to fight them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The male bear killed a cub.</v>

501
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.850
<v Speaker 3>She chased him off eventually and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>she went and finished it.</v>

502
00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she ate her own cup.</v>

503
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

504
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's harsh man.</v>

505
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I've got mad at my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

506
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:56.740
<v Speaker 3>I pull up a little short of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't think the male was the,</v>

507
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:57.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the father.</v>

508
00:22:57.401 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Speaker 3>He might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who knows?</v>

509
00:22:58.691 --> 00:23:01.090
<v Speaker 3>He might not even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably knew either.</v>

510
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.820
<v Speaker 3>I thought some bears were just ate </v>
<v Speaker 3>berries and shadow.</v>

511
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.250
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All bears eat meat.</v>

512
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll all North American bears,</v>

513
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:13.550
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't mean they don't eat meat </v>

514
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.751
<v Speaker 3>exclusively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're omnivores except polar </v>

515
00:23:15.751 --> 00:23:18.571
<v Speaker 3>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Polar bears and 100 percent Predator </v>

516
00:23:18.571 --> 00:23:18.571
<v Speaker 3>that the only bear that doesn't need </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything but meat.</v>

517
00:23:18.571 --> 00:23:20.050
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have anything up there.</v>

518
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:25.051
<v Speaker 3>There's no vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything they eat is just meet the </v>

519
00:23:25.051 --> 00:23:25.051
<v Speaker 3>seals and anything that fucks up.</v>

520
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the territory is that </v>

521
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.110
<v Speaker 1>certain animals need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were doing a thing about,</v>

522
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about uh,</v>

523
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.960
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if one there was a,</v>

524
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:41.300
<v Speaker 1>each mountain lion needs like 20 square </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles of territory just for him.</v>

525
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you get within that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fight to the death.</v>

526
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the stakes.</v>

527
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.130
<v Speaker 3>And so there's one mountain lion was </v>
<v Speaker 3>living up in the Santa Monica mountains </v>

528
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.700
<v Speaker 3>like above the Palisades Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

529
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 3>he somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they tagged them,</v>

530
00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:00.130
<v Speaker 3>he somehow ended up over in griffith </v>
<v Speaker 3>park across the four.</v>

531
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

532
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Did you see what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He killed a Koala bear.</v>

533
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He climbed a fence for the 12 foot tall </v>

534
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.371
<v Speaker 3>fence covered with barb wire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got over the fence and killed a qual </v>

535
00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:16.730
<v Speaker 3>bird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for him.</v>

536
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.180
<v Speaker 3>You know where there's a will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a way.</v>

537
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 3>Will they found these mountain lions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco,</v>

538
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:28.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because California doesn't have hunting </v>

539
00:24:28.481 --> 00:24:28.481
<v Speaker 3>laws for mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

540
00:24:28.481 --> 00:24:31.040
<v Speaker 3>they have laws against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot hunt mountain lions,</v>

541
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wildlife Biologists are seriously </v>

542
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 3>against because when you can't control </v>
<v Speaker 3>Predator populations,</v>

543
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 3>they just breed and breed and breed </v>
<v Speaker 3>until it becomes too many of them.</v>

544
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 3>Like you there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any predators other than</v>

545
00:24:42.351 --> 00:24:42.800
<v Speaker 3>a man.</v>

546
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can say,</v>

547
00:24:44.571 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let nature balance and tickets will.</v>

548
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:51.851
<v Speaker 3>That means they move into neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet your friends were part of the </v>

549
00:24:51.851 --> 00:24:54.791
<v Speaker 3>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're part of the balance and we think </v>

550
00:24:54.791 --> 00:24:54.791
<v Speaker 3>we're not because we have the internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the fucking cell phone,</v>

551
00:24:54.791 --> 00:24:56.060
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is they don't give a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit about that.</v>

552
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.500
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these mountain lions,</v>

553
00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.930
<v Speaker 3>they've been killing because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

554
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 3>What they have to do is when they invade</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods,</v>

555
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:03.890
<v Speaker 3>start killing dogs and threatening </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

556
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:04.490
<v Speaker 3>they have to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

557
00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:08.060
<v Speaker 3>they killed over 100 of them the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>year and yeah.</v>

558
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>

559
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 3>They have to shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just do it privately.</v>

560
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:12.380
<v Speaker 3>They don't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make the news,</v>

561
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.650
<v Speaker 3>but when they shot them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found out that their primary diet </v>

562
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:17.650
<v Speaker 3>is pets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

563
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.420
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cats,</v>

564
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.990
<v Speaker 3>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the primary diet like they were.</v>

565
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:25.400
<v Speaker 3>It was only like a small percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>deer in their belly and their bellies.</v>

566
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see any cats around your </v>
<v Speaker 3>house?</v>

567
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:33.070
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a cat around my house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saw a cat that killed my dog in </v>

568
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and I saw another mountain lion</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Santa Barbara on the.</v>

569
00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:37.890
<v Speaker 3>On a fucking residential road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

570
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that big.</v>

571
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.550
<v Speaker 3>It was like a small dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 50,</v>

572
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 3>60 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

573
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:46.230
<v Speaker 3>But it was big enough to freak me the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck out here.</v>

574
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.950
<v Speaker 3>But people know in the valley you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave your dog out in your yard.</v>

575
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.630
<v Speaker 3>You just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

576
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 3>It'll be fucking gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

577
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:53.780
<v Speaker 3>coyote is mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

578
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.100
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

579
00:25:55.550 --> 00:26:00.550
<v Speaker 3>the mountain lion that I saw in Santa </v>
<v Speaker 3>Monica or Santa Barbara rather looked </v>

580
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:00.620
<v Speaker 3>like a coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that size wasn't that big?</v>

581
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.560
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a coyote and then I saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tail.</v>

582
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a cat.</v>

583
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.540
<v Speaker 3>It's seen a cat is so much creepier than</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing a coyote.</v>

584
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know that they like a </v>

585
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.091
<v Speaker 3>coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure I could fuck up a </v>

586
00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:16.091
<v Speaker 3>coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

587
00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:19.180
<v Speaker 3>if a coyote jumped on me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I just grabbed him by his tail </v>

588
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:19.350
<v Speaker 3>and smash his fucking head off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

589
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.250
<v Speaker 3>I had to figure out a way to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I get it,</v>

590
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because of a bugs bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

591
00:26:24.231 --> 00:26:26.090
<v Speaker 3>the Wiley Coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was such a doof.</v>

592
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 3>He's just can't take the breed series.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lena.</v>

593
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're scary.</v>

594
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean if a coyote wanted to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

595
00:26:31.181 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 3>it'd be a real rat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wanted to kill you.</v>

596
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.070
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a real fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

597
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:40.150
<v Speaker 3>But I'm pretty sure if you could snap </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get into full rage psychopath mode,</v>

598
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.160
<v Speaker 3>you could probably kill a coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

599
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 3>But not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a mountain line.</v>

600
00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 3>You'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>50 pounds and they sprang so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast.</v>

602
00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:51.600
<v Speaker 3>So fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.900
<v Speaker 3>They're so fast and they're so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at their bodies in </v>

604
00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.231
<v Speaker 3>comparison to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like one of the most powerful </v>

605
00:27:00.231 --> 00:27:00.231
<v Speaker 3>cats,</v>

606
00:27:00.231 --> 00:27:03.550
<v Speaker 3>They have enormous wrists and forearms </v>
<v Speaker 3>and their shoulders.</v>

607
00:27:03.551 --> 00:27:05.000
<v Speaker 3>They ripped.</v>

685
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.641
<v Speaker 5>choice because there's a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that made the different choice and got </v>

686
00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:34.451
<v Speaker 5>really obsessed with something else that</v>
<v Speaker 5>lead them away from their family when </v>

<v Speaker 5>Are they related?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The horses and the kill himself?</v>

698
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was.</v>

699
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.640
<v Speaker 1>He was away from his family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like it with this free time.</v>

700
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:18.150
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how he was spending it away all </v>

701
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.001
<v Speaker 1>the time and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing I could think of </v>

702
00:31:21.001 --> 00:31:23.491
<v Speaker 1>that would cause it is like you ever sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>down with your family and this is the </v>

703
00:31:23.491 --> 00:31:23.491
<v Speaker 1>greatest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

704
00:31:23.491 --> 00:31:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I love this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just,</v>

705
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:29.750
<v Speaker 1>it made me think like the saddest time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you're with your family </v>

706
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.210
<v Speaker 1>and for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not feeling connected.</v>

707
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.650
<v Speaker 1>You're just feeling like they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're pretending to listen,</v>

708
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:39.850
<v Speaker 1>but you're just in your head thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't I feel close right now and you</v>

709
00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:40.280
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

710
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.150
<v Speaker 1>most times you don't feel like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once in a while you do and that,</v>

711
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.360
<v Speaker 1>those were like the saddest moments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life because it's all right there in </v>

712
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.000
<v Speaker 1>front of me and I can't touch it.</v>

713
00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.810
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's deep.</v>

714
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

715
00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously the guy's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's no way we could ever really </v>

716
00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.121
<v Speaker 5>know what his motive was or what the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the real big factor was that pushed</v>

717
00:32:01.281 --> 00:32:06.200
<v Speaker 5>them over the edge now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think sometimes people just aren't</v>

718
00:32:06.201 --> 00:32:11.201
<v Speaker 5>fucking happy and I think it can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can narrow it down to a couple </v>

719
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:16.650
<v Speaker 5>different things or it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be a group of experiences from </v>

720
00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:18.560
<v Speaker 5>their life that they've never gotten </v>
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>

721
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.170
<v Speaker 5>It could be breakups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

722
00:32:21.171 --> 00:32:26.171
<v Speaker 5>I know people that have been dumped like</v>
<v Speaker 5>in high school or college and just </v>

723
00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:27.020
<v Speaker 5>really never recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

724
00:32:27.021 --> 00:32:29.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a love and then the person just</v>

725
00:32:29.541 --> 00:32:31.190
<v Speaker 5>left them for someone else or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

726
00:32:31.191 --> 00:32:36.191
<v Speaker 5>And then they never bounced back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they fucking nose dive and went right </v>

727
00:32:36.191 --> 00:32:38.660
<v Speaker 5>into the rocks and just never came out </v>
<v Speaker 5>and never had another relationship.</v>

728
00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking,</v>

729
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 4>it's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

730
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 4>it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't about that,</v>

731
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:45.710
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't about that relationship.</v>

732
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:47.350
<v Speaker 4>It was about what came before at </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

733
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 4>Set the stage for them to be that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fragile.</v>

734
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.830
<v Speaker 4>That's the best way to say something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Set the stage.</v>

735
00:32:52.831 --> 00:32:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Like once I loved and it was a gas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>soon turned out,</v>

736
00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:01.450
<v Speaker 4>had a heart of glass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was the first rapper she was,</v>

737
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 4>or one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless she was,</v>

738
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 4>she was hanging out with um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

739
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.960
<v Speaker 4>the sugarhill gang and all those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

740
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:18.320
<v Speaker 4>She hung out with the earliest rappers </v>
<v Speaker 4>and was like at CBGBS.</v>

741
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:20.170
<v Speaker 4>And then she'd go uptown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

742
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.710
<v Speaker 4>And she wrapped it out.</v>

743
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:26.220
<v Speaker 5>The sugarhill gang happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was popular when I was in,</v>

744
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:30.450
<v Speaker 5>I think I was in seventh or eighth </v>
<v Speaker 5>grade,</v>

745
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:33.960
<v Speaker 5>I think I was in seventh grade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure one of those.</v>

746
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:39.260
<v Speaker 5>But when it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember we were in the cafeteria and </v>

747
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.140
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another someone had a boombox</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>

748
00:33:40.141 --> 00:33:42.960
<v Speaker 5>And they were playing it in my junior </v>
<v Speaker 5>high school when I was living in Jamaica</v>

749
00:33:42.961 --> 00:33:45.690
<v Speaker 5>Plain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to a junior high school,</v>

750
00:33:45.691 --> 00:33:49.020
<v Speaker 5>was super sketchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we had a,</v>

751
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:54.110
<v Speaker 5>we'd lived in a very bad neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Jamaica plain is kind of become </v>

752
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.700
<v Speaker 5>gentrified now a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when I lived there like in 1979,</v>

753
00:34:00.001 --> 00:34:03.150
<v Speaker 5>1980,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess when I lived there it was shit.</v>

754
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:03.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

755
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:09.060
<v Speaker 5>it was not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was kids in our class when I </v>

756
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.060
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess I,</v>

757
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.540
<v Speaker 5>like I said I was 13 and there was a kid</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my class that was 17.</v>

758
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:20.010
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not cheating off him during a </v>

759
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:20.010
<v Speaker 4>quiz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

760
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.860
<v Speaker 5>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he was there for the first couple </v>

761
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:22.860
<v Speaker 5>of days and then he left and then he </v>
<v Speaker 5>quit again.</v>

762
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.190
<v Speaker 5>You just never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

763
00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:29.220
<v Speaker 5>Never stuck it out with school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was there for a little while and </v>

764
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:29.220
<v Speaker 5>he bailed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like.</v>

765
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:33.870
<v Speaker 5>And I remember the feeling of sadness </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I remember a girl in my class was </v>

766
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:34.870
<v Speaker 5>kind of a Ho.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was also a little bit older.</v>

767
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.680
<v Speaker 5>She was a super 16 and she's a 13 year </v>
<v Speaker 5>old class,</v>

768
00:34:38.681 --> 00:34:40.390
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she asked the teacher.</v>

769
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.200
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you'll make out with someone and you </v>

770
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.980
<v Speaker 5>breathe out and they breathe it in and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they breathe in,</v>

771
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.850
<v Speaker 5>you breathe it in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you need any more?</v>

772
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:54.620
<v Speaker 4>Get fucking question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a bad question.</v>

773
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.750
<v Speaker 4>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking,</v>

774
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.620
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this bitch get fucked a lot.</v>

775
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:07.670
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired of regular an f only from </v>

776
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.120
<v Speaker 4>people who are fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your uncle exhales and you.</v>

777
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

778
00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 4>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not my uncle.</v>

779
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.090
<v Speaker 4>Hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you in the basement and your uncle is</v>

780
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.460
<v Speaker 4>whispering into your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a</v>

781
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:28.500
<v Speaker 5>crazy question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you could just breathe each of </v>

782
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:28.500
<v Speaker 5>those air back and forth and the science</v>
<v Speaker 5>teacher who is.</v>

783
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.900
<v Speaker 5>She asked a question to how to explain </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you breathe out carbon dioxide.</v>

784
00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.100
<v Speaker 5>Then he was the first guy that really </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of blew my mind.</v>

785
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 5>I had one of those science teachers </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

786
00:35:39.091 --> 00:35:44.091
<v Speaker 5>or any teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when you're really young that </v>

787
00:35:44.091 --> 00:35:46.131
<v Speaker 5>actually make an impression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really wish I could remember this </v>

788
00:35:46.131 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 5>guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was a Vietnam vet and um,</v>

789
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.990
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

790
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.200
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

791
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.220
<v Speaker 5>a very interesting guy because he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>very calm,</v>

792
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.700
<v Speaker 5>but people didn't fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>

793
00:35:55.701 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 5>he had this weird error,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he had a beard,</v>

794
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.690
<v Speaker 5>which I always thought was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is back then people didn't have beards,</v>

795
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.820
<v Speaker 5>hipster beard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

796
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.360
<v Speaker 5>I remember he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you really want to understand how </v>

797
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.541
<v Speaker 5>strange the world is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just go outside and look up and </v>

798
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.880
<v Speaker 5>understand that there's no end to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it goes on forever and just,</v>

799
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:21.890
<v Speaker 5>you want to hurt your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go outside and look up at the sky and </v>

800
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 5>realize that space is infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means there's no end to it.</v>

801
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember the whole class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

802
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.460
<v Speaker 5>2:16</v>
<v Speaker 5>year olds and the rest of us were like,</v>

803
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.040
<v Speaker 5>which is sitting there like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

804
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.710
<v Speaker 5>There's no end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how come nobody ever explained that</v>

805
00:36:34.711 --> 00:36:36.740
<v Speaker 5>to me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never even thought about it before.</v>

806
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.780
<v Speaker 5>I always knew that the universe is big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always new space was big.</v>

807
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 5>But when he said that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

808
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:42.870
<v Speaker 5>end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you start thinking,</v>

809
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:47.871
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then further and further and then </v>

810
00:36:47.871 --> 00:36:47.871
<v Speaker 5>for and there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no wall,</v>

811
00:36:47.871 --> 00:36:48.340
<v Speaker 5>there's no end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

812
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So they can't be an answer because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't come back.</v>

813
00:36:51.861 --> 00:36:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Whatever question you sent out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't come back because it's still going</v>

814
00:36:55.821 --> 00:37:00.821
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when I think about whether or </v>

815
00:37:00.821 --> 00:37:00.821
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not there's a god that's,</v>

816
00:37:00.821 --> 00:37:05.531
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think of the word infinity and I </v>

817
00:37:05.531 --> 00:37:05.531
<v Speaker 1>just think all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can,</v>

818
00:37:05.531 --> 00:37:07.160
<v Speaker 1>if science can ever grapple with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I,</v>

819
00:37:07.161 --> 00:37:09.890
<v Speaker 1>then I'll believe that there's no god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe it was gone?</v>

820
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

821
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you believe?</v>

822
00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.960
<v Speaker 5>Like there's an old dude and a cloud or</v>

823
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing like that.</v>

824
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>

825
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't articulate it that well because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never set out to make anybody agree</v>

826
00:37:21.331 --> 00:37:26.331
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just my own personal part of it is </v>

827
00:37:26.331 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 1>I think I was raised very Irish Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

828
00:37:28.171 --> 00:37:30.570
<v Speaker 1>you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn the 10 commandments.</v>

829
00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

830
00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:40.161
<v Speaker 1>you think about this force in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe that has all the answers and I </v>

831
00:37:40.161 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 1>don't know that like I ever fully let go</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

832
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.310
<v Speaker 1>but it morphed into Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

833
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.450
<v Speaker 1>kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a taoist.</v>

834
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:50.750
<v Speaker 1>There's an energy that flows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with nature and that all energy is </v>

835
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:54.561
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that your goal to achieve </v>

836
00:37:54.561 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment is to just become part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that energy.</v>

837
00:37:55.411 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Speaker 1>To let go and become part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that to me is God,</v>

838
00:37:58.291 --> 00:38:03.291
<v Speaker 1>is that there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something that has created the </v>

839
00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:07.641
<v Speaker 1>initial physical laws of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that those whatever happens within </v>

840
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:13.161
<v Speaker 1>that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there was something that </v>

841
00:38:13.161 --> 00:38:16.400
<v Speaker 1>engineered the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that there are physiological </v>

842
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.680
<v Speaker 1>reactions within an atom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way there are in a universe and</v>

843
00:38:19.681 --> 00:38:24.681
<v Speaker 1>a mat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine galaxies within the </v>

844
00:38:24.681 --> 00:38:27.231
<v Speaker 1>universe all I'll behave the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Proton and electron work in a,</v>

845
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.470
<v Speaker 1>in an atom.</v>

846
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.410
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's fractal.</v>

847
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.660
<v Speaker 5>I think that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're starting to realize.</v>

848
00:38:32.661 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 5>No one will look into subatomic and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>try to understand</v>

849
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.280
<v Speaker 6>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the relationship between atoms in</v>

850
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:43.600
<v Speaker 6>the universe itself and I think as you </v>
<v Speaker 6>go deeper and deeper and deeper,</v>

851
00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:46.300
<v Speaker 6>it starts to resemble the universe more </v>
<v Speaker 6>and more.</v>

852
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 6>The universe is mostly empty space,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

853
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:55.020
<v Speaker 6>Black matter which way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't necessarily totally </v>

854
00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:55.020
<v Speaker 6>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

855
00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.750
<v Speaker 6>Black binder is this weird thing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to figure out to try to.</v>

856
00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:04.110
<v Speaker 6>From the way it's been explained to me </v>
<v Speaker 6>by physicists because I'm an idiot and I</v>

857
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 6>asked them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

858
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>try to explain this to me.</v>

859
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 6>They don't know why these galaxies </v>
<v Speaker 6>behave the way they do.</v>

860
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:17.461
<v Speaker 6>They don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In one of the ways they have formulated </v>

861
00:39:17.461 --> 00:39:19.100
<v Speaker 6>to try to make it make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

862
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:24.210
<v Speaker 6>Is this concept of dark matter?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He and they say with Einstein theory of </v>

863
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.931
<v Speaker 6>relativity that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it is the black matter that has an </v>

864
00:39:28.001 --> 00:39:33.001
<v Speaker 6>effect on the way light bands and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>we gravity acts upon things.</v>

865
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:38.490
<v Speaker 6>Physicists or listen to this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are these fucking monkeys talking </v>

866
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:38.940
<v Speaker 6>about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not even.</v>

867
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 6>We should get high and try to work this </v>
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

868
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.220
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like God.</v>

869
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really,</v>

870
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.610
<v Speaker 6>it really is intense because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

871
00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:48.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I'm,</v>

872
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:53.820
<v Speaker 6>when I am feeling down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do start thinking about the big </v>

873
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.220
<v Speaker 6>question is just to shrink everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fuck down.</v>

874
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:59.790
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if the word God is serving </v>

875
00:39:59.790 --> 00:39:59.790
<v Speaker 6>us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're right,</v>

876
00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:00.970
<v Speaker 6>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a problem.</v>

877
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a loaded,</v>

878
00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:04.270
<v Speaker 6>got a loaded word,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

879
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.660
<v Speaker 6>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's got too much weight behind it.</v>

880
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And also it's got so many meanings that </v>

881
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.410
<v Speaker 6>connect to religious fundamentalism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ideologies that human beings have </v>

882
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:17.560
<v Speaker 6>obviously created,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

883
00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:22.561
<v Speaker 6>women wearing burkas and all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>wacky shit that's connected to these </v>

884
00:40:22.561 --> 00:40:25.120
<v Speaker 6>concepts of religious ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you say the word God,</v>

885
00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.360
<v Speaker 6>you immediately sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have a bridge to these </v>

886
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:30.360
<v Speaker 6>fundamentalist ideas.</v>

887
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're not that good.</v>

888
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's almost like,</v>

889
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.410
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>going back to my Catholicism,</v>

890
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.660
<v Speaker 6>I guess it just became a replacement for</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

891
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.020
<v Speaker 6>that concept,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're right.</v>

892
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:46.021
<v Speaker 6>I think that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of stigma attached to it </v>

893
00:40:46.021 --> 00:40:46.750
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

894
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:51.810
<v Speaker 6>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to get somebody to agree with </v>

895
00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 6>your God is the thing that's always </v>
<v Speaker 6>fascinated me.</v>

896
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:56.821
<v Speaker 6>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why do you need a bunch of people to </v>

897
00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:57.490
<v Speaker 6>convert and kneel next to you and all </v>
<v Speaker 6>have the same beliefs?</v>

898
00:40:57.491 --> 00:41:00.580
<v Speaker 6>Why can't you just have your </v>
<v Speaker 6>understanding and be peaceful with it?</v>

899
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.920
<v Speaker 6>That's how you know that veganism is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>religion.</v>

900
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because they're all trying to get you to</v>

901
00:41:05.261 --> 00:41:06.810
<v Speaker 6>do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're all trying to get,</v>

902
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.910
<v Speaker 6>we're going to save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We want to.</v>

903
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.070
<v Speaker 6>Polar bears are eating their kids saving</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

904
00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:12.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

905
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:15.430
<v Speaker 6>I mean the idea of stopping torture and </v>
<v Speaker 6>stopping,</v>

906
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.810
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a factory,</v>

907
00:41:16.811 --> 00:41:18.310
<v Speaker 6>farming,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these are all good things.</v>

908
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:21.370
<v Speaker 6>The little less harm we can do is all a </v>
<v Speaker 6>good thing,</v>

909
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:24.550
<v Speaker 6>but there's something about that need to</v>
<v Speaker 6>convert people.</v>

910
00:41:24.551 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 6>There's something about that patronizing</v>
<v Speaker 6>attitude they have.</v>

911
00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:33.091
<v Speaker 6>There's something about this </v>
<v Speaker 6>overwhelming desire to incorporate other</v>

912
00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 6>people</v>

913
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 5>into their group that completely smacks </v>
<v Speaker 5>of religion.</v>

914
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.520
<v Speaker 5>Well you</v>

915
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.210
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Bikram Yoga,</v>

916
00:41:39.211 --> 00:41:40.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

917
00:41:40.171 --> 00:41:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Cause I did a couple of classes and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out it was a call harborside.</v>

918
00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:47.250
<v Speaker 1>They started trying to indoctrinate me </v>
<v Speaker 1>into these long term contracts.</v>

919
00:41:47.251 --> 00:41:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I just come and pay you 22,</v>

920
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Speaker 5>500 and take the fucking class?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do I have to agree with you spiritually?</v>

921
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Also while they say crazy shit to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

922
00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.610
<v Speaker 5>this supports your inverse colon and </v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

923
00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.940
<v Speaker 5>can I see some documentation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I ask you some medical studies?</v>

924
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck are you talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about?</v>

925
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:08.771
<v Speaker 5>Like a friend of mine teaches yoga and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually had a conversation with her </v>

926
00:42:08.771 --> 00:42:08.771
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

927
00:42:08.771 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>teachers Baker my irregular.</v>

928
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:14.171
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like maybe some teachers </v>

929
00:42:14.171 --> 00:42:17.171
<v Speaker 5>should probably stop saying these things</v>
<v Speaker 5>about like medical stuff because they </v>

930
00:42:17.171 --> 00:42:19.760
<v Speaker 5>teach you that in Bikram Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they teach you to say that,</v>

931
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 5>but bikram himself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a fucking crook.</v>

932
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.240
<v Speaker 5>He's a crazy con man and a cult leader </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's just got sued for like millions</v>

933
00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.490
<v Speaker 5>of dollars for sexual harassment and </v>
<v Speaker 5>rape.</v>

934
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's like,</v>

935
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 5>it may mean allegedly a piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

936
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:42.521
<v Speaker 5>and he's the leader of this whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and somebody explained to me an extra </v>

937
00:42:42.521 --> 00:42:46.120
<v Speaker 5>instructor explain to me why he teaches </v>
<v Speaker 5>bikram yoga and he's like,</v>

938
00:42:46.371 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the method is very good.</v>

939
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.300
<v Speaker 5>The method of doing it in the hot room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>100,</v>

940
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:54.200
<v Speaker 5>four degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the poses themselves in that order,</v>

941
00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:59.210
<v Speaker 5>the 90 minutes of them are excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes 100 percent believe in the </v>

942
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.951
<v Speaker 5>method of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the method wasn't even created by </v>

943
00:43:02.951 --> 00:43:02.951
<v Speaker 5>beach grove.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

944
00:43:02.951 --> 00:43:03.530
<v Speaker 5>It's created by another guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>thirties.</v>

945
00:43:03.531 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And [inaudible] copywrote it.</v>

946
00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:10.781

<v Speaker 5>we see what happens is people get into </v>

<v Speaker 5>And they started taking yoga.</v>

949
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.830
<v Speaker 5>Then they find out about this beaker guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they go way the fuck.</v>

950
00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.240
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man?</v>

951

963
00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:52.700

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.710
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to work on large motors.</v>

965
00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Only Bentley's on and bentleys or into </v>
<v Speaker 1>bling bling cars.</v>

966
00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

967
00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Could dip shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's amazing because,</v>

969
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoga is,</v>

970
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.210
<v Speaker 1>it can be spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be like I,</v>

971
00:44:09.211 --> 00:44:14.211
<v Speaker 1>I used to go to this place called Yaz </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Venice beach and it was yoga and </v>

972
00:44:14.211 --> 00:44:18.171
<v Speaker 1>spinning together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd get on a spin bike for it was </v>

973
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:21.411
<v Speaker 1>perfect one hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes on a spin bike and then 30 </v>

974
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:24.471
<v Speaker 1>minutes of like power yoga and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked out with like a great cardio </v>

975
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:27.801
<v Speaker 1>workout stretched out and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>utter a word about anything spiritual </v>

976
00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:32.331
<v Speaker 1>because it was sort of like the antidote</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like be chrome where they're trying </v>

977
00:44:32.331 --> 00:44:32.331
<v Speaker 1>suck you into something.</v>

978
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 3>But I miss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I miss that little Vinyasa at the end.</v>

979
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:41.361
<v Speaker 3>I like a little bit of like a meditation</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's led in a really simple way </v>

980
00:44:41.361 --> 00:44:46.040
<v Speaker 3>because it's like you're already in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost sub rem state and then physically</v>

981
00:44:46.111 --> 00:44:48.000
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so much easier to go into that</v>

982
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:49.920
<v Speaker 3>mental you like you've really earned </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

983
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.400
<v Speaker 3>that a meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's 90 minutes to 90 minutes is </v>

984
00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.210
<v Speaker 3>fucking hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

985
00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to do a 90 minute class at 104</v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees restructured now.</v>

986
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.210
<v Speaker 3>But what I find one of the big benefits </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>

987
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.060
<v Speaker 3>not just physical because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive physical benefits.</v>

988
00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:11.061
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my back feels amazing since I've been </v>

989
00:45:11.061 --> 00:45:11.061
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing,</v>

990
00:45:11.061 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like real steady every week since </v>
<v Speaker 3>about August,</v>

991
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.290
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around where it was when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>

992
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.870
<v Speaker 3>You do it once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes twice a week,</v>

993
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.230
<v Speaker 3>but mostly once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to try to do three times a</v>

994
00:45:22.231 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 3>week what I'm going to try to do now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of A.</v>

995
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:30.170
<v Speaker 3>I've dedicated myself to this new diet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I talked about it a lot and one of </v>

996
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:34.611
<v Speaker 3>the things I found out is if you talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about something like on a podcast and </v>

997
00:45:34.611 --> 00:45:34.611
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

998
00:45:34.611 --> 00:45:36.660
<v Speaker 3>for the next 60 days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to have any added sugar.</v>

999
00:45:36.661 --> 00:45:37.800
<v Speaker 3>No grains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no this,</v>

1000
00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:38.580
<v Speaker 3>no that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1001
00:45:38.581 --> 00:45:40.290
<v Speaker 3>you just do it because you've already </v>
<v Speaker 3>said it.</v>

1002
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:45.380
<v Speaker 3>And then other people hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the people that listen to the </v>

1003
00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:45.380
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1004
00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:45.380
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if I can try that too.</v>

1005
00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:50.030
<v Speaker 3>And then I hear about all the benefits </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people are having from the Diet </v>

1006
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.030
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1007
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.850
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if it was just me,</v>

1008
00:45:50.851 --> 00:45:51.420
<v Speaker 3>if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1009
00:45:51.421 --> 00:45:56.421
<v Speaker 3>I'll give this a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I passed by some place with a </v>

1010
00:45:56.421 --> 00:45:56.421
<v Speaker 3>chocolate croissant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1011
00:45:56.421 --> 00:45:56.520
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me that.</v>

1012
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1013
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.230
<v Speaker 3>but I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not doing it.</v>

1014
00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:01.080
<v Speaker 3>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when these other people follow,</v>

1015
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:06.260
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and soon you're going to have a fucking </v>

1016
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:06.260
<v Speaker 3>fleet of Rolls Royces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My coach free,</v>

1017
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 3>no entry fecally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want.</v>

1018
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Youtube cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

1019
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.580
<v Speaker 3>my ideas that I'm going to commit to </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it three days a week because three</v>

1020
00:46:14.581 --> 00:46:16.920
<v Speaker 3>days a week it's fucking hard for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult.</v>

1021
00:46:16.921 --> 00:46:20.610
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to do 60 days of three days</v>
<v Speaker 3>a week to see how that feels.</v>

1022
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.920
<v Speaker 3>But the tough thing is I found when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it,</v>

1023
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:28.250
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had like two spots that night and I </v>

1024
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:30.000
<v Speaker 3>was still not 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a little lightheaded still.</v>

1025
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Well we probably need to rehydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably needed more water and also </v>

1026
00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.360
<v Speaker 3>electrolytes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody telling me got to get a lot of.</v>

1027
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sweat a lot and 100,</v>

1028
00:46:39.361 --> 00:46:42.390
<v Speaker 3>four degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're poor and sweat pouring at the end</v>

1029
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.540
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

1030
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm fucking drenched and I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge,</v>

1031
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 3>like a thermos that I fill with ice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>water before the class.</v>

1032
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The end of it.</v>

1033
00:46:51.031 --> 00:46:52.040
<v Speaker 3>It's empty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:57.210
<v Speaker 3>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that I could drink that much </v>

1035
00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:57.210
<v Speaker 3>water in 90 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1036
00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that it just,</v>

1037
00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 3>I just go right through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so hot in there.</v>

1038
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:04.950
<v Speaker 3>But the benefits for your body or </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely legit,</v>

1039
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.800
<v Speaker 3>like my flexibility is fantastic right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1040
00:47:07.801 --> 00:47:12.801
<v Speaker 3>My back feels amazing and the big one </v>
<v Speaker 3>though is how shit his rolls off your </v>

1041
00:47:14.191 --> 00:47:15.270
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1042
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.440
<v Speaker 3>like things don't bother me the way they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would bother me if I wasn't doing it.</v>

1043
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.860
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1044
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.050
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

1045
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.170
<v Speaker 3>One of the example uses this guy rear </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended my car,</v>

1046
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.780
<v Speaker 3>my Porsche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While you were at a stoplight.</v>

1047
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even worse was a,</v>

1048
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:30.670
<v Speaker 3>there was a construction</v>

1049
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:32.850
<v Speaker 5>on the highway and this guy wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking paying attention.</v>

1050
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.620
<v Speaker 5>He was looking at his phone and he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>from Mexico.</v>

1051
00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 5>No driver's license,</v>
<v Speaker 5>illegal slams on his brakes,</v>

1052
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 5>plows into me with his Honda Civic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just wrecks his car.</v>

1053
00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:47.440
<v Speaker 5>His car was totaled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My car was actually not that bad.</v>

1054
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:52.620
<v Speaker 5>They just had to replace because </v>
<v Speaker 5>Porsche's actually design their cars it </v>

1055
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:56.250
<v Speaker 5>incredibly well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they have this collision bar behind </v>

1056
00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:00.421
<v Speaker 5>the engine that accordions when it gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>hit and he completely protected the </v>

1057
00:48:00.421 --> 00:48:00.421
<v Speaker 5>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

1058
00:48:00.421 --> 00:48:02.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was only like a two week fixed.</v>

1059
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 5>I sent it back to shark works in </v>
<v Speaker 5>northern California.</v>

1060
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:06.430
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they fixed it.</v>

1061
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:08.370
<v Speaker 5>I had it back in two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good as no,</v>

1062
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.590
<v Speaker 1>but no compensation from the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>driver.</v>

1063
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:12.390
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>allegedly,</v>

1064
00:48:12.391 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some insurance,</v>

1065
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:16.610
<v Speaker 5>but most likely no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the thing is,</v>

1066
00:48:16.611 --> 00:48:19.670
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I saw the guy hit his,</v>

1067
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.560
<v Speaker 5>I looked at him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't paying attention.</v>

1068
00:48:21.561 --> 00:48:22.760
<v Speaker 5>I looked at him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look up,</v>

1069
00:48:22.761 --> 00:48:24.750
<v Speaker 5>I saw the look in his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1070
00:48:24.751 --> 00:48:29.751
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you realize like right before he hits </v>

1071
00:48:29.751 --> 00:48:29.751
<v Speaker 5>this fucking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he slammed on his brakes right before he</v>

1072
00:48:29.751 --> 00:48:34.691
<v Speaker 5>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And luckily he wasn't going too fast </v>

1073
00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:34.970
<v Speaker 5>because traffic was going kind of slow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

1074
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:38.600
<v Speaker 5>I got out and I wasn't upset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was weird.</v>

1075
00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:41.680
<v Speaker 5>When I fucking love that car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1076
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:44.030
<v Speaker 5>it is a rare car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's very few of them.</v>

1077
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.120
<v Speaker 5>You can't get them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you buy them,</v>

1078
00:48:47.121 --> 00:48:50.330
<v Speaker 5>they're extremely hard to find and mine </v>
<v Speaker 5>is really rare because it's,</v>

1079
00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:53.430
<v Speaker 5>it was done by shark works with this </v>
<v Speaker 5>company in Northern California,</v>

1080
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:55.280
<v Speaker 5>a tell me about shit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1081
00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:57.890
<v Speaker 5>but I got out and the first thing I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go up to my ego,</v>

1082
00:48:57.891 --> 00:48:58.460
<v Speaker 5>you okay?</v>

1083
00:48:59.000 --> 00:48:59.900
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1084
00:48:59.901 --> 00:49:00.500
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay.</v>

1085
00:49:00.501 --> 00:49:01.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1086
00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.560
<v Speaker 5>Well we were both okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I swear to God,</v>

1087
00:49:03.561 --> 00:49:04.670
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't even upset.</v>

1088
00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.130
<v Speaker 5>I was not upset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like level.</v>

1089
00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:12.220
<v Speaker 5>And it was because I did yoga that day </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I had done it another day that week </v>

1090
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 5>that I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was on my way to the store that was,</v>

1091
00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.890
<v Speaker 5>was worried about was I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>miss my spot because uh,</v>

1092
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:16.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1093
00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:22.980
<v Speaker 5>I usually give myself like I like to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>there like 20 minutes before and I'm </v>

1094
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:22.980
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this might fuck me up,</v>

1095
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:27.490
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I really attribute that to just the,</v>

1096
00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:32.750
<v Speaker 5>there's a balance that you get from </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing something like that where you're,</v>

1097
00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:36.110
<v Speaker 5>you're exerting yourself extremely hard </v>
<v Speaker 5>for 90 minutes.</v>

1098
00:49:36.111 --> 00:49:41.111
<v Speaker 5>It's so fucking difficult and most </v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't know you passed by Yoga </v>

1099
00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:45.490
<v Speaker 5>Studios,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look in there and he got a bunch of </v>

1100
00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:47.111
<v Speaker 5>housewives playing with their feet and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not doing anything but it's </v>

1101
00:49:47.111 --> 00:49:50.620
<v Speaker 5>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a struggle and it's a mental </v>

1102
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:50.620
<v Speaker 5>struggle.</v>

1103
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You break through some walls for sure.</v>

1104
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:55.251
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is is I remember I used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it up in San Francisco and for </v>

1105
00:49:55.621 --> 00:49:56.970
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is 10,</v>

1106
00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.100
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taken up in San Francisco.</v>

1107
00:49:59.101 --> 00:50:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was beef from back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then or it was just hot yoga,</v>

1108
00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.420
<v Speaker 1>but when I tried to leave the studio </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I felt dizzy and nauseous.</v>

1109
00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Every one of the classes like no you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1110
00:50:09.361 --> 00:50:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they really encourage you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to breakthrough to get.</v>

1111
00:50:12.691 --> 00:50:14.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like a team effort to get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1112
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:19.770
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of support in that because</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're by yourself and you've </v>

1113
00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:19.770
<v Speaker 5>experienced that same feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you usually like,</v>

1114
00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:20.680
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop right here.</v>

1115
00:50:20.681 --> 00:50:21.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>relaxed,</v>

1116
00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:23.830
<v Speaker 5>but you can't stop because everything's </v>
<v Speaker 5>timed.</v>

1117
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:29.010
<v Speaker 5>The teachers timing it and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna push you through and </v>

1118
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:32.291
<v Speaker 5>everyone else in the class is doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a 60 year old lady right next to </v>

1119
00:50:32.291 --> 00:50:32.291
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's doing it.</v>

1120
00:50:32.291 --> 00:50:32.470
<v Speaker 5>How come I can't do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1121
00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:37.610
<v Speaker 5>We all experienced the same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you realize that's the thing about yoga </v>

1122
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:41.171
<v Speaker 5>is like maybe one person might be able </v>
<v Speaker 5>to lift a heavier weight than this </v>

1123
00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:41.870
<v Speaker 5>person or they might be able to run </v>
<v Speaker 5>faster,</v>

1124
00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:47.020
<v Speaker 5>but the effort that a 60 year old person</v>
<v Speaker 5>puts in versus a 20 year old person is </v>

1125
00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:52.570
<v Speaker 5>the same because it's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're putting in 100 percent effort to </v>

1126
00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.961
<v Speaker 5>move your body so you might be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>move more or have more flexibility than </v>

1127
00:50:56.661 --> 00:51:01.661
<v Speaker 5>another person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the amount of effort you put in is </v>

1128
00:51:01.661 --> 00:51:01.661
<v Speaker 5>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:51:01.661 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 5>So class is never easy because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>always 100 percent effort,</v>

1130
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:06.320
<v Speaker 5>so it's always fucking difficult.</v>

1131
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my friend explained to me,</v>

1132
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:13.301
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that each pose is working at </v>

1133
00:51:13.301 --> 00:51:16.141
<v Speaker 4>different Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're cleaning out your </v>

1134
00:51:16.141 --> 00:51:16.141
<v Speaker 4>progressing,</v>

1135
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.530
<v Speaker 5>pressing any fucking Oregon's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you want?</v>

1136
00:51:18.531 --> 00:51:22.050
<v Speaker 5>Machine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>annual vice compressing your Oregon.</v>

1137
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.180
<v Speaker 5>You toothpaste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're stretching and holding it.</v>

1138
00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:25.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what you're doing.</v>

1139
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.270
<v Speaker 5>Why you're pushing your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1140
00:51:27.271 --> 00:51:30.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's some sort of benefits </v>
<v Speaker 5>to your Oregon,</v>

1141
00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:35.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's benefits all your </v>

1142
00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:35.740
<v Speaker 5>muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your circulation is pumping,</v>

1143
00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.980
<v Speaker 5>you're sweating like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably a lot of benefits.</v>

1144
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:40.950
<v Speaker 5>How would you describe the smell of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>beak from Yoga Room?</v>

1145
00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:44.500
<v Speaker 5>Like a foot under arm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>butthole,</v>

1146
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:49.670
<v Speaker 5>Vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then a lot of like anti fungal spray</v>

1147
00:51:50.211 --> 00:51:51.960
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of,</v>

1148
00:51:51.961 --> 00:51:52.890
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1149
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:56.580
<v Speaker 5>deodorants and like whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>they are using to clean it.</v>

1150
00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.480
<v Speaker 5>Whatever detergent.</v>

1151
00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to let go into the smell.</v>

1152
00:51:59.431 --> 00:52:03.030
<v Speaker 4>A little bit tail at first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a wall you get through as well.</v>

1153
00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:08.060
<v Speaker 4>The place I go to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do a great job of cleaning the </v>

1154
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:10.371
<v Speaker 4>carpets and vacuuming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but heartbeats frankly shouldn't be a </v>

00:52:10.371 --> 00:52:13.560
<v Speaker 4>Damn hardwood floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's too slippery.</v>

1157
00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Hardwood floors get super slippery and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people follow him.</v>

1158
00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Fucking rip their knees apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took a shower afterwards and uh,</v>

1159
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:22.620
<v Speaker 4>usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1160
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm always self conscious in a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1161
00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:27.780
<v Speaker 4>I've nudity it was just not part of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>upbringing at all.</v>

1162
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:31.010
<v Speaker 4>I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Irish Catholic shame and uh,</v>

1163
00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.840
<v Speaker 4>but my dick was hanging low with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>heat.</v>

00:52:33.841 --> 00:52:37.770
<v Speaker 4>It looked good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My balls were fucking just swing.</v>

1165
00:52:37.771 --> 00:52:38.010
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1166
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.600
<v Speaker 5>is it funny that your Dick especially </v>
<v Speaker 5>your balls literally stretches to get </v>

1167
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.621
<v Speaker 5>the fuck away from your body?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this guy's already eat and let's </v>

<v Speaker 4>Get away from the asshole.</v>

1170

1175
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:08.070
<v Speaker 4>like reluctant to say hide back when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes out of the shower.</v>

1176
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:10.550
<v Speaker 4>He cups his balls and his Dick and no </v>

1269
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:06.220
<v Speaker 6>Lake Sherwood is an area like way out </v>
<v Speaker 6>near like thousand oaks.</v>

1270
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:11.280
<v Speaker 6>Really Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really nice place and it's a giant </v>

1271
00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.250
<v Speaker 6>country club,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a gated community country club.</v>

1272
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:16.260
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we looked at a house there and um,</v>

1273
00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.410
<v Speaker 6>when we're there it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what?</v>

1274
00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.940
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is this place like?</v>

1275
00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.000
<v Speaker 6>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's going on in this place?</v>

1276
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.140
<v Speaker 6>It's all like people who go there and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they play golf because it's like you,</v>

1277
00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.140
<v Speaker 6>you to sign up and be a part of the golf</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

1278
00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:33.040
<v Speaker 6>The golf costs like some insane amount </v>
<v Speaker 6>of money a year.</v>

1279
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:36.490
<v Speaker 6>Like really stupid money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like pull that up,</v>

1280
00:57:36.491 --> 00:57:38.590
<v Speaker 6>find out how much lake shirt and they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>not going to list it.</v>

1281
00:57:38.591 --> 00:57:43.591
<v Speaker 6>A country club,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's like a quarter million </v>

1282
00:57:43.591 --> 00:57:43.591
<v Speaker 6>dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1283
00:57:43.591 --> 00:57:43.660
<v Speaker 6>like something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might be wrong.</v>

1284
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:45.490
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's 50 grand or something like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1285
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 6>but it's something something where you </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1286
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:51.950
<v Speaker 6>what were they just trying to keep out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anybody who's not stupid wealth,</v>

1287
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:53.330
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does it say it?</v>

1288
00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:56.150
<v Speaker 6>Say how much?</v>
<v Speaker 6>One hundred and 85,000</v>

1289
00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:01.320
<v Speaker 6>they list.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought this clubs would keep that on </v>

1290
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:01.320
<v Speaker 6>the download on their website.</v>

1291
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.440
<v Speaker 6>It's the article I found $185,000.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you want to play golf because think </v>

1292
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:08.670
<v Speaker 6>about if you're a billionaire one 85 </v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't mean shit to you except that </v>

1293
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:10.960
<v Speaker 6>people without it can't get in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1294
00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:13.000
<v Speaker 6>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not affecting your bottom line.</v>

1295
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.130
<v Speaker 6>It's just an insurance policy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1296
00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:16.300
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you see these clubs,</v>

1297
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:19.720
<v Speaker 6>like there's a club in Santa Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I forget which one it is,</v>

1298
00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:23.110
<v Speaker 6>but you drive past it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's never anybody on the chorus.</v>

1299
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:25.960
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a miles.</v>

1300
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.700
<v Speaker 6>Think about the real estate in Santa </v>
<v Speaker 6>Monica.</v>

1301
00:58:27.701 --> 00:58:32.410
<v Speaker 6>If you had a 3000 square foot store,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd be paying,</v>

1302
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>$10,000</v>

1303
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:36.760
<v Speaker 6>a month for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now take that store,</v>

1304
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 6>step it into a golf course that square </v>
<v Speaker 6>miles in that same neighborhood.</v>

1305
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.490
<v Speaker 6>What does that possibly work?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's nobody playing on the course</v>

1306
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 6>to insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>

1307
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.140
<v Speaker 6>And the amount of water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

1308
00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:52.720
<v Speaker 6>the sheer amount of water that gets used</v>
<v Speaker 6>by golf courses,</v>

1309
00:58:52.721 --> 00:58:54.160
<v Speaker 6>like they did a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1310
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:59.490
<v Speaker 6>they had a chart that showed all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>water that's being used by residential </v>

1311
00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:04.350
<v Speaker 6>people in houses and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>regular folks versus agriculture and </v>

1312
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.960
<v Speaker 6>agriculture is just staggering how much </v>
<v Speaker 6>water they use.</v>

1313
00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.760
<v Speaker 6>But the really nutty one was millions </v>
<v Speaker 6>and millions of gallons.</v>

1314
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.420
<v Speaker 6>How many millions are being used by golf</v>
<v Speaker 6>courses just in southern California,</v>

1315
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1316
00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:20.140
<v Speaker 6>it's like a significant percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 6>our water usage is golf.</v>

1317
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 6>And</v>

1319
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they write off the land,</v>

1320
00:59:23.421 --> 00:59:28.421
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to pay taxes on it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much as normally because they call it </v>

1321
00:59:28.421 --> 00:59:28.421
<v Speaker 3>you're ready for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

1322
00:59:28.421 --> 00:59:29.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1323
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:34.360
<v Speaker 3>it's considered wildlife walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like every city is supposed to have </v>

1324
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:37.840
<v Speaker 3>zoned out a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>undeveloped land for the environment.</v>

1325
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>golf courses were able to loophole their</v>

1326
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 3>way into that so they don't pay them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a wallet preserve,</v>

1327
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for squirrels.</v>

1328
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Squirrels with click and bumps on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>head from getting hit by golf ball </v>

1329
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.720
<v Speaker 3>scrolls had been marked by a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>blind drive.</v>

1330
00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you're in squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just hit golf ball bigger than your head</v>

1331
01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.830
<v Speaker 3>comes 75 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1332
01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.400
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dawn's,</v>

1333
01:00:07.401 --> 01:00:09.470
<v Speaker 3>you and Darwin didn't teach me about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1334
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:14.471
<v Speaker 3>How do I react to this in nature?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Ryan got hit in the head by a </v>

1335
01:00:14.471 --> 01:00:15.410
<v Speaker 3>long drive and he said he was fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>for six months.</v>

1336
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Really six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had massive headaches,</v>

1337
01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:23.140
<v Speaker 3>so fucking hard ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know too many people that have had </v>

1338
01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:23.990
<v Speaker 3>like significant head problems from </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting hit in the head.</v>

1339
01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.370
<v Speaker 3>Like people always wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1340
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:30.371
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always droning on and on about head </v>

1341
01:00:30.371 --> 01:00:33.101
<v Speaker 3>trauma and MMA and football and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangers of it because I know a lot of </v>

1342
01:00:33.101 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 3>people that one knockout and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked for like a year.</v>

1343
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1344
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:41.480
<v Speaker 3>Constant headaches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constant ringing or year.</v>

1345
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.000
<v Speaker 3>My son just got his first concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I play soccer and he got a.</v>

1346
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:51.430
<v Speaker 3>I think he had need and the head and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>collision and he was out of school for a</v>

1347
01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.680
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't like he'd go to school and </v>

1348
01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:56.680
<v Speaker 3>he'd have his head down on his desk and </v>
<v Speaker 3>first beer and have to come home again.</v>

1349
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.640
<v Speaker 3>It was bad and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>

1350
01:00:58.641 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 3>you don't know when that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A concussion can last a day.</v>

1351
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:03.560
<v Speaker 3>You can last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

1352
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:08.561
<v Speaker 3>it could go on and on with with </v>
<v Speaker 3>headaches and it's really important to </v>

1353
01:01:08.561 --> 01:01:12.340
<v Speaker 3>recognize that because there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of restrictions they put on athletes</v>

1354
01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:15.230
<v Speaker 3>after they'd been kod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for fighters.</v>

1355
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:15.770
<v Speaker 3>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

1356
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:20.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say like no contact for 30 days or 60 </v>

1357
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.870
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them,</v>

1358
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:22.430
<v Speaker 3>but that's not adequate because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really don't know.</v>

1359
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Each individual case of someone getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked out is,</v>

1360
01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.950
<v Speaker 3>is totally different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1361
01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:33.070
<v Speaker 3>One person get knocked out and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine a couple of days later and then </v>

1362
01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:35.570
<v Speaker 3>another person would get knocked down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fucked up for a long time.</v>

1363
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Like I got a tk owed once in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing fight and I was exhausted.</v>

1364
01:01:41.571 --> 01:01:46.571
<v Speaker 3>It was the third fight of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had fought twice that night before </v>

1365
01:01:46.571 --> 01:01:47.600
<v Speaker 3>that flight and part of it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhaustion.</v>

1366
01:01:47.601 --> 01:01:50.420
<v Speaker 3>I did get clipped with a good left hook </v>
<v Speaker 3>though my legs gave out.</v>

1367
01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I went down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never went out,</v>

1368
01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.640
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was weird too because a punch that </v>

1369
01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.521
<v Speaker 3>jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens is it's not even </v>

1370
01:02:00.521 --> 01:02:02.120
<v Speaker 3>necessarily your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the nerve behind,</v>

1371
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 3>like the nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ways it's been explained to me.</v>

1372
01:02:04.461 --> 01:02:09.461
<v Speaker 3>It's your jaw when it moves can slam </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the nerve and when it slams into </v>

1373
01:02:09.951 --> 01:02:12.110
<v Speaker 3>the nerve illich short circuits your </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1374
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your legs give out.</v>

1375
01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.380
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not good for you,</v>

1376
01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:20.381
<v Speaker 3>but my point is I was fine after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was fine that I was fine the next</v>

1377
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:20.580
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1378
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't be a good idea if I had </v>

1379
01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.801
<v Speaker 5>another fight after that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't like a ringing in my ears </v>

1380
01:02:27.801 --> 01:02:31.431
<v Speaker 5>and headaches and those in serious pain,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like that massive horn that makes your </v>

1466
01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:24.570
<v Speaker 1>body go paralyzed for like a second.</v>

1467
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:27.720
<v Speaker 5>Like a,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1472
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.720

<v Speaker 5>But like a Harley,</v>

1473
01:06:39.721 --> 01:06:42.440
<v Speaker 5>like when you buy one from a store </v>
<v Speaker 5>without fucking with it,</v>

1474
01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.100
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that,</v>

1475
01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:49.310
<v Speaker 5>that level of loudness apparently </v>
<v Speaker 5>prevents a lot of accidents because </v>

1476
01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:53.481
<v Speaker 5>people hear it and then they avoid you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because like part of the problem with </v>

1477
01:06:53.481 --> 01:06:56.781
<v Speaker 5>motorcycle accidents,</v>

<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1496
01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:41.360
<v Speaker 1>What holds you back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a little bump of money to justify</v>

1497
01:07:41.361 --> 01:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>it because the college fund isn't there </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

1498
01:07:43.161 --> 01:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I got to get a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a nice little hit,</v>

1499
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.900
<v Speaker 1>go out and buy that Mustang.</v>

1500
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:50.220
<v Speaker 5>She's the new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seen the new ones?</v>

1501
01:07:50.221 --> 01:07:51.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friend Matt Farah,</v>

1502
01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:55.020
<v Speaker 5>like the bank sent me a text.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently the new shelby,</v>

1503
01:07:55.021 --> 01:07:57.390
<v Speaker 5>they have a new shelby gt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>3:50</v>

1504
01:07:57.690 --> 01:08:01.830
<v Speaker 5>and he just sent me a text about it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he said he's,</v>

1505
01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.860
<v Speaker 5>he's emailing everyone who knows it for </v>
<v Speaker 5>just begging them to sell them one </v>

1506
01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.790
<v Speaker 5>because they're hard to get hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>because shelby gt 3:50.</v>

1507
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.070
<v Speaker 5>So they have a pr guy that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>hook them up,</v>

1508
01:08:11.071 --> 01:08:14.610
<v Speaker 5>but he said like literally it is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best car he's ever driven.</v>

1509
01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 5>How is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1510
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.760
<v Speaker 5>Not that expensive though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like less than a lot of cars,</v>

1511
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:22.280
<v Speaker 5>but apparently they're really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get the shelby but you don't need to.</v>

1512
01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:27.300
<v Speaker 5>Shelby like a GT Mustang gt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But one of the cool things about the </v>

1513
01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.761
<v Speaker 5>horsepower wars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like here's what's all that white stuff </v>

1514
01:08:30.761 --> 01:08:31.370
<v Speaker 5>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that just like shininess?</v>

1515
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:35.070
<v Speaker 5>What does that sort of fucked up part of</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the artifact?</v>

1516
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:43.010
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see if you find another one is not on </v>

1517
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.010
<v Speaker 5>your screen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1518
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 5>it's only when they transferred over to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the television.</v>

1519
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.520
<v Speaker 5>How weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how fucking strangers that.</v>

1520
01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:50.680
<v Speaker 5>There's other images I'm sure you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>find.</v>

1521
01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.860
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the car is a monster,</v>

1522
01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.600
<v Speaker 5>but a regular Mustang gt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is a regular one,</v>

1523
01:08:56.601 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 5>like find out how much a regular Mustang</v>
<v Speaker 5>gt is.</v>

1524
01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 5>I think it's only about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it's about 35 grand.</v>

1525
01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.980
<v Speaker 1>It gets more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a regular Mustang just like a </v>

1526
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>baseline Mustang or you can get for </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 32,</v>

1527
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:14.230
<v Speaker 5>really just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not gt 3:50.</v>

1528
01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.240
<v Speaker 5>Jamie g just dt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ford Mustang Gt.</v>

1529
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much of those pitches cost?</v>

1530
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.110
<v Speaker 5>I think like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well the thing what I was saying is like</v>

1531
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.340
<v Speaker 5>for the amount of look at that 32 grand </v>
<v Speaker 5>for a Mustang gt,</v>

1532
01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:33.360
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The amount of power that those things </v>

1533
01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.400
<v Speaker 5>have and how good they run and how good </v>
<v Speaker 5>they drive.</v>

1534
01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:39.670
<v Speaker 5>It's a bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an amazing bargain because they </v>

1535
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:41.840
<v Speaker 5>have more than 400 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those things are fast as fuck.</v>

1536
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:43.670
<v Speaker 5>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four hundred and 30.</v>

1537
01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:44.470
<v Speaker 5>What does it say there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>

1538
01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 5>Don't scroll real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>

1539
01:09:46.341 --> 01:09:49.160
<v Speaker 5>Four 35.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four hundred 35 fucking horsepower.</v>

1540
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:52.070
<v Speaker 5>Four hundred foot pound of Torque for 32</v>
<v Speaker 5>grand.</v>

1541
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:55.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the interior looks good.</v>

1542
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:58.490
<v Speaker 5>They have Ricardo cloth front seats.</v>

1543
01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I think about what it would've cost to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a car with those dimensions.</v>

1544
01:10:01.571 --> 01:10:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Ten years ago they couldn't do it.</v>

1545
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.110
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how about this?</v>

1546
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:09.350
<v Speaker 5>You would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would blow the doors off of Ferrari </v>

1547
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:11.670
<v Speaker 5>of 20 years ago with this car was </v>
<v Speaker 5>$32,000</v>

1548
01:10:11.671 --> 01:10:16.671
<v Speaker 5>car and it sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a wonderful American v eight and </v>

1549
01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:21.490
<v Speaker 5>look great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I would drive that 100 percent </v>

1550
01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:22.470
<v Speaker 5>and it'd be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those were fun to fucking drive,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And for 32 grand,</v>

1553
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:30.860

<v Speaker 5>people will get mad and they go through </v>

<v Speaker 3>I liked the idea behind it,</v>

1594
01:11:59.881 --> 01:12:04.881
<v Speaker 3>but some people say that there's issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>with how you get paid.</v>

1595
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>what were you saying?</v>

1599
01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:18.050
<v Speaker 3>When I found out about most of it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like one percent of the players are </v>

1600
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:19.440
<v Speaker 3>making something like 90 to 95 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the money.</v>

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these fucking Goddamn one percent of </v>

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.550
<v Speaker 3>white guys,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the fucking stats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1610
01:12:42.981 --> 01:12:43.590
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

1611
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:46.490
<v Speaker 3>watch all the training videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1612
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.310
<v Speaker 3>who's trading with WHO and what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1613
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:50.540
<v Speaker 3>this guy has got this new trainer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to help them with.</v>

1614
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.210
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you have any inkling about that last</v>

1615
01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:56.340
<v Speaker 3>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The two big upsets last week.</v>

1616
01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 3>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both of them.</v>

1617
01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.460
<v Speaker 3>We had a failing on both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be upsets.</v>

1618
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:04.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a feeling that holly could get </v>

1619
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:07.101
<v Speaker 3>beat by Meesha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought connor was gonna get beat </v>

1620
01:13:07.101 --> 01:13:07.101
<v Speaker 3>by nate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a feeling.</v>

1621
01:13:07.101 --> 01:13:09.930
<v Speaker 3>I said it to my friends too that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting right behind me.</v>

1622
01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.410
<v Speaker 3>I took my headset off as they were doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the introductions.</v>

1623
01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:14.960
<v Speaker 3>I said this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

1624
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:15.890
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1625
01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:16.940
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1626
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.980
<v Speaker 3>we just saw an upset with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She choked holly out and I knew that </v>

1627
01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Misha was gonna fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real smart in the way she fought,</v>

1628
01:13:24.931 --> 01:13:29.340
<v Speaker 3>was super cautious on the outside and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she made holly come to her,</v>

1629
01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.340
<v Speaker 3>which is not a holly likes to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Ronda fought,</v>

1630
01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:37.341
<v Speaker 3>holly was the perfect fight for holly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Rhonda charged after like a </v>

1631
01:13:37.341 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 3>maniac and holly just sidestepped </v>
<v Speaker 3>blasted her,</v>

1632
01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:41.280
<v Speaker 3>move back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blasted her.</v>

1633
01:13:41.281 --> 01:13:46.281
<v Speaker 3>She just countered her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for a person who's a counter </v>

1634
01:13:46.281 --> 01:13:49.101
<v Speaker 3>striker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that style that Rhonda employed is the </v>

1635
01:13:49.101 --> 01:13:49.710
<v Speaker 3>perfect style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even more perfect for someone like holly</v>

1636
01:13:49.711 --> 01:13:53.520
<v Speaker 3>because Rhonda doesn't kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Rhonda has a short range attack,</v>

1637
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.760
<v Speaker 3>short range attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and on top of that her grappling is </v>

1638
01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:01.080
<v Speaker 3>illimited attack because she only likes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tie up with upper body.</v>

1639
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.630
<v Speaker 3>Like Rhonda doesn't take anybody down by</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting on their legs,</v>

1640
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.580
<v Speaker 3>so I knew that holly fighting Misha </v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

1641
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:09.030
<v Speaker 3>She would have a totally different type </v>
<v Speaker 3>of opponent.</v>

1642
01:14:09.031 --> 01:14:09.460
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1643
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.010
<v Speaker 3>she's not going to charge out or she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1644
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 3>She's</v>

1645
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.520
<v Speaker 6>not reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's not a fucking crazed maniac.</v>

1646
01:14:15.521 --> 01:14:16.900
<v Speaker 6>Like Rhonda wasn't that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rhonda,</v>

1647
01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:19.160
<v Speaker 6>which just started maniacs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just want to smash her face in.</v>

1648
01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't find like that.</v>

1649
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:23.350
<v Speaker 6>And meesha fought like super </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligent,</v>

1650
01:14:23.351 --> 01:14:26.980
<v Speaker 6>very cautious state in the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then once in the second round me got</v>

1651
01:14:26.981 --> 01:14:28.810
<v Speaker 6>her down and just dominated on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ground.</v>

1652
01:14:28.811 --> 01:14:29.410
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1653
01:14:29.411 --> 01:14:32.140
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That my suspicions were correct me,</v>

1654
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:37.141
<v Speaker 6>she can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then holly pulled it off for the </v>

1655
01:14:37.141 --> 01:14:40.740
<v Speaker 6>next couple of rounds and it looked like</v>
<v Speaker 6>holly was going to probably win a </v>

1656
01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:43.411
<v Speaker 6>decision if she won the last round.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then Misha took her down and choked </v>

1657
01:14:43.411 --> 01:14:43.420
<v Speaker 6>her unconscious and that was just </v>
<v Speaker 6>madness.</v>

1658
01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.210
<v Speaker 6>That must've been a payout on picking </v>
<v Speaker 6>the underdogs.</v>

1659
01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:47.950
<v Speaker 6>And those two must have been here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Giant.</v>

1660
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:53.130
<v Speaker 6>I think it was six to one with conor and</v>
<v Speaker 6>nate and I think Misha and holly was </v>

1661
01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:53.620
<v Speaker 6>something like three to one.</v>

1662
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:55.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>know my own might've made that up.</v>

1663
01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.510
<v Speaker 6>I think if you pick them both and bet </v>
<v Speaker 6>100 bucks.</v>

1664
01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.590
<v Speaker 6>You want something like 1500 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

1665
01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.120
<v Speaker 6>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie,</v>

1666
01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:04.210
<v Speaker 6>bet on nate and one 500 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There you go.</v>

1667
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:06.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie was there where I got a picture of</v>

1669
01:15:11.161 --> 01:15:11.161

<v Speaker 6>right after the fight.</v>

1670
01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.050
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1676
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.060
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who was it in the background?</v>

1677
01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.770
<v Speaker 6>Kissing on the kiss cam.</v>

1678
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:36.920
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>ren duck.</v>

1679
01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.540
<v Speaker 8>It was fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now that before they were kissing,</v>

1680
01:15:41.541 --> 01:15:46.541
<v Speaker 8>you were throwing up illuminati signs </v>
<v Speaker 8>and they waited until the fucking camera</v>

1681
01:15:50.771 --> 01:15:55.180
<v Speaker 8>was right on them and they turned and </v>
<v Speaker 8>kissed tongue and everything.</v>

1682
01:15:55.181 --> 01:15:56.740
<v Speaker 8>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>watch this.</v>

1683
01:15:56.741 --> 01:15:57.640
<v Speaker 8>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Here it is.</v>

1684
01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:04.110
<v Speaker 8>If the camera's on him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>see the boundaries grabbed her face,</v>

1685
01:16:05.891 --> 01:16:07.480
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck did we do?</v>

1686
01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.310
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's so bad.</v>

1687
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:17.900
<v Speaker 8>It's like bora doing that cage match </v>
<v Speaker 8>down south that bruno.</v>

1688
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:22.540
<v Speaker 8>Now those guys are animals living there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This throwing up the illuminati science.</v>

1689
01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:32.660
<v Speaker 8>they're probably on mushrooms too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They get on mushrooms all the time when </v>

1690
01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.840
<v Speaker 8>they do the ufc because you could sit </v>
<v Speaker 8>there for a long time.</v>

1691
01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:40.841
<v Speaker 8>Look at that as a thing about that is </v>
<v Speaker 8>you do it in the moment</v>

1692
01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.630
<v Speaker 6>what it is funny and then all you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking about is the two dudes that are</v>

1693
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:48.630
<v Speaker 6>sitting behind you the whole time for </v>
<v Speaker 6>the rest of them,</v>

1694
01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.840
<v Speaker 6>are they going to do that again with the</v>
<v Speaker 6>fact they were sitting in the seats that</v>

1695
01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:54.640
<v Speaker 6>are right behind me so they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 6>even.</v>

1696
01:16:54.641 --> 01:16:56.620
<v Speaker 6>Audience sees that as a production </v>
<v Speaker 6>seats.</v>

1697
01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.870
<v Speaker 6>They're sitting in like the best seats </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

1698
01:16:59.070 --> 01:17:01.400
<v Speaker 6>They're three feet from the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're bright.</v>

1699
01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.720
<v Speaker 6>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like literally,</v>

1700
01:17:02.721 --> 01:17:04.690
<v Speaker 6>they could touch me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They could touch my back.</v>

1701

<v Speaker 6>first place.</v>

1737
01:18:26.811 --> 01:18:29.000
<v Speaker 6>It was perfect before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1738
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:32.960
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why they did it just to </v>
<v Speaker 6>leave a good thing alone.</v>

1739
01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:38.020
<v Speaker 6>I think they thought they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>have a suCcessful restaurant in the </v>

1740
01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:38.020
<v Speaker 6>front.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1741
01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:41.290
<v Speaker 6>for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it didn't pan Out in the restaurant </v>

1742
01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:41.290
<v Speaker 6>didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't.</v>

1743
01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:44.890
<v Speaker 6>Which most restaurants don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They say like 90 percent of all </v>

1744
01:18:44.890 --> 01:18:46.580
<v Speaker 6>restaurants fail in the first year,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they got a bag.</v>

1745
01:18:46.581 --> 01:18:47.300
<v Speaker 6>It's gReat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

1746
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.420
<v Speaker 6>back to its roots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's great.</v>

1747
01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:51.170
<v Speaker 6>Club.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1752
01:18:56.491 --> 01:19:00.470
<v Speaker 6>It's really just sort of did ari when </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when he first started his.</v>

1753
01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:05.740
<v Speaker 6>This is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The show that was on last night on </v>

1754
01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:05.740
<v Speaker 6>comedy central,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is on every week now,</v>

1755
01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.820
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>before already had that television show.</v>

1756
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:12.821
<v Speaker 6>He started that off in the improv lab,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I want to say like six years </v>

1757
01:19:12.821 --> 01:19:12.821
<v Speaker 6>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.210
<v Speaker 6>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his idea was as very smart idea that you</v>

1759
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:22.870
<v Speaker 6>would develop stories better and really </v>
<v Speaker 6>tightened them up if there wasn't </v>

1760
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:26.981
<v Speaker 6>pressure to do like traditional standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like he would do storytelling shows </v>

1761
01:19:26.981 --> 01:19:31.571
<v Speaker 6>and they would do them on a theme like </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys who have been arrested or people </v>

1762
01:19:31.571 --> 01:19:32.330
<v Speaker 6>that have done too many drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

1763
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:37.510
<v Speaker 6>And you would do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he would do a theme on these things and </v>

1764
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:39.440
<v Speaker 6>you go up there and just explore the </v>
<v Speaker 6>story and if you could do that you would</v>

1765
01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:42.070
<v Speaker 6>find the funny stuff in there because </v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1766
01:19:42.370 --> 01:19:43.870
<v Speaker 6>it's a different format.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1767
01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:45.500
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're kind of doing standup.</v>

1768
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:51.250
<v Speaker 6>But then some guys will fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they'd go up there and they would </v>

1769
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:51.250
<v Speaker 6>just set up punch lines,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just jokes.</v>

1770
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:55.930
<v Speaker 6>But theN like diaz does it right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like diaz would tell you these crazy </v>

1771
01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:57.050
<v Speaker 6>stories and they would be funny and find</v>
<v Speaker 6>the funny in them.</v>

1772
01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:02.320
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of those became bits because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he got comfortable and he did too as </v>

1773
01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.890
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get comfortable saying them.</v>

1774
01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:07.190
<v Speaker 6>And the storytelling format and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of edited down and honed,</v>

1775
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 6>sharpened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't</v>

1776
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.020
<v Speaker 4>folded the steel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it may become a,</v>

1777
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 4>a really solid bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1778
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.830
<v Speaker 4>That's where it starts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1779
01:20:13.831 --> 01:20:18.831
<v Speaker 4>I got a new bit about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing a couple of fucking in the hotel </v>

1780

1782
01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:22.260

<v Speaker 4>I won't do the bid.</v>

1783
01:20:22.261 --> 01:20:27.261
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the story has now turned into a bit </v>

1784
01:20:27.261 --> 01:20:28.740
<v Speaker 4>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crushes.</v>

1785
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean it went from you to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you get a new bit and it can </v>

1786
01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:37.491
<v Speaker 4>take three months to become your closing</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit because you're still working out </v>

1787
01:20:37.491 --> 01:20:40.760
<v Speaker 4>this thing raced to closing bit in like </v>
<v Speaker 4>five tellings of it really.</v>

1788
01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:46.160
<v Speaker 4>So I won't do the bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll tell you the story which is </v>

<v Speaker 4>So I'm on the 10th floor and I look </v>

1791
01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.410
<v Speaker 4>across into a room and the curtains are </v>
<v Speaker 4>open,</v>

1792
01:20:52.411 --> 01:20:54.450
<v Speaker 4>lights are on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chick is on her back,</v>

1793

<v Speaker 4>And this dude who's ripped his fucking </v>

1794
01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:02.370
<v Speaker 4>pounding her and I'm just standing there</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at him like,</v>

1795
01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.200
<v Speaker 4>like this is the greatest thing I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever,</v>

1796
01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:06.020
<v Speaker 4>greatest things that ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>

1797
01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:10.410
<v Speaker 4>I slept my bag in my hand and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 4>transfixed and they're,</v>

1798
01:21:10.411 --> 01:21:11.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really fucking.</v>

1799
01:21:11.761 --> 01:21:13.230
<v Speaker 4>And at one point he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1800
01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.600
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1801
01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:18.570
<v Speaker 4>he goes down on one knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eats or out stands up,</v>

1802
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:20.800

<v Speaker 4>like go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>

1804
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:27.120
<v Speaker 4>And so I had the curtain closed because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want them to see me,</v>

1805
01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:33.230
<v Speaker 8>but I popped my head through the curt,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I looked like a photographer from the 19</v>

1806
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.650
<v Speaker 8>thirties.</v>

1807
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:42.570
<v Speaker 4>And then I start thinking about what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>must sound like.</v>

1808
01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:44.480
<v Speaker 4>And this a sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This where it gets creepy,</v>

1809
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:49.870
<v Speaker 4>creepy air is I leave my room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I walked down the hall and I stand </v>

1810
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:54.441
<v Speaker 4>outside the room and I listen and I hear</v>
<v Speaker 4>him grunting and I hear her go to my </v>

1811
01:21:57.641 --> 01:22:00.040
<v Speaker 4>room and I call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I call the room.</v>

1812
01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:02.840
<v Speaker 4>Just watching him waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>waiting.</v>

1813
01:22:02.841 --> 01:22:04.840
<v Speaker 4>And he didn't pick up that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he did,</v>

1814
01:22:04.841 --> 01:22:05.430
<v Speaker 4>I would have been like,</v>

1815
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.620
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1816
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.570
<v Speaker 4>but what's better than some free nudity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you didn't earn it.</v>

1817
01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.480
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have to void.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take anyone out to dinner.</v>

1818
01:22:23.481 --> 01:22:25.610
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have to go to a strip club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>

1819
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:28.340
<v Speaker 4>you just see some nudity in a window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1820
01:22:28.341 --> 01:22:32.390
<v Speaker 4>it's way more exciting for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Accidental nudity is way more exciting.</v>

1821
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:37.930
<v Speaker 4>The voice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this avoider instinct that all of us </v>

1822
01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:37.930

<v Speaker 4>That's why like,</v>

1824
01:22:39.111 --> 01:22:41.750
<v Speaker 4>like those Jennifer Lawrence leaks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex pigs,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's her like spreading her cheeks and </v>

1827
01:22:49.841 --> 01:22:52.670
<v Speaker 4>like Jennifer Lawrence showing her pussy</v>

1861
01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:47.820

<v Speaker 4>pay more money now because that money </v>
<v Speaker 4>has to go back into the system.</v>

<v Speaker 4>comes up in between you and that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as someone starts talking to </v>

<v Speaker 6>There's some people you sit next to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's great,</v>

1893
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:13.780

<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1894
01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:18.900
<v Speaker 6>I was on the fucking plane the other day</v>
<v Speaker 6>headed back from vegas and there was a </v>

1895
01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:21.731
<v Speaker 6>drunk guy that was doing air quotes </v>
<v Speaker 6>business on the phone and he was so </v>

1896
01:26:21.891 --> 01:26:23.240
<v Speaker 6>loud.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tony and I were like,</v>

1897
01:26:23.241 --> 01:26:25.340
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he was like,</v>

1898
01:26:25.570 --> 01:26:30.570
<v Speaker 6>who?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Basically the bottom line is if we get </v>

1899
01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:31.520
<v Speaker 6>this account,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we are set and he's drunk and he's being</v>

1900
01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:36.521
<v Speaker 6>real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think maybe he was doing it to let </v>

1901
01:26:36.521 --> 01:26:37.760
<v Speaker 6>everyone know that he's doing because he</v>
<v Speaker 6>was definitely hammered.</v>

1902
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:43.570
<v Speaker 6>The plane takes off and then within five</v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes of the flight being the air out </v>

1903
01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:45.710
<v Speaker 6>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>snoring just drunk off his ass.</v>

1904
01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.570
<v Speaker 6>Probably stayed up all night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>got a flight,</v>

1905

<v Speaker 6>pig alcohol.</v>

<v Speaker 6>hours earlier.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Panama Panama just rocked out.</v>

1908
01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:07.760
<v Speaker 6>This van halen driving over here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They came on the a sirius xm and eddie </v>

1909
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.780
<v Speaker 6>van halen is one of the greatest guitar </v>
<v Speaker 6>players ever of all time.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1917
01:27:25.881 --> 01:27:30.881
<v Speaker 6>that's what David Lee roth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's big part of why David Lee roth </v>

1918
01:27:30.881 --> 01:27:34.480
<v Speaker 6>jettisoned during the prime days and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then they turned it to sam hagar didn't </v>

1919
01:27:36.021 --> 01:27:38.940
<v Speaker 6>enjoy one of those songs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a different band.</v>

1920
01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:40.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's weird because like I,</v>

1921
01:27:40.591 --> 01:27:45.591
<v Speaker 6>it was still super successful and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 6>even more successful with sammy hagar </v>

1922
01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:49.250
<v Speaker 6>than it was with David Lee roth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but man,</v>

1923
01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.070
<v Speaker 6>it was not the same because different </v>
<v Speaker 6>band entirely.</v>

1924
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:54.110
<v Speaker 6>It was all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was weird.</v>

1925
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:59.350
<v Speaker 6>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like acdc which just smoothly </v>

1926
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.350
<v Speaker 6>transitioned.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1927
01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:04.031
<v Speaker 6>like you can't even tell you go listen </v>
<v Speaker 6>to old acdc and then the new singer acdc</v>

1928
01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:05.960
<v Speaker 6>when that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is old still now,</v>

1929
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:11.350
<v Speaker 6>but it's all ecdc van halen to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>massively different bands,</v>

1930
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:17.890
<v Speaker 6>but just like that poppy bullshitty </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff that became massively,</v>

1931
01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.300
<v Speaker 6>massively successful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1932
01:28:20.301 --> 01:28:23.840
<v Speaker 6>it was like guys trying to be hard </v>
<v Speaker 6>rockers.</v>

1933
01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.160
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was like they were playing a </v>

1934
01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.971
<v Speaker 6>character.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what sammy hagar always seemed </v>

1935
01:28:30.971 --> 01:28:30.971
<v Speaker 6>like to me.</v>

1936

<v Speaker 6>there's a cop on the side of the road,</v>

1937
01:28:35.871 --> 01:28:39.570
<v Speaker 6>you'd like literally have to speed past </v>
<v Speaker 6>the 55.</v>

1938
01:28:39.571 --> 01:28:42.110
<v Speaker 6>It a bullshit speed limit though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why they got rid of it.</v>

1939
01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:46.730
<v Speaker 6>It's really 65 now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean if it says 65,</v>

1940
01:28:46.731 --> 01:28:49.520
<v Speaker 6>you can go 74.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You won't get pulled over.</v>

1941
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:51.740
<v Speaker 6>You might want a porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you will.</v>

<v Speaker 6>in any kind of car though,</v>

1944

<v Speaker 6>they can get you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's the greatest joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets up every morning and just,</v>

2065
01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.750
<v Speaker 3>I think he doesn't like 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>

2066
01:34:37.751 --> 01:34:41.370
<v Speaker 3>Smokes a joint and started talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you the motivation.</v>

2067
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:46.750
<v Speaker 3>Motivational insight from uncle joey </v>
<v Speaker 3>come on in motherfuckers and he gets ah,</v>

2068
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:52.180
<v Speaker 3>like ridiculously high and he's doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>on camera.</v>

2069
01:34:52.181 --> 01:34:54.310
<v Speaker 3>You just keep seeing him hitting it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>spoken.</v>

2070
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:56.920
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where is he?</v>

2071
01:34:56.930 --> 01:35:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he explained his beef with john capullo.</v>

2072
01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:02.120
<v Speaker 3>He had a beef with and keppra all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

2073
01:35:02.121 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 3>Legendary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2074
01:35:05.010 --> 01:35:10.010
<v Speaker 3>play it played out on twitter where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both going back and forth with </v>

2075
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:10.010
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2076
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:12.320
<v Speaker 3>And then it played out at the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>store or joey apparently,</v>

2077
01:35:12.321 --> 01:35:14.840
<v Speaker 3>and him got into some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>altercation recently.</v>

2078
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Physical joey spit in his face I think.</v>

2079
01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Was it a joke thief thing?</v>

2080
01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:22.260
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2081
01:35:23.170 --> 01:35:25.890
<v Speaker 3>You would have to talk to both of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>for to be,</v>

2082
01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.600
<v Speaker 3>for me to be fair for me to give you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real assessment of what happened,</v>

2083
01:35:31.110 --> 01:35:36.110
<v Speaker 3>but essentially it was his job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his contention that john was trying to </v>

2084
01:35:37.641 --> 01:35:42.641
<v Speaker 3>control the lineups and keep certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>people from performing and ale that he </v>

2085
01:35:42.641 --> 01:35:47.471
<v Speaker 3>fucked over the comedians doing so john </v>
<v Speaker 3>copper rule denies this and it says that</v>

2086
01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:53.120
<v Speaker 3>joe is a bully and a prison yard asshole</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of shit.</v>

2087
01:35:53.121 --> 01:35:55.220

<v Speaker 3>I don't want to feed into a beef here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2120
01:37:14.681 --> 01:37:16.210

2121
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:21.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something going on there that's </v>

2122
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.270
<v Speaker 3>something weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of controlling.</v>

01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2124
01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.410
<v Speaker 3>It might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

2125
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:29.860
<v Speaker 3>We could talk off air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could speculate with you off air </v>

2126
01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:33.460
<v Speaker 3>involving all sorts of various things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people might get really excited </v>

2127
01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:37.661
<v Speaker 3>about doing lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of speculation.</v>

2128
01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.460
<v Speaker 3>He said I never had a problem with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never.</v>

2129
01:37:40.461 --> 01:37:42.050
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a problem with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2130
01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Now he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks though that I somehow or </v>

2131
01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:47.160
<v Speaker 3>another I'm involved in this and so his </v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoia is fed into.</v>

2132
01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 3>He thinks that joey diaz is my hitman </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then somehow or another I'm plotting</v>

2133
01:37:51.231 --> 01:37:53.390
<v Speaker 3>against him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't even understand.</v>

2134
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Why wouLd do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why I don't even.</v>

2135
01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

2136
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 5>don't know why I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't get it.</v>

2137
01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:00.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people,</v>

2138
01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:01.680
<v Speaker 5>they tripped themselves.</v>

2139
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:05.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the thing is about the comedy store.</v>

2140
01:38:05.761 --> 01:38:07.600
<v Speaker 4>As much as I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes that,</v>

2141
01:38:07.810 --> 01:38:11.220
<v Speaker 4>that shit gets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets a little school yardi</v>

2142
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:12.740
<v Speaker 5>not as much anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2143
01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:14.190
<v Speaker 5>Tommy's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2144
01:38:14.210 --> 01:38:19.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is also because john was </v>
<v Speaker 5>friends with tommy and that's also part </v>

2145
01:38:19.821 --> 01:38:24.170
<v Speaker 5>of joey's contention is that he pulled </v>
<v Speaker 5>up with tommy to control that place.</v>

2146
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:27.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck.</v>

2147
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.350
<v Speaker 5>I go tell my jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say hi to people like you and hang out</v>

2148
01:38:30.351 --> 01:38:32.030
<v Speaker 5>with my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be involved.</v>

2149
01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:34.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't get to take 20 minutes early.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say what's up?</v>

2150
01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:40.330
<v Speaker 5>All that shit is just a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people out there that </v>

2151
01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:44.620
<v Speaker 5>are living their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just sort of going with the momentum of </v>

2152
01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:48.581
<v Speaker 5>all these things that people have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the gossipy things and get involved </v>

2153
01:38:48.581 --> 01:38:51.530
<v Speaker 5>in controlling this thing about </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

2154
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:54.350
<v Speaker 5>Just think about what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't get distracted and I can.</v>

2155
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:56.330
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of that is a distraction.</v>

2156
01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.500
<v Speaker 5>A lot of the people's fixating on other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people at this fucking guy.</v>

2157
01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:03.440
<v Speaker 5>He's doing this so that fucking guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that and man,</v>

2158
01:39:03.441 --> 01:39:06.170
<v Speaker 5>he fucking why you need something funny </v>
<v Speaker 5>was you getting on before me?</v>

2159
01:39:06.650 --> 01:39:09.860
<v Speaker 5>That is all distractions and it keeps </v>
<v Speaker 5>you from thinking about yourself.</v>

2160
01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:14.980
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people had to spend a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tremendous amount of time hating on </v>

2161
01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:18.011
<v Speaker 5>other people and very little time </v>
<v Speaker 5>working on themselves and it's a fucking</v>

2162
01:39:18.081 --> 01:39:23.081
<v Speaker 5>trap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an easy trap to get into because </v>

2163
01:39:23.081 --> 01:39:23.081
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2164
01:39:23.081 --> 01:39:26.740
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no commitment to hating on </v>

2165
01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:26.740
<v Speaker 5>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't,</v>

2166
01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:27.710
<v Speaker 5>there's no consequences if it doesn't go</v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

2167
01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:30.680
<v Speaker 5>So you put your energy into that and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2168
01:39:30.681 --> 01:39:35.681
<v Speaker 5>almost like you're like hoping they fail</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that it justifies this idea that you </v>

2169
01:39:35.681 --> 01:39:36.890
<v Speaker 5>have in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're not,</v>

2170
01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:37.690
<v Speaker 5>you're not benefiting</v>

2171
01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.610
<v Speaker 4>and it's wasting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can waste a day,</v>

2172
01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:44.700
<v Speaker 4>you can still about something and all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sudden it's the end of the day and </v>

2173
01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:47.971
<v Speaker 4>that was shit that you want it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplish that you didn't do because </v>

2174
01:39:47.971 --> 01:39:51.511
<v Speaker 4>you were obsessed with fucking googling </v>
<v Speaker 4>the person and finding out if it's a </v>

2175
01:39:51.791 --> 01:39:55.180
<v Speaker 4>story that people are latching onto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This whole thing with joey,</v>

2176
01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:57.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's wasted more of his time </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he wanted it to.</v>

2177
01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:02.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he put it on periscope and it's </v>

2178

2184
01:40:16.391 --> 01:40:21.310

<v Speaker 5>I don't love it with everybody though.</v>

2185
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:23.320
<v Speaker 5>With joey.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't know why.</v>

2187
01:40:24.701 --> 01:40:29.701
<v Speaker 5>I love him so much when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he's involved in something I'm </v>

2188
01:40:29.701 --> 01:40:29.860
<v Speaker 5>involved with,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He won't even talk about it now.</v>

2194
01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:40.960
<v Speaker 5>Bring it up now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck.</v>

2196
01:40:42.731 --> 01:40:45.040
<v Speaker 5>Joe rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I murdered them at san jose.</v>

2197
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:54.070

<v Speaker 5>He's hit a whole new level recently to </v>

2200
01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:58.330
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to give up any of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>details of the bit,</v>

2201
01:40:58.331 --> 01:41:00.710
<v Speaker 6>but he's got this bit where it just </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2202
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:05.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm just like the frenzy that he </v>
<v Speaker 6>approaches this bit with on stage.</v>

2203
01:41:05.111 --> 01:41:05.730
<v Speaker 6>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

2204
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:08.470
<v Speaker 6>he's on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like hitting new levels.</v>

2205
01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:09.080
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2206
01:41:09.210 --> 01:41:10.450
<v Speaker 6>I had to follow him at the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2207
01:41:10.451 --> 01:41:14.080
<v Speaker 6>in the main room of the store recently </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he went up and he,</v>

2208
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:17.350
<v Speaker 6>people were doubled over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They couldn't even make noise.</v>

2209
01:41:17.351 --> 01:41:22.351
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was just cruel what he did to this </v>

2210
01:41:22.351 --> 01:41:22.351
<v Speaker 6>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

2211
01:41:22.351 --> 01:41:22.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the,</v>

2212
01:41:22.421 --> 01:41:24.940
<v Speaker 6>in a comedy story,</v>
<v Speaker 6>each act brings up the next act.</v>

2213
01:41:24.941 --> 01:41:28.360
<v Speaker 6>So he introduces me and then I come up </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he shakes my hand and he whispers in</v>

2214
01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:29.920
<v Speaker 6>my ear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry dude.</v>

2215
01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.600
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't follow it right out of the </v>

2216
01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.080
<v Speaker 6>gate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah man,</v>

2217
01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:43.420
<v Speaker 6>he's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:46.740
<v Speaker 6>He murdered in vegas and I was with him </v>
<v Speaker 6>in vegas two weeks ago.</v>

2219
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:51.830
<v Speaker 6>A coffee at or 2000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking de Roy Roy.</v>

2220
01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:57.760
<v Speaker 6>He's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's just a,</v>

2221
01:41:57.810 --> 01:42:02.810
<v Speaker 6>he's hit this level right now where he's</v>
<v Speaker 6>just so free and loose and he's </v>

2222
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:05.670
<v Speaker 6>concentrating on standup so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's really into it,</v>

2223
01:42:05.671 --> 01:42:07.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he's reaping the rewards.</v>

2224
01:42:07.471 --> 01:42:11.580
<v Speaker 6>Like finally people recognizing like he </v>
<v Speaker 6>sells out everywhere now I can advance.</v>

2225
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.050
<v Speaker 6>So finally people are recognizing how </v>
<v Speaker 6>talented he is and how dedicated is.</v>

2226
01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.400
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's really just one of those </v>
<v Speaker 6>examples of focus and attention.</v>

2227
01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:23.580
<v Speaker 6>Equally results,</v>
<v Speaker 6>focusing on something,</v>

2228
01:42:23.581 --> 01:42:26.610
<v Speaker 6>really honing it and really putting your</v>
<v Speaker 6>focus and your attention on something.</v>

2229
01:42:26.611 --> 01:42:31.611
<v Speaker 6>And then seeing the results of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's just really passionate right now </v>

2230
01:42:31.611 --> 01:42:31.611
<v Speaker 6>about stand up.</v>

2231
01:42:31.611 --> 01:42:35.900
<v Speaker 6>He's always been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But right now because he's getting so </v>

2232
01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:38.361
<v Speaker 6>much love and he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's just constantly selling out </v>

2233
01:42:38.361 --> 01:42:39.840
<v Speaker 6>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crushing it.</v>

2234
01:42:40.230 --> 01:42:45.230
<v Speaker 6>So he's like really like feeling </v>
<v Speaker 6>energized or went through the same </v>

2235
01:42:45.230 --> 01:42:47.550
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just put massive focus on,</v>

2236
01:42:47.551 --> 01:42:49.260
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he just one of those guys,</v>

2237
01:42:49.261 --> 01:42:50.220
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2238
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:54.360
<v Speaker 6>he would put writing and performing </v>
<v Speaker 6>ahead of other things.</v>

2239
01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:55.530
<v Speaker 6>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

2240
01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.840
<v Speaker 6>and do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't for the next two months,</v>

2241
01:42:57.841 --> 01:43:00.660
<v Speaker 6>I'm just focusing on standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a.</v>

2242
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:02.940
<v Speaker 6>Well that's the way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2243
01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:05.640
<v Speaker 6>I mean you can always focus more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2244
01:43:05.641 --> 01:43:10.290
<v Speaker 6>And I think for me the balance has </v>
<v Speaker 6>always been focusing so much that I lose</v>

2245
01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:11.850
<v Speaker 6>some passion for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2246
01:43:11.851 --> 01:43:16.851
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like sometimes I take a couple of days </v>

2247
01:43:16.851 --> 01:43:18.801
<v Speaker 6>off and I come back hot juvenate it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like last night was really fucking fun.</v>

2248
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:21.300
<v Speaker 6>We did this benefit.</v>

2249
01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:26.300
<v Speaker 6>Brian cowen had a benefit last night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We did it in the main room and so last </v>

2250
01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:28.980
<v Speaker 6>night was tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I didn't work sunday or monday,</v>

2251
01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:32.820
<v Speaker 6>so taking sunday or monday off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I came in tuesday like fired up.</v>

2252
01:43:32.821 --> 01:43:37.821
<v Speaker 6>But it's nice you get like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think there's this balance of like </v>

2253
01:43:37.821 --> 01:43:40.440
<v Speaker 6>letting it go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>living life and then concentrating again</v>

2254
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:45.470
<v Speaker 6>coming back at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you grow it's like grinding too </v>

2255
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:47.700
<v Speaker 6>much is not good either becAuse then you</v>
<v Speaker 6>lose a little bit of focus.</v>

2256
01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 6>It's like this weird balance to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 6>is also a balance between the</v>

2257
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:57.010
<v Speaker 4>road and in town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I go on the ride just to three </v>

2258
01:43:57.010 --> 01:43:59.240
<v Speaker 4>weeks in a row on the road I came back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took off like you know,</v>

2259
01:43:59.241 --> 01:44:04.241
<v Speaker 4>for four days or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when I went out it was like </v>

2260
01:44:04.241 --> 01:44:08.291
<v Speaker 4>when you had been running with weights </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden you're like doing a </v>

2261
01:44:08.291 --> 01:44:11.020
<v Speaker 4>10 whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 minute spot at the comedy store in </v>

2262
01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 4>front of a hot crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was like just fucking effortless.</v>

2263
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:14.960
<v Speaker 4>it was like you were floating above the </v>
<v Speaker 4>room going like,</v>

2264
01:44:14.961 --> 01:44:15.770
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I'll do,</v>

2265
01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.660
<v Speaker 4>I'll throw this in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll throw like,</v>

2266
01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:20.660
<v Speaker 4>just toying with them having such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>blast.</v>

2267
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:24.080
<v Speaker 3>We know it's also those long sets that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do on the road.</v>

2268
01:44:24.081 --> 01:44:25.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what brings everything together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:30.970
<v Speaker 3>When you do in like a headlining set and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing an hour and 10 and just </v>

2270
01:44:30.970 --> 01:44:34.391
<v Speaker 3>some just sort of sorting it all out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it all together and you get </v>

2271
01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:37.250
<v Speaker 3>loose and you just do it like friday </v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

2272
01:44:37.251 --> 01:44:40.370
<v Speaker 3>two shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saturday two shows and then it gets just</v>

2273
01:44:40.371 --> 01:44:45.371
<v Speaker 3>so smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedy is in a lot of ways like </v>

2274
01:44:45.371 --> 01:44:45.371
<v Speaker 3>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2275
01:44:45.371 --> 01:44:47.060
<v Speaker 3>you definitely shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get in shape for it.</v>

2276
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also like exercise,</v>

2277
01:44:48.711 --> 01:44:50.320
<v Speaker 3>you need recovery right?</v>

2278
01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 4>When we were young we didn't recover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I used to work six,</v>

2279
01:44:54.501 --> 01:44:59.501
<v Speaker 4>seven nights a week every week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>year round and I kind of need that when </v>

2280
01:44:59.501 --> 01:44:59.870
<v Speaker 4>you're starting out.</v>

2281
01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Well we were so we were like colt right </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of there,</v>

2282
01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:05.070
<v Speaker 3>out of the horses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>

2283
01:45:05.071 --> 01:45:10.071
<v Speaker 3>We just didn't know how to walk or get </v>
<v Speaker 3>on stage to get our stage legs.</v>

2284
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:15.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a.</v>

2285
01:45:16.170 --> 01:45:17.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a strange thing,</v>

2286
01:45:17.881 --> 01:45:22.881
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you really think was after all </v>

2287
01:45:22.881 --> 01:45:24.510
<v Speaker 3>these years that you would have it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't really.</v>

2288
01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:26.370
<v Speaker 3>You always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're always geTting better.</v>

2289
01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:28.710
<v Speaker 3>You always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always have to stay on top of it.</v>

2290
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Never a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if music is like that.</v>

2291
01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:35.070
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it must be because musicians are</v>

2292
01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.510
<v Speaker 3>notorious for their practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2293
01:45:38.610 --> 01:45:42.240
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing that I think I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>envy about musicians,</v>

2294
01:45:42.241 --> 01:45:46.140
<v Speaker 3>like they have to be disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to practice.</v>

2295
01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:51.500
<v Speaker 3>they can't practice in front of a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think can't go in front of a crowd </v>

2296
01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.040
<v Speaker 3>with a half ass song and hope it comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>together because the crowds hot.</v>

2297
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2298
01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:59.510
<v Speaker 3>he can't talk to the crowd halfway </v>
<v Speaker 3>through because you didn't finish </v>

2299
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.510
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2300
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2301
01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:02.910
<v Speaker 3>someone said something about ian </v>
<v Speaker 3>edwards,</v>

2302
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:03.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2303
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:04.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ian,</v>

2304
01:46:04.681 --> 01:46:05.460
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

2305
01:46:05.461 --> 01:46:07.680
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's always writing.</v>

2306
01:46:07.681 --> 01:46:08.980
<v Speaker 3>He's always putting stuff together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2307
01:46:08.981 --> 01:46:10.680
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn'T we all be doing that man?</v>

2308
01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2309
01:46:11.881 --> 01:46:12.990
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was like,</v>

2310
01:46:12.991 --> 01:46:13.830
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

2311
01:46:13.831 --> 01:46:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I like to write on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2312
01:46:14.851 --> 01:46:16.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's fucking easier that way.</v>

2313
01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:21.980
<v Speaker 3>You go onstage with a halfass premise </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're forced to kind of put it </v>

2314
01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:21.980
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2316
01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:23.770
<v Speaker 4>It's just fear that keeps you from </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting down and doing it.</v>

2317
01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:29.100
<v Speaker 4>I think people feel like maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not that strong of a writer and there </v>

2318
01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:31.300
<v Speaker 4>they sit down and they're almost afraid </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it won't come together,</v>

2319
01:46:31.301 --> 01:46:33.320
<v Speaker 4>but then when you have the energy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being onstage,</v>

2320
01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:34.300
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

2321
01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:35.830
<v Speaker 4>you can use that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>BuT um,</v>

2322
01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.960
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's slower,</v>

2323
01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:39.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing off stage,</v>

2324
01:46:39.581 --> 01:46:43.240
<v Speaker 4>it takes longer because you're just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're energy is not as high,</v>

2325
01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:48.600
<v Speaker 4>but you can lay down the idea at least </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the structure and then maybe it'll </v>

2326
01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:50.720
<v Speaker 4>get funnier on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't start from scratch.</v>

2327
01:46:51.170 --> 01:46:53.480
<v Speaker 5>Some people can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people do,</v>

2328
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:56.420
<v Speaker 5>buT I think everybody would benefit from</v>
<v Speaker 5>both.</v>

2329
01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:01.600
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody would benefit from ad </v>

2330
01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:01.600
<v Speaker 5>living on stage and everybody would </v>
<v Speaker 5>benefit from writing more.</v>

2331
01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:03.710
<v Speaker 5>That's what I try to tell young comics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2332
01:47:03.711 --> 01:47:05.270
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you force yourself to write.</v>

2333
01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:08.930
<v Speaker 5>Even if you only write an hour a day to </v>
<v Speaker 5>sit down for an hour a day,</v>

2334
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:14.050
<v Speaker 5>just force yourself to go over some </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas and they will blossom and they </v>

2335
01:47:14.050 --> 01:47:16.130
<v Speaker 5>will fucking find a way to make it out </v>
<v Speaker 5>to that stage.</v>

2336
01:47:16.330 --> 01:47:18.550
<v Speaker 4>And they may not right away sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2337
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:24.000
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done this in awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I bought a note book about a month </v>

2338
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:24.000
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started writing long hand again,</v>

2339
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.261
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>read the paper for a little while or </v>

2340
01:47:28.261 --> 01:47:30.211
<v Speaker 4>just muse listened to sets that I did on</v>
<v Speaker 4>stage and maybe I started a little </v>

2341
01:47:30.211 --> 01:47:32.770
<v Speaker 4>tangent and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>write that up and I just fucking fill in</v>

2342
01:47:32.771 --> 01:47:35.800
<v Speaker 4>this notebook and it's not all making it</v>
<v Speaker 4>right into my act,</v>

2343
01:47:35.801 --> 01:47:38.500
<v Speaker 4>but some of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of it goes into the podcast.</v>

2344
01:47:38.501 --> 01:47:41.980
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like just a running journal</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I can draw from.</v>

2345
01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:45.910
<v Speaker 4>But I've had bits that I've started a </v>
<v Speaker 4>year before and pounded it,</v>

2346
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:51.270
<v Speaker 4>believed in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kept trying to try to hit my head </v>

2347
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:53.491
<v Speaker 4>against what doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you pick it up against six </v>

2348
01:47:53.491 --> 01:47:53.500
<v Speaker 4>months ago and it just click.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you found it,</v>

2349
01:47:54.370 --> 01:47:57.160
<v Speaker 4>but it has to sit late in your brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes for it to work.</v>

2350
01:47:57.670 --> 01:48:00.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>SomeTimes a thing can happen in life and</v>

2351
01:48:00.431 --> 01:48:04.000
<v Speaker 5>that thing in life opens up a door like </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you go,</v>

2352
01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:06.150
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could approach it this way.</v>

2353
01:48:06.151 --> 01:48:06.670
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2354
01:48:06.671 --> 01:48:08.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at it the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or oh,</v>

2355
01:48:08.891 --> 01:48:11.710
<v Speaker 5>of course it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2356
01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:16.060
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's the same way with any</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of creative writing.</v>

2357
01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:17.950
<v Speaker 5>Anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you're writing stories,</v>

2358
01:48:17.951 --> 01:48:22.951
<v Speaker 5>you're writing a blog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like sometimes you just have to go </v>

2359
01:48:22.951 --> 01:48:23.260
<v Speaker 5>outside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you write some stuff down,</v>

2360
01:48:23.261 --> 01:48:25.690
<v Speaker 5>then you go outside of it live your life</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then reapproach it.</v>

2361
01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:30.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then like every day my perspective </v>

2362
01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:30.780
<v Speaker 5>shifts at least a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2363
01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:33.270
<v Speaker 5>you have like core values and things you</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe in and things you,</v>

2364
01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.110
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you agree with and don't agree with,</v>

2365
01:48:35.410 --> 01:48:40.410
<v Speaker 5>but every day like some things will </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen in life that make you look at </v>

2366
01:48:40.410 --> 01:48:40.840
<v Speaker 5>things a little bit of a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2367
01:48:40.841 --> 01:48:43.900
<v Speaker 5>especially when it comes to current </v>
<v Speaker 5>events and politics in the world.</v>

2368
01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:45.750
<v Speaker 5>And lIke everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people go,</v>

2369
01:48:45.751 --> 01:48:50.751
<v Speaker 5>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were so wishy washy with some of </v>

2370
01:48:50.751 --> 01:48:50.751
<v Speaker 5>your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>

2371
01:48:50.751 --> 01:48:50.830
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're flexible,</v>

2372
01:48:50.831 --> 01:48:55.831
<v Speaker 5>they're moving around a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when it comes to things that </v>

2373
01:48:55.831 --> 01:48:59.281
<v Speaker 5>are happening in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think sometimes you just gotta </v>

2374
01:48:59.281 --> 01:49:00.700
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like let those things.</v>

2375
01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.840
<v Speaker 5>Like let let your thoughts sort of roll </v>
<v Speaker 5>around without trying to constantly </v>

2376
01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:06.820
<v Speaker 5>define them and then reapproach the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea.</v>

2377
01:49:06.970 --> 01:49:08.290
<v Speaker 5>Then come back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the,</v>

2378
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:13.470
<v Speaker 5>to the original notebook or the original</v>
<v Speaker 5>piece that you wrote and look at it </v>

2379
01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:16.561
<v Speaker 5>again maybe a week later and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well now that I've experienced a couple </v>

2380
01:49:16.561 --> 01:49:17.860
<v Speaker 5>of things in life this week and look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world a little bit.</v>

2381
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:21.400
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that tom seger and </v>
<v Speaker 5>christina palicki do,</v>

2382
01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:23.830
<v Speaker 5>We had a conversation that christina and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I the other day,</v>

2383
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:29.350
<v Speaker 5>she said that they used to do their </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast twice a week and decided to Go </v>

2384
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.350
<v Speaker 5>back to doing it once a week and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2385
01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:30.610
<v Speaker 5>how come?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she goes,</v>

2386
01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:35.880
<v Speaker 5>I think it's good to live to live your </v>
<v Speaker 5>life and then have some shit to talk </v>

2387
01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:37.660
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you do too many of them,</v>

2388
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:42.870
<v Speaker 5>then sometimes you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just talking shit and doesn't </v>

2389
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:43.180
<v Speaker 5>doesn't necessarily mean to you.</v>

2390
01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:48.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially because for them it's about </v>

2391
01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:48.380
<v Speaker 4>their relationship and what's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2392
01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:53.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not bringing in a new guest who </v>

2393
01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:53.120
<v Speaker 6>can bring new ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're talking about their life.</v>

2394
01:49:53.970 --> 01:49:55.060
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they occasionally have guests,</v>

2395
01:49:55.061 --> 01:49:56.140
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for the most part,</v>

2396
01:49:56.141 --> 01:50:01.141
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the way to avoid it is to have </v>

2397
01:50:01.141 --> 01:50:01.141
<v Speaker 6>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2398
01:50:01.141 --> 01:50:04.740
<v Speaker 6>People were selling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you talk to people for three </v>

2399
01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:04.740
<v Speaker 6>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 6>five days a week?</v>

2400
01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:08.570
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're fucking interesting people and </v>

2401
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:08.570
<v Speaker 6>it's not hard just you just have cool </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversations.</v>

2402
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:09.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right now.</v>

2403
01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:12.450
<v Speaker 6>But if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you just do it yourself,</v>

2404

2492
01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:25.070
<v Speaker 6>And that's how you navigate through </v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

2493
01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:27.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2494
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:33.310
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what abOut the scan and trees going </v>

2495
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:35.691
<v Speaker 6>between the trees?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where it's grooves you're going between </v>

2496
01:53:35.691 --> 01:53:38.891
<v Speaker 6>trees and where your skis go are like </v>
<v Speaker 6>deep grooves that your ski has to go </v>

2497
01:53:38.891 --> 01:53:43.781
<v Speaker 6>directly into and if you catch an edge </v>
<v Speaker 6>you flip over like a fucking tree.</v>

2498
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:45.830
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get it,</v>

2499
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:47.330
<v Speaker 6>I get the people like it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like,</v>

2500
01:53:47.331 --> 01:53:52.331
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my friend aubrey is good friends with </v>

2501
01:53:52.331 --> 01:53:53.090
<v Speaker 6>bodie miller.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's the olympic ski guy.</v>

2502
01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.600
<v Speaker 6>Just mangled his fucking leg.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2503
01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:59.570
<v Speaker 6>He just wiped out and crashed into </v>
<v Speaker 6>something and just fucked his leg up.</v>

2504
01:53:59.630 --> 01:54:02.540
<v Speaker 6>Take us 60 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus christ,</v>

2505
01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:06.780
<v Speaker 6>but make even guys are that good still </v>
<v Speaker 6>wipe out fuck themselves out.</v>

2506
01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just seems like there's a lot of fun </v>

2507
01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:11.860
<v Speaker 6>shit that I like to do that.</v>

2508
01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:16.860
<v Speaker 6>Like that's one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't start skiing until late in life </v>

2509
01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:19.480
<v Speaker 6>because I did jujitsu and all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>other things that already are dangerous </v>

2510
01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:19.480
<v Speaker 6>for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

2511
01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:21.470
<v Speaker 6>it's probably like limit the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 6>dangerous shit.</v>

2512
01:54:21.670 --> 01:54:23.470
<v Speaker 6>That's why I wouldn't ride a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

2513
01:54:23.970 --> 01:54:25.580
<v Speaker 6>it's probably back off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2514
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:28.820
<v Speaker 6>I started playing ice hockey again a few</v>
<v Speaker 6>weeks ago.</v>

2515
01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:32.000

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2517

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2519
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:42.490
<v Speaker 6>it's not dangerous because we don't hit </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other and you don't really ever </v>

2520
01:54:42.490 --> 01:54:43.610
<v Speaker 6>fuck up a knee or an ankle and hockey </v>

01:55:07.791 --> 01:55:08.720
<v Speaker 6>19,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

2531
01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:11.600
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bobby or was this legend,</v>

01:55:14.631 --> 01:55:19.631
<v Speaker 6>long retired,</v>

2535
01:55:19.631 --> 01:55:23.261
<v Speaker 6>couldn't even fucking walk and we would </v>
<v Speaker 6>have to help him climb onto the </v>

2536
01:55:23.261 --> 01:55:23.440
<v Speaker 6>versaclimber,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>and down and down with.</v>

2538
01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:32.110
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to help him pick his legs up </v>
<v Speaker 6>because his knees don't bash.</v>

2539
01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:37.140
<v Speaker 6>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't completely lock out and </v>

2540
01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:37.140
<v Speaker 6>they'll completely bend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like this.</v>

2541
01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:38.720
<v Speaker 6>So it's like the one thing he can do in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the gym.</v>

2542
01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:40.250

2547
01:55:55.450 --> 01:55:56.580
<v Speaker 6>he hasn't because he's had just massive </v>
<v Speaker 6>surgeries all through his knees.</v>

2751
02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:20.830
<v Speaker 6>Everybody gets champagne and celebrating</v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

2752
02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:24.870
<v Speaker 6>Like weddings who fucked by champagne on</v>
<v Speaker 6>a normal basis.</v>

2753
02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:26.190
<v Speaker 6>French people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

2754
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:28.320
<v Speaker 6>French people drank it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense.</v>

2755
02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:29.370
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this tasty.</v>

2756
02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:32.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what about americans?</v>

2757
02:04:33.670 --> 02:04:35.710
<v Speaker 6>White assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they drank.</v>

2758
02:04:35.770 --> 02:04:36.810
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're white asshole,</v>

2759
02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:38.300
<v Speaker 6>you drink champagne.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2760
02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:40.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking of one person</v>

2761
02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:41.490
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2762
02:04:41.710 --> 02:04:43.210
<v Speaker 5>say it later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say it later,</v>

2763
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:45.860
<v Speaker 4>although,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2764
02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:49.160
<v Speaker 4>when I used to work as a banquet waiter </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the marriott in boston,</v>

2765
02:04:49.161 --> 02:04:52.160
<v Speaker 4>we used to do these banquets and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they'd come in and they'd,</v>

2766
02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:57.490
<v Speaker 4>they'd order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a dom perignon and I'll tell you </v>

2767
02:04:57.490 --> 02:04:58.430
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man you get.</v>

2768
02:04:58.490 --> 02:05:01.490
<v Speaker 4>It's the best high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If bad champagne gives you a headache.</v>

2769
02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:03.230
<v Speaker 4>It's nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sugary,</v>

2770
02:05:03.630 --> 02:05:08.630
<v Speaker 4>which is usually sparkling wine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not champagne actual to call it </v>

2771
02:05:08.630 --> 02:05:10.520
<v Speaker 4>champagne.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be from this certain region of</v>

2772
02:05:10.521 --> 02:05:15.521
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only place you can get it to put </v>

2773
02:05:15.521 --> 02:05:15.521
<v Speaker 4>champagne on the label.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2774
02:05:15.521 --> 02:05:19.570
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And dom perignon is the best and I'm </v>

2775
02:05:19.570 --> 02:05:19.570
<v Speaker 4>telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2776
02:05:19.570 --> 02:05:20.480
<v Speaker 4>that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you feel so good.</v>

2777
02:05:20.481 --> 02:05:22.790
<v Speaker 4>It tastes so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No hangover,</v>

2778
02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:24.750
<v Speaker 4>hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no hang.</v>

2779
02:05:24.770 --> 02:05:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

2780
02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.410
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not like champagne hangover,</v>

2781
02:05:27.411 --> 02:05:32.411
<v Speaker 4>which is the worst hangover you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there really a difference in </v>

2782
02:05:32.411 --> 02:05:32.411
<v Speaker 4>hangovers?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2783
02:05:32.411 --> 02:05:33.200
<v Speaker 4>What's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sugar,</v>

2784
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:34.160
<v Speaker 4>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>content,</v>

2785
02:05:34.730 --> 02:05:36.950
<v Speaker 4>sugar content.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hangovers are all about sugar.</v>

2786
02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:38.790
<v Speaker 4>Fucking sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2787
02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:42.180
<v Speaker 5>As I explained to me by Carl Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr.</v>

2788
02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:43.860
<v Speaker 5>Carl Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was an addiction specialist,</v>

2789
02:05:43.861 --> 02:05:48.861
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what hangovers really are is your body </v>

2790
02:05:48.861 --> 02:05:51.450
<v Speaker 5>got temporarily addicted to the alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The feeling that you have,</v>

2791
02:05:51.451 --> 02:05:54.150
<v Speaker 5>the headache and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of is dehydration,</v>

2792
02:05:54.151 --> 02:05:59.151
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of is also the compensatory </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanisms that your body puts in place </v>

2793
02:05:59.151 --> 02:06:01.470
<v Speaker 5>to process the alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body literally shifts.</v>

2794
02:06:01.471 --> 02:06:06.471
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of scheduling shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a organizing of of chemicals and </v>

2795
02:06:07.501 --> 02:06:12.501
<v Speaker 5>all the shit that's in your brain and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then once the alcohol is not there </v>

2796
02:06:12.501 --> 02:06:16.131
<v Speaker 5>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not processing alcohol anymore and </v>

2797
02:06:16.131 --> 02:06:18.891
<v Speaker 5>then you have this like and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>compensatory mechanisms flooding their </v>

2798
02:06:19.891 --> 02:06:22.380
<v Speaker 5>way through your system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's also why people say,</v>

2799
02:06:22.381 --> 02:06:27.381
<v Speaker 5>here are the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That bit you like when you have a </v>

2800
02:06:27.381 --> 02:06:27.381
<v Speaker 5>hangover and you have like a bloody mary</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the morning.</v>

2801
02:06:27.381 --> 02:06:32.150
<v Speaker 5>It helps you a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>soothes you over that hump because it's </v>

2802
02:06:32.150 --> 02:06:32.220
<v Speaker 5>poisonous.</v>

2803
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:33.870
<v Speaker 5>Alcohol is poison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's your system.</v>

2804
02:06:33.871 --> 02:06:34.770
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

2805
02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:39.820
<v Speaker 5>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's counterintuitive that like more </v>

2806
02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:42.051
<v Speaker 5>alcohol would help you feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the way Carl Hart explains it is </v>

2807
02:06:42.051 --> 02:06:43.350
<v Speaker 5>that it's your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body recognizes,</v>

2808
02:06:43.351 --> 02:06:48.351
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this shit I have to process and </v>

2809
02:06:48.351 --> 02:06:50.920
<v Speaker 5>let's deal with that so it compensates </v>
<v Speaker 5>for that shit and then that shit's not </v>

2810
02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:51.330
<v Speaker 5>there anymore and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on?</v>

2811
02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:52.680
<v Speaker 5>Where's all the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing?</v>

2812
02:06:52.710 --> 02:06:54.670
<v Speaker 5>We set up to deal with alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2813
02:06:54.671 --> 02:06:59.671
<v Speaker 5>we don't have to deal with it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had him on a couple of times and he's </v>

2814
02:06:59.671 --> 02:06:59.700
<v Speaker 5>a fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating guy,</v>

2815
02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:01.650
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very smart guy.</v>

2816
02:07:01.651 --> 02:07:06.330
<v Speaker 5>And knows so much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about addictions and about,</v>

2817
02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:07.440
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

2818
02:07:07.470 --> 02:07:12.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>various drugs and the reactions to the </v>

2819
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:14.301
<v Speaker 5>body and all the myths that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing how many myths that people </v>

2820
02:07:14.301 --> 02:07:16.880
<v Speaker 5>have about like how hard things are to </v>
<v Speaker 5>kick and when,</v>

2821
02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:18.790
<v Speaker 5>what is instantly addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2822
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:20.180
<v Speaker 4>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did he say?</v>

2823
02:07:20.181 --> 02:07:24.290
<v Speaker 4>Because I hear cigarettes are the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>addictive cigarettes.</v>

2824
02:07:24.291 --> 02:07:25.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2825
02:07:25.641 --> 02:07:27.410
<v Speaker 4>it's cigarettes are more addictive than </v>
<v Speaker 4>heroin.</v>

2826
02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Cigarettes are super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super addictive.</v>

2827
02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:29.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2828
02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:30.610
<v Speaker 5>Super directive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2829
02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:35.640
<v Speaker 5>they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever see that movie with russel </v>

2830
02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:35.640
<v Speaker 5>crowe inside?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man?</v>

2831
02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:36.310
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

2832
02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:38.140
<v Speaker 5>we're about the cigarette industry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about a.</v>

2833
02:07:38.141 --> 02:07:43.141
<v Speaker 5>I'm a scientist that's working with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes to try to make them more </v>

2834
02:07:43.141 --> 02:07:45.760
<v Speaker 5>addictive and that goes out with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is apparently a real story.</v>

2835
02:07:46.230 --> 02:07:48.530
<v Speaker 4>But then they were sued and they lost </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2836
02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:53.820
<v Speaker 4>They know that's what it doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've engineered them and the </v>

2837
02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:53.820
<v Speaker 4>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2838
02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:55.380
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pot though is not,</v>

2839
02:07:55.381 --> 02:07:57.330
<v Speaker 4>they say not physically addictive at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

2840
02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.380
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not physically,</v>

2841
02:07:58.410 --> 02:08:00.470
<v Speaker 4>but it can be emotionally addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything</v>

2842
02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:01.410
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2843
02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:03.780
<v Speaker 5>like a girl could be emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 5>addictive.</v>

2844
02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Should we outlaw girls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2845
02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:10.380
<v Speaker 5>like a Jerking off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can be a mo emotionally and </v>

2846
02:08:10.380 --> 02:08:10.980
<v Speaker 5>psychologically addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of things can be.</v>

2847
02:08:10.981 --> 02:08:15.981
<v Speaker 5>Psychologic foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can be psychologically and physically </v>

2848
02:08:15.981 --> 02:08:17.640
<v Speaker 5>addictive work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one thing that they say about pot is</v>

2849
02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:21.180
<v Speaker 5>in rare individuals it can be physically</v>
<v Speaker 5>addictive,</v>

2850
02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:26.600
<v Speaker 5>but how Much so is it is physically </v>
<v Speaker 5>addictive as sugar because sugar is one </v>

2851
02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:29.010
<v Speaker 5>of the most addictive things that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>consume.</v>

2852
02:08:29.250 --> 02:08:29.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and I had fucking pounding headaches.</v>

2854
02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:34.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2857
02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:40.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm completely sUgar free now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't eat anything with added sugar.</v>

2858

<v Speaker 5>I don't eat it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

2860
02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:49.400
<v Speaker 5>but I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that I found within </v>

2861
02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:52.011
<v Speaker 5>the first few days was this overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 5>desire to eat it and liKe I wanted </v>

2862
02:08:52.471 --> 02:08:53.280
<v Speaker 5>candy.</v>

2863
02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:56.070
<v Speaker 5>I wanted soda.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted something like within the first</v>

2864
02:08:56.071 --> 02:08:57.690
<v Speaker 5>couple of dayS,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like my body was.</v>

2865
02:08:57.900 --> 02:09:01.080
<v Speaker 5>I get headaches and I would think about </v>

<v Speaker 6>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how the fuck do they clean the room</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some people argue as bad because it </v>

3027
02:15:58.220 --> 02:15:58.410
<v Speaker 1>stirs it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will put is in,</v>

3028
02:15:58.830 --> 02:16:00.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in layers embedded in the,</v>

3029
02:16:00.590 --> 02:16:05.100
<v Speaker 1>in the bed of the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they say,</v>

3030
02:16:05.101 --> 02:16:10.101
<v Speaker 1>well if a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a hurricane or tornado or whatever </v>

3031
02:16:10.101 --> 02:16:10.101
<v Speaker 1>comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna.</v>

3032
02:16:10.101 --> 02:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's going to bring it up in a much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive way so it's better to bring </v>

3033
02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>

3034
02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:16.590
<v Speaker 6>So they bring it up from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are they doing when they bring it </v>

3035
02:16:16.590 --> 02:16:16.590
<v Speaker 6>up there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're cleaning it.</v>

3036
02:16:16.590 --> 02:16:16.590
<v Speaker 6>So I guess they,</v>

3037
02:16:16.590 --> 02:16:18.920
<v Speaker 1>they filter it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dump it somewhere.</v>

3186
02:22:26.430 --> 02:22:31.430
<v Speaker 5>It's like most people live in cities and</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people will comment on animals or </v>

3187
02:22:31.430 --> 02:22:33.960
<v Speaker 5>animal rights activists and an animal </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights advocates.</v>

3188
02:22:33.961 --> 02:22:38.961
<v Speaker 5>These people have these ideas about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful nature that we live around </v>

3189
02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:44.060
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3190
02:22:44.060 --> 02:22:44.060
<v Speaker 5>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really.</v>

3191
02:22:44.060 --> 02:22:45.260
<v Speaker 5>It becomes a different thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize like,</v>

3192
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:46.710
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like constant conflict going on in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

3194
02:22:50.850 --> 02:22:53.250
<v Speaker 5>There's very little harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3195
02:22:53.251 --> 02:22:55.950
<v Speaker 5>the harmony exist with beings eating </v>
<v Speaker 5>beans.</v>

3196
02:22:56.010 --> 02:22:58.710
<v Speaker 5>That's when the harmony exists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all things.</v>

3197
02:22:58.711 --> 02:23:01.170
<v Speaker 5>Eating things and things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Looking out for things that are about to</v>

3198
02:23:01.171 --> 02:23:03.570
<v Speaker 5>eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a reason why dear perk up</v>

3199
02:23:03.571 --> 02:23:08.571
<v Speaker 5>and they move their ears and their head </v>
<v Speaker 5>side to side because somethIng's common </v>

3200
02:23:08.571 --> 02:23:12.680
<v Speaker 5>always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always something common and </v>

3201
02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:12.680
<v Speaker 5>that's why they run so fast to try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get away from something.</v>

3202
02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:12.690
<v Speaker 5>Eating them.</v>

3203
02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:16.410
<v Speaker 5>They're not chasing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Deer run fast because they don't want to</v>

3204
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:18.660
<v Speaker 5>get eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is fucked.</v>

<v Speaker 5>inside of him and he sought move a </v>

3210
02:23:31.641 --> 02:23:34.500
<v Speaker 5>little bit down his body and then a and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody got close to them because they</v>

3211
02:23:34.501 --> 02:23:37.110
<v Speaker 5>figured just ate right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he was less.</v>

3212
02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:38.790
<v Speaker 5>It was a little more lethargic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3213
02:23:38.791 --> 02:23:41.180
<v Speaker 5>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I crawled off as bad.</v>

3214
02:23:41.181 --> 02:23:44.280
<v Speaker 5>I'd never seen a rattlesnake before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nevermind a fuckIng eating a squirrel.</v>

3215
02:23:44.370 --> 02:23:48.930
<v Speaker 5>I was running the hills with my dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ran over what I thought was a log,</v>

3216
02:23:49.170 --> 02:23:51.330
<v Speaker 5>like a stick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a large stick.</v>

3217
02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:55.470
<v Speaker 5>And as I was in the air over it or </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize it was a rattlesnake the size of</v>

3218
02:23:55.471 --> 02:23:57.300
<v Speaker 5>my forearm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no shit.</v>

3219
02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:59.820
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck.</v>

3220
02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:05.480
<v Speaker 5>And I had to keep my dogs back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once I realized that it was a </v>

3221
02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:07.260
<v Speaker 5>rattlesnake because my dogs have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>bitten several times,</v>

3222
02:24:07.710 --> 02:24:08.560
<v Speaker 5>die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rattlesnakes.</v>

3223
02:24:08.900 --> 02:24:10.620
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my doc frank,</v>

3224
02:24:10.621 --> 02:24:13.290
<v Speaker 5>he got bitten twice and my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lucy,</v>

3225
02:24:13.291 --> 02:24:17.220
<v Speaker 5>she got bitten once and their face </v>
<v Speaker 5>swells up and it's,</v>

3226
02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:18.930
<v Speaker 5>it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's bad.</v>

3227
02:24:18.931 --> 02:24:23.931
<v Speaker 5>But they'll go and attack the rattle </v>
<v Speaker 5>snake even though they know they'll get </v>

3228
02:24:23.931 --> 02:24:23.931
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3229
02:24:23.931 --> 02:24:24.570
<v Speaker 5>they'll bark and they get near it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they bark,</v>

3230
02:24:24.571 --> 02:24:25.320
<v Speaker 5>bark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bark,</v>

3231
02:24:25.350 --> 02:24:30.350
<v Speaker 5>bark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the snakes bite them in the </v>

3232
02:24:30.350 --> 02:24:30.350
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3233
02:24:30.350 --> 02:24:30.350
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know what it is.</v>

3234
02:24:30.350 --> 02:24:34.701
<v Speaker 5>They just know it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>like something in their doggy brain is </v>

3235
02:24:34.701 --> 02:24:34.701
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this ain't cool.</v>

3236
02:24:34.701 --> 02:24:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck is this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they bark at it.</v>

3237
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:42.230
<v Speaker 5>Whereas they don't bark at squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they see a squirrel that chase after </v>

3238
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.230
<v Speaker 5>it and try to kill it.</v>

3239
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:43.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if they see a rattlesnake,</v>

3240
02:24:43.230 --> 02:24:45.690
<v Speaker 5>they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get close and I don't know,</v>

3241
02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:48.090
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't there when it actually went </v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

3242
02:24:48.270 --> 02:24:50.160
<v Speaker 5>I was there in the aftermath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw the snake,</v>

3243
02:24:50.161 --> 02:24:52.020
<v Speaker 5>I pulled him away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I looked at him,</v>

3244
02:24:52.021 --> 02:24:53.820
<v Speaker 5>I looked at his face and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going on?</v>

3245
02:24:53.821 --> 02:24:54.900
<v Speaker 5>I saw a little holes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3246
02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:56.010
<v Speaker 5>goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got bit.</v>

3247
02:24:56.450 --> 02:24:59.910
<v Speaker 5>So I had to take him in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one time I took him to the guide.</v>

3248
02:24:59.911 --> 02:25:01.750
<v Speaker 5>If you hadn't taken them in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3249
02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:04.080
<v Speaker 5>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably eventually.</v>

3250
02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:05.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes awhile.</v>

3251
02:25:05.250 --> 02:25:10.250
<v Speaker 5>But they swell up like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the side of their face becomes a </v>

3252
02:25:10.250 --> 02:25:12.900
<v Speaker 5>cartoonish where they got stung.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially a young rattlesnake.</v>

3253
02:25:12.930 --> 02:25:17.930
<v Speaker 5>Young rattlesnakes are the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous because they don't know any </v>

3254
02:25:17.930 --> 02:25:20.211
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They empty out all their venom in one </v>

3255
02:25:20.211 --> 02:25:22.041
<v Speaker 5>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The old rattlesnakes just give you a </v>

3256
02:25:22.041 --> 02:25:22.041
<v Speaker 5>little taste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like take that motherfucker,</v>

3257
02:25:22.050 --> 02:25:23.550
<v Speaker 5>but they keep some for the kids.</v>

3258
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:26.020
<v Speaker 5>Have that bite you again or buy </v>
<v Speaker 5>something else an hour later.</v>

3259
02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:31.640
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one time frank got bit and I looked </v>

3260
02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:31.690
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3261
02:25:31.870 --> 02:25:33.040
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3262
02:25:33.130 --> 02:25:33.890
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3263
02:25:34.140 --> 02:25:36.760
<v Speaker 5>I killed a rattlesnake and then I looked</v>
<v Speaker 5>at him.</v>

3264
02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:38.950
<v Speaker 5>I go kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3265
02:25:39.010 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 5>I think I used to rake forget what to </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed it with.</v>

3266
02:25:43.210 --> 02:25:45.710
<v Speaker 5>I just killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3267
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:50.880
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then I looked at frank and people are </v>

3268
02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:50.880
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would you do that?</v>

3269
02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:51.760
<v Speaker 5>Because it's in my yard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

3270
02:25:51.761 --> 02:25:54.640
<v Speaker 5>See that fence you get inside that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dead.</v>

3271
02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:57.190
<v Speaker 5>If you can kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dead.</v>

3272

<v Speaker 5>my yard.</v>

3274
02:26:01.981 --> 02:26:04.060
<v Speaker 5>And you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dead.</v>

3275
02:26:04.061 --> 02:26:07.300
<v Speaker 5>CoyoTes dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I'm practicing archery in my yard and</v>

3276
02:26:07.301 --> 02:26:08.710
<v Speaker 5>I see a coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

3277
02:26:08.711 --> 02:26:11.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm shooting that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe rogan was killed up,</v>

3278
02:26:11.070 --> 02:26:14.030
<v Speaker 5>sat in my apartment for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3279
02:26:14.031 --> 02:26:18.370
<v Speaker 5>I did with a tennis racket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3280
02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:24.190
<v Speaker 5>Without even thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then sat down and watched tv.</v>

3281
02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:26.350
<v Speaker 5>Five seconds later I ran after that </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

3282
02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:27.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3283
02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:31.360
<v Speaker 5>It's disturbing to switch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then what happened with frank?</v>

3284
02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:31.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

3285
02:26:32.050 --> 02:26:35.640
<v Speaker 5>so I brought him to the vet and the vet </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks at him and this is like,</v>

3286
02:26:35.641 --> 02:26:38.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after like the first time frank and lucy</v>

3287
02:26:38.111 --> 02:26:42.190
<v Speaker 5>both got bit and then this is like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe a year later,</v>

3288
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:47.790
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't sure if he got bit because I </v>

3289
02:26:47.790 --> 02:26:49.681
<v Speaker 5>saw the rattlesnake and I saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I killed a rattlesnake and then I'm </v>

3290
02:26:49.681 --> 02:26:49.681
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come here buddy,</v>

3291
02:26:49.681 --> 02:26:52.981
<v Speaker 5>let me check your face out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm looking at him and I don't see </v>

3292
02:26:52.981 --> 02:26:52.981
<v Speaker 5>any marks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3293
02:26:52.981 --> 02:26:52.981
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you seem all right,</v>

3294
02:26:52.981 --> 02:26:54.520
<v Speaker 5>but fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3295
02:26:54.610 --> 02:26:55.300
<v Speaker 5>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's go.</v>

3296
02:26:55.450 --> 02:26:57.650
<v Speaker 5>And I'd take him in the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>truck and I drag 'em,</v>

3297
02:26:57.900 --> 02:27:00.100
<v Speaker 5>take them down to the vet and the vet </v>
<v Speaker 5>checks them out and he goes,</v>

3298
02:27:00.130 --> 02:27:02.560
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't see any swelling.</v>

3299
02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:04.330
<v Speaker 5>Everything seems fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3300
02:27:04.331 --> 02:27:05.590
<v Speaker 5>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I'd take them back home.</v>

3301
02:27:05.591 --> 02:27:08.380
<v Speaker 5>This face started swelling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>delayed reaction.</v>

3302
02:27:08.381 --> 02:27:11.890
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe he got like a small dose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it wasn't a lot,</v>

3303
02:27:11.891 --> 02:27:16.891
<v Speaker 5>but within an hour he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to tell because it's </v>

3304
02:27:16.891 --> 02:27:17.460
<v Speaker 5>adrenaline is so fired up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3305
02:27:17.470 --> 02:27:22.470
<v Speaker 5>His tongue was as a and he was like so </v>
<v Speaker 5>excited to get to get in the car and go </v>

3306
02:27:23.381 --> 02:27:24.330
<v Speaker 5>drive around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3307
02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.760
<v Speaker 5>He seemed normal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then an hour or so later after I got</v>

3308
02:27:27.761 --> 02:27:32.761
<v Speaker 5>him home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his face started swelling so I had to </v>

3309
02:27:32.761 --> 02:27:32.761
<v Speaker 5>bring them back in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to give him the antivenom.</v>

3310
02:27:32.761 --> 02:27:35.380
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's thousands of dollars.</v>

3311
02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.950
<v Speaker 5>So if you're shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's no joke.</v>

3312
02:27:37.951 --> 02:27:39.880
<v Speaker 5>So if you're broke and your dog gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit,</v>

3313
02:27:39.881 --> 02:27:42.580
<v Speaker 5>it's a fucker man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You suck it out yourself.</v>

3314
02:27:43.810 --> 02:27:46.030
<v Speaker 5>That's a myth too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only Way you could suck it out as if</v>

3315
02:27:46.031 --> 02:27:47.860
<v Speaker 5>you get it right when it's happened.</v>

3316
02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:50.110
<v Speaker 5>like right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if it bites you right there,</v>

3317
02:27:50.290 --> 02:27:52.660
<v Speaker 5>you'd make a tourniquet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You goT to cut yourself too.</v>

3318
02:27:52.661 --> 02:27:54.190
<v Speaker 5>You gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't be shy about it.</v>

3319
02:27:54.330 --> 02:27:59.330
<v Speaker 5>You got to cut into with that area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with that fucking snake is squeeze it </v>

3320
02:27:59.330 --> 02:28:01.300
<v Speaker 5>and suck it out and you're probably not </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get it all.</v>

3321
02:28:01.370 --> 02:28:06.370
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you ever seen what happens to a </v>

3322
02:28:06.370 --> 02:28:06.370
<v Speaker 5>person when they get bit by a </v>
<v Speaker 5>rattlesnake,</v>

3323

02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:45.680
<v Speaker 6>very old when this happened and just put</v>
<v Speaker 6>mesh over it.</v>

3351
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:50.830
<v Speaker 6>Well that mesh is so that his skin a </v>
<v Speaker 6>grows in place and then they take the </v>

3352
02:29:51.890 --> 02:29:55.040
<v Speaker 6>graft and they try to put it over that.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's rough,</v>

<v Speaker 6>with um,</v>

3391
02:31:37.890 --> 02:31:38.520
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3392
02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:43.760
<v Speaker 6>they teamed dogs like baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually tame dogs and they taught these</v>

3393
02:31:44.551 --> 02:31:47.030
<v Speaker 6>dogs had to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>watch dogs get.</v>

<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3395
02:31:47.421 --> 02:31:52.020
<v Speaker 6>they took these dogs in and fed them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like in they had these tribes of baboons</v>

3396
02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:55.450
<v Speaker 6>and they had figured out that this up as</v>
<v Speaker 6>an experiment or just had another dog.</v>

3397
02:31:55.470 --> 02:31:58.920
<v Speaker 6>The baboons did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The baboons have these dogs and fed them</v>

3398
02:31:59.220 --> 02:32:00.930
<v Speaker 6>and then the dogs like stayed around </v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

3399
02:32:00.931 --> 02:32:05.931
<v Speaker 6>And when anything would come near,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the dogs would bark and the baboons </v>

3400
02:32:05.931 --> 02:32:05.931
<v Speaker 6>would come out and no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3401
02:32:05.970 --> 02:32:08.310
<v Speaker 6>they're smart as fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

3402
02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:10.830
<v Speaker 6>They're creepy and their world is harsh </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

3403
02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:13.620
<v Speaker 6>so their actions don't seem like </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligent actions,</v>

3404
02:32:13.621 --> 02:32:15.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't have community and it's,</v>

3405
02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:17.030
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not like a,</v>

3406
02:32:17.410 --> 02:32:21.000
<v Speaker 6>they have an a language and you rapid </v>
<v Speaker 6>use of tools or anything like that.</v>

3407
02:32:21.001 --> 02:32:24.510
<v Speaker 6>But they're very intelligent and some </v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of a weird way.</v>

3408
02:32:24.511 --> 02:32:29.511
<v Speaker 6>They figure if they figure out problems </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then we stick them in steel cages </v>

3409
02:32:29.511 --> 02:32:29.520
<v Speaker 6>for life.</v>

3410
02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:31.890
<v Speaker 6>There was an article that a tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 6>today,</v>

3411
02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:37.160
<v Speaker 6>see if he could see that they believe </v>
<v Speaker 6>that chimpanzees and monkeys have just </v>

3412
02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:39.930
<v Speaker 6>started using stone tools over the last </v>
<v Speaker 6>40,000</v>

3413
02:32:39.931 --> 02:32:43.290
<v Speaker 6>years and that chimps are entering the </v>
<v Speaker 6>age,</v>

3414
02:32:43.330 --> 02:32:46.440
<v Speaker 6>the stone age.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there they are evolving.</v>

3415
02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:49.680
<v Speaker 6>Chimps and monkeys have entered the </v>
<v Speaker 6>stone age in the wild.</v>

3416
02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:50.820
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In the wild.</v>

3417
02:32:50.970 --> 02:32:55.970
<v Speaker 6>They're actually evolving and that this </v>
<v Speaker 6>could eventually lead to chimps becoming</v>

3418
02:32:56.851 --> 02:32:59.190
<v Speaker 6>something very different than what they </v>
<v Speaker 6>are now.</v>

3419
02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:00.870
<v Speaker 6>That what we're seeing now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3420
02:33:00.871 --> 02:33:03.690
<v Speaker 6>a million years from now,</v>

3421
02:33:04.050 --> 02:33:06.270
<v Speaker 6>They could become neanderthals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It can become us.</v>

3422
02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:09.360
<v Speaker 6>We've only been us for a couple of </v>

02:33:49.831 --> 02:33:51.190
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he and homo sapiens,</v>

3439
02:33:51.191 --> 02:33:56.191
<v Speaker 6>which is what came after neanderthal </v>
<v Speaker 6>people think there was like a timeline </v>

3440
02:33:56.191 --> 02:33:56.770
<v Speaker 6>because when you look at timelines,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it lists one,</v>

3441
02:33:56.920 --> 02:33:59.800
<v Speaker 6>then there's a line segment and then the</v>
<v Speaker 6>next one starts.</v>

3442
02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:05.100
<v Speaker 6>But there was a time when they were both</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the earth at the same time and they </v>

3443
02:34:05.100 --> 02:34:06.550
<v Speaker 6>were fighting and neanderthal was </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking way bigger.</v>

3444
02:34:06.551 --> 02:34:09.370
<v Speaker 6>a more powerful way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stronger and bigger brains and big.</v>

3445
02:34:09.410 --> 02:34:10.690
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which is weird.</v>

3446
02:34:10.750 --> 02:34:12.220
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't even know why.</v>

3447
02:34:12.221 --> 02:34:17.221
<v Speaker 6>They don't know if the brain was bigger </v>
<v Speaker 6>to control the body because they don't </v>

3448
02:34:17.221 --> 02:34:18.700
<v Speaker 6>have one to study all the speculation of</v>
<v Speaker 6>how smart they were.</v>

3449
02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:20.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it was a battle in the,</v>

3450
02:34:20.891 --> 02:34:25.891
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the sapiens one because they had </v>

3451
02:34:25.891 --> 02:34:26.560
<v Speaker 6>techniques for hunter working as a group</v>
<v Speaker 6>and surrounding the other ones.</v>

3452
02:34:26.561 --> 02:34:28.140
<v Speaker 6>And they use tools.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3453
02:34:28.220 --> 02:34:30.040
<v Speaker 6>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it was rocks or whatever</v>

3454
02:34:30.041 --> 02:34:33.190
<v Speaker 6>it is that they use,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that the neanderthals were not using.</v>

3455
02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:36.640
<v Speaker 6>I think it's they just divided them and </v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck them all.</v>

3456
02:34:36.810 --> 02:34:37.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And became,</v>

3457
02:34:38.050 --> 02:34:40.210
<v Speaker 6>They became us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How did they don't know?</v>

3458
02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:42.430
<v Speaker 6>That's my fear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My,</v>

3459
02:34:42.610 --> 02:34:45.280
<v Speaker 6>they were on top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't wonder man.</v>

3460
02:34:45.281 --> 02:34:48.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean they know that there was some </v>
<v Speaker 6>interbreeding yeah.</v>

3461
02:34:48.310 --> 02:34:53.310
<v Speaker 6>or at least they believed or some </v>
<v Speaker 6>interbreeding and they recently found </v>

3462
02:34:53.310 --> 02:34:57.150
<v Speaker 6>some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a bone of an ancient neanderthal that </v>

3463
02:34:57.150 --> 02:34:59.260
<v Speaker 6>had human dna in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so they're like,</v>

3464
02:34:59.261 --> 02:35:00.190
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

3465
02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:02.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See if you find that,</v>

3466
02:35:02.321 --> 02:35:03.850
<v Speaker 6>because I think I tweeted that recently </v>
<v Speaker 6>too,</v>

3467
02:35:03.851 --> 02:35:05.970
<v Speaker 6>but just might,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might not be human.</v>

3468
02:35:05.971 --> 02:35:07.170
<v Speaker 6>You mean sapient?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3469
02:35:07.230 --> 02:35:12.230
<v Speaker 6>Homeless in dma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean because I guess neanderthal or </v>

3470
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.940
<v Speaker 6>human type of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that what they are?</v>

3471
02:35:13.330 --> 02:35:14.380
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3472
02:35:14.381 --> 02:35:16.620
<v Speaker 6>I guess there's homo erectus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>homo,</v>

3473
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:19.060
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then homosapien is what's considered</v>

3474
02:35:19.061 --> 02:35:21.190
<v Speaker 6>modern man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3475
02:35:21.191 --> 02:35:26.191
<v Speaker 6>they don't necessarily hear it is humans</v>
<v Speaker 6>made with neanderthals much earlier and </v>

3476
02:35:26.191 --> 02:35:28.510
<v Speaker 6>more frequently than thought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is really recently.</v>

3482
02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:46.960
