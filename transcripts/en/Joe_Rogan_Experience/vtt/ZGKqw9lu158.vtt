00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.540
The Joe Rogan Experience.
Cast.
By.

2
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.970
<v 1>Trevor Moore ladies and gentlemen Trevor walked in.</v>

3
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.340
The first thing you said is I have one of these electronic cigarettes.

4
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.960
Do you mind if I take a hit off of it and just synchronicity it was just when

5
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.520
Jamie put together this thing.

6
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.410
<v 2>This dude sent me that.</v>

7
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.370
You could kind of lift weights with you didn't think you could fucking kill

8
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:35.510
somebody with this for sure.

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.620
Because it's like it's very heavy and there's all these sharp edges for the

10
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.800
folks at home that are not watching they're just listening.

11
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.580
This is so unnecessary.
It must weigh.

12
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.580
<v 3>I would say of a pound maybe 2 2 pounds maybe you know like a briefcase.</v>

13
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.250
Yeah.
How much would you say that weighs if you'd had a guess with a pound maybe.

14
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.000
Yeah more than that I would feel like yeah maybe two pound.

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.790
<v 4>Yeah this is this is the heaviest one of these I've ever seen so fucking stupid.</v>

16
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.790
And so you you you take it it's tobacco and you you know you press the button

17
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.970
the bottom has a button and you take it.

18
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.310
It's like it doesn't move possibly sucking on that thing.

19
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.310
It looks like garlic on exhaust for a very small car.

20
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.750
<v 3>Yeah I mean it might as well have like if it's gonna be like that it might as</v>

21
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:24.830
well have like a brass knuckles component so it could be like a self-defense

22
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:25.250
weapon.

23
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.540
<v 4>Yeah like a key ring and you know like right try getting on a fucking plane.</v>

24
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.390
I tried telling the people on the plane.

25
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.930
This is my Veep and the part of Veep culture and I like ve been sweeping this on

26
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:43.511
a plane a dude came up to me at M problem was talking to me he had one of those

27
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.890
well yours sounds cool.
Here's has a weird tone to it.

28
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.190
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.560
James made it sound like it's Vader's jet with Darth Vader whispering It's a

30
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.350
quiet Darth Vader.

31
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.420
<v 4>This isn't really how much of a noise
play mine here</v>

32
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.510
my latest is just the sound of breathing and then a giant puff of smoke.

33
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.750
Yours doesn't have as much smoke either.
Now I think my my coils are bad.

34
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.660
I've got to redo the coil coils.
Man.
What is.

35
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.050
You know it just started off with those little fake cigarette jammies.
Yeah.

36
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.610
Like those blue cigarettes.
Well I've been doing this since 2007.

37
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.820
You early adopter.

38
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.290
<v 5>I know.</v>

39
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.350
Like well if they if they find out that something's wrong with these I might

40
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:29.710
post like you know it takes like 20 years to actually figure out if something's

41
00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:32.740
wrong with.
They go Hey whoa this is.

42
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.990
Stop everybody.

43
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.720
<v 6>But when I started you had to get them from England.
Like yeah you'd order it.</v>

44
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.290
My friend was a comic who was like You know I was smoking too much and he.

45
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.750
And he was like I just quit I started doing this stuff and you ordered from

46
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:49.000
England and they would send it in.

47
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.760
Even like vials of the nicotine liquid and they had all these big gloves that

48
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.820
would come with it and it would say they had this book that was like if you get

49
00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:01.810
this on your hands and it absorbs in it can give you a heart attack.

50
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 3>What thought so.
Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700
I don't know if it was there just being like you know overcautious or whatever

52
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.670
but I was like You know every time I had a fill it I was in the bathroom like

53
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.640
making sure there's people in my house like alright if I get this on my hands

54
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.640
run me to the hospital or something so ridiculous.

55
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.000
<v 7>That's so rude.
If you get it on your hand you'll die.</v>

56
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.460
How potent could that be.

57
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.870
<v 4>I don't know this stuff.</v>

58
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.460
The guy said sent it to me sent me little bottles of this jazz.

59
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.430
This one says strawberry custard.

60
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.750
<v 3>Yeah that's that's the thing now it's all like it's all fruit flavors like I do</v>

61
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.940
the like pipe tobacco flavored minus strawberry custom.

62
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.500
<v 4>This is a shitty handwriting.</v>

63
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.420
<v 8>You smoke it on a crunch berry crunch berry.</v>

64
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.660
<v 4>What does that say.
I say customer custard custard custard.
Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.010
Shitty handwriting you strawberry custard.

66
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.090
You'd think we'd somewhat print that out.
This is like the beta.
This is the test.

67
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.640
Yeah I'm not sure about this.
Well I.

68
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.060
I like puffing on those little blue cigarettes like before I do standup because

69
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:06.640
I feel like it gives you like because I know nicotine is one of things I read in

70
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:11.260
Stephen King's book on writing is a great book.

71
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.470
You read it.
No it's Stephen King sort of like.

72
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.490
I think he calls it a memoir of the craft or something along those lines but

73
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:22.450
it's basically like talking all about his writing habits and his just as the

74
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:26.410
discipline of writing and you know what what you shouldn't shouldn't do and you

75
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:29.860
know how he started out writing and it's really really inspiring.

76
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.210
A great book but one of the things in the book he talks about cigarettes I need

77
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.980
to stop when he's quit smoking cigarettes.

78
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.650
It had a an adverse effect on his writing.

79
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.380
Yeah like you felt like a synapses didn't fire up as well.

80
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.370
And I thought that was really interesting.

81
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.350
So I started reading up on nicotine and nicotine the effect on the brain and

82
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:51.220
it's kind of a bit of a cognitive enhancer.
You know it's a bit of a stimulant.

83
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.000
<v 9>It will yeah.</v>

84
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.090
And it's one of the things like one of the good things about nicotine that they

85
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:58.540
don't really talk about that much is that they think that it staves off

86
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:00.100
Alzheimer's.
That's crazy.

87
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.180
<v 4>It's like or there's some some sort of correlation between smoking and less</v>

88
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:08.560
likely to get Alzheimer's maybe that cancer is doing battle with the Alzheimer's

89
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:09.610
cancer itself first.

90
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.590
So they go to war and then your body's revised it gives a battlefield or they

91
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:14.890
could.

92
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.860
<v 3>Everyone dies before the age of you.
You usually get Alzheimer's.</v>

93
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.860
<v 4>Well have you heard of that.</v>

94
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.810
They're doing things like they're shooting HIV and cancer and killing cancer.

95
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.830
Oh really.

96
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.270
Yeah there's all these weird bizarre studies that they're doing now are tests

97
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.630
where they're injecting like tumors and different you know really fucked up

98
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.680
parts your body with other diseases.

99
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.950
And the other diseases are attacking the fucked up part of your body.

100
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.450
But then do you have aids to worry about AIDS cancer and die.

101
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.610
<v 5>I know that you live with AIDS.
Magic Johnson looks great.</v>

102
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.750
It's not AIDS HIV HIV but does that does it.
Does that make you HIV positive.

103
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.910
<v 4>You're putting so I think it's an inert form of HIV allegedly.</v>

104
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.540
I don't know.
Some people don't know.

105
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.590
I mean if you're gonna die of cancer if you had a choice between like pancreatic

106
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:07.591
cancer or HIV take HIV all day right because they got that thing pretty nailed

107
00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:11.590
down.
I have a friend who I've known for

108
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.480
maybe 20 years and he's been HIV positive for like most of that time and he's

109
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:22.450
great.
He's fine hey he's fine.
It's normal.

110
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.960
I mean you see him he's always laughing and nothing wrong with him.
Huh.

111
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.853
It's weird.

112
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.270
<v 3>When was the turn for that.</v>

113
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.300
Was it like oh it's it's like last 10 years right where all of a sudden it's not

114
00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:37.660
as I'm not not to say it's not as big of a deal but like it's certainly less of

115
00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:39.490
it's certainly slightly less of a death sentence.

116
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.770
<v 4>You know I don't think it's a death sentence at all anymore.</v>

117
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.020
I mean it's a testament to science you know.

118
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.500
Protease inhibitors and all these different things that they figured out how to

119
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.580
how to stunt the progress of HIV.

120
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.520
It's it's super controversial because there's been a lot of like weird

121
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.880
correlations between the crushing of the immune system like obviously it's an

122
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:04.910
agreement that HIV or most people are in agreement that HIV is or causes AIDS.

123
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.840
But there's a bunch of people that say well it's that maybe but there's also

124
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:13.841
this thing about partying like in the gay community especially there's rampant

125
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:19.271
drug abuse like and that for whatever reason people do want to factor that in

126
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.920
and there is this guy that I had on the podcast that I think had a faulty

127
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.860
connection and his is he's actually a biologist at the University of Berkeley

128
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.610
University California Berkeley it seems Peter Duisburg and he's super

129
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:39.170
controversial because he doesn't believe that HIV causes AIDS.

130
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.200
He thinks that AIDS is you know AIDS being immune deficiency syndrome acquired

131
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.080
immune acquired immune deficiency syndrome and he believes that it is directly

132
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:55.130
correlated with partying directly correlated with use of crystal meth with

133
00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.910
poppers AML nitrate crushing the immune system and no other scientist support

134
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:03.230
him no credible scientist support us.

135
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.520
We had him on the podcast he was pretty convinced convincing to an idiot like me

136
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.790
zero medical biologicals studying.

137
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.360
But the more I talk to people who understand no one wanted to debate him which

138
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.180
is really interesting.
But I think it's kind of like debating a Holocaust denier.

139
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.410
<v 3>It's a controversial Yeah.</v>

140
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.630
You don't want to you know you want to give him credit you know.

141
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.320
<v 4>So he's like he's got tenure at University California Berkeley but he can't get</v>

142
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:29.390
any funding anymore.
No I don't have anything to do with them.

143
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.870
Apparently he's done tremendous work with with cancer but because of this whole

144
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.490
HIV AIDS connection thing he's kind of blackballed.

145
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.260
And I was in touch with a lot of scientists after this was over was really

146
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:47.090
interesting because people got really upset with that podcast with him on that

147
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:51.410
podcast and then me giving him a platform and I'm like Look man the guy was in

148
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:52.580
Spin magazine.

149
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.340
He's you know he's been he's written a bunch of articles about this.

150
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.470
I just wanted to hear what he had to say about it.
Yeah.

151
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.670
So having him on was pretty interesting but I think it's I don't think he's

152
00:09:01.671 --> 00:09:06.260
right but I think he has a point in that it's got to have an adverse effect on

153
00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:08.450
your body.
And gay people like to party.

154
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.450
I mean it's just a fact you know and Crystal Matthews and Emile nitrate use it

155
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.150
like those are devastating to your immune system.

156
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.430
<v 10>So if you've already got something going on you are more susceptible.
Yes.
Yeah.</v>

157
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.770
But that doesn't it doesn't get factored in very often and I think that's where

158
00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:27.920
Duisburg because he kind of brings that up.

159
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:33.130
I think you know it kind of gives the whole thing is a little bit cloudy because

160
00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:38.540
of that and because it doesn't get factored in but that shit's super super bad

161
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:40.460
for your body HIV.
No.

162
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.820
Hardy partying all that you know the poppers and crystal meth and all that shit.

163
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.680
It's just like you know gay people don't have kids.
They do have kids.

164
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.360
It's rare you know that just they're out there having a good fucking time just

165
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.060
doing math banging each other getting sick.

166
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:02.060
<v 3>I I always I love like hanging on this a couple of conspiracy theory boards just</v>

167
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.930
as I'm like fascinated by it like I just it's only my fear of things in the

168
00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:08.340
world are this conspiracy theories like even ones I don't believe in.

169
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.180
I just love them like my favorite one ever is.

170
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.750
There's a whole bunch of people out there who actually think that Lady Gaga is

171
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:18.230
JonBenet Ramsey.
Oh good Lord.
Yeah I like that real yeah.

172
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.580
There's a whole bunch people that think that.

173
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.460
And so it's like those things that put up the pictures where they show like the.

174
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.910
I like the eyes are the same.
You know distance across and like that kind of.

175
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.860
But there's one there's a whole group of people who don't think Magic Johnson

176
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:31.940
ever had HIV.

177
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:38.410
They think that it was a kind of almost a PR campaign to get awareness out.

178
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.470
Really.
Yeah.
I don't I don't believe that.

179
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.340
But it's like it's a fascinating conspiracy theory where people are just like it

180
00:10:46.341 --> 00:10:49.290
was a huge problem.
It was a problem in like inner cities.

181
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.170
And he was the biggest guy at the time he was kind of like this huge role model

182
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:57.410
and for somebody like him to come out and say I have HIV.

183
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.380
Then like it could be like a big kind of get awareness out kind of thing that's

184
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.090
like oh he conspired.
That's what that's.
I mean why would he do that.

185
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.360
Yeah but it's a vague it's a conspiracy theory but ridiculous.

186
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.340
<v 4>Well he is one of the few guys that was reportedly heterosexual that got it.</v>

187
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.050
You know like did you ever see Sam Kennison a bit Sam Kinison.

188
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.360
You hear the crackle ladies and gentlemen only.

189
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.280
I'm going to support solidarity.

190
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.740
<v 11>Well yeah synopsis.
What the fuck was I saying.</v>

191
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.480
This stuff the same kinds of Sam Kennison Sam Kinison had a bit about it you

192
00:11:34.481 --> 00:11:34.920
know.

193
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.500
Well you know because he had he made fun of AIDS and they say Sam you know he's

194
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.650
a communicable disease heterosexual diabetic.

195
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.170
<v 7>Those name on line one fucking guy.</v>

196
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.780
<v 4>It's not our dance you know but really it's not by many and there's very few me</v>

197
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.010
when I was a kid and I heard about Magic Johnson getting HIV.

198
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.960
I remember thinking Oh my God everyone's gonna have AIDS and like maybe a year

199
00:11:59.961 --> 00:12:04.961
or two later I got health insurance and I had to get an AIDS test and I was

200
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.120
fucking terrified just thinking of all the drunken poor choices with no condom

201
00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:16.031
and oh my goodness it's gonna happen I have AIDS I'm only twenty five of AIDS

202
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.170
shit and then I didn't have AIDS and so super psyched but then I started looking

203
00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:21.470
into it.

204
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.700
<v 12>It's like it's almost like very very few heterosexual people that aren't</v>

205
00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:26.900
intravenous drug users.

206
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.700
<v 3>Users yeah they get AIDS.</v>

207
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:34.030
Yeah I mean I mean I remember it like when I was a kid it was there they treated

208
00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:38.160
it like it was you know you have sex without a condom once you're gonna get it

209
00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:41.150
it's going to happen.
It's just it's an inevitable you know kind of thing.

210
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.810
And now I think now they're kind of backing off that a little bit where it's

211
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.860
like well it's actually not.

212
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.510
<v 4>I think it's way more easy for a woman because obviously the woman takes sperm</v>

213
00:12:50.511 --> 00:12:55.020
into her body and her body absorbs it or gay men because you're a gay man even.

214
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.580
You're taking it in your ass and you're not supposed to have come in your ass.

215
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.010
What's up.
It's on.
I'm just sitting it down.
You made it.

216
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.180
<v 13>Oh just this stupid fucking thing is so heavy.</v>

217
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.940
<v 5>There's a safety on it.
Mine has a safety on the bottom.</v>

218
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.300
There's no safety on this piece of shit that's been Oh my God it's so hot.

219
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.100
<v 4>Oh my God if I if I licked that right now if I tried to suck on it it would</v>

220
00:13:19.101 --> 00:13:22.310
probably burn.
I came in said it.
I got to set it down sideways.

221
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.160
You can't set this for people at home at eliciting which is most people see it.

222
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.650
You do it right.
Yeah.
The top of it is super hot.

223
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.920
<v 3>See there's a safety right here so you spin that down.</v>

224
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.250
Oh no I'm taking it to safety.
That's a battery.
Well mine has a year is better.

225
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:41.350
<v 14>Mine has a thing like that.
So you're doing it again.
Smoke started coming out of</v>

226
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.340
this thing.
I'll try to describe it.
You know what it looks like.

227
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.200
<v 2>It looks like a spaceship in a shitty 1990s sci fi movie.</v>

228
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.220
<v 15>That's what it looks like.
That could be some sort of a spaceship.
Like you know.</v>

229
00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:00.710
Yeah it's fucking horrible.
AIDS.
Where were we.

230
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.720
It's conspiracy theories.
AIDS.
Yeah.

231
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.810
I don't know what it was.

232
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.440
<v 4>I know what we're talking about but the JonBenet thing is interesting.</v>

233
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.270
When I was living in Colorado I actually looked at her house the house that she

234
00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:15.104
was killed in.

235
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.060
I didn't look at it in person but it was for sale and I was like wow what a

236
00:14:20.061 --> 00:14:22.670
beautiful house.
I was pretty reasonable for what it is.

237
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.950
And they actually changed the street name.

238
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.210
They changed the street name or changed the address.
Right.
One of those.

239
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.570
And like to try to hide the fact that it was the house where JonBenet died.

240
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.440
But they have to disclose it.
Don't they do have to disclose it.

241
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.360
And that's the problem.
They can't fucking sell it.
Yeah.
Who's gonna buy that.

242
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.580
It's a beautiful house.

243
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:45.600
It's really nice and it's a nice area of Boulder but nobody wants I fucking.
No.

244
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.200
Ten dollars.
Len Bias.
I'd buy for ten bucks.
Would you live in.

245
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.250
Would you say behaves.

246
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.970
For a show for a TV show like a go show fucked up man.
That whole stories.

247
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.370
<v 10>Oh look I think I think that whole child pageant thing is one of the most fucked</v>

248
00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:04.780
up things when you see little kids with high heels and makeup on.
Yeah.

249
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.520
Dressed up like you know they're trying to get laid.

250
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.230
So Cary is like you know the worst parenting.
It's weird man.

251
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.430
We were in Dallas and we were doing the improv in the hotel that we were staying

252
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:20.390
at was the exact same hotel where they were having one of these pageants.

253
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.860
And we.

254
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.300
It was me and I think Duncan and Joey and we were walking around the hotel
going.

255
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.070
What the fuck is this.

256
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:33.190
<v 16>Yeah it was all little tiny kids like 5 like I have a I have a 4 year old and I</v>

257
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.430
have a 6 year old so they were like my kid's age but they were wearing high

258
00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:41.240
heels where they could barely walk and they were fully dolled up.

259
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.210
<v 17>I mean eyelashes full makeup war paint.
Yeah.</v>

260
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.190
Oh teased up Texas style hair like little dresses.

261
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.890
I mean it was disgusting.
It was disturbing.

262
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.540
<v 3>Was really really weird.</v>

263
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.250
Just the fact that just putting them into like a judging scenario at that age.

264
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.310
Yeah.
You know kind of like well you weren't the best kid.
Yeah.

265
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.460
You know you didn't you know everyone you got up in front of everyone but they

266
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:05.770
like this other kid better than you.

267
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.470
So yeah psychologically rattled that around in your brain for your whole life.

268
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.860
<v 4>My daughter was playing softball or soccer rather for a while and her nickname</v>

269
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:17.810
was Bruiser.
My youngest one is like super aggressive.

270
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.400
She's crazy but she's really like she's a sweetie.

271
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.230
But when it comes to thinks she's like she loves like Teenage Mutant Ninja

272
00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:29.231
Turtles and she's a Superman lunchbox probably a lesbian but I love her to death

273
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.710
but she's she's really athletic and so she's only four.

274
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.150
<v 2>And so they had her in soccer and she's just scoring goals like crazy.</v>

275
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.390
The game starts.
Boom she scores the first goal.

276
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.610
She runs the ball boom scores a second goal.

277
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.020
I mean she's like a little animal and then the other team scored and she's start

278
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.020
crying because you're the team was cheer and she started crying like that.

279
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.610
The family on the other side with the families were cheering and then she's like

280
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.810
I don't want to play anymore.

281
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.690
And the coaches like you got to go back out there and play I'm like you don't

282
00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:02.930
have to play I go it's just stupid it's a ball going it's the net I go if you're

283
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:06.020
not enjoying it don't do it yeah I go but you shouldn't worry about the other

284
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.760
team.
It's like scoring but I knew that she couldn't kind of internalize that.

285
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.210
So I said this is no big deal I don't want to make it a big deal because I think

286
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.120
that sports a lot of times parents they fuck their kids up because they make

287
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:21.200
like winning and losing this like huge deal or playing you got to get out there

288
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.400
you got to look and play Yeah figure that out when you're older you know when

289
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:29.390
you're four you should be having fun you know and that's I mean the coaches like

290
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:32.450
sitting down with they're trying to psych her out and the coaches dummy shit.

291
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.110
<v 4>So when she's sitting down she's giving her the dumb psychology as I go but well</v>

292
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:40.120
stop stop stop stop stop don't teach my kid.
Come here honey.
Sorry.

293
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.090
It's some big deal.
Yeah.

294
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.300
She's like you've gotta go out there and you got to just go out there and you

295
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.420
get that score back.
What have they scored.
If you feel bad you've got to go.

296
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:53.270
None of them did it.
Get out of here.
No you don't.
Yes.
Have fun.

297
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.670
Relax.
Like this is just supposed to be fun.

298
00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.500
So the idea that you could take someone that age and then judge them on their

299
00:18:00.501 --> 00:18:02.870
looks.
That's fucking insane.

300
00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.910
And you know they have like a talent portion where they have they saying and do

301
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.940
little dances in their high heels and you know what the fuck man likes it so on

302
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.980
who is the pedophile that invented this first guy who is like I have an idea for

303
00:18:17.801 --> 00:18:21.940
a thing to do.
I think it's people that are just living through their kids man.

304
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.210
Yeah you see that a lot with with sports.

305
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.400
You know you really see that a lot with you know people that like it's usually

306
00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.980
fathers with their sons like fathers like.

307
00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.900
Like really fucked their kids up because they're like super some guys you know

308
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.800
obviously some guys like fucked our kids up to they're super super super

309
00:18:41.801 --> 00:18:46.450
invested in their kid being successful like I've seen kids not do well at

310
00:18:46.451 --> 00:18:48.760
certain sports and seen their fathers yelling at them.

311
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.710
<v 17>You're talking like 10 year old kids like God damn and like you're to the only</v>

312
00:18:53.711 --> 00:18:57.520
way these kids are really good at something is if he's rewarded for his hard

313
00:18:57.521 --> 00:18:58.060
work.

314
00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:02.920
And then if he gets a sort of an understanding of what is healthy and was not

315
00:19:02.921 --> 00:19:04.180
healthy about competition.

316
00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:09.220
Yeah what's definitely not healthy is you you putting everything on the line for

317
00:19:09.221 --> 00:19:13.300
this kid like it's everything like your love your love is invested in this kid

318
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.830
knocking a ball into a net.
This is fucking preposterous and it's just so goofy.

319
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.220
<v 3>Dads just see that Tiger Woods money and think that's what it is.</v>

320
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.270
I mean I don't know.

321
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.410
I mean it's it's probably it's probably a column a which is them trying to you

322
00:19:26.411 --> 00:19:29.770
know redo their you know what they wish they had done.
Yeah.

323
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.970
<v 4>Then there's also like my kid could be the greatest quarterback my kid could be</v>

324
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.330
you know.

325
00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:39.070
Yeah I think that could be in the future they might be looking at it that way.

326
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.990
We're gonna get you on that doesn't make that noise.
Oh sorry I won't do it.

327
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.120
I do it's okay.
I just push the microphone.
But the audience is probably going.

328
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.290
People that have headphones on is that the headphones are the real issue.
Sorry.

329
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.740
Because sometimes we have these fight companion podcasts where we have a bunch

330
00:19:53.741 --> 00:19:57.100
of guys in here and watch fights and people start eating snacks and they're

331
00:19:57.101 --> 00:20:00.620
eating right into the microphone and if you listening if you have headphones on

332
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.780
it's fucking maddening but it's hard you know you're drinking and smoking pot

333
00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:06.490
and people forget and they start chewing.

334
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.290
<v 15>Anyway JonBenet Ramsey not not a good place to buy a house.</v>

335
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:18.710
Age just done JonBenet Ramsey is done we cover those super duper important

336
00:20:18.791 --> 00:20:23.110
things conspiracy there's one that thinks they think that Bill Hicks and Alex

337
00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:25.070
Jones are the same person I've seen that.

338
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.370
<v 18>Yeah.
Trust me I've met both of them they're different humans.</v>

339
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.490
Fucking christ people are so crazy.
Could you imagine.

340
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.320
Like why why would you do that.
I want to be the buddy ever done that.

341
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.970
Has anybody ever faked their own death.

342
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.150
<v 3>Tupac
Andy Kaufman.</v>

343
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.390
Andy Kaufman Tupac live on an island somewhere.
All right.

344
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.690
What a boring fucking life waiting to die of old age.

345
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.720
Yeah but that's also maybe one of the best sitcoms ever.

346
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:56.410
Tupac and Andy Kaufman alone on an island somewhere like an odd couple.

347
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.010
How long before gay shit starts happening.
How many months and

348
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.480
it's got to be early right away.
Yeah right.
Fuck it we're here.

349
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.060
<v 15>Let's be honest no one's rescuing us.</v>

350
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.710
I don't know of anyone that's ever fake their own death successfully.

351
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.330
I know some people have tried.

352
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:18.690
There was a guy that I remember it was some business guy who apparently got

353
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.990
busted swindling or something like that.

354
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.820
<v 4>He faked his own death.
They caught him a few years later.
Yeah.</v>

355
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.460
And then that guy that's in the movie The Jinx the show The Jinx.

356
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.690
Yeah that guy that what is his name Robert Durst Robert Durst.

357
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:36.160
Yeah he had a guy that they know but he disappeared and pretended he was a woman

358
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:36.730
right.

359
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.750
He pretended he was a mute woman like to put on a wig and dressed like a woman.

360
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:45.760
And then as a mute woman murdered another guy and took off.

361
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.653
And that's like.

362
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.670
<v 3>Whitey Bulger did it for a while.</v>

363
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.210
That's where he disappeared but didn't fake his own death.
No.
Yeah I heard.

364
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.070
I don't know if this is true.

365
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.640
I heard and I don't I don't remember where I heard it so this could just be

366
00:21:57.641 --> 00:21:58.390
nonsense.

367
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.350
<v 4>But that was his plan was to do it like when he was gonna get old and die was</v>

368
00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:06.700
gonna go out into the desert dig a hole and just basically you know kill himself

369
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:09.930
in the hole so they never find him.
Bolger Yeah.
I don't know that's true or not.

370
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.570
I heard that you got to kill yourself where animals would eat you right.

371
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.523
That's the move.

372
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.560
What you should do if anybody wants to kill themselves and not be found go to

373
00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:22.561
Alberta go to Alberta Canada go to where the bears are because there's sections

374
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:26.650
of Alberta Canada that are literally infested with black bears.

375
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.760
You and they have a few Grizzlies up there as well but I've never seen more

376
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:35.761
bears in one place in my life like in one day you'll see 16 bears like no shit.

377
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:41.450
Yeah fucking big bear seven foot bears and just blow your brains out every

378
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.920
summer.
Honey.
Yeah.

379
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.400
Because the bears eat honey and Nellie you know they'll have you'll be gone.

380
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.260
They'll eat your bones clean everything they'll eat every every single piece of

381
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:53.320
who you are they'll shit out your teeth and that's that'll be a wrap.

382
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.850
Nobody will find you good.
It's a good life or the ocean.
The oceans are the best.

383
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.400
Yeah.
They just are not going to find you.

384
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.160
<v 3>And you go out far enough and just jump just jump out.</v>

385
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.410
<v 11>Yeah.
Just start breathing.
You'll fucking sink to the bottom.</v>

386
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.490
The odds of your body making it all the way to shore.
Not so good.
Yeah.

387
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.050
I mean think about how goddamn big the ocean is.

388
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.690
<v 15>Who's gonna find you.
Nobody.</v>

389
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.360
That's probably good move the oceans by better than the bear move but it's more

390
00:23:17.361 --> 00:23:19.820
peaceful serene all up.

391
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.950
It's terrifying the oceans peaceful in the day at nighttime it's fucking

392
00:23:24.951 --> 00:23:25.490
horrific.

393
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:30.490
<v 3>Yeah I was out sailing once in New York and we went out like a little far and</v>

394
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:37.081
then it got dark and we were trying to come back and it was awful and the waves

395
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:39.520
got bigger and it was actually like a sailboat.

396
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.410
So like really kind of you know with the old like wheel and everything and

397
00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.750
actually like feeling like the strength of the waves trying to get back and it

398
00:23:46.751 --> 00:23:49.480
was really fucking terrifying.
Like trying to get back to New York.

399
00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.870
<v 4>That's a crazy way to die man.
Your boat tips over.</v>

400
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.040
Know I'm trying to scramble and hope the boat stays afloat sideways and the

401
00:23:57.041 --> 00:24:01.280
water's cold.
Yeah.
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho.
I.

402
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.750
My kitchen was getting fixed.
There's shit wrong with my kitchen.

403
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.700
So we decided to rent.

404
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.060
We say oh well you know we'll do we'll rent a house on the water you know rent a

405
00:24:10.061 --> 00:24:11.200
house on the beach for a couple of months.

406
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:16.650
And I got barbecued one night the first night we went there I got super duper

407
00:24:17.741 --> 00:24:18.574
high.

408
00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:22.420
And in the daytime it was beautiful like that like you look out the window where

409
00:24:22.421 --> 00:24:25.120
you're eating breakfast and would just be ocean just like right there in the

410
00:24:25.121 --> 00:24:26.590
ocean like wow so pretty.

411
00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.790
<v 2>But at nighttime.</v>

412
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:33.810
That same view is horrifying because the sky is black and the is black and you

413
00:24:34.931 --> 00:24:36.920
keep hearing lush.

414
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.830
And it's like it reveals itself to you like Oh you thought that this was like

415
00:24:41.831 --> 00:24:43.840
your playground.
A beautiful thing.

416
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.100
There's a fucking monster that could swallow up the whole city and not even know

417
00:24:48.101 --> 00:24:48.310
it.

418
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:53.310
Yeah like the ocean could just swallow Los Angeles one day with one burp slash

419
00:24:54.071 --> 00:24:58.630
fart of the tectonic plates.
At least Malibu.
Oh yeah.

420
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.060
Malibu that would be done.
Santa Monica.
Done.
Yeah.

421
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:07.240
All that the promenade done just all those in the mall area with all the shops

422
00:25:07.241 --> 00:25:12.241
and people playing songs you don't want to hear on the street a hundred foot

423
00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:17.611
high waves just pouring in covering everything for 3 4 miles deep.

424
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.700
<v 4>That's nothing that's happened a hundred thousand fuckin times in the course of</v>

425
00:25:21.701 --> 00:25:26.200
the earth.
And we just set up houses there.
Dig a man.

426
00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.890
Boom boom boom fuckin posts have our way of all.

427
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.250
I was terrified in that house.

428
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.890
Man I barely stayed and I rented it for a few months and I'm gonna have to stay

429
00:25:35.891 --> 00:25:40.240
in and my my other house my art my actually out my house with the fucked up

430
00:25:40.241 --> 00:25:43.120
kitchen I was cooking on a hot plate.
I was like I feel more comfortable here.

431
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.610
Are you afraid of Sonam ese.
I'm afraid of everything.

432
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:50.440
<v 3>Yeah I'm afraid of everything I'm afraid of asteroids wolves tsunamis are like</v>

433
00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:54.850
the one some birds one disaster for some reason I'm not afraid of.
Really.
Yeah.

434
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.050
I don't know why like my wife is terrified.
I think her biggest fear is tsunami.

435
00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:58.900
She's smart.

436
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.650
And like whenever I see the tsunami I know this is just this is naive.

437
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.360
But whenever I look at tsunami footage and stuff I feel like I could.

438
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.740
I think I feel like I could get away like but I got so scared Snowmass Bill

439
00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:12.070
caught my shirt.
You really think you get away.

440
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.250
You know it's I know it's stupid and I probably couldn't but I just have that

441
00:26:15.251 --> 00:26:16.360
kind of thought right.

442
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.510
Like I feel like if I had to pick a natural disaster like I'm afraid of

443
00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.310
earthquakes asteroids.

444
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.210
But like tsunamis I would never take that.

445
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.710
<v 11>Imagine if you did.</v>

446
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.880
If you if you were right and you like a suit tsunami came you survived like a

447
00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:32.620
thousand people dead Trevor Moore.

448
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.570
<v 2>How did you survive.
They're all pussies.</v>

449
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.140
How do they not survive some fucking water just swim.

450
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.980
<v 18>No I just think you know it.
I kind of always deep down felt like I could do it.</v>

451
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.440
And you know it's turned out.

452
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.550
God told me I would be fine and the water is just water.

453
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.490
<v 4>Just keep swimming and you're fine now.</v>

454
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.110
If you ever could've been caught in an undertow.

455
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.993
<v 3>Not a big one.</v>

456
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.260
Like I go surfing and surfing like you know I've never been caught in like one

457
00:26:59.261 --> 00:27:02.590
that was I've been caught in one and been like oh I'm an undertow you know.

458
00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:04.600
But now not a bad one.

459
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.660
<v 4>You know I've never been kind of bad when either but I got caught in one that</v>

460
00:27:07.661 --> 00:27:10.750
was enough that freaked me the fuck out.
I got caught in one.

461
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.560
Got to remember where it was but I remember like oh this is what that is.
Yeah.

462
00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:17.770
And I'm you know pretty athletic.

463
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.520
I'm in pretty good shape but I was thinking man what if I was like a old lady or

464
00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:24.530
you know a young kid.
Yeah yeah like this is not good.

465
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.390
Like the water just started pulling me back and that was pretty wrap and I was

466
00:27:28.391 --> 00:27:32.830
like oh fuck this I started starts.
You've got to swim sideways.

467
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.420
Yeah lateral.
Yeah yeah.
Towards the shore.
Greg Fitzsimmons how to rescue someone.

468
00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.760
<v 2>He was on vacation with his family and some woman got caught in the undertow and</v>

469
00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:46.210
she was screaming and she was getting pulled out and he looked around and there

470
00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:49.120
was no lifeguard.
There was no nothing.
And she was just getting pulled.

471
00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.530
And so he was having his fucking wife and his kids yelling HOLY SHIT.

472
00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.120
OK here we go.

473
00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.730
And he just jumped out there and you know you've got to like know how to hold on

474
00:27:58.731 --> 00:28:00.030
to people when you're saving them.

475
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.860
<v 12>He denies they're panicking and they're just trying to get to higher ground on</v>

476
00:28:02.861 --> 00:28:06.040
top of the hour pull you with them they'll pull you with them and she she did

477
00:28:06.041 --> 00:28:07.030
not know how to do that.

478
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:11.350
And so like you know he barely made it well barely made it and saved this this

479
00:28:11.351 --> 00:28:12.160
woman.

480
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.140
<v 4>But that moment when you you have to make that decision do I risk my life to try</v>

481
00:28:17.141 --> 00:28:20.710
to save some person because it might be get to a point where like Oh my God I'm

482
00:28:20.711 --> 00:28:23.700
gonna have to punch this chick in the face and swim by myself because she's

483
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:27.260
gonna drag me under Right like there's those weird Mom that actually happened to

484
00:28:27.261 --> 00:28:29.870
people when they're trying to save someone they realize I'm going to die too

485
00:28:29.871 --> 00:28:31.360
because this person is an idiot you know.

486
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.180
Aw yeah maybe not an idiot but they can't they're panic and they don't know how

487
00:28:35.181 --> 00:28:36.230
to deal with stress.

488
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.730
<v 17>Some people given that exact same circumstance just know how to stay calm and</v>

489
00:28:40.731 --> 00:28:45.260
they'll be fine and other people they just and they can breathe like you like

490
00:28:45.261 --> 00:28:48.800
Breathe breathe I can't breathe and I'll fucking christ like I can't teach you

491
00:28:48.801 --> 00:28:51.200
how to breathe here while we're both trying to swim for our lives.

492
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.690
Fuck I mean his wife and his kids were watching this whole thing happen and you

493
00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.810
know he kind of figured out how to grab her and swim to the shore with her and

494
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.760
that's some terrifying shit.

495
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.910
<v 3>Yeah that's good I mean like Yep people we were we were doing like river kind of</v>

496
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.970
rafting not I mean just like kind of a..

497
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:13.580
Like you know kind of like lazy river kind of stuff up in Cape Cod once me and a

498
00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:18.581
bunch of friends and this river comes out to the ocean and when it came out to

499
00:29:19.161 --> 00:29:23.510
the ocean there was one of our friends who doesn't swim so I don't know why he

500
00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:26.540
was with us but like he was on one of those inner tubes just kind of like did he

501
00:29:26.541 --> 00:29:29.690
have a life raft on to.
No he was just kind of tubing but it was like a river.

502
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:30.543
It was a river.

503
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.940
And so it got to the ocean and it was the same kind of thing where it just this

504
00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:38.900
river just shoot stuff you know shoots the water out into the ocean really far.

505
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:44.110
So he went all of a sudden way out and we're all we're all back on the beach

506
00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.700
we're like oh.
Holy shit lake.
Chris can't swim.
Oh.

507
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.550
So we're like going in and we see that he's panicking and in his panic.

508
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.150
What he did was he jumped off of the raft.

509
00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:00.410
Oh no because the raft was going out to ocean and he just wanted to get back to

510
00:30:00.411 --> 00:30:01.730
the shore.
So he does not swim.

511
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.060
I know but in the panic in that moment like you know your brain doesn't really

512
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:08.090
make the right decisions.
So I had to get him but how he died.

513
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.700
<v 19>No no no
no.</v>

514
00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:14.270
We had people that had a swim out and like I get him back.

515
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.480
<v 5>Did you get the raft who.
I don't know I don't either.
The money man.</v>

516
00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:21.770
I don't remember what happened.
Maybe not.
Oh fucking Christ.

517
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.950
<v 4>Oh my friend Remy.
Remy Warren.</v>

518
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.040
He was on a river once he was right next to a river and some stuff.

519
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.190
Saad he talked about on the podcast for folks listening to this.
His.

520
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.870
His version is gonna be way better than mine.

521
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.790
But he saw some stuff floating down the river.

522
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:43.130
And then a guy face down body floating down the river.

523
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.580
And then he realized holy shit like this is like a capsized boat.

524
00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.820
It's freezing cold water and then a woman hanging on for dear life screaming and

525
00:30:51.921 --> 00:30:53.450
he said Holy shit.
Here we go.

526
00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:57.230
He just jumped in the river and was freezing cold water and he realized like as

527
00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.500
he was jumping he's like okay I'm probably gonna die because this you know you

528
00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:02.270
get hypothermia really quickly.

529
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:06.220
Yeah those means essentially those rivers are there.
They're glaciers.

530
00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.520
It's glaciers melting and they create this river and it's fucking freezing cold

531
00:31:10.521 --> 00:31:15.200
water in the mountain and he's in this water and it's not warm out either.

532
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.053
It's cold out.

533
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.120
And so he just drove in and he's trying to save this woman and he got lucky.

534
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.330
They both got lucky and they figured out a way to grab a hold of something and

535
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.400
you know.
But he got a hold of her and then dragged it to shore.

536
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:29.180
But he was pretty convinced as he jumped in like Okay this is it for me.

537
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.600
Been a fun life a good way to die to try to save somebody else.

538
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.060
That's pretty much yeah.
It's pretty heroic.

539
00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:40.140
But if she dies to you like damn I could have lived and just want to die.
Yeah

540
00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:47.330
just start telling people Hey man don't don't raft.
Shit's dangerous as fuck.

541
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.330
Well all the ways to die.

542
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:54.320
You know that's a river rafting is this is a really terrifying one.

543
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:58.640
If you see like when people there was such a reality show I forget what reality

544
00:31:58.641 --> 00:32:02.870
show was but it never went to air because as they were filming like one of the

545
00:32:02.871 --> 00:32:07.871
first episodes someone they overturned their canoe and got trapped under a rock

546
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:14.320
like the canoe overturned and the the waves or the the current rather wedged

547
00:32:16.461 --> 00:32:21.330
them under a rock and they drowned.
You didn't like the pilot and the pilot.

548
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.420
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is years back.

549
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:28.370
This was like right when Survivor was first taken off before the internet really

550
00:32:28.371 --> 00:32:32.780
took hold as far as like social media and TMC type shit which they would just

551
00:32:32.781 --> 00:32:34.100
have a field day with this.

552
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.760
Yeah but back then it was just you know they didn't really they hadn't figured

553
00:32:37.761 --> 00:32:39.750
out how to use the Internet for trash yet.

554
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.250
<v 12>You know but this this this person just got stuck and I remember thinking that</v>

555
00:32:45.951 --> 00:32:49.580
like okay that's not something I ever want to be a part of.

556
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.410
<v 10>You know now we are stuck in a freezing cold river with insanely powerful</v>

557
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:56.520
currents.
Yeah I don't I don't I don't.

558
00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:01.220
<v 3>I mean some people like I've done it once the river rafting kind of thing like</v>

559
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:02.790
the white water kind of stuff like that.

560
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.150
It's just not fun to me like it's it's it's very bumpy.
It's scary.

561
00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:12.290
<v 11>There's potential death everywhere people love thrills man they love it.</v>

562
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.460
Somebody was they love that rush that adrenaline rush just poof.

563
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.390
I don't know.

564
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.320
<v 3>I hinted this guy I've ever done skydiving now.
Yeah.</v>

565
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:26.410
<v 20>Fuck that yeah cause I feel like if you if you do die sky diving</v>

566
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:31.760
it's you know it's always sad when people die but it's like you know it's kind

567
00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:32.390
of you don't get that.

568
00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.120
<v 0>I mean people be like Well yeah.
He jumped out of an airplane.</v>

569
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.240
<v 4>You know I've had friends or EMT guys that have found people you know after</v>

570
00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:44.710
Scott got into the surface they saw their bodies totally intact.

571
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.760
It's everything inside you know.
Yeah.

572
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:51.210
But everything inside like your bones are like pushed up through your torso and

573
00:33:51.211 --> 00:33:56.211
just like and you're just a bag of broken bones and destroyed organs.

574
00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.660
Yeah not good.

575
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:02.820
<v 3>I read there's this article there Jamie has a look at his face.</v>

576
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.240
There is this article where they interviewed people who had actually fallen out

577
00:34:06.241 --> 00:34:07.390
of planes and lived.
OK.

578
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:11.460
There's like only a handful but they were trying to figure out how you how to do

579
00:34:11.461 --> 00:34:16.380
it and the stories were crazy because there's this one guy who was an old guy

580
00:34:16.381 --> 00:34:20.550
that they interviewed who I guess was in World War 2 and his plane just
exploded.

581
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.730
Well he before he had jumped out a thing and he fell and then they say that is

582
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:29.400
the way to do it is and it's not like full proof but like the people who have

583
00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:33.240
survived they kind of try to hit a tree and

584
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:39.760
you try to hit a tree as close to the middle as possible but not the exact metal

585
00:34:39.931 --> 00:34:44.490
because that'll impale you that you want to hit close to the trunk where the

586
00:34:44.491 --> 00:34:49.491
branches are the thickest and you basically want to have all the branches break

587
00:34:49.531 --> 00:34:53.940
your fall on the way down and you're gonna be fucked up when like you hit the

588
00:34:53.941 --> 00:34:57.150
ground.
But the people who have lived a lot of them hit trees.

589
00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:58.450
<v 11>Wow.</v>

590
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.180
I heard a guy who lived to hit a barn and apparently went through the roof and

591
00:35:03.181 --> 00:35:07.530
into the hay and somehow another made it but he was fucked.

592
00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:10.740
Yeah I mean it was bone broken back broken.

593
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.270
You know all fucked up legs broken but lived somehow or another.

594
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.390
Yeah my friend Brian his dad had worked with this guy and the guy was trying to

595
00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:25.620
get him to skydive and then you know when they went to the office and the guy

596
00:35:25.621 --> 00:35:27.340
wasn't there he's like what happened.

597
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.300
Where's where's Mike or whatever the fuck his name.

598
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:34.450
That was actually a woman and I found out that the skydiving didn't go so well

599
00:35:35.341 --> 00:35:36.450
that weekend.
Holy shit.

600
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.690
<v 13>Yeah yeah.
It's dead.</v>

601
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.590
<v 3>Yeah.
Skydiving.
I don't get that sports don't like that one.</v>

602
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.710
<v 4>Well you know my friend Steve vanilla said it best.</v>

603
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.330
He said there's things that are fun that are fun while you're doing them but

604
00:35:51.331 --> 00:35:52.490
they're not fun later.

605
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:57.030
And I think skydiving is one of those roller coasters or one of those as well.

606
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.460
They're fun while you're doing them but they're not fun later.

607
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:04.700
And then there's things that you do like crazy arduous hikes over mountains and

608
00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:08.940
you get to the top and you is insanely beautiful view and like you earned that

609
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:12.720
view and you know you're camping it's freezing and you know you're you're

610
00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:16.170
fucking huffing but when it's all over when you get together like weeks later

611
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:19.560
and talk about that trip like wow you have these amazing memories like it was

612
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:24.300
really cool.
Yeah but at the time it was kind of brutal and arduous.

613
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.980
<v 3>Would you ever do Everest fuck that.</v>

614
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:31.060
Yeah that's that's that's that's like what the suicide basically.

615
00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.950
<v 17>But you have to watch this new it's out right now.
Glad you brought this up.</v>

616
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.840
There's a real sports with Bryant Gumbel that's out right now.
What is.

617
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.260
It's amazing.

618
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:45.110
And it's on the Sherpas those fucking guys who have to do all the work.
Yeah.

619
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:50.010
<v 12>Because they had all these experienced climbers who had summited at Everest like</v>

620
00:36:50.011 --> 00:36:54.420
years and years ago and they were talking about what it used to be like you know

621
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.860
used to carry your own stuff.

622
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.360
<v 17>You had a minimal amount things and now they have these companies that set it up</v>

623
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:05.390
like these luxury tours where these Sherpas they carry like virtually anything

624
00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:09.190
you want like whatever you want whatever you need.

625
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:13.390
So they have all these prepped meals.
They have these tents inside these tents.

626
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:17.280
They have you know gourmet food and cots and all this stuff.

627
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.280
And these Sherpas have to carry all this stuff.

628
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:24.210
And it was sort of highlighting how insanely dangerous it is.

629
00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:27.390
You know like there's only you know a few hundreds sherpas and over the last

630
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:32.391
couple of years 25 of them have died in avalanches and ice falls and the path

631
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:39.510
that they take from base camp up through the mountains like within the first you

632
00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:44.511
know hundred yards or so you're in dangerous territory where there's dead bodies

633
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:47.230
all along the trail that they they can't get them.

634
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:51.210
<v 3>You know they good die on the mountain you stay on your part of the mountain for</v>

635
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.110
that on there there's like I was there's pictures up of the bodies like long

636
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:58.560
line and there's one guy that just looks like he's like slumped over taking a

637
00:37:58.561 --> 00:37:59.220
nap.

638
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.980
And that's what happened like he was he still in his like parka and everything

639
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:05.760
like that but he just kind of you know when you get up that high you get tired

640
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:08.580
so you're like I'm just gonna rest for a second and then you're there for the

641
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:13.110
next 100 200 years including the first guy to ever climb Everest is he.

642
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.460
<v 4>You could see his body.
Yeah look at that guy.
That's the first guy.</v>

643
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.620
That's one of them.
Look at that fucking that's so creepy man.

644
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:24.430
But the first guy to.

645
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.060
That's the guy right there on the lower left the lower left.

646
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.130
That's the first guy to ever climb Everest.
Holy shit.

647
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:33.930
<v 3>Yeah see I feel like that's gonna suck all the fun out of no matter like how</v>

648
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:37.770
great the view is when you're walking up through just corpses you know like it's

649
00:38:37.771 --> 00:38:42.360
gotta suck a little bit of no one out of it looks like someone chewed on his ass

650
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.080
look he's got a hole in his ass like some birds came on fucking.

651
00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.660
<v 4>Yeah but it's he's white.</v>

652
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:53.790
White frozen solid face planted Yes.
Terrifying.
Yeah.

653
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:59.130
I'm pretty sure that is the body of the first guy because that's an iconic

654
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:04.100
photo.
But there's more than one hundred more one hundred dead.

655
00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.720
But how many hundred how many how many dead bodies Jamie finding out Mallory is

656
00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:10.940
the guy's name that died first right.
Isn't that his name.

657
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.320
This is the first guy that ever tried it.
I believe so.

658
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.530
<v 15>He was the first guy that ever did it and then he died on the way down.</v>

659
00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.530
Some poor bastard.

660
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.930
<v 3>I'm just gonna wait for the virtual reality.</v>

661
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:27.310
They'll put a camera up there and meet on goggles and go through it will mean

662
00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:27.900
anything.

663
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:32.900
<v 17>I mean enough but the feeling of that thing is you're you've experienced it like</v>

664
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.610
you like.

665
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.550
As you'd walking every fiber you're being he's going what the fuck are you
doing.

666
00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:41.360
You gotta get out of here man.
Right.
This is dangerous there's no air.

667
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:43.550
It's 18 degrees below zero.

668
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:48.050
You got a mile of walking more than 200 dead bodies.

669
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.490
Oh my God.
Some bodies even used as landmarks for other climbers.

670
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.510
Fucking christ what.

671
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.250
<v 5>Jesus how many people have successfully done it.</v>

672
00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.830
<v 2>A lot.
Oh that was the fucked up thing about this.
This real sports thing.</v>

673
00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:08.150
As this guy was doing it he was talking about how crowded the summit is now when

674
00:40:08.151 --> 00:40:12.020
you go up there like you could barely stand because so many people have
summited.

675
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:15.260
There's so many people there with you and then they showed the video of him

676
00:40:15.261 --> 00:40:19.100
doing it and all the people making on the way up and there was over 100 people

677
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.780
on their way up the mountain.

678
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.020
I mean it was insane it was like there was a line for Disneyland.

679
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.350
I'm not kidding.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Look at that.

680
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.130
Look at all those fucking people.
That's insane.

681
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.260
Look at the legality the line the upper right hand corner.
Look at the law.

682
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.140
Look at that fucking line.

683
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.860
<v 3>Now you can only do it like there's like a one week a year or something right.</v>

684
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.350
Or it since it's a small window isn't it like a month or two.

685
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.530
I'm not sure where the weather is OK to do it.

686
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:50.610
<v 4>I'm not sure but they you know people die all the time doing it.
Yeah.</v>

687
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:55.580
<v 17>And so these companies have sort of capitalized as one of the things they were</v>

688
00:40:55.581 --> 00:41:00.050
highlighting of capitalize on two things one does desire of all these rich

689
00:41:00.051 --> 00:41:04.460
douchebags to you know like I'm an adventurer I'm summit of Everest I conquered

690
00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:07.160
business now I've conquered the highest mountain in the world.

691
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.540
<v 5>People love saying things like that.</v>

692
00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.110
<v 12>I've summited Everest too.
You know John I'm so much more impressive now.</v>

693
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:18.040
But the Sherpas it was really really really really depressing because they a lot

694
00:41:18.561 --> 00:41:22.820
of them come from this one town that's like you know halfway up the mountain and

695
00:41:22.821 --> 00:41:25.820
the town has been essentially the same way you can even call it town.

696
00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.820
It's like a village.
It's a day's walk to buy food.

697
00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:34.180
They have to walk for a day and this family this mother and her son were just

698
00:41:35.601 --> 00:41:40.601
mourning the death of her husband and the kids father and as he was a Sherpa

699
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.260
first day on the job first time doing it you know they needed money to try to

700
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:48.470
get out of this village and they make like 5000 dollars a year.

701
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:54.140
<v 3>And that's the equivalent to like that I'll go for a year out there probably</v>

702
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:58.190
like way more than anybody makes up there doesn't want to help.
Wait wait wait.

703
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.370
I mean so it's like a I'm sure it's like a pretty much.

704
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.560
That's the that's the town business like that's a Sherpa community.
Yeah.

705
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:11.390
<v 16>Well also they're uniquely like genetically qualified for the jobs they're</v>

706
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:14.840
living up there.
They live up there.
They're used to climbing all the time.

707
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:19.670
<v 12>They're insanely fit because their bodies are used to like very low oxygen very</v>

708
00:42:19.671 --> 00:42:24.050
high altitude so they can do things that other people just it's like super

709
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:26.840
difficult for like a person like us that lives here in L.A.

710
00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.240
You know we're at sea level to go up there we'd be like Fuck you.

711
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.570
You know it takes a long time for your body to adapt.

712
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.390
Yeah like I lived in Colorado for a while and we were living at eighty five

713
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:40.010
hundred feet above sea level which is like 3000 feet above Boulder.

714
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.550
And it was just going up stairs was rough.
Yeah.

715
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.270
These fucking people were like What.

716
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:49.430
<v 17>Twenty thousand feet more even I think like the summit is something like twenty</v>

717
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:54.380
nine thousand feet above sea level so it's like essentially like almost as high

718
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:59.300
as a jet like when a jet is flying over Vegas like crazy.

719
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:03.770
<v 7>Yeah it's insane.
MAN There's no air.</v>

720
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.180
<v 3>And they do with tanks too.</v>

721
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.650
That's the other thing they do with oxygen tanks pussies.
We did a show in Aspen.

722
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.820
Like at the Aspen Comedy Festival and there's just like you know there's a

723
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:17.570
sketch show running around other thing but I had to have an oxygen tank

724
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.440
backstage just because like from the amount of like running around like after

725
00:43:21.441 --> 00:43:23.830
the first show is like I can't I can't breathe.
Yeah.

726
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:27.560
I can't imagine being up at Jet level.
I did Aspen.

727
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.210
<v 12>I did the comedy festival the probably same year you were there.</v>

728
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:34.670
You guys you we didn't have any Trevor eyes from the whitest kids you know very

729
00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:35.790
very famous sketch troupe.

730
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:40.610
You probably seen a lot of our stuff online model sketches online but we were

731
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:42.260
doing the Aspen Comedy Festival.

732
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.680
I want to say like two thousand three or something like that was way back in the

733
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:48.650
day and those with I was with Lewis Black.

734
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.580
We're on the show together and they they they had oxygen waiting for him when he

735
00:43:52.581 --> 00:43:56.250
got on stage like they have a tank right there a little mask like you're sucking

736
00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.520
oxygen out of the ghetto you know cause Lewis does that.

737
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.870
<v 7>Well I don't think he's going to get very did you know you got no air.
Yeah.</v>

738
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.170
No fucking air up there.

739
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:09.140
<v 3>Yeah.
Well I mean when we got there they were saying like if you if I was feeling</v>

740
00:44:09.141 --> 00:44:11.540
faint or anything like that we have oxygen for everybody.

741
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.210
I was like that's you know I'm not gonna need the policy.

742
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:18.350
<v 5>And then like Yeah 24 hours then I was like where where's the oxygen tanks.</v>

743
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:19.543
Well they sell it.

744
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.210
<v 4>They sell like tubes you could bring with you like I like it looks like a can of</v>

745
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:26.570
hairspray or something.
Shaving cream it's got to go look a little mask thing.

746
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.690
But up Yeah that's nothing though.

747
00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:34.730
I mean that's that's nothing compared to the altitude that these people are at.

748
00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.320
<v 18>So this is the same kind of thing.</v>

749
00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:41.240
What I did is basically like going to the moon on a bike.

750
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:47.660
Yeah Aspen is a freaky town isn't it.
Yeah.
The sidewalks are heated.

751
00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.460
<v 3>Yeah that was weird.
Like so rich she asked money up there it's so stupid.</v>

752
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.900
Well they have to bus everybody at Lake because there's a McDonald's there and

753
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:57.800
over there and everyone who works there.

754
00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.190
Anyone who works in any of those shops has to be bussed in from like an hour

755
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.140
down the mountain.
Yes they work there.

756
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:06.050
I guess there's no no one who works there lives there.

757
00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.840
<v 4>No.
You could never afford it.
Yeah.
Do they even have apartments.</v>

758
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.140
I mean they must have some right now.

759
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.270
I don't remember seeing any but I remember seeing some stupid fucking expensive

760
00:45:14.271 --> 00:45:19.010
houses up there.
It's a weird like rich people paradise you know.

761
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:24.080
The stores like they have like a Nobu up there like super expensive sushi place

762
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.820
or how are you getting fish up here.
This is the same.

763
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:32.030
Nowhere near the fucking ocean.
Yeah like Aspen is pretty high up there as well.

764
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.740
Eight thousand feet right.
Something like that.

765
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.420
It seems like it it's a goofy airport too.
That's horrible.

766
00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.240
You have to fly like straight up.

767
00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.070
<v 3>Sure.
Yeah.
This year we went.</v>

768
00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:47.510
They don't think planes were coming in because it was snowing and so are they.

769
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.900
They called it off or something like that.
Someone with my ear.

770
00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:53.600
So then so then it was basically I had to drive up the thing and that was

771
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:57.140
terrifying cause then the roads like you know if there's nobody driving on the

772
00:45:57.141 --> 00:45:58.850
road for like five minutes the road's gone.

773
00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.710
<v 4>Yeah you know covered with snow.</v>

774
00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:05.570
Yeah yeah we we landed in Denver and then they bust us up and it took hours.

775
00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:09.740
Yeah and you go on these winding roads in a boat you don't even know his driver.

776
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:14.420
He might be crazy.
Yeah.
How'd you get this job.
Can't talk to you.

777
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:17.840
<v 3>You're the guy driving like you that your life is on the line you're on</v>

778
00:46:17.841 --> 00:46:21.070
mountains and on the way up there's all these buses just on the side of the road

779
00:46:21.071 --> 00:46:24.830
they're just been frozen there because you can't go get them like on the way to

780
00:46:24.831 --> 00:46:28.460
the Aspen Comedy Festival.
They're just littered with frozen comedians and buses.

781
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.780
<v 2>It was a goofy place to do comedy too because like the audiences they either had</v>

782
00:46:32.781 --> 00:46:37.730
to live in Aspen or they had also like fly in for it and then they kind of

783
00:46:37.731 --> 00:46:41.810
realize somewhere on line Oh executives just sort of built this festival so they

784
00:46:41.811 --> 00:46:43.580
could ski the ice party.
Yeah.

785
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.790
So like when I was up there I remember thinking like this is very different from

786
00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:50.390
the Montreal Comedy Festival where the Montreal Comedy Festival it really did

787
00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:52.330
seem like it was all about the shows.

788
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:56.360
The shows were like an afterthought in Aspen and so they just canceled it.

789
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:57.650
Like it doesn't exist anymore.

790
00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:00.860
And then they brought it to Vegas for a while and they were like well this is

791
00:47:00.861 --> 00:47:03.230
even worse.
And then there's no more festival.

792
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:06.830
Yeah I mean HBO does HBO even have a comedy fest.
I don't think they do.

793
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:07.723
I don't think they do either.

794
00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.530
<v 3>Which is a shame because actually I thought was a fun festival.
So right.</v>

795
00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:13.220
But yeah I think I enjoyed it.

796
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:15.690
<v 4>I don't.
I ski now but back then I didn't ski.</v>

797
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.940
So I just was there just kind of having fun go on.

798
00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.540
This is a weird place to have a festival like why would you go festival.

799
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.870
And then I kind of like sort of piece it together like oh you fuckers just like

800
00:47:23.871 --> 00:47:27.940
skiing.
Yeah see all the agents and everyone's what Sundance is.

801
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.060
Yeah yeah yeah.

802
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:33.290
That all the shit with them on their ski and shit like this is fucking bizarre

803
00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.550
like you guys have like this is an afterthought.

804
00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.000
<v 21>Yeah that's that's Hollywood.</v>

805
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:42.330
You know the skiing skiing terrifies me does it.

806
00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.990
<v 3>Yeah that's that's.
I put that up there.</v>

807
00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:48.290
Well I just I know you can hit a tree and then you know.

808
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:52.610
<v 12>Well you know what the thing is man just don't go on like a super tough course</v>

809
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.130
you know.
Yeah that's the thing about skiing.
Like if you're going gonna ski.

810
00:47:56.150 --> 00:48:00.680
Like everybody wants to go like crazy skiing is fun for me when I'm in control

811
00:48:00.681 --> 00:48:05.330
of it like you know they have like black courses and blue like blue is like

812
00:48:05.331 --> 00:48:06.820
fairly easy right.

813
00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.980
<v 4>It's like was like bunny slopes.</v>

814
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:14.510
Yeah I was like well blue is not Bunny Blue's pretty like I was in Park City

815
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:16.010
Utah this year.

816
00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:21.080
And blue is not easy like blue blue gets weird like there's some spots were like

817
00:48:21.081 --> 00:48:25.490
whoa this is and I think green is like maybe blue is harder than green and green

818
00:48:25.491 --> 00:48:29.150
is harder than blue but whatever it is I got to the the one right before Black

819
00:48:29.151 --> 00:48:33.590
and I was like Well this is kind of crazy you kind of figure it out you just

820
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:38.630
gotta take like steep turns left and right to try to regulate your speed yeah.

821
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.880
But while I was doing it there were some motherfuckers that were just experts

822
00:48:41.881 --> 00:48:46.881
that were fall by it and by me just as people that are just speed demons they

823
00:48:47.721 --> 00:48:52.580
just really know how to do it and if they fuck up oh you know some of those guys

824
00:48:52.581 --> 00:48:55.700
are going they probably won't like 50 mile an hour sometime.
Yeah.

825
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.760
And so there's no room for error no.

826
00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.360
Also I was with my kids and the freak males like what are some uncoordinated

827
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.050
dummy plows into one of my kids when they're trying to learn how to ski right.

828
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.550
That's that's a potential danger.

829
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:12.900
<v 3>But when I was a kid the first time I ever went skiing like my I took the little</v>

830
00:49:12.901 --> 00:49:16.280
lessons you know that you take in your first time skiing and then we were there

831
00:49:16.281 --> 00:49:18.620
for like a Christmas thing my family's there for like a week.

832
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:21.500
So like by the second or third day I'm like I want to try the Black Diamond kind

833
00:49:21.501 --> 00:49:23.510
of thing.
And my dad was like Fine.

834
00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:26.810
Like he was just kind of like Yeah he like you know we learn a lesson or

835
00:49:26.811 --> 00:49:27.680
something like Yeah go for it.

836
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:32.510
So I took the lifts up to the thing and nobody said anything like it was

837
00:49:32.511 --> 00:49:35.720
totally.
Everyone's like all right this kid's gonna eat shit.

838
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:41.110
And it took me hours to get down because I couldn't I couldn't you know stay up

839
00:49:41.931 --> 00:49:46.470
for more than you know 50 yards at a time without just falling because it's just

840
00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:50.540
that the slope the pitch was just so much that I just would just keep tumbling.

841
00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:54.790
<v 5>And like crying trying to walk down this black diamond thing what Peter likes</v>

842
00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.490
flying past me.
Oh God did he tell you Dad when you got to the bottom.

843
00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:04.400
Yeah I was like I hate skiing.
Did he do it.

844
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:08.240
What did you learn a lesson you take that black diamond.

845
00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.380
How about a double black diamond.

846
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.360
<v 4>Pussy Yeah.
The moguls are kind of crazy.</v>

847
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:16.490
We we're watching people doing on Black Diamond mogul which are for people who

848
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.020
don't know what skin is like.

849
00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:23.620
It's like massive bumps like the people like the bumps which I I'm real

850
00:50:24.801 --> 00:50:28.850
confused.
I didn't understand why they would like sic air.
Is that what it is.

851
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.930
I think I think it is a kind of you're trying to get air off of the bumps aren't

852
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:34.400
you.
I guess you kind of do.

853
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:37.040
I mean don't jump too high because you kind of go on back and forth.

854
00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:42.320
But we were we were going over it in the lift and we were watching these people

855
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:47.530
just go left and right and just hopping up and bouncing and it's the the actual

856
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:52.721
ground gets like etched in like this criss cross cross hatching pattern from

857
00:50:52.731 --> 00:50:54.740
people just going left and right and left and right.

858
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:59.000
Oh it is crazy fucking bombs like Man that is a whole lot of room for error

859
00:50:59.001 --> 00:50:59.960
there.
Yeah.

860
00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.930
If you don't know what you're doing and you that you just jumped in like you did

861
00:51:02.931 --> 00:51:06.550
just a little too quick you're in the trees.
Yeah.

862
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.230
What's safer school skiing or snowboarding.

863
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.400
<v 3>What's easier to do.
I don't know.</v>

864
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:16.220
Can you go as fast on a snowboard as you can on skis.

865
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.950
I feel like you go faster on skis but I'm talking on my ass.

866
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.590
But you do go faster and go.

867
00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.930
<v 8>Like a hundred miles an hour rule not on a snowboard you go straight down like</v>

868
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:27.590
the downhill alpine skiing and the Olympics go really fast yeah.

869
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.890
Now I can't get that snowboard Aubrey's friends with that guy.

870
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.760
<v 4>Bodie Miller who's Olympic gold medalist I watched him in the Olympics because</v>

871
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:40.040
they were you know the Olympics was happening when Aubry was over at my house we

872
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:45.041
watched it while it was going live and that mother fucker fly.

873
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.390
<v 2>You know when you watch it like Olympic gold medalists going down these things</v>

874
00:51:50.391 --> 00:51:53.270
like the speed is just unfathomable.

875
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:58.340
<v 17>Yeah like you get to think that at some point in time like if if you wipe out</v>

876
00:51:58.341 --> 00:52:02.540
like he just wiped out recently almost severed his leg like he hit something and

877
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:07.280
tore his he almost tore the meat off of his leg and this acts like it's pretty

878
00:52:07.281 --> 00:52:11.360
severe might might even be like a career ending injury like I think he hit a

879
00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:12.230
fence or something.

880
00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:14.940
<v 4>Holy shit.
Yeah.
Fuck I just hit snow.</v>

881
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:17.430
But if that's as fast as it is going the snow is right.

882
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:19.400
I think it's a I think he hit a fence.

883
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.880
My friend Steve was on the U.S. ski team and he's had.

884
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:27.530
I would I want to be conservative when I say this but I think I'm wrong.

885
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.410
I think I'm under shooting.
He's had 28 knee surgeries.

886
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.820
<v 17>He actually had his his knees resurfaced.</v>

887
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:36.860
<v 12>I'll show you a picture you want to freak out.</v>

888
00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:40.400
He doesn't have any cartilage on his knee anymore.
How old is he.

889
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.900
Steve's in his 50s.
I've known him since I was a kid.

890
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:47.240
You ever find this image.

891
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.680
<v 13>It's gonna freak you out but I'll pull it up here.
I'm not fucking</v>

892
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:54.163
What's up.

893
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.960
<v 4>Oh yeah.
You looking up at the screen.
Yeah.
Let me.</v>

894
00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:01.140
The record is actually a hundred fifty six miles down.
Oh my God.

895
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.870
<v 13>Average speed for you.</v>

896
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.410
<v 17>One hundred forty two one hundred is average.</v>

897
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:09.170
<v 22>Yeah.
I never want to be going on in 56 miles an hour.</v>

898
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.380
<v 12>Yeah you're smart.
OK.
Look at this image.</v>

899
00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:16.980
Pull this.
I'll give it to you.

900
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.570
<v 23>I'm off my laptop.
That's my friend's knee.
Look at that.</v>

901
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.920
<v 4>Does the NSG have the medals.
Yeah.</v>

902
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:28.940
So they put medal over the top of his knee.

903
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:33.320
That's got to feel terrible when it gets cold.
He's a bad motherfucker.

904
00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.600
<v 17>He would never complain about anything this guy's an animal.</v>

905
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:38.870
He doesn't give a shit.
He's got fake meniscus.

906
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:40.340
You see that little white thing there.

907
00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:45.880
That's an artificial piece of meniscus that is a pad in between the the ball and

908
00:53:46.281 --> 00:53:46.790
socket.

909
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:51.790
<v 12>Those caps of his knees where you know normally have cartilage cartilage is so</v>

910
00:53:52.341 --> 00:53:54.890
worn away that he has these.

911
00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:59.920
It looks like they're chrome like steel steel caps that cover over the top of

912
00:54:00.621 --> 00:54:01.454
the bone.

913
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.760
And then you know it just sort of rolls steel to steel and that's a knee

914
00:54:07.671 --> 00:54:09.020
replacement he doesn't have that.

915
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:13.130
<v 0>No he just has his knee research his knee replacement is like for people that</v>

916
00:54:13.131 --> 00:54:17.450
have like their ligaments destroy my mama knee replacement should both knees

917
00:54:17.451 --> 00:54:22.310
done at the same time that they'd chop your legs off basically and then they put

918
00:54:22.311 --> 00:54:25.880
robot knees in and then you basically can't walk for a couple months and then

919
00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:28.330
Lord yeah fuck man.

920
00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:31.020
<v 6>And they give you a whole bunch of like it and send you home.</v>

921
00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.760
<v 4>Yeah.
The amazing thing is the hips.</v>

922
00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.770
They saw the top off.

923
00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:42.160
They give you a fake hip a they like it's attached to like a screw that go like

924
00:54:42.591 --> 00:54:47.591
the sore the top here your femur off and this fake hip screws right in there and

925
00:54:48.381 --> 00:54:52.210
then you just start walking around like you're walking around within hours

926
00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.430
really surgery.
Yeah hip replacement.
Yeah.
A guy that was yeah.

927
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:58.250
There's the hip there's the fake hip.

928
00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:02.500
Whichever if you hear that sound that's Travers sucking on his I didn't like

929
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.330
the look at that.
How they do it.

930
00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:11.350
They they they literally saw the top of your bone off and put this fake thing in

931
00:55:12.171 --> 00:55:16.550
there.
This fake ball and socket.
That looks cool.
I will get it from aspirin.

932
00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:19.690
That's hilarious.
The picture that you pull up is from Aspen.

933
00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.510
I mean how many people that are super rich blow their hips out from skiing all

934
00:55:23.511 --> 00:55:26.870
the time.
Probably a lot or just get that done cosmetically kind of be like to be

935
00:55:26.871 --> 00:55:30.740
beautiful yeah kind of cyborg I want to have better hips but you see the top

936
00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.870
which shows how deep it goes into the femur.

937
00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.920
Yeah the screw like up above that Jamie above into the right you see that.
Yeah.

938
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:40.430
There likely that that's what happens.

939
00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:45.540
They they put that fuckin steel thing Graham Hancock had it and he came on the

940
00:55:45.801 --> 00:55:50.540
podcast six weeks later he was walking around like nothing like I had no idea

941
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:54.690
you know he goes Well I had my hip replaced I said when he was six weeks ago you

942
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:55.760
get the fuck out of here.

943
00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:58.460
<v 12>He was walking around like there was nothing wrong.</v>

944
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:59.623
<v 3>Now how long.</v>

945
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:03.260
And it was like with the knee stuff like it last like 20 years or something.

946
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:07.110
And so then you got to do it again like 20 years or so.

947
00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:12.110
How long did it take you to recover where she could walk like a couple months.

948
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:14.690
I think because she did both at once.

949
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:18.770
<v 6>Like most of times you do one and then and then you do another one later but</v>

950
00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:21.550
she's done both.
One she said fuck it let's just suffer one.
Yeah.

951
00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:22.453
She's like a schoolteacher.

952
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.610
So she was like I got this summer open let me just get a book done out of the

953
00:56:25.611 --> 00:56:26.000
way.

954
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.260
<v 5>And my eyes.
Well what was wrong with her knees that she had to do that.</v>

955
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:33.680
<v 22>I think just the cartilage wore down like it wasn't an injury or anything it was</v>

956
00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:35.090
just kind of wear and tear.

957
00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:39.680
<v 4>That's one of the reasons why I don't trust certain doctors because there's</v>

958
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.880
other ways to handle that.

959
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:45.920
First of all they're doing these stem cell injections now on people's knees

960
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.790
where they're regenerating cartilage.
You know obviously that's not an option.

961
00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.830
Once they chop your fucking legs off and put a fake knee in.
Right.

962
00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.190
But doctors love doing that.

963
00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:00.240
<v 17>They love doing surgery you know I had a back injury and I talked to a doctor</v>

964
00:57:00.591 --> 00:57:03.850
and he's like well I've gone for future discs you know there's no other way on

965
00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:06.560
this.
We're gonna chop it out and now I'm fine.

966
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:10.580
I got I sought out a bunch of alternative methods and I did this thing called

967
00:57:10.581 --> 00:57:14.790
Regina King is blood spinning procedure that reduces inflammation the last

968
00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:19.410
stretching and yoga and a lot of strengthening.
It's fine now.
Yeah.

969
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.240
I want to listen to this asshole and I'll have my discs fused right now.

970
00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:27.830
<v 4>And what is I don't know that means like what was it like cut the soft part in</v>

971
00:57:27.831 --> 00:57:31.850
between the bones like your spinal column is a series of bones and in between

972
00:57:31.851 --> 00:57:36.851
those bones or discs which is like sort of like a tough bag of like jelly and

973
00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:42.940
that bag of jelly a lot of times gets herniated where it pokes out and because

974
00:57:43.341 --> 00:57:47.670
of trauma it all starts sticking into the nerve and it causes pain.

975
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:51.170
<v 17>That's where sciatic comes from.
You know that term like sciatica.
Yeah.</v>

976
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.450
People go Oh I have a sciatic issue.

977
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.300
Well you know what that really means there really means you have a bulging disc

978
00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.500
means you're bulging disc is poking into a very specific area of your spinal

979
00:58:00.501 --> 00:58:01.334
column.

980
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:06.370
It's a specific area of your nerves that affects where your your leg is and so

981
00:58:06.431 --> 00:58:08.500
it can cause atrophy in your leg.

982
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:10.570
Which I've I've had friends that have had that issue.

983
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:15.110
<v 4>It can cause like some pretty severe lower back pain and leg pain.</v>

984
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:19.210
It like through your butt down your hamstring all the way down like shooting

985
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:20.044
down your leg.

986
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:26.790
So what they want to do is cut that meat out that soft cushy part and then they

987
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.170
drop it down and screw the bones together.

988
00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.080
So now you have one part of your spine that just doesn't move.

989
00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:39.250
So you can't your brain doesn't articulate the same way.
Yeah.

990
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:45.120
Now they've developed the same guy that invented well not the same guy the same

991
00:58:45.851 --> 00:58:47.560
in the same country other in Germany.

992
00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.440
They they're they're doing things in Europe that they're just not doing in

993
00:58:50.441 --> 00:58:51.850
America yet for whatever reason.

994
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:55.300
And one of the things they're doing is they're replacing the disks with

995
00:58:55.330 --> 00:59:00.280
artificial disks that articulate they move around much like your actual the

996
00:59:00.281 --> 00:59:02.040
actual stuff that's in between your bones do.

997
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:06.520
So instead of fusing it and having this one stiff rigid area which actually is

998
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.840
can be really problematic because it puts pressure additional mechanical

999
00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:13.130
pressure on the above disk and the below disk.

1000
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.990
So oftentimes people wonder having multiple disk fused and you get like one

1001
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.860
stiff fuckin back and you're walking around like this and you are shorter like

1002
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:25.600
it makes you shorter and makes you have all sorts of problems like mechanical

1003
00:59:25.601 --> 00:59:28.300
problems the way you're boss because your body's like going What the fuck is

1004
00:59:28.301 --> 00:59:30.040
going why are we built different now.

1005
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.140
Yeah well how come I can't move my neck anymore.

1006
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.740
Why is it all but it's really common.
People get it done all the time.

1007
00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:40.660
They fuse the disks and you don't always have to know there's there's other ways

1008
00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:41.470
around it.

1009
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:45.580
But a lot of doctors just want to start cutting you just don't want to start

1010
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:46.390
doing.

1011
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:49.780
<v 12>I mean there's very ethical doctors and there's some times where they have to do</v>

1012
00:59:49.781 --> 00:59:52.120
it.
There's sometimes when you like you know you're really fucked up man.

1013
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:56.080
We have to do surgery to open up your nerve pathway because your arms are

1014
00:59:56.081 --> 00:59:59.770
atrophying which is really common with people that have neck injuries there.

1015
00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:03.430
They'll have a one arm they like shrivels up like it's not getting any nerves.

1016
01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:07.990
The nerves aren't firing anymore because they're being impinged by this compare

1017
01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:11.620
this this disk is bulging disk scary scary shit.

1018
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:15.810
<v 4>No but doctors just want to fuck and cut you up man.</v>

1019
01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.230
They make money doing it.
Yeah sure but the doctor arrested recently.

1020
01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:24.910
He was arrested because he was lying to patients and telling them they had

1021
01:00:24.911 --> 01:00:28.240
cancer and giving them chemotherapy for profit.

1022
01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.820
Well yeah that's a fuck man.
Yeah.

1023
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.120
Intentionally misdiagnosing people and then giving them fucking chemotherapy.

1024
01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.340
How did they catch him.
I don't know.

1025
01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:45.330
<v 3>Someone got a second.
A bunch of people got a second opinion kind of maybe right.</v>

1026
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.910
Yeah.
Like what can't what.
You love cancer.

1027
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.660
You're not even fat it doesn't look like that's gonna be a weird turn when

1028
01:00:51.661 --> 01:00:55.230
you're a doctor and you're just like you know you're like I'm going to be a bad

1029
01:00:55.231 --> 01:00:56.880
doctor right.
You know because you can't.

1030
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:59.760
I mean you have to know you're a bad doctor at that point you're like I'm a bad

1031
01:00:59.761 --> 01:01:00.690
guy you know.

1032
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.630
<v 12>Yeah.
Some people have a way of dancing around reality.</v>

1033
01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.810
You know there's a book called Dead doctors don't lie.

1034
01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:11.310
This guy doctor Joel Wallach who's so kind of an eccentric character.

1035
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:16.430
And lastly the premise of a lot of what his book is about is about how few

1036
01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:21.630
doctors really understand nutrition and the understanding the impact of

1037
01:01:21.631 --> 01:01:25.500
nutrition on the body and mineral deficiencies that people have that you would

1038
01:01:25.501 --> 01:01:28.860
treat in like livestock like and in animals.

1039
01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:32.220
A lot of times when the animals develop issues they change the diet and we give

1040
01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:35.790
them minerals and that they don't do that with people.

1041
01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.060
And he found that particularly fascinating because I think he started out as a

1042
01:01:39.061 --> 01:01:39.894
veterinarian.

1043
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:45.230
And one of things he was talking about is how many doctors abuse drugs because

1044
01:01:45.811 --> 01:01:48.870
they can get them like it's really easy for doctors to get drugs.

1045
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:52.740
And you know he details like this one story of this guy who was in the middle of

1046
01:01:52.741 --> 01:01:57.741
an operation stepped away and shot cocaine into his body and had a fucking heart

1047
01:01:58.051 --> 01:01:58.884
attack and died.

1048
01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.920
So he was in like a storage room dead while this person was cut open in the

1049
01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:07.680
middle of surgery and they had to try to go look for him and they found him.

1050
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:14.240
But you would think that you know when you're a doctor you have access to you

1051
01:02:14.361 --> 01:02:16.710
know prescriptions and you can get a hold of some medicine.

1052
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:20.280
And I'm sure it's probably more tightly regulated today than it was in years

1053
01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:20.910
past.

1054
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:24.150
<v 6>Yeah I mean I'd heard that about dentists or dentists.</v>

1055
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:28.890
You know a lot about the dentists have the highest rate of depression for any

1056
01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:33.060
occupation the highest amount of suicide for any occupation.

1057
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:34.300
Yeah.

1058
01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:38.610
And a lot of people think that it's because people hate going to the dentist

1059
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.250
like it's kind of a universal nobody wants to go to dentists.

1060
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.180
They kind of put it off like that they only go when they have to think they're

1061
01:02:45.181 --> 01:02:45.960
in pain.

1062
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.340
So every single person that a dentist sees every day of their professional life

1063
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:54.400
is people who are having the worst day of their year and they're dreading it.

1064
01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:58.230
So there's this energy of everyone coming in and being like I'm not happy to see

1065
01:02:58.231 --> 01:03:01.650
you I'm stressed out.
And that kind of wears on these dentists.

1066
01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:06.120
So they have the highest suicide rate and and I've I've heard that because of

1067
01:03:06.121 --> 01:03:09.780
that there's a lot of abuse of because they have the drugs too but there's less

1068
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:12.900
oversight than at a hospital like it's their own private practice.

1069
01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:14.070
So they just have all this stuff.

1070
01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:17.760
<v 4>So there's a lot of abuse there that totally makes sense.
Yeah.</v>

1071
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:19.680
You try to find a dentist friend.
I've.

1072
01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:25.200
I've always felt that that was the case with cops like cops.

1073
01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.960
I mean cops have very high suicide rates as well.

1074
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:31.320
I think a lot of his PTSD they're always seeing trauma.

1075
01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.470
You see these you know but they're also dealing with people that don't want to

1076
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:35.970
see them like all the time.

1077
01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.920
Yeah most of the time when you you see a cop like all these fucking cop Yeah the

1078
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:44.640
cops are here.
Great you know.
So they just deal with that all the time.

1079
01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.440
<v 21>Yeah plus they have a gun on their belt.</v>

1080
01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:52.050
So you know that's it could be you know there's gonna be more in your mind if

1081
01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:55.470
the gun is constantly there just stick it in your mouth.

1082
01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.990
<v 15>Yeah yeah I'm sure.
Yeah.</v>

1083
01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.570
But they're probably like no one for shooting themselves.

1084
01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.180
Yeah you know it's easy right there.

1085
01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:07.050
You know being a cop is gonna so I don't think anybody is qualified to be a cop.

1086
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.650
I really don't.
Not for more than like an hour you know.
Yeah.

1087
01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:11.640
You're doing a right along.

1088
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:16.500
No no I have another baby fascinating that anyone can do it right.

1089
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.670
It's a pressure.

1090
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.810
I feel like you just call the police station and they're right along.

1091
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:20.970
That would be fascinating.

1092
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.030
What would you if you do that and the cops get killed and you're in the
backseat.

1093
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:31.660
<v 5>What can you say.
I'm just on a ride along.
I'm not a cop.</v>

1094
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.950
I am white and I'm so sorry for that.

1095
01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:39.550
<v 15>I'm not interested.
I don't want to go to war either.</v>

1096
01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:42.280
I won't do a ride along in Afghanistan you know.

1097
01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.940
I have a friend who just got back from was filming a documentary on Afghanistan

1098
01:04:45.941 --> 01:04:50.941
and he was embedded with his troops for over a month and he came back shell

1099
01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:53.200
shock.

1100
01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.033
<v 2>Really.</v>

1101
01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:54.550
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

1102
01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:59.170
He came back just a whacked out and nuts from one month.

1103
01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:00.010
Yeah.

1104
01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:03.430
Well he was a little more than a month on what seemed like maybe six weeks but

1105
01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:07.900
he came back and he was talking about in his his experience when he's a hunter

1106
01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:13.260
and he's like there's there's this really creepy similarity that I didn't didn't

1107
01:05:14.261 --> 01:05:17.980
take into consideration that these guys are hunting people.

1108
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.600
I mean that's really what they're doing.

1109
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:23.110
I mean they're going after like certain you know quote unquote insurgents.

1110
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.280
You know you give him some interesting names like insurgents like we never heard

1111
01:05:27.281 --> 01:05:30.220
insurgents before this war.
When the fuck did you ever hear.

1112
01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.620
Did they say insurgents during say the Viet Cong during Vietnam right.

1113
01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:39.240
You know they said the Nazis and the Japs during World War 2.

1114
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:44.760
Now it's insurgents.
It's like this real way of making things sanitized.

1115
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:49.160
But he said essentially like he realized like right away.

1116
01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:53.260
Like whoa this is like hunting these guys are they're not going after a deer so

1117
01:05:53.261 --> 01:05:55.570
they can eat it.
They're going after people and they're there.

1118
01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:59.710
They knew their behavior patterns.
They knew how to set traps for them.

1119
01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:02.530
They knew where they would be.
They knew how to sneak up on them.

1120
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.710
And they had like all these strategies like very similar to the way you would

1121
01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:07.000
hunt a deer like OK.

1122
01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:11.320
This the path that deer goes into we're going to do is get you know upwind of

1123
01:06:11.321 --> 01:06:14.980
them so that or downwind of them so that the weather where the wind comes to us

1124
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:15.880
they can't smell us.

1125
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:20.080
And like all this crazy shit they were doing to try to avoid being seen and

1126
01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:24.820
really similar to hunting an animal.
That's crazy.
Yeah he was pretty fucked up.

1127
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:30.070
He came back he was a little a little weird and he had an idea in his head what

1128
01:06:30.071 --> 01:06:31.250
it was going to be you know.

1129
01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:36.330
He said Well you know go over there do a documentary sort of like you wanted to

1130
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.570
you know kind of show how difficult it was.
Show the real side of war.

1131
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.180
But you know sort of honor these people that are over there.

1132
01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:47.230
He's kind of kind of a simplistic way of looking at things too you know fighting

1133
01:06:47.231 --> 01:06:47.980
for our freedom.

1134
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.820
<v 4>He's one of those guys that says Shouldn't you go OK.
What does that mean.
Right.</v>

1135
01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.510
And they just don't expand like us like fighting for our freedom.

1136
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.070
I'm exactly sure.
That exactly what they're doing.

1137
01:06:57.130 --> 01:06:59.530
Like they're like people that are telling them to do that.

1138
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:03.540
Are they doing it because they want freedom or is there other ulterior motives

1139
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:05.590
have you looked into this at all.
He didn't you know.

1140
01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:08.920
Yeah it's like very surface American Sniper but.
Exactly.

1141
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.090
<v 12>And but when he came back man he had a fucking completely different idea about</v>

1142
01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:13.180
it.

1143
01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:18.180
He was really he had a very realistic portrayal of war when he came back it was

1144
01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:20.740
a fucking eye opener.

1145
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:23.770
Like he was like This is a cluster fuck.

1146
01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:28.970
It's a scary cluster fuck and it's not good by any stretch of the imagination

1147
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.560
and there's no way to win this fucking thing.
You're over in Afghanistan.

1148
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:36.460
It's all mountains.
There's no towns there's Kabul.
That's one city.

1149
01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:41.080
Everything else is warlords who are trapped up in the mountains and get this the

1150
01:07:41.081 --> 01:07:43.060
way they get the warlords to tell the Taliban.

1151
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:47.470
<v 15>Give them via grow Bhangra tigers at best huh.</v>

1152
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:51.130
Give them guns.
You give them money.
They got guns.
They've got some money.
Yeah.

1153
01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.630
You know they got opium everywhere.

1154
01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:55.420
So yeah faggot is the one thing that's not local.

1155
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:58.210
They need Biafra because a lot of these guys are like in their 60s.

1156
01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:02.890
They got like 30 wives and these bitches are complaining man you can't fuck them

1157
01:08:02.891 --> 01:08:03.690
once a day.

1158
01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:06.900
<v 3>Now once a month it's me a faggot commercial.
Yeah.</v>

1159
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.050
Red white and blue line behind the virus.
What's keeping you safe.

1160
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:14.620
<v 4>It's one of the main ways they get these guys to rat on the Taliban.
That's.</v>

1161
01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.980
Crazy even call the Taliban anymore they call it al-Qaeda.

1162
01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.670
Everyone talks about al-Qaida.
It's ISIS now.

1163
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:25.150
<v 3>It's the same people.
They are their offshoot.
There's their branch of al-Qaeda.</v>

1164
01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:25.660
Yeah.

1165
01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:29.260
<v 4>Is it like you know a Van Halen with David Lee Roth was totally different than</v>

1166
01:08:29.261 --> 01:08:32.170
Van Halen Sammy Hagar.
Yeah.
Is that what ISIS is like.

1167
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:36.220
They're like a totally different offshoot of the original band.

1168
01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.090
Yeah we're getting the band back together.
It's ISIL now.
Right.

1169
01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:42.810
ISIL ISIL.
Yeah.
Was ISIS.

1170
01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:45.340
And now it's aiming for that too.

1171
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.480
<v 9>Yeah they started it ISIS and they changed it.</v>

1172
01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:52.500
<v 5>I saw wasn't 2k wasn't testing it wasn't testing well they rebranded.</v>

1173
01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.520
<v 11>Testing testing is adorable.</v>

1174
01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:01.000
Take a bunch of people when you doing a television show you take a bunch of

1175
01:09:01.001 --> 01:09:02.590
people that don't want to be there.

1176
01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:06.400
They're getting paid and then you play a show for the in Vegas.

1177
01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.170
<v 3>Yeah it's usually is it really usually.</v>

1178
01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.200
I think they go to Vegas and they'll they'll you know this like they'll grab

1179
01:09:13.241 --> 01:09:15.670
people off the street and they'll be like would you like to see some TV shows

1180
01:09:15.671 --> 01:09:19.110
that are about to come out and like you'll get like 20 dollars off TGIF fridays

1181
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.480
kind of thing like that and people like Will because they because Vegas is like

1182
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:26.330
where you get a cross-section of everyone from all across the country right.

1183
01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.520
So they find that you know that you can kind of get people from Iowa you can get

1184
01:09:30.521 --> 01:09:35.080
people from Florida and this one like city so you get like a good cross sheet of

1185
01:09:35.081 --> 01:09:36.430
what people are gonna think of a show.

1186
01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.440
<v 24>That's hilarious.
That's hilarious Vegas.</v>

1187
01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:44.950
That's a weird place to do it man.
And it's also like what.

1188
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.520
<v 11>Who are these people like you can't just get a random group of people and ask</v>

1189
01:09:48.521 --> 01:09:52.420
them about a show especially if this show is specific you know like of a

1190
01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.150
specific genre.
Yeah.

1191
01:09:54.230 --> 01:09:58.850
<v 15>No you just get a bunch of rednecks and you play you know some sophisticated</v>

1192
01:09:58.851 --> 01:10:01.350
show for them.
This is gay.

1193
01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.140
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1194
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:08.020
Well it's people who are on vacation who have run out of things to do and I'll

1195
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.710
just do anything anyone's like OK.

1196
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:14.240
Like if you if you're on vacation at Vegas or something and then somebody was

1197
01:10:14.241 --> 01:10:18.480
like Do you want to watch like five TV shows that you've never heard of.

1198
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:19.730
<v 15>You'd be like No.</v>

1199
01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:23.890
Yeah I just think the idea of testing is ridiculous anyway.

1200
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:26.240
This is the way you test it.
Put it on the air.
Yeah.

1201
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:28.760
You know let creative people come up with it.

1202
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.340
<v 4>Let the comedians are the writers or whoever.
Know what.</v>

1203
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.000
Whatever kind of show it is.
Let them come up with it.

1204
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.220
Put it together and go okay.

1205
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:39.950
We like you let's put this thing on TV and find out you know trust your

1206
01:10:39.951 --> 01:10:42.220
instincts on shit.
You don't have to bring this up.

1207
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:46.650
Well we brought you a random group of people need like a wacky neighbor.
Yeah.

1208
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.380
How come it isn't a wacky knee or a man.

1209
01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:52.160
<v 3>Well what Amazon does now is they just throw them up online.
Yeah.</v>

1210
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:53.430
And they just see money.

1211
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:56.840
Which one's got the most you know which one the people watch more.

1212
01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:59.570
Amazon's got so much goddamn money they can do that.

1213
01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.200
Yeah they've got drone money.
They're sending drones.

1214
01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.110
It delivers never going to land.

1215
01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:07.690
They're never gonna do I think that was like a publicity stunt that's never

1216
01:11:07.691 --> 01:11:09.410
gonna happen.
You don't think so.
No.

1217
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:14.440
Because like if they if Amazon started sending drones there would be guys that

1218
01:11:15.951 --> 01:11:20.270
had eight drones in their garage their drones trying to get back to Amazon's

1219
01:11:20.271 --> 01:11:21.770
headquarters.
People are gonna steal them.

1220
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:24.200
They're gonna like you know shoot them down take your packages too.

1221
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:25.940
Yeah like this power lines.

1222
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:28.640
<v 15>How are they gonna get you know.
Well they can see where they're going.</v>

1223
01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:33.350
People would steal I'd steal on would you steal a drone.
Yeah.

1224
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:36.140
Be funny how rude Amazon drone.

1225
01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:37.003
<v 4>It's not hurting anyone.</v>

1226
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:40.760
P.S. I mean they find it like find a phone they find your iPhone you don't think

1227
01:11:40.761 --> 01:11:42.230
they can find your fucking G.P.S..

1228
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:45.890
Well I'd put it somewhere you know no it wouldn't keep in my house.

1229
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:46.970
<v 0>Mm hmm.</v>

1230
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:51.200
I lived in a town in Charlottesville I lived in Charlottesville Virginia when I

1231
01:11:51.201 --> 01:11:53.210
grew up which is where Dave Matthews was from.

1232
01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.360
And it was like when Dave Matthews was huge.

1233
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:59.510
And so you know he's like a big thing in my town.

1234
01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:04.540
And like one thing that he did to like give back to the community that he wanted

1235
01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:08.200
to do was he did this thing where he got a whole bunch of bicycle.

1236
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:12.610
And he painted them like orange and they put him all around town and they're

1237
01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.440
like these are Dave Matthews is putting all these bikes around and they're free.

1238
01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.010
You can get one ride it to where you need to go.

1239
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:22.940
Leave it there and then you know you know it's this a community bicycle kind of

1240
01:12:22.941 --> 01:12:27.110
thing.
And within like two months they were all gone.
Like all month all gone.

1241
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:31.340
And then for any bikes it was like it was a lot like hundreds of bikes.

1242
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:32.480
They're all gone.

1243
01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.230
And then and then for like years and years like it cause I was like in like

1244
01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:39.340
1920.
Like you know kind of.

1245
01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:43.670
You go to house parties and every house party you go to there every one of the

1246
01:12:43.671 --> 01:12:46.460
Dave Matthews bikes on the lawn.
I gotta go to Dave's bikes.

1247
01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.580
You know you can only have what the people that you have.

1248
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:52.810
And that's why they have the Amazon drones because people are going to steal.

1249
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.850
<v 4>That's funny.
Yeah with that you'd a really steal.</v>

1250
01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.340
That's not something you could borrow Amazon's like I let you borrow their

1251
01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:02.430
drones.
No it's got to come to your house right.
Drop off a package.

1252
01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.550
Yeah but I think it just drops it off then takes off.

1253
01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.200
I don't think it waits for you to release it.

1254
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:09.500
You know I think it just drops it off and then that's it.

1255
01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.560
Well you have your buddy order something then you go up on the roof with a

1256
01:13:12.561 --> 01:13:13.394
baseball bat.

1257
01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:18.740
His wife magically died because you're trying to hit a fucking drone and you

1258
01:13:18.741 --> 01:13:21.230
slipped and fell off your roof broke your neck.

1259
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:25.000
That would be a sad funeral stupid fuck.

1260
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:28.250
He died trying to hit a home run off a drone.

1261
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.430
I don't know what we're gonna be doing in a few years but I have a feeling that

1262
01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.870
within the next couple of decades it's not even gonna involve things being

1263
01:13:38.871 --> 01:13:41.390
delivered.
I think it's going to involve 3D printing.

1264
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:42.770
Yeah I think that's the big one.

1265
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:45.650
<v 6>Like you have a subscription to like Apple or something like that.</v>

1266
01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.800
And then you you know you have their account and then they just make your iPod

1267
01:13:48.801 --> 01:13:50.060
in your living room kind of thing.

1268
01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:50.540
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1269
01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:55.040
You know how like you order like a movie on iTunes you say hey I want to watch

1270
01:13:55.190 --> 01:13:59.660
taken or whatever and just click it and then all the movie will you start

1271
01:13:59.661 --> 01:14:01.370
downloading and then you start watching it.

1272
01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.690
I think that's what it's gonna be like.

1273
01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.490
I want a new pair of Converse chucks right now and then I want to feel build a

1274
01:14:07.491 --> 01:14:12.040
3D print cloth.
That's an interesting question.
Mm hmm.
Possibly.

1275
01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:14.550
Why not.
Right.
Yeah.
Mm hmm.

1276
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:18.500
<v 3>Because it's woven like this the whole idea of cloth as a whole maybe like some</v>

1277
01:14:18.501 --> 01:14:23.501
sort of like what are the sham wow kind of course not that I'm comfortable but

1278
01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:30.130
Blizzard show is a sham me like a sham is a skin of an animal like it's a super

1279
01:14:31.171 --> 01:14:32.820
absorbent skin of an animal.

1280
01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:36.840
<v 4>And I'm sure they have synthetic I think that I think that whatever chamois was</v>

1281
01:14:36.841 --> 01:14:40.530
I don't think it was an animal.
What does that 3D printed for fabrics.

1282
01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:44.400
Well let me just fucking answer a question crazy.
How does that shit work.

1283
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.590
<v 22>You know it's crazy is when I look at this</v>

1284
01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.420
when the 3D printing like takes off is like you know what happened with like

1285
01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:56.760
music and like the entertainment where I've seen people could like BitTorrent

1286
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:57.623
everything.

1287
01:14:57.630 --> 01:15:01.020
<v 6>You're gonna have that happen to every single industry because all of a sudden</v>

1288
01:15:01.021 --> 01:15:02.610
you can you can bit torn an iPhone.

1289
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:05.780
You can put that whole thing like you wouldn't download a car would you be like

1290
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:09.600
well if it was possible.
Yes a lot of people would as you will be able to do it.

1291
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:12.900
<v 4>Yeah that that argument for piracy.</v>

1292
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:16.740
I had Paul Stanley from KISS and who's like really adamant that it's stealing

1293
01:15:16.741 --> 01:15:21.120
it's stealing.
And I was like you know it's piracy.
I'm like making a copy is it.

1294
01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:25.530
Yeah.
It's the original still there.
Like it's not really stealing you know.

1295
01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.420
But he's he's used to being rich and wants to stay rich and he wants to keep

1296
01:15:30.421 --> 01:15:31.770
making millions of dollars.

1297
01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.670
But he was talking about how the industry just disappeared and I was like well

1298
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:40.750
it's kinda but see my argument was like Yeah but the radio always existed and

1299
01:15:42.841 --> 01:15:47.160
you were you always had radio and you play the music on radio and that's what

1300
01:15:47.161 --> 01:15:50.550
made the music famous.
And then people would go out and buy the C.D.

1301
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.870
and you'd make millions and then they would go out and tour and you'd make more

1302
01:15:54.871 --> 01:15:58.080
millions.
Well now one part of that's missing right.

1303
01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:02.520
The buying it is missing and people don't really want to buy it anymore but they

1304
01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:03.490
still want to tour.

1305
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:06.060
<v 0>They'll still buy T-shirts that's always room money came from anywhere it's</v>

1306
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:10.470
T-shirts like you know these people tour and they you know I mean like back in

1307
01:16:10.471 --> 01:16:14.070
like the old Sun Records days and everything they were on the road all the time

1308
01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:16.740
you know putting out these singles and then making all their money touring and

1309
01:16:16.741 --> 01:16:18.180
just kind of go back to that.

1310
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.420
<v 4>Well I think the record companies have forked way more than the artists.</v>

1311
01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.480
Yeah because that's why the record companies are creating these like really

1312
01:16:24.481 --> 01:16:29.481
fucking strange deals especially like with young artists they get talked into

1313
01:16:30.511 --> 01:16:34.620
these really creepy deals where you know they get locked up for X amount of

1314
01:16:34.621 --> 01:16:39.621
years and they're really like strange contracts like that established artists

1315
01:16:41.371 --> 01:16:44.610
would never agree to and then you have to try to get out of them once you get to

1316
01:16:44.611 --> 01:16:48.360
a certain point but they're just trying to figure out a way to lock down these

1317
01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:51.690
artists and try to suck money out of them.
Where.

1318
01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:55.230
I mean what do they have to offer these days.
They don't really have anything.

1319
01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:58.290
It used to be like you needed a record company to release your record and they

1320
01:16:58.291 --> 01:17:01.440
get you on the radio.
But now the radio doesn't mean shit.

1321
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:05.550
<v 6>Now everyone just wants to get in like a TV show or like in a commercial now.</v>

1322
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.670
I mean that's like the song that's payday.
Yeah.

1323
01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:12.420
It's just getting like your song played at the end of some MTV show or getting

1324
01:17:12.421 --> 01:17:15.810
like your song played in the background of a commercial that's like the the new.

1325
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.950
<v 4>Yeah.
Or just getting it like okay.</v>

1326
01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:23.310
Like how about that Gangnam Style guy like that guys in a weird spot because

1327
01:17:23.311 --> 01:17:26.840
everybody knows you ain't gonna make more in one of those dude.

1328
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.980
I think you're right.

1329
01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:31.860
He got that one song where no one knows what the fuck you're singing.

1330
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:36.410
Yeah and people go is kind of catchy.
And how many of those can you make man.

1331
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:38.450
And do people want to go see you live.

1332
01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.270
<v 3>Well he's a big guy in Korea.</v>

1333
01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:46.340
Yeah yeah he's a he's a B he was a big he was a star before that over there and

1334
01:17:46.831 --> 01:17:48.800
this was just I think went international.

1335
01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:52.520
But the size how big that song was he didn't need to have another one.

1336
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:55.370
You think so.
I think he'll be able to coast off that for a while.

1337
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:59.400
You think how much money you think they make.
Jamie's like he's fine.

1338
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:03.230
Plus that.
I mean there was on that was on so many commercials too.

1339
01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.650
And then like ten years from now there'll be a nostalgia for it.
It'll come back.

1340
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:10.950
Really.
Oh like Rick Astley.
Yeah.
Rock Roll yeah yeah.

1341
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:14.720
<v 20>Oh man I don't know.
E You gotta think that</v>

1342
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:18.720
like for most artists that's not going to happen right.

1343
01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:21.540
<v 15>Maybe for him but for most artists.
They got a hit.</v>

1344
01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:25.410
You've got a few songs that people are into and then you're hoping they can come

1345
01:18:25.411 --> 01:18:27.210
see you live.
Yeah that's like the big thing.

1346
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:32.190
Yeah but with Paul Stanley he was just saying that you used to be able to make a

1347
01:18:32.191 --> 01:18:36.120
lot of money off the sales of the records and now it doesn't exist anymore

1348
01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:40.500
because of illegal downloads but they must be making some money right off of.

1349
01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.680
<v 21>I tunes and shit yeah I think I mean I'm sure it's it was better.</v>

1350
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:50.300
Yeah for the few people that like you know.

1351
01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.910
You know we're in the Paul Stanley level you know.

1352
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:57.420
But I don't know.

1353
01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:01.470
<v 3>That's flipside of that is that there's a lot of smaller bands that can you know</v>

1354
01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:02.620
get heard now.

1355
01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:06.570
Like you know the Internet's been great for small music I mean you have a

1356
01:19:06.571 --> 01:19:08.800
platform I can I guess know I don't know.

1357
01:19:09.330 --> 01:19:13.020
<v 10>I think it broke it broke up the monopoly broke up that industry which is a</v>

1358
01:19:13.021 --> 01:19:16.860
really creepy industry guy dude.
All right I'm gonna get that robot.

1359
01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:18.500
Dave he's gonna suck.
Can't help it.

1360
01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.370
<v 8>You watch that movie artifact about 30 seconds to mars.</v>

1361
01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:24.210
What is the label battle.

1362
01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:28.950
<v 4>Oh that's the Jared Leto thing as I say let go let a little.</v>

1363
01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.950
<v 8>It's it's an insane movie talking exactly about why you're talking about the</v>

1364
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:36.180
really famous band that went on tour sold out everything and they came back in

1365
01:19:36.181 --> 01:19:40.140
the record label said they stole a million dollars.
No.
What the fuck.

1366
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:41.383
How they.

1367
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:45.600
It's a whole three year battle and the documentary shows everything lawyer
talks.

1368
01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:48.930
Wow.
And meanwhile no one's talking about that documentary.

1369
01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.330
It's not like yet it hasn't.

1370
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:54.600
I mean they still ended up at the end of the movie and spoiler alert.
Right.

1371
01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:57.900
They're still making music right now.
This is a couple of years ago.

1372
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.823
The movie was made.

1373
01:19:59.310 --> 01:20:03.720
<v 4>Did you ever see the piece that Courtney Love wrote on a music business that</v>

1374
01:20:03.721 --> 01:20:05.430
sort of highlights how crazy it is.

1375
01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:09.630
Like how much money goes to the record company versus how much goes to the

1376
01:20:09.631 --> 01:20:09.960
artist.

1377
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:14.430
But again that was before the internet kind of like took the legs out from under

1378
01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:18.210
that business.
Yeah.
Napster for comics it's giant.

1379
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:21.490
We never made any money off of seeds anyway.
I mean you make a little bit.

1380
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:25.770
But the real money was always in doing clubs and doing theatres and stuff like

1381
01:20:25.771 --> 01:20:26.010
that.

1382
01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:30.420
So the Internet is just awesome promotion for that like way better than anything

1383
01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:32.460
else before way better than radio.

1384
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:35.940
<v 12>Way better than putting out a C.D..
There is nothing better than the internet.</v>

1385
01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:40.200
<v 6>I mean guys I mean that blows my mind.
I try to think about like what you know.</v>

1386
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:43.800
You have a mailing list you know you know at the end of a show you put out a pad

1387
01:20:43.801 --> 01:20:47.130
of paper and you know like write down you know I'll send out a mailing list

1388
01:20:47.131 --> 01:20:47.830
every year.

1389
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:52.830
Let you know when I was a kid I'd go to the record store and just check to see

1390
01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:59.541
if the bands that I like had new albums out because there was no way to know

1391
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:03.840
like you know you would just go and sometimes you know you'd check multiple

1392
01:21:03.841 --> 01:21:07.010
times a year and then you'd like oh there's a new there's no way to tell.

1393
01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:11.180
<v 10>That's right.
Yeah.
You know where they would have like a poster up.
Yeah.</v>

1394
01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:12.870
Coming September 3rd.

1395
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:16.860
<v 4>The new Bon Jovi.
Did you hear.</v>

1396
01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.760
You know and then the radio would have to tell you this information was really

1397
01:21:20.761 --> 01:21:24.010
hard to get back then man.
It's really hard to get anything you know yet.

1398
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:26.790
You got like I remember I was in the KISS Army.

1399
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:30.060
You know you get like a Kiss Kiss fan thing in the mail.

1400
01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:33.780
When I was a kid and you'd get like this but you know I only remember them

1401
01:21:33.781 --> 01:21:37.310
saying tour dates just tell you about the band you know.

1402
01:21:37.530 --> 01:21:41.490
You know you get this like real superficial version of who they are.

1403
01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.450
So so much different now so much different.

1404
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:50.040
You can't be like this mysterious hidden person in a castle.

1405
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:54.750
Marilyn Manson style top of the hill cowlick.
They know you now man.

1406
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.520
If they don't know you they're not going to.
It's just to hold animals.

1407
01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:01.780
Different people are different.
Like I think human beings.

1408
01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:06.480
I think we're so used to it.
It's hard for us to really conceptualize.

1409
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:09.960
It's hard for us to really kind of appreciate how much different just

1410
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:14.640
interacting with human beings is today.
In 2015 as opposed to like 1985.

1411
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:18.650
<v 0>Well I I was we were shooting Whitest Kids.</v>

1412
01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:24.860
When the iPhone came out and we were in production you know and I remember like

1413
01:22:26.611 --> 01:22:30.330
me and a guy Zach from the troop would direct everything.

1414
01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:34.160
So I remember directing you know we like mid season.

1415
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.490
And the day before the iPhone came out you know everyone would kind of be

1416
01:22:38.491 --> 01:22:42.470
talking you know in between takes like everyone would be on set like you know

1417
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:46.080
P.A.
is like you know like a caution department we would kind of be like joking

1418
01:22:46.081 --> 01:22:47.070
around and stuff like that.

1419
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:51.010
And then the iPhone came out at midnight and like you know it was a huge thing.

1420
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:52.080
Everybody would wait in line.

1421
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:56.340
<v 3>A lot of people got it and the next day everybody was just staring at the iPhone</v>

1422
01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.970
and it was this thing where I was like I was crazy because I bought one too and

1423
01:22:59.971 --> 01:23:02.660
I was like It's just crazy with this thing can do and it's everybody sort of

1424
01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:05.640
fascinated with what this can do but we never went back.

1425
01:23:05.670 --> 01:23:07.290
It was it never went back.

1426
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.500
I thought it was just gonna be like a couple days where everyone's just you know

1427
01:23:10.501 --> 01:23:13.260
staring at this thing and it was like that was the dividing point.

1428
01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.400
It changed after that.

1429
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:18.600
Now you know just interacting interacting with people is just completely

1430
01:23:18.601 --> 01:23:19.200
different.

1431
01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:23.040
<v 4>Well then the social media really took off because you took it everywhere with</v>

1432
01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:23.490
you.

1433
01:23:23.490 --> 01:23:28.380
It wasn't like well when I get home then I will check my social media.

1434
01:23:28.530 --> 01:23:30.240
I'll check my MySpace page or whatever.

1435
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:34.350
No I wasn't that it was like you're on the road you're everywhere you go you're

1436
01:23:34.351 --> 01:23:37.890
eating dinner you know you're in your car at stoplights you're looking at your

1437
01:23:37.891 --> 01:23:39.000
your Twitter feed.

1438
01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.120
<v 17>Yeah you know you see people that are just glued to it.</v>

1439
01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:43.320
They can't have a conversation.

1440
01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:46.230
I have some people that come on the podcast and they're we're in the middle of

1441
01:23:46.231 --> 01:23:50.330
conversations and then you start.
Yeah yeah.
Oh yeah.

1442
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.520
<v 7>They're not even listening.</v>

1443
01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:55.290
They don't even paying attention that I can sound like they can't help it man.

1444
01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.500
<v 17>They can't help it.
There's this weird like poll it just did that.</v>

1445
01:23:59.570 --> 01:24:03.810
Maybe there's some interesting and for most of time there's not most of time

1446
01:24:03.811 --> 01:24:06.030
it's not.
It's like you're searching for a present.

1447
01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:09.510
Like maybe there's one more Christmas present or that tree is gonna find that

1448
01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:11.730
present but it's not there.

1449
01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:17.130
It's very rare that you like your obsession pays off when you're like staring at

1450
01:24:17.131 --> 01:24:17.950
social media.

1451
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:21.390
<v 3>Yeah it's very rare that it is worth the look we're just looking to see what</v>

1452
01:24:21.391 --> 01:24:25.320
your friends are doing or thinking but like you don't care what your friends are

1453
01:24:25.321 --> 01:24:28.540
doing or thinking like it's cool to call you.
Yeah.

1454
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.780
<v 4>You know hey man something fucking crazy happened.</v>

1455
01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.840
<v 6>Yeah but now it's like you're constantly looking for more data and I think the</v>

1456
01:24:36.121 --> 01:24:40.980
newness of it is like really attracted attractive to us in a way that we have a

1457
01:24:40.981 --> 01:24:44.640
really hard time controlling you know or it's just the beginning of its

1458
01:24:44.641 --> 01:24:48.390
metamorphosis it's the beginning of evolution like to us becoming like a

1459
01:24:48.391 --> 01:24:53.391
synthetic kind of non carbon based you know silicone based being kind of thing

1460
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:57.660
and you know then we put nanobots in ourselves and you know it's just the first

1461
01:24:57.661 --> 01:25:00.040
step that you know of of evolving.

1462
01:25:00.210 --> 01:25:02.940
<v 4>Yeah I think so.
I think that's most definitely what it is.</v>

1463
01:25:02.970 --> 01:25:04.650
There was a article recently.

1464
01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:09.030
I think yesterday about this guy was dying of cancer leukemia I believe and

1465
01:25:09.031 --> 01:25:12.000
they're going he's gonna be the first person they inject nanobots into.

1466
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:15.600
Well yeah it's as fuck and it's it's begun.

1467
01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:18.840
These tiny little robots try to like without it he's going to die.

1468
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:20.430
So let's give it a shot.

1469
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:23.670
<v 3>And I've heard that's supposed to be the norm within like 15 years.</v>

1470
01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:28.380
<v 11>What if this dude becomes Dr. Manhattan just like all figures out everything</v>

1471
01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:32.170
starts glowing blue he sees Dick everywhere he goes yeah.

1472
01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:39.180
I think I think human beings will definitely have some sort of a weird symbiotic

1473
01:25:39.181 --> 01:25:43.200
relationship with computers in within the next like decade though they'll be

1474
01:25:43.201 --> 01:25:48.201
implants that you'll be able to get data directly downloaded into your brain.

1475
01:25:48.930 --> 01:25:51.300
I mean I think it's it's only a matter of time before they do that.

1476
01:25:51.450 --> 01:25:54.660
<v 6>Well they're saying I think I was reading some of this in the nanobots thing is</v>

1477
01:25:54.661 --> 01:25:57.770
gonna be commonplace within like 15 years where you know you inject them and

1478
01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:02.470
deal and then just constantly is doing read outs like oh your platelets are low

1479
01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:06.010
Oh your white blood cells are well like and it's just telling like your doctor

1480
01:26:06.011 --> 01:26:07.600
so you can you know keep up with everything.

1481
01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:11.440
<v 11>Kurzweil believes within the next few decades you're gonna have nanobots that</v>

1482
01:26:11.441 --> 01:26:14.260
are going to allow you to hold your breath for over an hour.

1483
01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:19.740
They're going to give you these nanobots that somehow or another do something

1484
01:26:19.781 --> 01:26:24.781
with maybe artificial blood cells or some like that where they can hold and

1485
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:28.450
carry oxygen through your system so well that you'll be able to take a deep

1486
01:26:28.451 --> 01:26:31.420
breath jump to the bottom the pool and sit there for an hour like a regular

1487
01:26:31.421 --> 01:26:34.020
person that's fucking fucking crazy.

1488
01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:36.490
No we're worrying about a drowning for your friend.

1489
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:41.260
<v 4>Yeah dummy holds breath hold your breath then walk back just get on a ground on</v>

1490
01:26:41.261 --> 01:26:44.870
the bottom of the ocean and walk home.
There's that's awesome.

1491
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:49.870
Well there's already experiments where they've transmitted words from one person

1492
01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:53.470
to another person in their brain through the Internet.
Really.
Yeah yeah.

1493
01:26:53.650 --> 01:26:56.580
They transmitted a word from one part.

1494
01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:00.460
Jamie pull it up because it's kind of difficult to describe.

1495
01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:05.230
Exactly what they did but somehow or another like say if you're thinking

1496
01:27:05.710 --> 01:27:10.710
Christmas tree you know you you actually can send that word to me through the

1497
01:27:12.101 --> 01:27:15.730
Internet and somehow or another I receive it.
I'm not sure I understand.
Yeah.

1498
01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.150
Is it is it is it visualized.
It's like look at the signs.

1499
01:27:19.210 --> 01:27:24.210
Scientists transmit thoughts from one brain to another international team of

1500
01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:28.000
scientists has succeeded in transmitting the thoughts of one individual into the

1501
01:27:28.001 --> 01:27:30.730
brain of a second person located thousands of miles away.

1502
01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:34.690
Combining some of the latest technological marvels with the long arm of the

1503
01:27:34.691 --> 01:27:37.900
Internet is thought to be the first time the two brains have communicated with

1504
01:27:37.901 --> 01:27:42.250
each other directly over long distance without the sender having to utter a

1505
01:27:42.251 --> 01:27:47.251
single word to greetings Oh la and Chow Oh I can't even do it in America using

1506
01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:55.360
English requires made a historic trip from India to France where oh excuse me

1507
01:27:56.770 --> 01:28:01.770
France where they were received and spoken by a researcher who was blindfolded

1508
01:28:01.811 --> 01:28:03.940
and equipped with earplugs.
Wow.

1509
01:28:04.690 --> 01:28:09.670
<v 10>Scientists want to ensure that the receiver knew what his colleague 5000 miles</v>

1510
01:28:09.671 --> 01:28:13.600
away was thinking because of the brain to brain transmission not because of some

1511
01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.430
other cue.
That's amazing.

1512
01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:21.100
So somehow or another those two words were transmitted and they knew what those

1513
01:28:21.101 --> 01:28:25.950
two words were thousands of miles.
I don't get it man.
But it sounds good right.

1514
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:30.990
But like it you told me 30 years ago that there were gonna be able to send a

1515
01:28:31.271 --> 01:28:33.790
video through the mail.
I believe.
What are you even talking about.

1516
01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:35.680
Or through the air on a phone.
Yeah.

1517
01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.890
<v 18>Like what.
What's a video you're going to feel a sense of.</v>

1518
01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.460
A video that you could if you're watching it on what you got on TV.

1519
01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:43.803
Wait a minute hold on.

1520
01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:48.190
So to a TV show is gonna be on what you're gonna hold on to something like in

1521
01:28:48.191 --> 01:28:48.880
Star Trek.

1522
01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.030
<v 2>They didn't even have fucking.</v>

1523
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:53.200
If you look at those stupid phones that they had they didn't have buttons on

1524
01:28:53.201 --> 01:28:55.210
them.
They were just like Kirk out like the.

1525
01:28:55.630 --> 01:29:00.270
The space ship had to know that they were calling Kirk but Kirk called a

1526
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:03.040
spaceship and that's it.
He couldn't call his girlfriend.

1527
01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:04.760
He couldn't get his a man.

1528
01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.990
You guys won't eat like there wasn't any of that going on.

1529
01:29:07.190 --> 01:29:09.390
<v 10>Like they didn't even think that would be possible.
Yeah.</v>

1530
01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:14.350
They thought that they'd be able to bring you to break your body down until like

1531
01:29:14.351 --> 01:29:19.180
subatomic particles and reconstruct you on the surface of an alien planet like

1532
01:29:19.181 --> 01:29:20.080
that makes sense.

1533
01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:25.110
But you got a walkie talkie or some the USA Kirk out you know Kirk out here you

1534
01:29:25.271 --> 01:29:29.910
couldn't even could even see call ended on your phone.
Yeah.

1535
01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:34.660
We don't even have any idea what they're gonna be able to figure out within the

1536
01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:35.440
next few years.

1537
01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:39.940
Like the concept of transmitting a word through the Internet and the US

1538
01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:41.860
understanding what that word is to you and I.

1539
01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:43.600
It's like what are you talking about.

1540
01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.710
But 10 20 years from now they may be like of course you do that.

1541
01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:48.573
That's what you do.

1542
01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:53.020
<v 3>I send words to each other it be terrible if like it ends up being like a</v>

1543
01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:56.680
Twitter thing where it's just like you know everybody's stupid

1544
01:29:58.510 --> 01:30:02.020
like went to the mall.
Is this constantly rattling around your brain.

1545
01:30:02.770 --> 01:30:04.330
<v 21>Do you think that Twitter is making people stupid.</v>

1546
01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:08.710
Now I get it some people stupid right.
I think it's just I mean

1547
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:11.450
I don't think it makes people stupid.

1548
01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.490
<v 4>I think it just like you know it's just more distractions.
Yeah.</v>

1549
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.110
Well you know what is the weirdest thing to me.

1550
01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:22.790
There's some people that use Twitter and it seems like everything they're

1551
01:30:22.791 --> 01:30:27.770
posting there they're like manipulating what they think or what they're saying

1552
01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:31.460
they're manipulating it in order to get a positive reaction from people.

1553
01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.040
You know I almost feel like they're not really communicating.

1554
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:37.880
They're like selling themselves.
Yeah you know they're like faking it.

1555
01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:42.410
<v 3>I always feel that like when like a celebrity dies like and then everybody posts</v>

1556
01:30:42.411 --> 01:30:45.590
like oh my god this guy meant this to me or this to me this to me this to me

1557
01:30:45.591 --> 01:30:46.890
this to me and like I get it.

1558
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:51.910
You know but like it always seems to be about themselves kind of in a weird way

1559
01:30:53.331 --> 01:30:57.440
where it's like this is how much this affected my life and exactly or like any

1560
01:30:57.441 --> 01:30:59.090
sort of issue that people like.

1561
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.500
There's like a bandwagon of everybody jumping on like we got to find Kony.

1562
01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:07.970
You know we got to find county and you know like that and this is your entire

1563
01:31:07.971 --> 01:31:11.900
timeline.
It's just everybody talking about Kony.
I mean you watched the video.

1564
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:16.770
<v 5>And that went away immediately because the guy jerked off in public.
That's it.</v>

1565
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.270
Yeah.

1566
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:21.050
<v 17>That's all I got to do is run around his underwear in San Diego beaten off in a</v>

1567
01:31:21.051 --> 01:31:24.950
street losing his mind and they were like This is meanwhile this is just the

1568
01:31:24.951 --> 01:31:28.100
messenger the guy Kony was still a piece of shit.

1569
01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:33.040
Still a bad guy in Africa murdering people and shit and everybody's like Yeah

1570
01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.180
but that guy was beaten off and on to be a part of this.

1571
01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:39.980
<v 3>Well the weird thing the weird thing about the Kony thing for me was like when.</v>

1572
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:41.360
Because it came out of nowhere.

1573
01:31:41.670 --> 01:31:45.380
It was just everybody being like Kony going to go any like you know and and then

1574
01:31:45.381 --> 01:31:47.210
you're like OK well that seems like an asshole.

1575
01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:51.710
You know child army never good you know and then you look in and you like so

1576
01:31:51.711 --> 01:31:52.240
what are you doing.

1577
01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.670
They're like Well we want to get the United States involved and send troops over

1578
01:31:55.671 --> 01:31:58.130
there and like Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on.

1579
01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.910
<v 18>You know a couple of countries are already doing that.</v>

1580
01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:06.590
Where do we need to be adding the thing to get after one guy because he fits on

1581
01:32:06.591 --> 01:32:09.290
a bumper sticker.
Yeah.
Come on in 2012.

1582
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:12.500
And I'm pretty sure if we go over there we're not going to grab all those kids

1583
01:32:12.501 --> 01:32:13.490
and put them in the school.

1584
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:16.790
I think we're going to probably you know kill all his kids.

1585
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:19.850
You know that's kind of what we do.
We don't shoot at us.

1586
01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.860
<v 4>We're gonna shoot back.
We're super sorry.</v>

1587
01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.550
But we had to save those kids by shoot them.
Yeah.

1588
01:32:24.630 --> 01:32:27.410
The Kony 2012 and the ice bucket challenge.

1589
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:30.230
They they both had that thing in common where I felt like there was an

1590
01:32:30.231 --> 01:32:33.860
insincerity to the message that people were sending out through social media

1591
01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.280
like they were sending it out to get social media brownie points.

1592
01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.180
He wanted everyone to know that their super conscious and super progressive.

1593
01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:43.880
And there's that that's one of the things that drives me nuts.

1594
01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:45.980
There's certain Twitter pages that I'll visit.

1595
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:50.090
One of them recently blocked me because I've mocked him on on the podcast.

1596
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:51.920
Hilarious by the way.

1597
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:54.890
Dummy don't you know that all I have to do is log out and I could still see your

1598
01:32:54.891 --> 01:32:57.280
Twitter page you dipshit.
It's public.

1599
01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:00.290
Just type it into a browser and read all your stupidity.

1600
01:33:00.710 --> 01:33:05.710
<v 2>But this guy's entire Twitter page is like telling people how they should be</v>

1601
01:33:07.701 --> 01:33:11.840
living and telling people what's wrong with the way other people are living and

1602
01:33:11.841 --> 01:33:15.740
what's wrong with the way other people are thinking and what's so bad about

1603
01:33:15.741 --> 01:33:17.690
certain social issues.
It's hilarious.

1604
01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:20.450
Like don't you have sandwiches that you like.

1605
01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:23.570
Isn't there like a movie you enjoyed.
Did you have a great time.

1606
01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:25.020
Did you have a revelation today.

1607
01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.900
Did you feel bad about something maybe you thought.
Did you have any.

1608
01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:31.400
Is there any unique insight as to you as a human being or is your whole thing

1609
01:33:31.401 --> 01:33:33.830
like just lessons to other people.

1610
01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:37.220
Yeah like everybody needs to learn and this is what's wrong with this and this

1611
01:33:37.221 --> 01:33:41.180
is what's wrong with that and it's all like that those type of people are almost

1612
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:46.270
all either like extreme right wing like like real like heavy duty Republicans

1613
01:33:48.991 --> 01:33:50.750
like there's one dumb ass that I go to.

1614
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:55.700
<v 17>He but he's a young earth Christian guy and you know it's everything in his</v>

1615
01:33:55.850 --> 01:34:00.420
entire timeline is anti-Obama anti liberal anti-gay.

1616
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:02.550
So is this anti dinosaur.

1617
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:07.250
And then this other guy go to the extreme left wing and everything that he does

1618
01:34:07.251 --> 01:34:12.251
is like super progressive super like really like Uber left wing Uber socially

1619
01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:15.950
conscious to the point where I'm not buying it.

1620
01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:18.950
You sound you know you're not even a human right.

1621
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:22.090
<v 3>You're like a sounding board you've made across this issue.
Yeah.</v>

1622
01:34:22.130 --> 01:34:26.210
You made activism your personality.
Exactly.
That's a great way to put it.

1623
01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.040
<v 4>You've made activism your personal.
It's a great way to put it.</v>

1624
01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:33.190
And it's not really activism.
It's just talking.
Yeah.

1625
01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:36.230
Just yapping and bitching about shit.
Yeah.

1626
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:41.410
You know either bitching about shit or proclaiming the right way to be and it's

1627
01:34:41.961 --> 01:34:45.260
always like you know pro transgender pro gay pro.

1628
01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:47.100
It's like I can I can guess.

1629
01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:49.410
Like super easy what your position is gonna be on anything.

1630
01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:54.440
It's gonna be like super uber left wing like down the pipe every time no nuance

1631
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:58.320
no subtlety to it.

1632
01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:02.840
Like you're going to subscribe to whatever the agenda is or subscribe to

1633
01:35:02.841 --> 01:35:05.700
wherever the ideology you know fits.

1634
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:10.810
<v 3>There's a fetish ization of being outraged or being offended you know for a lot</v>

1635
01:35:14.251 --> 01:35:16.850
of like on both sides of the aisle.

1636
01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:21.980
<v 21>The thing where you've you know you you mean there's genuine outrage and there's</v>

1637
01:35:22.051 --> 01:35:24.630
genuine being offended at things that there should be.

1638
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:27.780
You know you should be offended by it but then there's some of these people that

1639
01:35:27.781 --> 01:35:31.180
you see it's this seems like well you're kind of reaching direct creation to be

1640
01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:31.890
offended.

1641
01:35:31.890 --> 01:35:34.380
<v 4>Yeah yeah they're looking for it.</v>

1642
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:38.580
Yeah there is a lot of reaching but there's also I think a lot of it is people

1643
01:35:38.581 --> 01:35:43.581
just getting used to this new ability to communicate and they're finding that I

1644
01:35:43.651 --> 01:35:47.370
think for some of these people some of these people are severely socially

1645
01:35:47.371 --> 01:35:52.371
retarded and they're finding that they can get love and support when they say

1646
01:35:52.891 --> 01:35:54.780
things that other folks who agree with.

1647
01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:58.560
So then that's all they say they're all they're doing is like saying things they

1648
01:35:58.561 --> 01:35:59.670
think other people agree with.

1649
01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.120
Yeah and they'll just sound these things out and say them.

1650
01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:07.260
And that's like most of it is like da you know like there's a lot of stuff like

1651
01:36:07.290 --> 01:36:11.970
you know like we should be we should end sexual discrimination of course.

1652
01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:13.620
Yeah like who the fuck doesn't he.

1653
01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:17.460
Is that really going to end sexual discrimination by writing about it on
Twitter.

1654
01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.520
<v 21>If there was a vote yeah like it's gonna be 99 percent of people that say you</v>

1655
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:25.810
check yes we should end sexual discrimination yes.

1656
01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:30.930
<v 4>You know there's a recent study that showed that most people that work out and</v>

1657
01:36:30.931 --> 01:36:33.240
exercise he's backing up sucking on that robot.

1658
01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:38.310
<v 7>Here here here at home
I'm gonna get you one of these dude.</v>

1659
01:36:38.670 --> 01:36:42.580
Please don't make any sound bro you just get a fucking cut your hands up while

1660
01:36:42.581 --> 01:36:43.414
you carry it.

1661
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:46.080
<v 4>So he's sharp edges that is sharp edges.</v>

1662
01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:50.030
You know you could use this for if you a particularly tough cut of meat roll

1663
01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:54.330
this fucker all over the meat and it would really soften it up nicely

1664
01:36:55.110 --> 01:36:57.810
tenderizer.
Yeah it's a meat tenderizer.
I mean it really is.

1665
01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:01.680
If you didn't have a meat tenderizer in your house you could absolutely use this

1666
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:07.070
giant hunk of copper fucking weight often found.

1667
01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:12.160
<v 23>Yeah but I think oh shit I put it in the wrong spot.</v>

1668
01:37:12.210 --> 01:37:15.360
I put it put it heads down.

1669
01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:20.450
<v 4>Heads up it's a piece of shit exercise I go over Senate House fire with that you</v>

1670
01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:25.770
left it on up overnight and then the whole copper heats up and just burns

1671
01:37:25.771 --> 01:37:28.320
through your table you know it happened it would make weird noises and then your

1672
01:37:28.321 --> 01:37:31.800
cat would come over and your cat would touch it with his paw and then you would

1673
01:37:31.801 --> 01:37:35.130
burst into flames and then he would jump on the couch freaking out trying to

1674
01:37:35.190 --> 01:37:38.340
enter the couch you go up and then your fucking whole house is on the phone it's

1675
01:37:38.341 --> 01:37:40.130
a Ben Stiller movie it's just like two minutes.

1676
01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:44.880
Yeah it was Morgan Adam Sandler movie.
No more Ben Stiller right.

1677
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:47.580
Maybe Will Ferrell.
Yeah oh say Will Ferrell.

1678
01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.510
I think that the the Internet and the ability to communicate.

1679
01:37:52.050 --> 01:37:57.050
It's so fresh that there's all these like archetype like stereotypical sort of

1680
01:37:58.381 --> 01:38:01.770
characters that have come up like the right wing guy like you know who's a great

1681
01:38:01.771 --> 01:38:04.590
one to follow Chuck Woolery the guy.
Oh yeah.

1682
01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.790
<v 5>To and to be right back into it too.
Yeah that guy does his pitch about Obama.</v>

1683
01:38:09.010 --> 01:38:13.170
Yeah.
All day it's all about the Dems.
He writes things like anybody.

1684
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.940
You're right the Dems you're an idiot.

1685
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:20.150
You're right the Dems or the Libs you're retarded OK.
No bama.
Yeah.
No bomb Obama.

1686
01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:21.570
<v 2>But he.</v>

1687
01:38:21.570 --> 01:38:26.570
All he does is complain about Obama all day all day his fucking entire twitter

1688
01:38:28.651 --> 01:38:31.020
feed is complaining about the liberals.

1689
01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:36.390
You know meanwhile it's like living in Texas and bass fishing and whining and in

1690
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:39.570
doing commercials for like prostate pills.
Does he do.

1691
01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:42.960
<v 3>I mean I feel like a lot of those guys do like does he have a radio show.</v>

1692
01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:45.050
I don't think he does.
Does he.

1693
01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:47.610
Is he auditioning for a radio show is that what the Twitter feed is.

1694
01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:52.370
<v 5>Here's his.
Oh he has a fucking salary.
Save us Chuck.
No it isn't.</v>

1695
01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:55.620
Oh come on.
I did that.
I did his show.

1696
01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.430
<v 2>BECK Got a second look at this today on save us.</v>

1697
01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:03.510
Chuck get the fuck out of here.
That's his show.

1698
01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:06.330
That is so rude us.

1699
01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:11.690
<v 4>The idea that you would call your show save us Chuck political satire from a</v>

1700
01:39:12.301 --> 01:39:17.100
Hollywood confirmed Oh my God oh it's political satire.
Is that what it is.

1701
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:22.280
You know it'd be better if somebody like onion style made a save us Chuck and

1702
01:39:22.921 --> 01:39:27.921
just mocked it openly like nothing ever gets saved from an old actor.

1703
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.980
<v 13>I mean don't you play any of it.
Jamie.</v>

1704
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:36.830
<v 4>He's probably going to run for congressmen or something wherever he live game</v>

1705
01:39:36.831 --> 01:39:41.530
show legend Chuck Woolery considers why Democrats are willing to support
Boehner.

1706
01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:45.950
Why.
Bob Bob blow by blow on NASA and global warming.

1707
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:48.950
When your government is in charge of your fund when the government is in charge

1708
01:39:48.951 --> 01:39:53.390
of your funding you tow the company line just like all government funded
science.

1709
01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:56.230
What does that mean.
Does he mean he doesn't believe in global making.

1710
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:59.120
Course you don't.
That's an ideological thing.

1711
01:39:59.150 --> 01:40:04.150
The right wing are reluctant to agree in climate change being something that's a

1712
01:40:04.221 --> 01:40:08.060
product of human beings.
No he is he ran for president.

1713
01:40:08.210 --> 01:40:12.470
It says if you elect me president my press secretary would be oh my god is he

1714
01:40:12.471 --> 01:40:14.660
serious.
Oh I hope that any right.

1715
01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:19.170
If you in gigantic capital letters write in their eyes and write him in.

1716
01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:20.083
That would be.

1717
01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.990
<v 3>Great.
I always felt like you seem like a nice guy when he's on that show.</v>

1718
01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:27.260
I did his show.
I did the dating game when I was 18 years old.

1719
01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:29.590
No I was I came I was doing.

1720
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:34.640
I did stand up at the Laugh Factory when I was 18 and they had scouts in the

1721
01:40:35.150 --> 01:40:38.660
dating game in the audience and they were like I guess at that time they were

1722
01:40:38.661 --> 01:40:42.330
doing two contestants and then the third contestant was always a comedian.

1723
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:46.270
So they were going and trying to find the kids that were doing standup and like

1724
01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:49.580
fish that you won't be on the dating game so I got to go do what was that like.

1725
01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.920
It was weird.
I mean it was it was actually really like

1726
01:40:53.630 --> 01:40:57.740
because of laws or whatever they had to make sure that everything is as it seems

1727
01:40:57.750 --> 01:41:01.520
as they say so you're not allowed to see the other contests that you're not

1728
01:41:01.521 --> 01:41:02.870
allowed to see the girl.
Right.

1729
01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:07.730
So they have people following you around with walkie talkies like you know make

1730
01:41:07.731 --> 01:41:10.520
sure you don't let a contested number three is on the way to the bathroom.

1731
01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:13.850
You know make sure that you know so it's really like there was a lot of
security.

1732
01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:16.640
Wow that is interesting what is did you meet Chuck.

1733
01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:20.060
You hang with him about the lives.
No I he.

1734
01:41:21.170 --> 01:41:26.170
I met him when the show started and when know it is a perfect ticket.

1735
01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:31.520
<v 4>Chuck Woolery Ted Nugent together at last.
Come on.</v>

1736
01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:34.670
I'd vote for it would you.
Just to see what happens.
Yeah I would like to.

1737
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:38.240
I would vote for some ridiculous like that if they'd gotten office and see

1738
01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:41.190
things go exactly the same way they've always gone.
Like just like Obama.

1739
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:44.600
<v 0>Yeah that's the kind of thing I would be really fascinated with.</v>

1740
01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:48.440
Yeah like you know it'd be like I bet you know like really see like how much

1741
01:41:48.710 --> 01:41:50.240
power the president actually has.

1742
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:55.390
<v 4>You know I would love to see what happens if you didn't do the social stuff</v>

1743
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:58.130
those dangerous that did the real danger with things like.

1744
01:41:58.610 --> 01:42:01.250
Like when really hardcore Republicans get in.

1745
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:06.050
It's like things like gay rights abortion rights like things though along those

1746
01:42:06.051 --> 01:42:07.560
lines.
That is a real.

1747
01:42:07.610 --> 01:42:12.200
Like like marijuana legalization and the support of the DEA raiding medical

1748
01:42:12.201 --> 01:42:15.830
marijuana.
I guess that's real that's real.

1749
01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:20.860
Like they really do have an impact on social issues.
Supreme Court justices.

1750
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:25.190
Yeah that's a big that's a big that's a big power the president has but yeah I'm

1751
01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.420
choosing those right wing fuckheads who barely believe in evolution.

1752
01:42:30.170 --> 01:42:35.170
<v 21>If they said well you can vote for a starfish and a puppy and just see what</v>

1753
01:42:36.471 --> 01:42:38.620
happens I'd bet a lot of people

1754
01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.840
we would go to war with Iran the next day.

1755
01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:47.320
<v 4>Starfish heads I ran the bubbles with it would be the president of starfish or</v>

1756
01:42:47.491 --> 01:42:48.324
the puppy.

1757
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:53.800
Yeah well the crazy thing is they're talking about Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.

1758
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:58.490
That is terrifying me insane because doesn't it feel like you know you're.

1759
01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.680
<v 18>Oh the whole thing's fake.
Yes.
The whole thing.</v>

1760
01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:03.890
Oh I mean you kind of felt that the whole time.

1761
01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.560
But isn't this like this is the smoking gun like oh it's all rigged.

1762
01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:09.260
It's all it's all been a trick like.

1763
01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:15.810
<v 2>I mean Clinton for eight years old Bush for four and then young Bush for eight.</v>

1764
01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.700
We got Obama.
Okay we got a new name.

1765
01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:23.480
And then what is Obama's wife going to run next year or the kids.

1766
01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:27.380
<v 3>Yeah well Hillary you get Chelsea Clinton then you've got nobody but they really</v>

1767
01:43:27.381 --> 01:43:31.370
do.
They've got another.
They've got a brand new Bush down in Texas.

1768
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:33.890
They've got one.
Yeah.
Who's the new deal or something.

1769
01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:39.730
He just ran for Treasury or something and he won and he's and he's he's young

1770
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:43.790
and he's handsome and he's like there they're saying like he's like the next in

1771
01:43:43.791 --> 01:43:47.480
Q Oh God Neil Bush.
No that's not Neil.
That's another one.

1772
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:50.370
He's fairly you up like Texas.

1773
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:54.230
<v 24>Midland Texas.
It's recent.</v>

1774
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:57.410
<v 4>Mm hmm.
How many bushes are there.
Neil Bush and his family.</v>

1775
01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:02.900
Mary it's not Neil it's commuting.
George scary ass robots.

1776
01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.293
It's.

1777
01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:08.630
He's a Texas he he just won election like this year last year.

1778
01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:13.260
Chuck Woolery that's who I'm voting for.
God damn it.
Just save us Chuck.

1779
01:44:13.610 --> 01:44:18.160
We'll be right back and to and to end those fucking press conferences like that.

1780
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:20.630
Oh God.

1781
01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:25.040
<v 21>So I wonder if he would be terrified if he won the presidency just being like oh</v>

1782
01:44:25.130 --> 01:44:27.890
like I wonder if he would realize that he's not

1783
01:44:29.850 --> 01:44:34.270
probably capable of being president or if you're just not not get it all just be

1784
01:44:34.290 --> 01:44:37.140
like I should be president.
I think he probably thinks you should be president.

1785
01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.040
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ted Nugent thinks he should be president.
He's a narcissism thing.

1786
01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:45.780
Does the idea that I should be in charge is all presidents are probably crazy.

1787
01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.250
I don't think anybody should be president.

1788
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:49.920
I really don't think that it should be an option.
I say a computer.

1789
01:44:50.110 --> 01:44:51.870
<v 3>Yeah I mean can't.</v>

1790
01:44:52.130 --> 01:44:55.290
Well we will probably get there in the next 20 years we have a computer we

1791
01:44:55.291 --> 01:44:59.850
program in all of our laws you know and we were like Okay now you know make the

1792
01:44:59.851 --> 01:45:00.684
right choice.

1793
01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:04.770
<v 4>Yeah but it's program by people and people can influence the programming.</v>

1794
01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:08.140
I mean that was one of the big devil deals with electronic voting machines.

1795
01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:11.340
Right now we have that computer be built by a computer.

1796
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:14.880
But then we're fucked because of computers is going to take over then it's like

1797
01:45:14.881 --> 01:45:17.610
what.
Elon Musk is worried about George P.
Bush.

1798
01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:20.940
You look at that that's going to be the next well he's going to get a lazy eye.

1799
01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:25.110
The left eye Kennedy somebody punched him.
Can you get a lazy eye.

1800
01:45:25.230 --> 01:45:28.760
<v 12>Yeah I did it to grow at a lazy eye and I found lazy eye sexy for a short period</v>

1801
01:45:28.761 --> 01:45:31.830
of time.
She was kind of a freak.

1802
01:45:32.670 --> 01:45:37.230
She's a frequent lazy guy.
I developed a lazy eye fetish for at least a year.

1803
01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:38.153
Did you.

1804
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:47.970

1808
01:45:59.191 --> 01:45:59.790
library.

<v 3>It's like a older authority figure.

1814
01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:23.780

You feel your weight on it.</v>

1815
01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.100
As she wraps her legs around.

1816
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:29.640
I was all fucking fat slob like what you thought.

1819
01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:41.880
<v 11>I had a foot fetish too when I was a kid.
For a little while I got rid of it.</v>

1820
01:46:42.210 --> 01:46:43.470
<v 3>That's a popular one.
I don't get it.</v>

1825
01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.760
<v 11>There was I mean a lot to talk about it in my act.</v>

1826
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:02.880
There was a magazine which found the woods once when I was a kid.

1827
01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:08.180
It was called it was Foot Action magazine and it was me and his two friends mine

1828
01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:14.720
and my friend Josh and my friend my friend Pedro and we're we're going over

1829
01:47:15.121 --> 01:47:20.121
these these magazines like some dude left a magazine bag like like a plastic bag

1830
01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:22.913
under a log.

1831
01:47:23.130 --> 01:47:26.850
When you're a kid and you're in the woods and you find magazines it's almost

1832
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.960
always porn.
Yeah.

1833
01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:32.820
<v 12>And so we're going through this magazine and it was just like gnomes talking</v>

1834
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:37.530
because it was it was all like foot stuff.
You know it's like weird.

1835
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.690
And then like three minutes and my friend goes Dude this shit is all just dicks

1836
01:47:42.691 --> 01:47:43.524
and feet.

1837
01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.000
<v 7>I'll never forget.</v>

1838
01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:52.560
<v 5>I'll never forget him saying that I never forget those words coming out of his</v>

1839
01:47:52.561 --> 01:47:54.600
mouth because we were totally quiet.

1840
01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:57.750
Well we're like we're confused because we're only 11.

1841
01:47:57.890 --> 01:48:02.890
Yeah and he's like Dude this shit is all just dicks and feet and articles.

1842
01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:04.713
There's no art.

1843
01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:09.540
<v 4>You know obviously again pre internet you know any eleven year old kid is</v>

1844
01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:13.410
probably seen hours of hardcore ass porn.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1845
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:18.090
<v 9>I just think it's so crazy that there is a time where there's like you know guys</v>

1846
01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:21.720
we just go out into the woods with a foot magazine and just turn off and leave

1847
01:48:21.721 --> 01:48:24.560
it there like that's like the scariest person I can think of.

1848
01:48:24.750 --> 01:48:27.390
<v 4>Meanwhile there's probably someone listening to us right now with earbuds</v>

1849
01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:29.260
jerking off to a flip magazine.
Yes.

1850
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:31.940
<v 7>We thought that we were hey you know.</v>

1851
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:36.450
<v 4>I mean you get enough numbers you know you get like a million people that listen</v>

1852
01:48:36.451 --> 01:48:40.650
to a podcast at once you know there's gonna be one dude out there jerking off to

1853
01:48:40.651 --> 01:48:43.360
a foot magazine.
Yeah.
You looked at a there's a million.
Yeah.

1854
01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.940
That's one of the bigger fetishes isn't it.
Probably pretty big.
Yeah.

1855
01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.890
But like what.
What is it.
What are their big fetishes like.
Big girls.

1856
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:51.300
Some guys like really big girls.

1857
01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.193
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.990
<v 4>There's all those kids that dress up like animals vs.
furries.</v>

1859
01:48:58.170 --> 01:49:00.260
Have you ever seen them.
Oh my dear life.

1860
01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:01.740
<v 9>I went.
I've never.
I mean I.</v>

1861
01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:07.370
We were playing a festival in Atlanta and it was the furry convention in town

1862
01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:08.673
same day.

1863
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.960
And we were all in the same hotel room and we had driven we had driven from

1864
01:49:12.961 --> 01:49:13.680
Florida.

1865
01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:17.010
We had just done a show in Florida and then we were sketched out by the hotel

1866
01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.610
that was provided for us.
We're like we're just gonna fucking drive like Atlanta.

1867
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.840
So we drove all night so we got into the hotel was so sketchy you drove all

1868
01:49:24.841 --> 01:49:25.140
night.

1869
01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:26.730
<v 5>There was there was there was blood.</v>

1870
01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:31.660
We flip the mattress over and there was blood.
On the bottom of it and put back.

1871
01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:33.970
No I mean we felt below a reason there.

1872
01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:40.260
<v 9>So we're like fuck this for driving Atlanta.
So we drove like all night.</v>

1873
01:49:40.290 --> 01:49:44.460
And then we get in and we're like we're all almost like delirious like tired.

1874
01:49:44.490 --> 01:49:49.410
<v 5>So I get into hotel and then we're seeing all these furries everywhere as</v>

1875
01:49:49.590 --> 01:49:52.620
artifact and your mascot convention.

1876
01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:56.070
Yeah yeah well the weird thing is like kids are coming up to him because the

1877
01:49:56.071 --> 01:50:00.480
kids see like you know it's a mascot and they're like hugging I'm like don't hug

1878
01:50:00.481 --> 01:50:01.314
that costume.

1879
01:50:02.250 --> 01:50:07.250
<v 6>It's not goofy but I checked into my room and there was you know the whole the</v>

1880
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:14.030
most of the hotel running by furries and there was the loudest like sex going on

1881
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:18.570
like against the wall while I was trying to sleep and all I wanted to do is like

1882
01:50:18.571 --> 01:50:21.660
midday and I just want to get like a couple hours of sleep for the show that

1883
01:50:21.661 --> 01:50:22.140
night.

1884
01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:27.140
And it's just like loud sex and then these guys just getting in fights being

1885
01:50:27.451 --> 01:50:31.830
like I would never I would never this repeating that again and again I would

1886
01:50:31.831 --> 01:50:34.830
never like you know like.
And then just more sex kind of stuff.

1887
01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:39.390
<v 5>And it was.
That's my only encounter at first.</v>

1888
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.040
Oh oh I stumbled upon one as well.

1889
01:50:44.490 --> 01:50:48.690
<v 4>In Pittsburgh I was in Pittsburgh and apparently that's one of the places where</v>

1890
01:50:48.691 --> 01:50:51.150
they have big they used to have a big one in San Diego.

1891
01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:54.570
But they moved it to Pittsburgh as Pittsburgh is more open minded than San
Diego.

1892
01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:57.000
That didn't make any sense to me.

1893
01:50:57.270 --> 01:51:00.990
This guy was telling me they might be bullshit me but apparently San Diego is

1894
01:51:00.991 --> 01:51:03.690
like a pretty conservative town and a lot of ways right.

1895
01:51:03.810 --> 01:51:04.890
A lot of military down there.

1896
01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:09.030
Well you put a furry convention in the military community that's probably not.

1897
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:15.250
Kelly I'd never seen it in person and it was just total dumb luck that we were

1898
01:51:15.421 --> 01:51:20.190
in town the exact same time and when we got to our hotel the people that were

1899
01:51:20.191 --> 01:51:24.300
working there were except tactic to talk to people that weren't furries and

1900
01:51:24.301 --> 01:51:26.640
wanted to tell you all the things that furries were asking for.

1901
01:51:26.730 --> 01:51:27.360
<v 16>Oh wow.</v>

1902
01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.670
And one of the crazy things they were asking for they want all their food and

1903
01:51:29.671 --> 01:51:31.800
bowls.
They want to eat on the ground like a dog.

1904
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:36.060
And they asked like room service they could deliver their food in bowls like

1905
01:51:36.061 --> 01:51:38.710
milk.
They wanted milk in a bowl like a dog.

1906
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:42.090
So they could drink out of it and they wonder a litter box in the hallway.

1907
01:51:42.450 --> 01:51:45.880
They asked for a litter box in the lobby.
Big I draw a line there like they will.

1908
01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:49.020
Well the guy was like What.
And I said hold on.

1909
01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:52.290
The guy asked you to put a litter bottle like a regular sized litter box.

1910
01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:54.150
No they wanted a large box.

1911
01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:59.180
They wanted to pay to have a large litter box installed in the lobby and his

1912
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:05.490
that their thoughts were hey we have this whole hotel we bought bought out the

1913
01:52:05.491 --> 01:52:08.760
whole hotel wasn't the hotel I was in the hotel too right.

1914
01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:10.550
<v 4>But there was a few other people that weren't furry.</v>

1915
01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:13.220
So we went to shit in the lobby they wanted to shit in the lobby that's in there

1916
01:52:13.230 --> 01:52:15.350
at least pee like they asked the guy.

1917
01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.430
I mean he could've been they could've been pulling the guy's leg but I guarantee

1918
01:52:18.431 --> 01:52:21.570
you if the guy said yes somebody would have shit in that lobby Oh yeah somebody

1919
01:52:21.571 --> 01:52:26.571
if they had like a big like sandbox like the one on ones that kid's playing fill

1920
01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:32.040
with cat litter.
I love
it.

1921
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:37.260
<v 3>I love going to like different like groups message boards and just like hanging</v>

1922
01:52:37.261 --> 01:52:40.020
out on him like lurking on I'm just reading them and it's like one of my fair

1923
01:52:40.021 --> 01:52:40.854
things to do at night.

1924
01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:45.330
And I've been on like furry ones before and it's like they're like serious about

1925
01:52:45.331 --> 01:52:46.240
that stuff.
It's insane.

1926
01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:51.370
It's like it's like and that is it is a very new thing.
Mm hmm yeah.

1927
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:52.320
Something happened.

1928
01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:57.320
I don't know if it's Wi-Fi signals or cell phone service but something this is

1929
01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:00.440
something did something about vaccines.

1930
01:53:00.650 --> 01:53:01.890
<v 4>Yeah.
Jenny McCarthy is right.</v>

1931
01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:07.640
What if it's some there's the other thing these spirit animals like people like

1932
01:53:08.410 --> 01:53:12.910
like I'm a fox kin like foxes my spider.
Yeah.

1933
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:16.890
<v 9>And other candidates planet kids there's girls who think they do a song about it</v>

1934
01:53:16.891 --> 01:53:17.970
on the new album.

1935
01:53:19.110 --> 01:53:23.230
<v 5>I do a song called Bullies where the whole point of the song is like you know it</v>

1936
01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:25.980
means cracking down on these bullies but like Okay fine.

1937
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:26.670
<v 25>Bullies are bad.</v>

1938
01:53:26.670 --> 01:53:31.650
<v 5>But like if the bullies go away we're screwed because people are gonna get out</v>

1939
01:53:31.651 --> 01:53:33.030
of get faster keeping you in line.

1940
01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:37.370
Like you know when I was a kid I you know I.

1941
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:41.220
<v 3>You go away for the summer you know you don't see your friends so much like
that.</v>

1942
01:53:41.250 --> 01:53:45.210
And so I was really into Ninja Turtles and like and so then when it gets to be

1943
01:53:45.211 --> 01:53:49.170
around like 13 or years old like I come back to school form and into turtle toys

1944
01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:52.440
you know thinking that everybody's gonna like you know be still in the Ninja

1945
01:53:52.441 --> 01:53:54.550
Turtles and then everybody just made fun of me.
All right.

1946
01:53:54.570 --> 01:53:57.900
<v 18>We do.
Toys like and there's like okay.
Good.
Duly noted.</v>

1947
01:53:58.020 --> 01:53:59.430
Got rid of them and it was fine.

1948
01:53:59.490 --> 01:54:02.850
Like you know because the bullies kept me alive they kind of told me like that's

1949
01:54:02.851 --> 01:54:04.990
not cool.
Yeah they mock you.
Yeah.

1950
01:54:05.190 --> 01:54:10.190
<v 4>When I was a kid I was eleven and I moved from Florida to Boston and I just</v>

1951
01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:11.943
wasn't

1952
01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:17.990
11 12 and 13 yeah about 13 and I guess I was in middle school and I went to this

1953
01:54:20.690 --> 01:54:24.330
I was in Jamaica Plain which is kind of now it's become more gentrified.

1954
01:54:24.630 --> 01:54:29.190
When I lived there it was priest you like late 7 these early.

1955
01:54:29.250 --> 01:54:33.510
Like maybe 1980 at the latest 1980 I think high school freshman year was eighty

1956
01:54:33.511 --> 01:54:34.344
one for me.

1957
01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:38.410
So I guess it was like nineteen seventy nine or 1980 and I had like an

1958
01:54:38.411 --> 01:54:40.150
incredible hulk lunchbox.

1959
01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:46.260
And you know and when you're in a fuckin you know quote unquote urban middle

1960
01:54:46.631 --> 01:54:51.631
school and you show up with a fucking cartoon lunchbox you get shit all over.

1961
01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.280
I had I had that lunchbox for one day.

1962
01:54:54.670 --> 01:54:58.640
I remember like I was so happy I got this lunchbox so we'd like to recite a love

1963
01:54:58.650 --> 01:55:03.460
of the Hulk and they fucking looked at me like I was like a victim.
I got ready.

1964
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:07.620
I was gonna get attacked like I was a limping antelope straying in front of a

1965
01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:11.270
waterfall of the herd.
And I was I realized I got to get rid of this thing.

1966
01:55:11.290 --> 01:55:13.710
I remember thinking myself I got to leave it in a locker somewhere.

1967
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:17.320
Yeah I got to take this lunchbox and just leave it somewhere I can even bring it

1968
01:55:17.321 --> 01:55:21.660
home because like I'm in danger carrying it around like carrying a relic I it

1969
01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:22.870
was a target.
Yeah.

1970
01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:26.380
None of the other kids had lunchboxes with like cartoon like there was no

1971
01:55:26.381 --> 01:55:28.840
innocence at all.
It was non-existent.

1972
01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:33.350
It was like a dangerous creepy school environment an area walking room was

1973
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:34.223
working and.

1974
01:55:34.450 --> 01:55:38.610
<v 18>But if you didn't have that experience you could be dressing up like Hulk today</v>

1975
01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:40.810
being in a hotel room with like a condo.

1976
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:43.990
<v 2>Yeah but it's not bad.
I mean comic con.
I've never been.</v>

1977
01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.150
I've been to San Diego why it was happening.

1978
01:55:46.410 --> 01:55:48.840
I feel like they're having a good time you know.
Yeah.

1979
01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:52.690
<v 22>And I think there's a huge difference between the cause players and Comic Con</v>

1980
01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:53.613
and furries.

1981
01:55:54.190 --> 01:55:57.000
<v 0>What's the difference.
I don't.</v>

1982
01:55:57.050 --> 01:56:01.570
<v 5>I think that they'll backtrack.
I mean no I'll stick with it.</v>

1983
01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:03.860
I'll stick with it.
Okay let's explore this.

1984
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:08.950
<v 3>It's well I don't think I think the furry thing and I'm probably wrong but the</v>

1985
01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:14.560
the you know quick take that I get away from it is that it seems to be a lot

1986
01:56:14.561 --> 01:56:18.520
about sex.
You know like dressing up and having sex with other animals.

1987
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:20.110
<v 4>They defend that though.
Yeah.</v>

1988
01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:23.860
If you bring them up to furries I said No it's not about that furries contact me

1989
01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:28.840
because we shit on them in a podcast because you know I've heard that as well

1990
01:56:29.110 --> 01:56:33.400
and they say it's not about that.
Yeah but that's what people say about anything.

1991
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:36.280
True.
But don't want to ever admit it's just about sex but we're.

1992
01:56:36.650 --> 01:56:36.940
<v 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1993
01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:40.030
But on the other hand now I'm not even like doubting myself I mean I'm playing

1994
01:56:40.031 --> 01:56:43.630
devil's advocate for myself even if it is about that and it is a person who

1995
01:56:43.631 --> 01:56:47.260
wants to dress up like a animal and then fuck another guy dressed like an animal

1996
01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:53.120
who gives a shit really I mean I think it's weird but like you know it doesn't

1997
01:56:53.201 --> 01:56:54.940
bother me and it doesn't affect me at all.

1998
01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:58.150
<v 4>It's voluntary.
Yeah those things are voluntary.
Who cares.</v>

1999
01:56:58.810 --> 01:57:00.380
You could be weird and voluntary.

2000
01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:05.370
It's not a bad thing to want to fuck a mascot.
You know why is that awful.

2001
01:57:05.650 --> 01:57:08.400
But it's also not bad I think it's weird.
Yeah it's not bad.

2002
01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:11.470
It's deadly not bad I think it's weird but there's a lot of weird shit that we

2003
01:57:11.471 --> 01:57:14.020
just accept like what's up with like garter belts.

2004
01:57:14.650 --> 01:57:19.650
Like why do people like like thigh high stockings and you know right elastic

2005
01:57:20.171 --> 01:57:23.080
bands connect your underwear to your stock what the fuck is all that about.

2006
01:57:23.110 --> 01:57:25.480
That's weird shit to Yeah.
Why was that hot.

2007
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:30.420
<v 23>Yeah yeah lingerie then I don't get it.
Mm hmm.</v>

2008
01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:34.370
<v 7>So oh jesus christ I did it again.</v>

2009
01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:38.330
I set this fucking shitty thing down and it's hot as fuck.

2010
01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:40.700
Every time I do it I'm going gonna burn the studio to the ground.

2011
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:45.380
<v 17>The studio is going down but if you look at it like that it's like I look like a</v>

2012
01:57:45.381 --> 01:57:46.430
lunar module or something.

2013
01:57:47.090 --> 01:57:50.900
<v 0>Yeah.
It looks like a miniature from like an old sci fi film.</v>

2014
01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:54.650
I've never seen one so stupid I've seen a bunch of these things I've never seen

2015
01:57:54.651 --> 01:57:55.484
one this dumb.

2016
01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:57.560
<v 4>Or this like a flash gordon dildo.</v>

2017
01:57:58.190 --> 01:58:01.520
I just can't understand why anybody would make it so hard to hold on to like the

2018
01:58:01.521 --> 01:58:04.640
idea that it's so sharp edged.
Yeah.

2019
01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:06.830
How did that happen.

2020
01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:11.460
It did not come from what the giant vape thing.

2021
01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:14.970
How come they have the little e-cigarettes and the little e-cigarettes where it

2022
01:58:14.971 --> 01:58:19.610
looked like a cigarette.
Now it turned out like black ones like you murdered out.

2023
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:22.060
You get a murdered cigarette it's all back.
Back down.

2024
01:58:22.590 --> 01:58:25.500
And then it turned into these goddamn robot.
I think it's all battery life.

2025
01:58:26.290 --> 01:58:28.590
<v 21>I think it's because the batteries in these things.</v>

2026
01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:31.560
You know I think this will last like a day.

2027
01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:33.390
You know you can kind of hit it all day.

2028
01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:36.150
<v 4>That's it.
Yeah.
That only lasts a data.</v>

2029
01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.880
How many times a day do you hit that thing constantly.

2030
01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:44.720
<v 6>And you were smoking how much was a pack a day for a while and then I switched</v>

2031
01:58:45.091 --> 01:58:49.290
to this and I bet my nicotine levels through the roof.

2032
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:50.250
I bet I bet I do.

2033
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:53.670
<v 17>I take in more nicotine now than I when I smoked a pack a day but nicotine is</v>

2034
01:58:53.671 --> 01:58:55.620
not necessarily what's dangerous.

2035
01:58:55.650 --> 01:58:58.800
<v 3>Well it turns out great for you.
I mean it'll raise your blood pressure.</v>

2036
01:58:59.130 --> 01:59:01.740
You know you still got.
Yeah.
You still have it.

2037
01:59:02.190 --> 01:59:05.580
You still got problems with like heart attack stroke kind of things like that

2038
01:59:05.610 --> 01:59:06.960
but it's very real.
Yeah.

2039
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:10.080
Because it raises it's a stimulant so it raises your blood pressure.

2040
01:59:10.350 --> 01:59:12.950
You've got a really jack it up all day though.
Yeah.

2041
01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:17.710
That kind of response don't you.
Yeah.
Which I do.
I do like
that.

2042
01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:22.680
But like as far as carcinogens I think it's pretty clear as far as they know

2043
01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:23.520
right now.

2044
01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:27.060
<v 4>Did you ever see that.
RUSSELL CROWE He's backing up here it.</v>

2045
01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:30.990
Try to keep it quiet.
Well no we don't.
Don't worry about it man.

2046
01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:34.530
Was that Russell Crowe movie The Insider is that what it was.
Yeah.

2047
01:59:34.590 --> 01:59:39.590
Where he was a scientist that worked for the cigarette companies and was he was

2048
01:59:40.411 --> 01:59:43.140
testifying about all the different chemicals that they put.
Yeah.

2049
01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:47.730
That's terrifying shit.
Yeah.
They had a number of chemicals.

2050
01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:52.050
They allowed the FDA allowed five hundred and ninety nine plus chemicals.

2051
01:59:52.590 --> 01:59:57.540
<v 6>I mean I remember I was just talk about this last week where there's I remember</v>

2052
01:59:57.570 --> 02:00:01.140
when I was a kid you know you download like Anarchist Cookbook and all stuff

2053
02:00:01.141 --> 02:00:02.310
from like the Internet.

2054
02:00:02.350 --> 02:00:06.540
And there was a CIA handbook that you could download.

2055
02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:10.260
I don't know if it's real or not but one of the things that they told you how to

2056
02:00:10.261 --> 02:00:13.680
do in there is they said there's enough chemicals and a pack of cigarettes to

2057
02:00:13.681 --> 02:00:18.510
kill somebody and you boil it down you distill it and you can make like a paste

2058
02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:20.100
that you'd put on like a doorknob.

2059
02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:23.380
And then if somebody like touches it it'll kill them like you'll get them like

2060
02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:27.240
oh same cut same type of deal with the nicotine thing where it's an absorbent.

2061
02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:30.570
<v 4>So toxic.
Easy.
That's so crazy.</v>

2062
02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:36.620
It says here cigarette smoke contains 4000 chemicals including 43 known cancer

2063
02:00:37.321 --> 02:00:41.280
causing compounds and 400 other toxins.

2064
02:00:41.610 --> 02:00:45.670
<v 9>Forty three out of four thousand is not that bad though if you you know only 43</v>

2065
02:00:45.690 --> 02:00:50.070
of them cause cancer but there is five hundred and ninety nine ingredients.

2066
02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:54.070
<v 11>So I don't know why there's five hundred nine nine ingredients and 4000</v>

2067
02:00:54.090 --> 02:00:58.440
chemicals.
I don't know how that works but all those things were approved.

2068
02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:01.910
That's what's really crazy.
And they say I put that in yeah.

2069
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:06.930
We're thinking about throwing formaldehyde and so I hope we're still golfing

2070
02:01:06.931 --> 02:01:07.764
right.
Yeah.

2071
02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:12.930
I mean this through all these different chemicals and what's really fascinating

2072
02:01:12.931 --> 02:01:17.931
about it is the object or the the the purpose of all these chemicals is just to

2073
02:01:19.170 --> 02:01:20.910
try to make you more addictive.
Right.

2074
02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:23.880
So it is just what the flavor comes from does it.
I don't know.

2075
02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:25.080
I don't think a cancer chemical.

2076
02:01:25.530 --> 02:01:29.130
I mean they're just they add a bunch of shit according least to that movie that

2077
02:01:29.131 --> 02:01:33.730
Russell Crowe movie.
Yeah just to try to get you more and more hooked you know

2078
02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.380
does a great job.
Yeah.
It's really addictive.

2079
02:01:37.810 --> 02:01:40.890
Imagine you came out with a product today that did the damage the cigarette did

2080
02:01:41.310 --> 02:01:45.140
and he tried to push it.
You know if you came out with some new thing.
Yeah.

2081
02:01:45.450 --> 02:01:49.170
And he killed.
I half a million people a year.

2082
02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:54.140
<v 3>Like a vaporizer.
They get superhot and burns down on anybody man.</v>

2083
02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:58.530
Not yet not mass produced.
Do you think they're dangerous.

2084
02:01:58.950 --> 02:02:01.740
No I was talking about though that one because it gets so high.
Yeah yeah.

2085
02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:03.480
They think I don't know.

2086
02:02:03.570 --> 02:02:06.480
I mean it takes a long time to find the stuff out doesn't it don't have to do

2087
02:02:06.481 --> 02:02:10.860
like 20 year studies and things like before they kind of really know.

2088
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:16.560
I mean as far as you know I read about it because I do it all I use a vaporizer

2089
02:02:16.561 --> 02:02:17.400
so I like you worry.

2090
02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:21.120
Yeah a little bit like I look up whenever I see anything about it it seems like

2091
02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:26.870
they find that it's not it's it's not as good as not doing anything but it's a

2092
02:02:27.571 --> 02:02:28.860
little better than smoking.

2093
02:02:30.150 --> 02:02:34.950
<v 15>It's not as good for you as not doing it but it's not as bad for you as smoking</v>

2094
02:02:34.951 --> 02:02:35.784
cigarettes.
Yeah.

2095
02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:39.870
So for people that smoke cigarettes you got a kind of way your options like do

2096
02:02:39.871 --> 02:02:41.030
you think you're gonna be able to quit.

2097
02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:46.080
And if you can you just quit on your own.
Right.

2098
02:02:46.290 --> 02:02:50.550
But if you don't think you be able to quit you kind of do that and get your fix.

2099
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:51.943
Yeah this is good.

2100
02:02:53.490 --> 02:02:54.323
<v 3>No it's not good.</v>

2101
02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:59.360
But like I've been doing it for like seven years now and now I don't even like

2102
02:02:59.611 --> 02:03:03.750
when I want nicotine.
I don't think about a cigarette like you think about that.

2103
02:03:03.810 --> 02:03:04.140
Yeah.

2104
02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:09.140
So I was like some smoked a cigarette an hour ago now and I probably actually

2105
02:03:09.621 --> 02:03:13.710
smoked one probably a month ago but like one had like a party one.

2106
02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:14.990
Yeah you could do that.
Yeah.

2107
02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:19.640
Because I just I just this I mean I smoke one cigarette maybe three or four

2108
02:03:19.641 --> 02:03:20.790
times a year.

2109
02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:24.320
<v 4>Like really infrequently now Stephen King gives himself one cigarette when he</v>

2110
02:03:24.321 --> 02:03:26.750
finishes a book.
Oh I know.
That's why I read so many books.

2111
02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:30.500
It's his whole motivation.
But isn't that interesting.

2112
02:03:30.530 --> 02:03:33.940
Like he'll he allows himself a cigarette when he finishes a book huh.

2113
02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:35.853
<v 20>Uh</v>

2114
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:40.110
get the hell up your productivity.

2115
02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:44.010
<v 4>There's a documentary that I'm in called the culture the culture high.</v>

2116
02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:47.520
Recent documentary by the same people that did this other documentaries and

2117
02:03:47.521 --> 02:03:52.521
called the union and it's all about how the prison industry and the medical

2118
02:03:54.211 --> 02:03:57.330
marijuana on marijuana has been demonized.

2119
02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:58.980
How many people are in jail because of it.

2120
02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:01.890
Just the percentage of people that are non-violent drug offenders that are in

2121
02:04:01.891 --> 02:04:02.910
there because of marijuana.

2122
02:04:02.970 --> 02:04:07.890
And how many how many people like the literally drug war would dissolve if it

2123
02:04:07.891 --> 02:04:10.110
wasn't for marijuana being illegal.
Right.

2124
02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:13.410
The amount of people who get arrested for other drugs pales in comparison.

2125
02:04:13.710 --> 02:04:16.530
But one of things they talked about was cigarettes and they said that if you

2126
02:04:16.531 --> 02:04:19.350
take if you smoke two packs of cigarettes.

2127
02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:24.330
That's the that's the breaking number where you are 4000 times more likely to

2128
02:04:24.331 --> 02:04:29.160
get cancer to two packs of cigarettes.
Yeah in your life.
No no no no.

2129
02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:33.150
Every day every day two packs a day 4000 times more.

2130
02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:35.490
I might have made those numbers out by the way they sound good.

2131
02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.550
I listened to it on a point man watching a plane half awake.

2132
02:04:38.970 --> 02:04:40.050
That's crazy that's a lot of cigarettes.

2133
02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:44.220
Two packs a day not for dogs and hope that means he throws them down.

2134
02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:47.070
<v 6>John Mellencamp does for.
Does he really.
I heard that.</v>

2135
02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:50.520
I read it sounded like one of his show about him.
He smokes like four.

2136
02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:52.350
But within the air you see him an interview.

2137
02:04:52.410 --> 02:04:54.840
He's smoking and then he's like lighting the other one.

2138
02:04:54.930 --> 02:04:59.230
Like when that one's going out like he's just going back to back things all day.

2139
02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:03.990
<v 11>I was in Indiana and at a UFC and John Mellencamp was in the audience and they</v>

2140
02:05:03.991 --> 02:05:05.280
showed a picture of him.

2141
02:05:05.590 --> 02:05:09.480
You know they showed the video of him in the crowd and showed it to the audience

2142
02:05:09.481 --> 02:05:14.150
and they booed him really
liberal.

2143
02:05:14.850 --> 02:05:18.330
<v 4>They think he's.
And I had to ask her why don't they like John Mellencamp.</v>

2144
02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:21.920
He's from Indiana.
I was born in a small town.
Yeah.
Whole deal.
Nope.

2145
02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:26.430
<v 6>He's a liberal.
He must have said something.
There must be something.</v>

2146
02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:32.240
<v 4>I wonder if you got outspoken on some sort of issue that like slavery so that</v>

2147
02:05:34.650 --> 02:05:36.940
you know even like that.
Yeah.

2148
02:05:36.990 --> 02:05:39.600
I don't know what it was man but they booed the shit out of him it seems like

2149
02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:42.340
it's crazy.
Jack and Diane.
Yeah.

2150
02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:46.560
<v 15>He likes
he's too liberal for Indiana.</v>

2151
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:50.970
At least that crowd UFC crowd in Indiana.
They were mad at him.

2152
02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:52.643
I couldn't believe it.

2153
02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:55.920
<v 26>I was like goddamn John Mellencamp fucks commies.</v>

2154
02:05:56.280 --> 02:06:01.260
<v 3>I wonder if he had any idea of that before he went that's got to suck go to see</v>

2155
02:06:01.261 --> 02:06:04.670
like a UFC fight and an entire lake place hates you.

2156
02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:07.950
<v 4>It was a large number of people booing him too.</v>

2157
02:06:08.370 --> 02:06:13.060
It wasn't just like a couple of boos scattered in the clapping and applause
Yeah.

2158
02:06:13.590 --> 02:06:16.320
<v 3>That's kind of you tell your wife like you know I think I need to see the rest</v>

2159
02:06:16.321 --> 02:06:19.140
the fight let's just get in the car pretend we're in the bathroom.

2160
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:23.360
<v 11>Fire up cars you're either falling winches and this.</v>

2161
02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:26.100
There's certain spots in the country you're not allowed to be liberal.

2162
02:06:26.220 --> 02:06:29.780
You mean you really are not you're allowed to be kind of conservative anywhere

2163
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:34.790
you'll be mocked but it's not dangerous per say but if you're a liberal in

2164
02:06:35.641 --> 02:06:40.590
certain parts of the country like you are that that's that team mentality.
Yeah.

2165
02:06:40.890 --> 02:06:42.330
Are you a Raiders fan.

2166
02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:46.650
You know there's like you know I mean it's like that team mentality really comes

2167
02:06:46.651 --> 02:06:49.590
out.
People love to defend their team.

2168
02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:53.700
And when you are a liberal you're thought to be weak.

2169
02:06:54.180 --> 02:06:56.680
You god damn bleeding heart.
Oh yeah.

2170
02:06:56.730 --> 02:07:00.150
You're gonna help all those welfare moms and all although you know they just

2171
02:07:00.151 --> 02:07:05.100
take that money and spend it on fucking drugs you know Joe.

2172
02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:12.180
<v 6>The like I we had all these conspiracy sites like you know a lot of them you</v>

2173
02:07:12.181 --> 02:07:14.870
know get you know a lot of lean right.

2174
02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:19.330
You know like conspiracy sites and all of them right.
Yeah most of them.

2175
02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:20.933
And.

2176
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:25.770
<v 3>And remember when Texas was talking about seceding or Rick Perry was talking</v>

2177
02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:27.240
about seceding from the union.

2178
02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:29.680
Yeah that's the layer when he was about to run for president.
Which is weird.

2179
02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:33.750
But he was like he's like you know we can secede.

2180
02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:38.610
And so like everybody on the conspiracy boards that were from Texas there's this

2181
02:07:38.611 --> 02:07:42.900
big thread everybody's talking about it and they're like and everybody was like

2182
02:07:42.901 --> 02:07:45.930
the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go to Austin and just kick

2183
02:07:45.931 --> 02:07:46.770
everybody's ass.

2184
02:07:47.710 --> 02:07:50.410
<v 19>They said Yeah it's like we secede.</v>

2185
02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:55.370
<v 4>We're gonna get off and
this broken stop work and I burned it all up.</v>

2186
02:07:55.770 --> 02:07:58.330
That's hilarious.
I've got to put more juice out there.

2187
02:07:59.070 --> 02:08:03.720
How much you got your earned dude.
A lot.
That's gross.
Yeah.

2188
02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:07.350
Doesn't isn't Texas like it's a different sort of a state.

2189
02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:10.460
It's like it's the way they're set up.

2190
02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:14.430
<v 3>It's the Republic of touch.
Yeah yeah.
Because they</v>

2191
02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:17.550
have my histories right.

2192
02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:22.580
<v 6>I think during or leading up to the Civil War Texas wanted to be part of the</v>

2193
02:08:24.061 --> 02:08:28.770
Union or it came that Texas could be part of the Union but then they wouldn't

2194
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:33.090
accept them because they thought they didn't want to swing the amount of pro

2195
02:08:33.091 --> 02:08:33.924
slave states.

2196
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.100
They didn't want to add another pro slave state and like kind of they had like a

2197
02:08:38.190 --> 02:08:41.250
equal you know amount of pro slave and non slave states.

2198
02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:44.430
So they didn't accept Texas is entrance into the union.

2199
02:08:44.610 --> 02:08:45.660
So they made their own country.

2200
02:08:46.110 --> 02:08:51.110
And then after the Civil War when they asked Texas to come into the country they

2201
02:08:51.241 --> 02:08:52.320
had this kind of

2202
02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:58.260
caveat you know which should they're like OK but at any point if we want to

2203
02:08:58.261 --> 02:09:01.750
leave we can leave.
If it gets shitty Oh it's a prenup.
Yeah.

2204
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:05.340
Basically Texas is like the only state that came into the country with a prenup

2205
02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:06.600
and where they're like OK.

2206
02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:09.360
But we can leave at any time and so I think that's what rich Rick Perry was

2207
02:09:09.361 --> 02:09:09.900
talking about.

2208
02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:14.820
<v 11>Is this the thing I got to unscrew
this is so goofy.</v>

2209
02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:17.520
There's so much involved in these fucking things.

2210
02:09:17.790 --> 02:09:20.460
<v 8>I can't believe you can only suck on it like four or five times and it runs out</v>

2211
02:09:20.461 --> 02:09:24.270
of juice while you sat there cooking it for about 10 minutes probably not.

2212
02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:27.810
It wasn't that long the first time I called it it was gone for a minute.

2213
02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:31.230
<v 11>Yeah but is it does that cooking the stuff.
How come it doesn't come out then.</v>

2214
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:34.350
It wasn't very little.
Yeah.
All right so where does it go.

2215
02:09:35.190 --> 02:09:37.520
<v 8>You put it on that.
Yeah.
That coil.</v>

2216
02:09:37.890 --> 02:09:40.230
<v 5>This can only good for you and you gotta make that call.</v>

2217
02:09:40.410 --> 02:09:41.970
This is my first and last day.

2218
02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:44.820
Oh yeah I made it because you had to build your own coils on these things.

2219
02:09:44.850 --> 02:09:48.900
What the fuck.
I have a bunch of wire in my car.
What's wrong with you.

2220
02:09:49.110 --> 02:09:54.080
I just love Nick really because it's the greatest drug pour it in.

2221
02:09:54.230 --> 02:09:56.350
<v 11>See in this area ladies and gentlemen is what you do.</v>

2222
02:09:56.730 --> 02:10:00.490
<v 13>Just a little bit it.
This isn't even give me a buzz though.</v>

2223
02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:05.190
I'd rather have a cigar.
You'll see that there's a video.

2224
02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:08.500
Oh fuck.
Watch out.
You're not attack really.

2225
02:10:09.590 --> 02:10:14.120
<v 11>No video of this guy hand rolling a Cuban cigar with a GoPro on his head.</v>

2226
02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:16.400
It's pretty dope.
You get to see how they do it.

2227
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:19.700
So it's so much skill involved in that.
Are those legal here now.

2228
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:22.010
Yes that's going to have a few though.

2229
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:24.380
Would they sell them can you buy them in Los Angeles.

2230
02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:27.830
Good question but I think you're allowed to have a few now because we're kind of

2231
02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:30.590
opening up a thing.
Jamie finding out.

2232
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.600
There's a number that you're allowed to have.

2233
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:36.040
I'm pretty sure I'd imagine you could buy him now.

2234
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:37.580
There's a lot of counterfeit ones.

2235
02:10:39.450 --> 02:10:44.030
And apparently there's so much of a demand for Cuban cigars that the quality has

2236
02:10:44.031 --> 02:10:46.330
diminished.
Really some of them.
Yeah.

2237
02:10:46.490 --> 02:10:48.560
It's they're just not worth as much as they used to be.

2238
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:51.530
They're just not as good rather as they used to be because the soil's getting

2239
02:10:51.531 --> 02:10:56.531
depleted and there's a lot of fake ones a lot of counterfeit Cuban cigars.

2240
02:10:56.730 --> 02:10:59.310
But it's another one of those things just like the fucking rich guys that want

2241
02:10:59.311 --> 02:11:02.760
to go to Everest as you can bring in a hundred dollars worth of alcohol tobacco

2242
02:11:02.761 --> 02:11:03.594
from Cuba.

2243
02:11:03.870 --> 02:11:06.780
<v 4>But do they sell them.
Do they sell them here in the States.
Yeah.</v>

2244
02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:11.010
I just do it again.
I put this fucking stupid face up.

2245
02:11:11.070 --> 02:11:14.940
I might be retarded I need to go to a doctor.
Maybe that's what's happening.

2246
02:11:14.970 --> 02:11:19.830
This thing's making me stupid.
That's it.
I'll find out.
Yeah.
No no no.

2247
02:11:19.950 --> 02:11:20.940
That's what happened to everybody.

2248
02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:23.790
Well then why why Stephen King say it makes him smarter

2249
02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:26.670
well he's just saying it makes.

2250
02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:28.290
<v 6>Oh you mean his brain work.</v>

2251
02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.530
Maybe it makes him maybe makes you more creative but not smarter.

2252
02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:34.500
<v 11>Well that's what Tony Hinchcliffe says Tony Hinchcliffe says when he smokes and</v>

2253
02:11:34.501 --> 02:11:38.040
he writes it just way better.
I mean brains is firing up.

2254
02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:41.950
<v 3>Well it's almost like you know all those.
Well I guess everybody smokes.</v>

2255
02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:43.130
It's not really you know.

2256
02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:45.830
But like all those old writers you think about like Hemingway or he does all

2257
02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:46.740
smoking and drinking.

2258
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.660
Well how about NASA when they were trying to do the moon landing ship.

2259
02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:52.510
<v 26>They're all in the fucking control room.</v>

2260
02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:54.240
<v 5>They're all puffin.
It's kind of crazy.</v>

2261
02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:57.440
Yeah they all had those weird like they're smoking in the spaceship.

2262
02:11:57.660 --> 02:12:01.470
There's no I don't know what it's there's like on the moon.

2263
02:12:01.530 --> 02:12:05.020
There's like so many cigarette butts up there.
They put the flag on them.

2264
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:06.263
Buzz Aldrin.

2265
02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:08.373
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2266
02:12:08.490 --> 02:12:13.490
The control room though in Houston when they were there were all like monitoring

2267
02:12:13.831 --> 02:12:17.280
it like they were all smoking is a bunch of guys smoking and they all looked

2268
02:12:17.281 --> 02:12:21.690
like Peter Parker's boss from Spider-Man.
I like those haircuts.

2269
02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:27.610
What's his name Jay Jonah Jameson.
Yeah that's.
That's what it looks like.

2270
02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:31.700
They're old school.
They all died in their 50s.
Cancer see.
Yeah that's it

2271
02:12:33.250 --> 02:12:37.380
got to a certain age just don't go wise old man.
It didn't make it.

2272
02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:39.100
Smoke cigarettes die.

2273
02:12:39.730 --> 02:12:44.730
A few hardy souls last deep in their 60s and they dark like days when they had

2274
02:12:44.891 --> 02:12:49.600
those remember those things you'd see people had those things on their neck so

2275
02:12:49.601 --> 02:12:50.980
they get down do you like that.

2276
02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:53.890
<v 24>Yeah do they do that anymore.
Is that a good question.</v>

2277
02:12:54.850 --> 02:12:58.330
There's a commercial that the air from some some woman she was beautiful when

2278
02:12:58.331 --> 02:13:01.280
she was younger and then she smoked a lot of cigarettes and got cancer and now

2279
02:13:01.290 --> 02:13:04.350
are half her face is missing and she's got no throat.

2280
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:08.920
She wears a wig and and yeah she has like the whole I really hate those

2281
02:13:08.921 --> 02:13:12.190
commercials and gee whiz this thing on her neck.

2282
02:13:13.210 --> 02:13:17.020
I get the point of the commercials but they're so unpleasant.

2283
02:13:17.050 --> 02:13:18.020
Which is the point you know.

2284
02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:21.310
But there was a hack thing that comedians used to do I don't know who invented

2285
02:13:21.311 --> 02:13:21.700
it for us.

2286
02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:26.380
I think it was probably Hicks who first started putting the microphone he put a

2287
02:13:26.381 --> 02:13:30.850
microphone neck and started dialing like that and then Leary kind of ripped it

2288
02:13:30.851 --> 02:13:33.640
off from Hicks and a bunch of other people started ripping off from each other.

2289
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.270
It became like well no one could tell you you can't do that.

2290
02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:40.870
And yeah it was the hack thing to do and you did a thing about smoking.

2291
02:13:40.930 --> 02:13:44.680
Yes stick the microphone on your neck to represent those things.

2292
02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:47.260
These have a thing they used to have to put.
Yeah it was

2293
02:13:49.190 --> 02:13:52.680
like you said a voice.
Yes it was just it was just something that vibrated right.

2294
02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:56.160
Did it did what your vocal cords would do.
Yeah or it.
Yeah.

2295
02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:59.640
Somehow or another picked up on the sounds you were trying to make with your

2296
02:13:59.641 --> 02:14:03.000
fucking cancer ridden neck and now would just be able to send it through our

2297
02:14:03.001 --> 02:14:03.810
mind.

2298
02:14:03.810 --> 02:14:07.590
That technology so that's the new and maybe mine would work better if you're

2299
02:14:07.610 --> 02:14:11.490
smoking can only worry about throat cancer anyway and I'm neither.

2300
02:14:11.550 --> 02:14:14.990
Fuck that thing.
Yeah.
That's an honor we're on our way to becoming aliens right.

2301
02:14:15.090 --> 02:14:17.460
Aliens have those little tiny mouths because they didn't need em anymore.

2302
02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:21.270
Yeah big giant stupid heads cause all they're doing is like sending data with

2303
02:14:21.271 --> 02:14:23.850
their heads and needles large hard drive up there.

2304
02:14:24.020 --> 02:14:28.920
Well we'll probably end up just being computers will upload us into like some

2305
02:14:28.921 --> 02:14:30.270
sort of hard drive cause.

2306
02:14:31.110 --> 02:14:34.710
<v 10>Probably more complicated in that we're probably going to be some sort of</v>

2307
02:14:34.770 --> 02:14:39.770
artificial creation like an artificial body not necessarily a computer but like

2308
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:45.060
you know everything about us artificial not like living well you know eventually

2309
02:14:45.061 --> 02:14:46.650
probably a virtual thing.
Mm hmm.

2310
02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:49.200
Well I realized like why we saw hung up on bodies.

2311
02:14:49.590 --> 02:14:53.520
<v 3>Yeah you know just like maybe they'll just be it'll probably be like a computer</v>

2312
02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:57.410
that has versions of us just kind of out of.

2313
02:14:57.560 --> 02:14:59.010
It's good to know where you came from.

2314
02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:03.000
You know computers paying respect like let's keep you know a lot of them

2315
02:15:03.001 --> 02:15:04.470
virtually inside of us.

2316
02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:08.180
And then the computers will go out and explore the galaxy and kind of yeah you

2317
02:15:08.190 --> 02:15:10.230
know and we'll just be kind of an interesting footnote.

2318
02:15:10.650 --> 02:15:14.580
<v 13>You know that they kind of pay respect to what the fuck.
Yeah.</v>

2319
02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:19.920
<v 3>We'll be like and you go to the zoo and you see those like fake cave people you</v>

2320
02:15:19.921 --> 02:15:23.850
know.
Yeah.
Statues of the fake people by the cave Neanderthals.

2321
02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:25.620
Yeah I think this is where we came from.

2322
02:15:25.770 --> 02:15:28.860
You know they were kind of not as smart as we are and that's what we'll be to

2323
02:15:28.861 --> 02:15:32.280
the computers will have people.
These are these are early men.

2324
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:36.790
<v 18>They have people that are just bent over looking at their phone and that's this.</v>

2325
02:15:36.910 --> 02:15:41.530
That's what they're like that's baby us.
That's them with baby us.
Yeah.

2326
02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:46.350
Instead of like having a club where those big cavemen Flintstones style clubs

2327
02:15:46.351 --> 02:15:48.440
with the fur on like.

2328
02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:53.220
Like you know 2001 A Space Odyssey look and people.
Yeah.

2329
02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:57.210
Instead of that they just have a dude with an iPhone like at a Starbucks

2330
02:15:58.170 --> 02:16:01.710
tweeting about how great the Jinx was and then they'll have Google Glasses.

2331
02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:06.800
<v 10>This was the first step of Google Glass and then the ever seen the virtual</v>

2332
02:16:06.931 --> 02:16:08.130
reality ski goggles.

2333
02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:12.450
Where do you see the whole world in front of you becomes a desktop.

2334
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:14.860
You start manipulating things in front of.
Oh yeah.

2335
02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:18.420
And yeah it's like Minority Report gathering.

2336
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:21.600
Yeah but it's it's all you're what you're wearing goggles and through these

2337
02:16:21.601 --> 02:16:26.520
goggles you could see like I could see you but I also could like pull up things

2338
02:16:26.521 --> 02:16:29.520
in front of you.
Augmented reality.
Yeah this is a con.
Yeah.

2339
02:16:29.970 --> 02:16:34.530
Augmented augmented reality and then Oculus Rift.
Yeah that's gonna be huge.

2340
02:16:35.090 --> 02:16:38.310
Let's skip that comes out like this year.
I don't know.

2341
02:16:38.370 --> 02:16:40.110
I mean there's versions of it now like Duncan.

2342
02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:45.380
Duncan Trussell has he has an older version but he just tried the newest version

2343
02:16:46.561 --> 02:16:49.720
and he called me up screaming and ranting and raving.
Yeah.

2344
02:16:50.730 --> 02:16:54.820
Apparently it's in for K so it's just insanely graphic.

2345
02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:59.840
Like glue like insanely high definition beautiful video and the way they film

2346
02:17:00.121 --> 02:17:03.330
it.
They put cameras all over your body like these little small cameras are

2347
02:17:03.331 --> 02:17:07.080
everywhere you're moving so that option is available so long as you move to the

2348
02:17:07.081 --> 02:17:07.740
right you could.

2349
02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:11.220
They've already got video of that you move to the left in the processing speed

2350
02:17:11.221 --> 02:17:13.800
of computers today is apparently good enough to keep up with this.

2351
02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:18.750
Yeah and your you go into a room and when you go into this room is a guy playing

2352
02:17:18.751 --> 02:17:22.410
the piano and he goes you really feel like you're in a room with the guy playing

2353
02:17:22.411 --> 02:17:23.370
the piano.
It's that good.

2354
02:17:23.490 --> 02:17:24.323
<v 6>That's crazy.</v>

2355
02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:27.990
Yeah I was reading something about this company that's that's trying to start up

2356
02:17:27.991 --> 02:17:32.970
where what they're gonna do is take these because I think it's like a it's like

2357
02:17:32.971 --> 02:17:37.770
a spherical camera that is basically recording in all directions at once.

2358
02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:41.370
They want to go to like Everest.
They want to go to the pyramids.

2359
02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:45.090
They want to plant one of these things and you pay like a monthly service and

2360
02:17:45.091 --> 02:17:47.130
then you're just sitting in your home you're like I want wanna see what it's

2361
02:17:47.131 --> 02:17:48.540
like at the pyramids right now.

2362
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:51.900
<v 3>And you put this on and you're there they're going to put one on a satellite in</v>

2363
02:17:51.901 --> 02:17:56.220
low orbit I'm going around the planet so you can just be like floating in space

2364
02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:58.200
over like anywhere you want.

2365
02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:02.100
<v 6>And then the they're saying that like what's really gonna be crazy about it is</v>

2366
02:18:02.101 --> 02:18:06.230
how it's going to change news because like CNN will have their camera like you

2367
02:18:06.250 --> 02:18:07.860
know Fox News will have their camera.

2368
02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:11.250
So like you know something happens in Ferguson you know they go down there and

2369
02:18:11.251 --> 02:18:14.220
they plant their camera there and then you can just air all their viewers can

2370
02:18:14.221 --> 02:18:18.120
just go and actually be at like the where the news is happening and you can kind

2371
02:18:18.121 --> 02:18:21.450
of look around and see for yourself you can watch the State of the Union with

2372
02:18:21.510 --> 02:18:25.160
you know the camera there and you see what your specific state senator is doing

2373
02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:29.880
why you see John McCain playing poker on his phone doesn't going to war with

2374
02:18:29.881 --> 02:18:30.714
Syria.

2375
02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:35.280
<v 4>Remember when that was going on he was advocating going to war with Syria and he</v>

2376
02:18:35.281 --> 02:18:37.050
was playing fucking angry birds.

2377
02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:42.240
<v 7>They caught him doing it to me and he's still working there.</v>

2378
02:18:42.630 --> 02:18:45.770
I like that should be something you should be paying attention to Marin.

2379
02:18:46.130 --> 02:18:49.420
Maybe we should get somebody in there is paying attention not playing Pope on

2380
02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:50.950
their fucking phone dude.

2381
02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:54.930
Christ how trivial is war to you.

2382
02:18:55.630 --> 02:18:58.060
<v 5>Yes it is less important than Farmville.</v>

2383
02:19:02.090 --> 02:19:05.140
<v 2>Oh I can't help but he can't help but it's like someone sitting there talking to</v>

2384
02:19:05.141 --> 02:19:05.920
you at dinner.

2385
02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:10.920
They have to check their phone and the call of kings and queens and aces just

2386
02:19:11.381 --> 02:19:12.340
pulls him in.

2387
02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:15.280
<v 4>How old is he.
A thousand.</v>

2388
02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:19.030
Because people were like him when he was running for president people like he's

2389
02:19:19.031 --> 02:19:21.880
gonna die like yeah next year or two and that was eight years ago now.

2390
02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:23.320
Well he's unhealthy too.

2391
02:19:23.710 --> 02:19:28.080
I mean it's not like he's just old and he exercises a lot and now he's not Jack

2392
02:19:28.090 --> 02:19:32.670
Lil Wayne.
I mean he's he was really fucked up because of being a prisoner warm.

2393
02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:37.270
He was tortured and his shoulders are fucked up like really beyond repair.

2394
02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:41.290
That's the thing he can't raise his hands again like raise his arms over his

2395
02:19:41.291 --> 02:19:46.291
head and he's not like physically well but he makes sense sometimes just weird

2396
02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:49.840
you know he's not off about everything.

2397
02:19:49.930 --> 02:19:53.890
Like he starts talking like one of the things about when he and Obama were

2398
02:19:53.891 --> 02:19:58.891
debating he was they were talking about going into Afghanistan and you know

2399
02:20:00.371 --> 02:20:04.300
Obama was like you know we'll just go in and we'll send troops to take care of

2400
02:20:04.301 --> 02:20:05.134
the bad guys.

2401
02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:10.500
And McCain was like Whoa wait a minute man that's when we came made sense

2402
02:20:10.671 --> 02:20:12.280
because like this guy was in war.

2403
02:20:12.370 --> 02:20:17.050
<v 12>You know like was a prisoner of fucking war was tortured held by the Vietcong</v>

2404
02:20:17.470 --> 02:20:20.360
and he was like it is not that easy man like you.

2405
02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:21.610
Do you know what it's like over there.

2406
02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:25.480
One of the things that he said that really fucking stunned me and I had to

2407
02:20:25.481 --> 02:20:27.250
research and it turns out is totally true.

2408
02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:32.640
He said most of Afghanistan operates essentially exactly the way it did when

2409
02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:34.210
Alexander the Great was around

2410
02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:38.620
yeah he's like You're talking about a country that's never been conquered.

2411
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:43.690
Yeah like you.
It's the terrain itself makes it just almost impenetrable.

2412
02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:46.890
Like you you're going to send troops into the mountains.
Yeah.

2413
02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:52.580
<v 3>And it was like our plan to bankrupt the Russians was to get them involved over</v>

2414
02:20:55.631 --> 02:20:58.750
there.
Yeah with the same people that were fighting.

2415
02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:03.900
So it's like we we like set this great trap and then walked like you know just

2416
02:21:04.451 --> 02:21:05.284
forgot about it.

2417
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:11.140
It's like the kid from home alone went home one day and forgot all the stuff

2418
02:21:11.170 --> 02:21:12.400
that he had set for the burglars.

2419
02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:16.090
<v 4>Well it's almost like they set a trap and then didn't realize that trap had</v>

2420
02:21:16.091 --> 02:21:16.924
heroin in it.

2421
02:21:17.850 --> 02:21:21.400
<v 5>Oh wait a minute.
This isn't a church.
We left other great hair.</v>

2422
02:21:22.570 --> 02:21:24.300
Forget what I said.
Forget what I said.

2423
02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:30.160
Let's try one more time but do it right and grow heroin.

2424
02:21:30.310 --> 02:21:33.670
OK.
This is gonna cost us so much money.
Not really.

2425
02:21:34.850 --> 02:21:38.300
It's actually just minor to certain around.
I can move it.

2426
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:41.020
<v 11>Oh well the beautiful thing they found recently.</v>

2427
02:21:42.190 --> 02:21:46.390
They said they found recently that there's trillions of dollars worth of

2428
02:21:46.391 --> 02:21:51.150
minerals in the mountains.
Yeah it's the stuff they use to make batteries.
Yeah.

2429
02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:52.150
To blow on this thing.

2430
02:21:56.680 --> 02:22:01.680
<v 23>Now makes noise I mean the whole for a broken zip file and it's full.</v>

2431
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:05.840
<v 4>You had to do it because you saw me do it.
Get it out.
You get that pole.</v>

2432
02:22:05.930 --> 02:22:10.190
Monkey see monkey do.
It's exciting.
It's like Pavlov's dog.

2433
02:22:10.250 --> 02:22:11.083
<v 27>Ring that bell</v>

2434
02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:16.280
This is not going to be a regular thing.

2435
02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:18.770
<v 5>Listen to this podcast he got.</v>

2436
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:21.860
He asked me if he could do his and I said All right.
Yeah.
Do it man.

2437
02:22:22.270 --> 02:22:26.920
<v 11>And then I'm fucking doing it to have bottles of this shit.
What if I drank that.</v>

2438
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:28.370
How quick would I die Piper.

2439
02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:33.470
<v 23>I think I think within Yeah like the whole bottle.</v>

2440
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:34.423
Mm hmm.

2441
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:37.330
<v 5>Ten dollars says that you die with.</v>

2442
02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:40.650
If you put that into someone's drink I.

2443
02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:44.030
<v 4>You know people were talking about porn roofies in someone's drink what do you</v>

2444
02:22:44.031 --> 02:22:47.000
pour this into like someone had like a younger bomb.

2445
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:48.170
Yeah you just have a heart attack.

2446
02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:51.590
You just probably have a heart attack within a couple hours.
Yeah.
Right.

2447
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:55.040
The stimulant.
It's crazy this guy sent me fucking heart attack juice.

2448
02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:56.900
I got it my fingers.
Is that bad.

2449
02:22:57.890 --> 02:23:00.580
<v 5>I don't think I don't think we do.
Dude you had gloves on.
Yeah.</v>

2450
02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:03.710
That was back in 2007.
I'm sure they've changed the formula.

2451
02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:08.920
I'm sure this is random guy this guy's going to even know what his face looks

2452
02:23:09.081 --> 02:23:09.320
like.

2453
02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:12.730
<v 23>How dare I miss the whole thing is ridiculous man.</v>

2454
02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:17.160
<v 3>What's the next thing you know.
Well they vaporized alcohol now.</v>

2455
02:23:17.930 --> 02:23:21.290
Have you seen that.
Yeah you look it up on YouTube it's crazy.
Yeah.

2456
02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:25.190
It's this it's like this little kit you can buy and you like heat it up and you

2457
02:23:25.191 --> 02:23:29.450
put like alcohol on it and then people just taken these vapor hits of alcohol

2458
02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:31.190
that's quick and then they just.

2459
02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:34.520
The FDA just legalized powdered alcohol this week.

2460
02:23:35.810 --> 02:23:40.430
So now you can like snort vodka.
What.
Yeah they approved it.

2461
02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:45.740
That can't be good.
It sounds but you know sounds worth trying.

2462
02:23:46.170 --> 02:23:49.490
<v 4>Would you try it.
Oh yeah.
How would you know Mitch.
Just guess.</v>

2463
02:23:49.610 --> 02:23:52.790
Like you know one of the good things about our cause it's super powerful.

2464
02:23:53.060 --> 02:23:55.880
But you kind of know what a shot of tequila is right.

2465
02:23:56.090 --> 02:23:58.220
Shot of tequila is pretty uniform.
Mm hmm.

2466
02:23:58.580 --> 02:24:03.290
You know that's why I like whiskey is okay.
But moonshine is illegal.

2467
02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:06.760
<v 3>Well I guess I never thought about it but yeah you're right.</v>

2468
02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:10.730
Cause there's some there's some sort of well isn't moonshine just illegal

2469
02:24:10.731 --> 02:24:12.800
because it's unregulated.
Yeah.

2470
02:24:12.890 --> 02:24:16.070
You know and they don't know how what the percentages are putting in there.

2471
02:24:16.470 --> 02:24:19.190
<v 4>Like ever clear that stuff's legal right.
Yeah.</v>

2472
02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:23.750
And then some states some states some states it's not yes states have weird laws

2473
02:24:23.751 --> 02:24:26.960
on booze like Utah has got weird laws on booze like your beer can't even be that

2474
02:24:26.961 --> 02:24:30.140
strong.
Yeah.
Because Mormons.
Yeah.
Fucking Mormons.

2475
02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:35.030
I was there recently and it was hilarious when we landed.

2476
02:24:35.290 --> 02:24:38.750
We're coming down the escalator and there was all these people that were waiting

2477
02:24:38.751 --> 02:24:41.000
there for the missionaries to return.

2478
02:24:41.210 --> 02:24:45.680
The elders were in like foreign countries convincing these poor people to sign

2479
02:24:45.681 --> 02:24:49.010
up and become Mormons and not drink caffeine.
It's so fucked up man.

2480
02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:51.170
So we're coming down the aisle.
Now you can drink caffeine.

2481
02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:52.760
I really can drink coffee.

2482
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:57.980
It's a loophole you can't drink you can't drink coffee but you can drink

2483
02:24:57.981 --> 02:24:58.560
caffeine.

2484
02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:01.470
So my friend who was a Mormon used to drink Monster Energy drinks all day.

2485
02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:06.440
Oh and I was like wait a minute you're not allowed to drink coffee but you could

2486
02:25:06.441 --> 02:25:07.080
drink that.

2487
02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:09.670
<v 5>He's like guys uncovered not covered by Jesus</v>

2488
02:25:12.170 --> 02:25:16.040
Jesus doesn't say anything about fucking XYZ college he drinks he's cool with

2489
02:25:16.041 --> 02:25:19.730
taurine what is taurine bad for you.

2490
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:21.590
<v 4>Probably that's the shit that's in red bull right.</v>

2491
02:25:22.530 --> 02:25:25.460
Just fucking dude I'm not telling.
I'm not lying.
He.

2492
02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:26.870
I never saw him was like he was.

2493
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:31.250
His arm is connected to his can of fuckin monster energy drink and drink that

2494
02:25:31.251 --> 02:25:32.084
shit all day long.

2495
02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:33.530
<v 0>Yeah.
You haven't got something.</v>

2496
02:25:33.860 --> 02:25:37.160
If they if that's anything you can have and you're going to be addicted to it.

2497
02:25:37.250 --> 02:25:41.870
<v 11>Well before he was a Mormon he was a he had some issues with some substances and</v>

2498
02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:45.370
then his wife got him to convert over and then he just went with the program.

2499
02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:47.520
But he liked his caffeine.

2500
02:25:47.570 --> 02:25:51.590
So he came in Monster's energy drink kind of a guy but a lot of those dudes that

2501
02:25:51.591 --> 02:25:53.810
are like AA guys cigarettes and coffee.

2502
02:25:54.570 --> 02:25:58.310
Yeah they're not drug free by any goddamn stretch of the imagination.

2503
02:25:58.550 --> 02:26:02.340
They're just not taking anything that just a bullet or your consciousness right.

2504
02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:05.900
They're just altering it on a consistent basis.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2505
02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:09.410
For some it's a little easier on your liver.
Yeah it's definitely easy.

2506
02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:12.290
Well the cigarettes aren't cigarettes bad for your liver.

2507
02:26:12.310 --> 02:26:13.490
I don't know bad for everything.

2508
02:26:13.700 --> 02:26:16.580
Your whole body is like what do we do with the shits in your bloodstream.

2509
02:26:16.970 --> 02:26:19.700
Your pancreas apparently pancreatic cancer is a big one.

2510
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:22.930
Cigarette smokers the lungs of course but this.

2511
02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:27.200
You know it's it's done so many different processes in your body.

2512
02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:30.590
There's so many different things that are just going what is all this shit.

2513
02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:33.500
<v 5>People should just do nitrous all day every day.</v>

2514
02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:37.530
That's how things do with this man.
There's something about doing whippet.

2515
02:26:37.610 --> 02:26:40.550
If you commit to like whip hits and huffing paint you're kind of in the same

2516
02:26:40.551 --> 02:26:42.440
category.
Like wait wait what are you doing.

2517
02:26:42.770 --> 02:26:45.350
I'm taking some stuff that you're not supposed to get high with and you're using

2518
02:26:45.351 --> 02:26:46.970
it to get high.
That's not cool.

2519
02:26:49.450 --> 02:26:53.630
But meanwhile whip it's the whip it's fuck you up more than a glass of Jack

2520
02:26:53.631 --> 02:26:55.100
Daniels whip its are amazing.

2521
02:26:55.800 --> 02:27:00.020
They're like I went through a phase I was done a lot of efforts and oh God.

2522
02:27:00.050 --> 02:27:04.670
<v 3>And it was you know I mean you have had to stop because it was just like this is</v>

2523
02:27:04.820 --> 02:27:07.430
I enjoy this but you just can't give you brain damage.

2524
02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:09.370
Well everything there's you're brain damaged doesn't it.

2525
02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:14.120
I mean you lose like two hundred or twenty thousand brain cells a day just from

2526
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:17.390
you know waking up you know kind of walking around like so it's I mean I think

2527
02:27:17.391 --> 02:27:21.080
it's you know you have like a thousand and you get new ones.

2528
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:25.460
No.
Yeah.
I don't get no one ever.
No.
Fuck.

2529
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:27.470
I think it's I think you have what you have.

2530
02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:30.380
I think you get new ones if you do mushrooms and showing what that makes sense.

2531
02:27:30.530 --> 02:27:32.220
Probably really for real.
Yeah.

2532
02:27:32.450 --> 02:27:36.410
<v 11>It's like one of the few things that I've been shown to like regenerate neurons</v>

2533
02:27:36.411 --> 02:27:38.910
in the brain or something like that so just do as much mushrooms as you are

2534
02:27:38.911 --> 02:27:40.190
doing nitrous and you'll be fine.

2535
02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:43.820
Maybe you would probably have to live in a mountain somewhere and get so

2536
02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:48.350
detached from everybody's show yourself when you get firewood and go back to

2537
02:27:48.351 --> 02:27:49.184
your cabin.

2538
02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:54.580
<v 3>I was I was doing a sketch like a music video for this country music song called</v>

2539
02:27:55.340 --> 02:27:59.060
you knows about blue laws in states like you know and if they won't tell you

2540
02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:03.320
alcohol you know that the song is called What About mouthwash and it is like you

2541
02:28:03.321 --> 02:28:06.330
know all these different things like what about mouthwash What about huffing

2542
02:28:06.350 --> 02:28:10.580
paint and all these things that you could you could do and for the music video

2543
02:28:10.850 --> 02:28:15.850
it was like oh fuck it we'll just you know we're in the truck got some paint and

2544
02:28:16.490 --> 02:28:17.780
spray paint in a bag.

2545
02:28:17.810 --> 02:28:21.500
<v 6>And my friend had like mouthwash and so we're just like did it for the shot.</v>

2546
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:26.660
<v 3>And I I just you know cause the shot was on so I just sprayed the spray paint in</v>

2547
02:28:26.661 --> 02:28:31.661
the bag and then I just huffed in and it's so fast it's so immediate and it's so

2548
02:28:33.711 --> 02:28:34.544
high.

2549
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:40.000
<v 5>Do to you it's like we did it and I was like and then I kind of broke take.</v>

2550
02:28:40.250 --> 02:28:44.780
<v 3>I was like whoa like you know like this really works like huffing paint is like</v>

2551
02:28:44.781 --> 02:28:47.270
the real deal.
Oh that's so funny.
It's quick.

2552
02:28:47.690 --> 02:28:48.560
<v 4>That's so funny.</v>

2553
02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:52.700
Oh have you ever talked to someone who works in an auto body shop like spray

2554
02:28:52.701 --> 02:28:54.150
painting cars.
No.

2555
02:28:54.350 --> 02:28:57.260
You know they wear those masks and shit but it doesn't really work.

2556
02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:01.040
I mean it works a little bit but if you're spray painting a car you go into

2557
02:29:01.041 --> 02:29:01.790
those boots.

2558
02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:06.770
<v 5>Those guys get high as far back as like the hidden secret of auto body work.</v>

2559
02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:08.270
It's such a dirty high kill.

2560
02:29:08.450 --> 02:29:13.450
I'd imagine the paint high this huffing it doesn't feel like like it's good for

2561
02:29:14.121 --> 02:29:14.954
you

2562
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:19.940
like you're drinking kills Yeah you're like lightheaded and you're like well I'm

2563
02:29:19.941 --> 02:29:22.970
high and you're like this is gonna feel bad when it wears off.

2564
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:27.260
Oh God that's so crazy.
Wow.

2565
02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:31.830
Do you everybody seen those images of the guy who got arrested several times he

2566
02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:36.840
has paint a fucking goatee of silver paint over his face like fuck man it's so

2567
02:29:39.111 --> 02:29:39.980
weird.

2568
02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:43.280
<v 9>You ever see that.
I forget what show it was.</v>

2569
02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:47.270
It's one of those if there's a rehab show or something.
Interventions show.
Yeah.

2570
02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:52.320
<v 3>Where the gross is addicted a duster the dust stuff these brand you see on your</v>

2571
02:29:52.330 --> 02:29:55.380
keyboard that area.
What does that do to you.
I guess it gets you high.

2572
02:29:55.440 --> 02:30:00.440
And I've never done it but like she was going through like she just would

2573
02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:04.630
forward a Wal-Mart and she'd go to Wal-Mart to fill up her cart with duster and

2574
02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:07.340
she does this every day just because someone just does dusty all day.

2575
02:30:07.450 --> 02:30:12.450
<v 4>You know the problem with that show is I have been I've been exposed too much to</v>

2576
02:30:12.701 --> 02:30:16.490
how television works.
And I just as parliaments can bullshit.

2577
02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:21.460
Part of me saying like you this person is so together that they've contacted the

2578
02:30:21.461 --> 02:30:25.780
producers of this show they're on the show they're walking around the cameras

2579
02:30:25.781 --> 02:30:28.730
following them.
Really.
Sure.

2580
02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:31.960
<v 25>Are you sure they're not engineering this whole thing but do they call or do</v>

2581
02:30:31.961 --> 02:30:36.380
their families call.
That's a good question.
I just don't get why.

2582
02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:40.870
I mean like if I had a loved one who was like you know like I had a problem you

2583
02:30:40.871 --> 02:30:43.750
know I was like I gotta do an intervention like the last thing I ever think of

2584
02:30:43.751 --> 02:30:47.320
it is like I gotta get a TV show to watch this thing like you know you say that

2585
02:30:47.350 --> 02:30:49.900
but I mean what the fuck did Dr. Drew do for all those years.

2586
02:30:49.930 --> 02:30:51.130
<v 17>He's doing Celebrity Rehab.</v>

2587
02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:55.800
He took these people at their most vulnerable time and publicly shamed them

2588
02:30:55.810 --> 02:30:59.470
showed them on television having the DVD freaking out each other.

2589
02:30:59.740 --> 02:31:04.480
Screaming at each other incredibly vulnerable and expose them to the world for

2590
02:31:04.481 --> 02:31:06.640
other people's amusement.
And he's a doctor.

2591
02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:11.760
Yeah addiction specialist so only has I gotten dry when TV is involved in

2592
02:31:11.921 --> 02:31:15.660
profits involved people have weird ways of rationalizing things.

2593
02:31:15.850 --> 02:31:19.270
This is the only way these people will get help but you do it on TV.

2594
02:31:19.450 --> 02:31:21.960
<v 22>No.
But I mean like the family.
I mean do you think the family do they.</v>

2595
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:24.010
I guess they have to get paid something to do it.

2596
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:27.070
<v 4>They have to get paid something.
Yeah.
And it's not like a windfall.</v>

2597
02:31:27.130 --> 02:31:30.080
The family might be morons you know they might not think it's the way to do it.

2598
02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:30.760
<v 9>It's very.</v>

2599
02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:33.640
I mean there there is a show that I was obsessed with for a long time cause I

2600
02:31:33.641 --> 02:31:36.520
didn't know I was pregnant.
Have you seen that show.
Have you seen it.

2601
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:37.990
It's fucking amazing.

2602
02:31:38.890 --> 02:31:43.890
Find it on like iTunes or whatever but it's it's a show where they would.

2603
02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:47.200
It's about people who just didn't realize that they were pregnant then they have

2604
02:31:47.201 --> 02:31:51.400
their babies in the toilet or you know just walking to work or something and

2605
02:31:51.850 --> 02:31:55.450
they would reenact it like it was kind of like Unsolved Mysteries style where

2606
02:31:55.451 --> 02:31:58.750
they'd interview the real people and then they'd have actors like playing it out

2607
02:31:58.751 --> 02:31:59.770
like oh my stomach hurts.

2608
02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:03.280
I mean go take a shit and then the baby they put they throw the crazy thing

2609
02:32:03.281 --> 02:32:07.170
about the show is that I watched one episode where they had the mom get up you

2610
02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:10.270
know and then the camera goes in the toilet and they put a real baby in a toilet

2611
02:32:10.450 --> 02:32:14.440
like a real like for the shot fuck you in the water.

2612
02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:16.330
<v 5>Yeah they put a baby in that toilet bowl for the shot.</v>

2613
02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:21.460
<v 25>I like Mike didn't have a day Bronner is at an angle you can see I'm just</v>

2614
02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:27.180
holding onto a seat on the block mom but that I knew a girl who worked on the

2615
02:32:27.341 --> 02:32:32.341
show and I was my finish she worked on and I was like How do you why do people

2616
02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:36.460
you know agree to do because they all look like idiots there's no way you can be

2617
02:32:36.461 --> 02:32:39.880
on that show and not look like one of the dumbest people on you know if you

2618
02:32:39.881 --> 02:32:43.060
didn't know you were pregnant like I was like why did they agree to let you do

2619
02:32:43.061 --> 02:32:47.050
this episode about him she was like we are getting calls all day from people

2620
02:32:47.051 --> 02:32:50.920
wanting to be on the show like we have to you know we're batting them off

2621
02:32:51.310 --> 02:32:56.310
because it's people seeing the idea of somebody playing them on television is so

2622
02:32:58.631 --> 02:33:03.631
enticing to people that the fact that someone is going to reenact their life is

2623
02:33:03.951 --> 02:33:07.110
like worth it yeah I'll be it I'll look like an idiot on television that's so

2624
02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:12.120
crazy though that's the poll having someone play you Wow that's amazing there

2625
02:33:15.821 --> 02:33:19.240
was a girl that worked at the bank that I used to go to when I was a kid and she

2626
02:33:19.241 --> 02:33:22.090
had her baby and threw it in the garbage and went back to work.

2627
02:33:22.330 --> 02:33:25.150
<v 11>She worked at a bank.
No one knew she was pregnant.</v>

2628
02:33:25.180 --> 02:33:29.890
She was overweight went to the bathroom had the baby threw in the garbage and

2629
02:33:30.460 --> 02:33:33.030
went back to work and then they figured out what the fuck happened in the

2630
02:33:33.031 --> 02:33:37.770
wrestler.
That's crazy.
Oh so crazy it was like I'd seen her I.

2631
02:33:38.030 --> 02:33:39.640
Person to Person approach shook hands with her.

2632
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:43.750
I mean I don't remember like on the day 17.
No not on the day I think.

2633
02:33:44.050 --> 02:33:46.510
I think I found out about it like you know after the fact.

2634
02:33:46.540 --> 02:33:48.890
But it was like the talk of the town.
Yeah.
Like that.

2635
02:33:48.970 --> 02:33:51.980
I don't remember her name but you know I was like I think I was price 60 years.

2636
02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:57.360
I was working at Newport Creamery which was a ice cream and hamburger joint in

2637
02:33:57.641 --> 02:34:02.470
Newton Massachusetts.
So as probably I think I got that job when I was 16.

2638
02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:03.650
So it's probably when I was 16.

2639
02:34:03.790 --> 02:34:07.420
All this happened but it was just the whole town was talking about I was like

2640
02:34:07.421 --> 02:34:10.120
What.
She had a baby.
She was pregnant.
What.

2641
02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:13.550
That she put in the garbage like it was crazy.
Went to jail.
Yeah.

2642
02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:16.550
Whole thing was it really creep people it's creeps you out.

2643
02:34:16.570 --> 02:34:19.060
When you find out that insanity like that.

2644
02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:22.970
Was there the whole time and you were interacting with insanity like hello and

2645
02:34:22.971 --> 02:34:26.190
sane person Hi crazy you're about to have a baby and throw in the trash.

2646
02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:26.980
Yeah yeah.

2647
02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:29.830
You know like if you talk to her the week before you throw your baby in the

2648
02:34:29.831 --> 02:34:33.370
trash what's going to happen.
Who are you.

2649
02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:36.180
How do you know she might not have even known she was pregnant.

2650
02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:37.410
She might have been one of those people.

2651
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:38.800
<v 6>Oh a lot of the people who.</v>

2652
02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:41.950
Most of the people in the show who did other pregnant are overweight.

2653
02:34:42.220 --> 02:34:46.960
<v 4>Of course.
Yeah.
Yeah just.
They must be in such discomfort all the time.
Yeah.</v>

2654
02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:52.300
<v 23>Oh fuck man.
I don't understand.
Can't.
Yeah.</v>

2655
02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:53.573
Kenya.

2656
02:34:53.950 --> 02:34:56.440
<v 17>There's like there's certain levels of madness.</v>

2657
02:34:56.470 --> 02:35:00.240
It's like there's a scale you know like you could be like a little crazy when I

2658
02:35:00.250 --> 02:35:02.260
got this thing.
I have to wear a different color socks.

2659
02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:05.710
You know I have this thing.
You know I only wear my underwear backwards.

2660
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:07.900
You know how this thing I like to be a mascot.

2661
02:35:07.980 --> 02:35:10.120
I like to fuck other mascots and we get together.

2662
02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:13.350
I guess you could always get further and further down the crazy hole.

2663
02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:13.900
<v 3>I have this thing.</v>

2664
02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:16.680
I don't think I'm pregnant but if I ever am I'm definitely not going dumpster.

2665
02:35:18.970 --> 02:35:23.680
<v 4>Well there was a bumper sticker once I saw a car like a cop car that was like</v>

2666
02:35:24.370 --> 02:35:27.850
telling people they didn't have to throw their baby away and they could bring

2667
02:35:27.851 --> 02:35:29.260
their baby to a fire department.

2668
02:35:29.410 --> 02:35:32.400
Yeah the baby off or a police station like women went.

2669
02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:35.340
Who the fuck is like I'm on my way to the dumpster with my bike.

2670
02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:38.030
Oh look at that bumper sticker.
Oh I could just go to Fire Department.

2671
02:35:38.170 --> 02:35:41.350
I have options like you that you like what a great what a great service the

2672
02:35:41.351 --> 02:35:42.250
public is offering.

2673
02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:47.580
<v 3>I've seen fire department things with a baby drop like like window.</v>

2674
02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:52.150
I mean it's not like a like a block after you know but I mean it's like you know

2675
02:35:52.151 --> 02:35:55.690
it just says I've seen the sign that says like this is where you can leave an

2676
02:35:55.691 --> 02:36:00.691
unwanted baby so it must happen frequently enough that it's an regular thing

2677
02:36:00.970 --> 02:36:03.270
that like people are like you know that you know okay.

2678
02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:06.780
Fire departments are places that we can we can do OK.

2679
02:36:07.010 --> 02:36:12.010
<v 4>And that's I just it's more evidence that we are there's groups of people when</v>

2680
02:36:12.521 --> 02:36:16.270
you get to like when you have a city you know you have a million people or 5

2681
02:36:16.271 --> 02:36:19.900
million people or 10 million people whatever it is that when you get groups of

2682
02:36:19.901 --> 02:36:23.050
people that aren't really interacting with their neighbors they don't really

2683
02:36:23.051 --> 02:36:25.930
have real communities.
They don't they're not in real tribes.

2684
02:36:26.170 --> 02:36:30.130
They just sort of independent and wandering around is like madness all around
us.

2685
02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:35.760
Then which just like unrecognized unchecked madness ignored madness you know.

2686
02:36:37.090 --> 02:36:41.500
Yes all around us we just don't you know you don't have you don't deal with it

2687
02:36:41.501 --> 02:36:44.650
like if we there's only 50 of us we lived in the jungle together you know that

2688
02:36:44.651 --> 02:36:49.120
bitch is pregnant down Yeah you know Yeah well she wouldn't be fat she would

2689
02:36:49.121 --> 02:36:54.121
have to like gather food and everybody thin it's a wall it's a law how to drop

2690
02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:58.690
off an unwanted baby with easy pictures why now.

2691
02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:05.340
Safe Haven law you must drop them off at a police department fire station or any

2692
02:37:05.351 --> 02:37:05.980
hospital.

2693
02:37:05.980 --> 02:37:09.670
<v 7>If a parent were to change their mind they have 30 days after dropping off their</v>

2694
02:37:09.671 --> 02:37:12.400
infant to get their baby back from the state in 30 days.

2695
02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:15.840
<v 12>Makes me so sad.
That's crazy imagine.</v>

2696
02:37:16.060 --> 02:37:20.230
On the twenty ninth day the 24th hour he's come in I just want to be back.

2697
02:37:20.390 --> 02:37:22.210
Sorry you just missed the cut off.

2698
02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:27.230
Yeah it just it's 30 days right now.
Tick tock tick.

2699
02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:29.140
<v 3>I got baby.
Give the baby back.</v>

2700
02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:33.040
After one day like you know if if if you went through the idea if you like.

2701
02:37:33.070 --> 02:37:37.000
You know what maybe I'm going to drop this baby off at the fire department.

2702
02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:41.590
So you probably should drop the baby off at the fire so depressing it's so

2703
02:37:41.591 --> 02:37:42.424
depressing.

2704
02:37:42.460 --> 02:37:46.660
<v 15>Imagine being that poor fucking kid and you find out that your mom dropped you</v>

2705
02:37:46.661 --> 02:37:50.750
over the fire department possibly better.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Who knows.

2706
02:37:51.790 --> 02:37:55.160
<v 3>But then the fucked up thing is that all the babies have to become firefighters.</v>

2707
02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:59.140
It's part of a show about this where firefighters come from.

2708
02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:02.950
They've all been dry.
I think they come from store.
I could be wrong.

2709
02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.410
I think all firefighters have dropped off babies that grow up.

2710
02:38:08.190 --> 02:38:12.630
<v 4>Fuck and you have to live in the firehouse.
Yeah.
Where's my toys.
I want an axe.</v>

2711
02:38:14.580 --> 02:38:17.710
You got the coal pole.
You got the Dalmatian.
That's pretty good.

2712
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:19.990
It's great if your stripper early training.

2713
02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:28.210
<v 23>Fuck.
God damn what a weird world we live in now.</v>

2714
02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:32.800
<v 4>Just too many of us.
That's that's the only or too many of us.</v>

2715
02:38:32.890 --> 02:38:36.220
I shouldn't see too many of us because the cool thing about cities.

2716
02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:40.840
The cool thing about large urban centers is you get a high concentration of

2717
02:38:40.841 --> 02:38:45.040
intelligence to high concentration of cool people high concentration of like

2718
02:38:45.041 --> 02:38:49.300
things happening and things moving and progress but there's too many of us that

2719
02:38:49.301 --> 02:38:50.800
aren't in contact with each other.

2720
02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:53.410
<v 25>Yeah well it's weird.</v>

2721
02:38:53.650 --> 02:38:57.280
Didn't like the population of the entire world stays somewhere around 1 billion

2722
02:38:58.150 --> 02:39:00.760
for as long as we can like kind of for a long time.

2723
02:39:00.850 --> 02:39:04.450
Like you know hundreds hundreds hundreds maybe thousands of years.

2724
02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:09.840
And then like once we invented basic at once we figured out how to use fossil

2725
02:39:11.561 --> 02:39:16.561
fuels and like plastics and things very kind of it shot up to like 7 billion

2726
02:39:16.571 --> 02:39:20.950
within like 100 years.
Like you have more of a chance.

2727
02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:24.940
I mean there's more people now and there's ever been by like a huge long shot

2728
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:27.510
huge
yeah.

2729
02:39:27.580 --> 02:39:29.860
<v 12>There was a thing there was less energy though day David was talking about the</v>

2730
02:39:29.861 --> 02:39:32.540
population of the United States during World War 2.

2731
02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:35.500
And it was night in the 1940s.

2732
02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:37.930
It was one hundred and fifty million people or less.

2733
02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:39.893
<v 20>Yeah.</v>

2734
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:43.090
<v 11>Now it's more than 300.
It's like 350.
Is it 350.</v>

2735
02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:45.250
That's fucking crazy.

2736
02:39:46.330 --> 02:39:48.940
And then then the world population is much larger than that.

2737
02:39:49.270 --> 02:39:53.350
The world population was at the time I think only like 2 billion and now it's at

2738
02:39:53.351 --> 02:39:56.230
7.
Yeah.
Which is stunning.

2739
02:39:56.710 --> 02:39:59.220
Yeah astronomical increase in human being.

2740
02:39:59.270 --> 02:40:01.660
<v 25>What was that like 1 billion around like nineteen hundred or something.</v>

2741
02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:03.400
So that's like your whole world.
Yeah.

2742
02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:08.190
And so it's like doubled it doubled in like 40 years and now it's it's crazy.

2743
02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:12.150
<v 4>Yeah a lot of people.
And that's what makes you wonder.</v>

2744
02:40:12.330 --> 02:40:16.230
That's it but that's the other thing about the points to urbanization and to

2745
02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:21.570
improvement of the quality of life is that apparently when the quality of life

2746
02:40:21.571 --> 02:40:26.571
improves and there's more resources people have less kids and then also when the

2747
02:40:28.021 --> 02:40:30.510
quality of life improves and resources improve.

2748
02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:33.830
The the people.

2749
02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:38.900
How does it go that people have less kids because their careers are become more

2750
02:40:38.941 --> 02:40:43.941
important and they become more more concerned with progress and with their

2751
02:40:44.491 --> 02:40:48.180
career than they do with having a family so they have families later and later.

2752
02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.350
That's one things they also tribute to the high the increase in autism.

2753
02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:55.440
I think there's a contributing factor.

2754
02:40:55.480 --> 02:41:00.480
Apparently like several times several fold is when you have children after a

2755
02:41:03.271 --> 02:41:06.720
certain age like it's many men right.
Men and women but it isn't.

2756
02:41:06.820 --> 02:41:11.280
<v 21>Don't they think that it's linked to male sign that too that but women as well.</v>

2757
02:41:11.790 --> 02:41:15.360
<v 11>Women as they get older like birth defects increase in birth defect issues.</v>

2758
02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:17.790
They didn't think it was men at all for a while but now they do.

2759
02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:22.110
I used to think it was just the age of the woman but now they think it's the age

2760
02:41:22.111 --> 02:41:25.490
of the man as well the age of the sperm that's gone through the roof.

2761
02:41:25.570 --> 02:41:29.030
To think something like one in twenty five now or something like autism.

2762
02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:32.880
Yeah I think they also think that that's also because they die.

2763
02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:35.790
Yeah they didn't really know what was wrong with Billy and now know they've

2764
02:41:35.791 --> 02:41:36.624
given it a name.

2765
02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:40.440
He's got autism or he's got he's on the spectrum he's you know he's got a

2766
02:41:40.441 --> 02:41:42.570
spectrum disorders I've got Asperger's.

2767
02:41:45.470 --> 02:41:47.750
<v 18>Whatever dude.
What a great way to end this podcast.</v>

2768
02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:52.640
Started out on AIDS ended up on after dropping off babies has been a hospital.

2769
02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:56.660
You're special dude.
It was this past Friday.

2770
02:41:56.750 --> 02:42:01.730
<v 3>Yeah.
But it's available.
What's it called high end church.
Did you ever get Hydra.</v>

2771
02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:03.253
Actually I would.

2772
02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:07.880
I went to like a Christian school and stuff so I was like I never actually got

2773
02:42:07.881 --> 02:42:08.660
high in church.

2774
02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:11.510
My friend has a story about something happening my friend that I wrote the song

2775
02:42:11.511 --> 02:42:15.500
about but like I've been hired like church basketball games and things like
that.

2776
02:42:15.770 --> 02:42:19.250
It's just it's it's not it's like you went to it you grew up Christian.
Yeah.

2777
02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:24.340
My parents were Christian rock singers in the 80s like Stryker striper now they

2778
02:42:25.161 --> 02:42:28.310
were like folk folk kind of folk and then it became rock kind of thing.

2779
02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:31.000
But I grew up on a tour bus traveling around the country.
Why.

2780
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:34.310
Oh my God that's amazing.
Yeah.
Holy shit.

2781
02:42:34.370 --> 02:42:37.530
So you haven't really really conservative high school and you know.

2782
02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:43.250
Wow that's weird.
You break free.

2783
02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:49.040
Well I think it's it's when when something is around the land you know you're

2784
02:42:49.041 --> 02:42:52.140
kind of just you know as a kid growing up you're kind of just like OK.

2785
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:55.300
Does everything have to be about you know church that kind of thing.
Like right.

2786
02:42:55.340 --> 02:43:00.170
So you just sort of you know so then like when I was in school it was always me

2787
02:43:00.171 --> 02:43:04.400
in like two or three of the other quote unquote bad kids that would be at the

2788
02:43:04.401 --> 02:43:07.370
back of the class just like not taking things seriously and kind of making fun

2789
02:43:07.371 --> 02:43:10.640
of everybody kind of thing.
So it was just odd.
There was this kind of like that.

2790
02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:13.100
<v 11>You know Praise God praise God for people like you.</v>

2791
02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:15.440
Yeah but that that often happens right.

2792
02:43:15.470 --> 02:43:19.970
I mean Cara Santa Maria is a friend of mine who say she's a beautiful

2793
02:43:19.971 --> 02:43:23.780
intelligent neuroscientist who grew up on a strict religious household.

2794
02:43:24.020 --> 02:43:28.130
She's a devout atheist and you know her parents don't like her.
Yeah.

2795
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:33.250
Upset at her because she's an atheist and has metal in her face range.

2796
02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:36.890
But that's often times a case right.

2797
02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:39.770
Your parents are pushing a certain direction you rebound and go crazy.

2798
02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:41.150
<v 3>Yeah I mean the other bag.</v>

2799
02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:44.960
I mean the other kids that I would hang out with were like other pastor's kids

2800
02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:48.590
you know they're the kids in the back that weren't like taking things seriously.

2801
02:43:48.650 --> 02:43:51.560
<v 4>Yeah they did get tired of their parents tell them what to do.
Yeah.</v>

2802
02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:55.460
If you restrict your kids too much it's like what I'm saying about my daughter

2803
02:43:55.610 --> 02:43:58.100
the soccer shit like make them do anything man.

2804
02:43:58.510 --> 02:44:02.000
Ford make them do things you know you want your kid to not play piano.

2805
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:06.200
<v 3>Force them to play piano.
Fuck yeah right.
Yeah.
Sometimes it works.</v>

2806
02:44:06.230 --> 02:44:07.063
<v 11>But God.</v>

2807
02:44:07.760 --> 02:44:12.080
The amount of resentment that children have for from really like overbearing

2808
02:44:12.081 --> 02:44:12.914
parents.

2809
02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:17.420
When I was a kid I did this girl that went to Catholic school and our parents

2810
02:44:17.430 --> 02:44:19.520
like super strict Catholics.

2811
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:25.030
<v 4>And she was the biggest hoe bag because of that because of that like that girl</v>

2812
02:44:26.030 --> 02:44:28.740
probably fucked everyone who asked her.
Yeah.

2813
02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:33.380
Or everyone who wanted to take that Daddy.
But she's probably like 30.

2814
02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:38.060
She's went on a rampage like there was like a long list of people that I knew

2815
02:44:38.061 --> 02:44:40.960
that fucked her as crazy at a certain point time we were like.

2816
02:44:41.450 --> 02:44:46.370
By time we're like 19 or 20.
Like I dated her when I guess we were like 16.

2817
02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:50.430
And by the time we're like 19 20 I knew like a dozen dudes faster.

2818
02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:54.680
It's just chaos.
K was just fucking everybody.

2819
02:44:55.210 --> 02:44:58.270
And she was really pretty too.
So like everybody wanted to focus right.

2820
02:44:58.380 --> 02:45:02.910
It was just like she was just just all that suppression like her parents were so

2821
02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:07.920
overbearing so constantly drilling Jesus into her head and the Catholic guilt.

2822
02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:11.840
And she just couldn't wait to just finger herself and just start sucking Dad

2823
02:45:13.430 --> 02:45:17.330
run around and you know she would get so drunk that she would just throw up and

2824
02:45:17.331 --> 02:45:18.164
pass out.

2825
02:45:18.650 --> 02:45:23.650
She was out of fucking control and a lot of it was just her parents.

2826
02:45:23.870 --> 02:45:27.380
<v 7>They just they just they just wound that spring up so tight</v>

2827
02:45:31.210 --> 02:45:33.020
shot to the fucking moon.

2828
02:45:33.950 --> 02:45:35.540
<v 23>It's weird how that works right.</v>

2829
02:45:37.020 --> 02:45:41.300
<v 3>Were your parents overbearing about it.
Not.
I mean it wasn't.</v>

2830
02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:46.960
No it was I mean it was strict but it was like also not strict in weird ways

2831
02:45:47.060 --> 02:45:51.320
like you know like I couldn't watch most stuff on television.
Like what.

2832
02:45:51.350 --> 02:45:53.230
What was forbidden like Dukes of Hazzard.

2833
02:45:53.770 --> 02:45:56.270
No like like anything they had like more than one swear word.

2834
02:45:56.780 --> 02:45:57.890
Like I couldn't watch it.

2835
02:45:58.010 --> 02:46:00.980
So I watch The Simpsons and then they'd be like they'd say Damn something in the

2836
02:46:00.981 --> 02:46:01.440
back.

2837
02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:05.720
And my parents be like I want more and it's off and then be like oh god please

2838
02:46:05.721 --> 02:46:07.040
don't let Bart Simpson say Damn again.

2839
02:46:07.130 --> 02:46:10.010
No that to him was a swear word damn is a swear word.

2840
02:46:10.310 --> 02:46:12.920
And then I was allowed to watch R rated movies.

2841
02:46:13.970 --> 02:46:17.930
So and so still to this day like you know there's all these great movies that

2842
02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:22.850
you know came out and like the 90s that I just didn't really see stripes now

2843
02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:23.750
racing stripes.

2844
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:28.750
But like I remember like a cut like when I was in my early 20s like my

2845
02:46:28.821 --> 02:46:32.570
girlfriend realized that I'd never seen any Terminators.

2846
02:46:33.470 --> 02:46:35.600
She's was like you haven't seen any Terminators.
McKnight never.

2847
02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:38.520
Never saw any of them like that and she's like you have to watch the Terminator

2848
02:46:38.570 --> 02:46:39.403
like that.

2849
02:46:39.860 --> 02:46:44.860
So we watched all three of them like that and binge Terminator I watched all

2850
02:46:45.381 --> 02:46:47.120
three turn.
She's like What do you think I was like.

2851
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:48.150
I like the third one the best.

2852
02:46:48.170 --> 02:46:49.670
<v 19>And she's like You're crazy.
She's.</v>

2853
02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:53.490
But I didn't have the nostalgia play right.

2854
02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:56.240
<v 5>So I just watched them all once I was like No I liked that they blew the world</v>

2855
02:46:56.241 --> 02:46:58.860
up at the end.
I thought that was cool.
She's like No.

2856
02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:00.770
I was like the lady Terminator she was cool.

2857
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:03.170
No no no no it's the second Terminator.

2858
02:47:04.220 --> 02:47:05.970
The second is the one that's what she was saying.

2859
02:47:06.210 --> 02:47:07.400
I thought the first was the one.

2860
02:47:07.970 --> 02:47:10.340
No the first one has a really shitty special effects.

2861
02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:14.840
Try to watch it today on Blu ray you'll go What the fuck is that.

2862
02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:19.580
What am I.
That's not Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Things mean a silly putty.

2863
02:47:20.670 --> 02:47:25.410
<v 4>God so are your parents.
They're still around.
Yeah.
They still like super.</v>

2864
02:47:25.430 --> 02:47:26.263
Jesus out.

2865
02:47:26.270 --> 02:47:26.600
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2866
02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:30.560
<v 4>They don't perform anymore but they're like you know they're my mom's a teacher</v>

2867
02:47:30.561 --> 02:47:33.970
my dad's a graphic designer and failing.
Yeah but.
Yeah.

2868
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:39.200
That's wild man.
So what do they think about.
Like you.
What you do.

2869
02:47:39.290 --> 02:47:42.810
<v 5>They don't like it day to day.</v>

2870
02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:48.330
<v 3>You know my relationship is is fine with them.
You ever see you don't Trevor.</v>

2871
02:47:48.890 --> 02:47:51.140
No but they would watch Trevor.
Yeah.

2872
02:47:51.230 --> 02:47:55.040
Well yeah I mean they though they don't like the material or the things that I

2873
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:58.790
talk about or like what my you know comedy is usually about.

2874
02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:03.080
But you know I'm the same on the same.
On the other side of that coin.

2875
02:48:03.410 --> 02:48:06.170
They're happy that you know things are going well.

2876
02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:09.360
You know they're happy that you know that.

2877
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:13.040
It's like a weird you know we kind of try not to talk about right stuff.

2878
02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:17.900
Like when the special came out I was like You know I waited until pretty much

2879
02:48:17.901 --> 02:48:18.250
the end.

2880
02:48:18.250 --> 02:48:19.580
<v 28>Tom I guess called high end church</v>

2881
02:48:21.470 --> 02:48:25.340
and they were going out there and they were talking about they're like Oh we're

2882
02:48:25.341 --> 02:48:28.340
excited for your special you know we're gonna go over and meet with some of our

2883
02:48:28.341 --> 02:48:30.950
friends and we're gonna watch it when it comes out and they're like they're like

2884
02:48:30.951 --> 02:48:35.240
Is it something we should watch him like now you know it's like it's like

2885
02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:38.870
there's like one song you can probably watch I'll send you all the high end

2886
02:48:38.871 --> 02:48:39.704
shirts.

2887
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:42.860
<v 2>Oh that's funny.
Oh my God.</v>

2888
02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:44.720
Did they ever have a sit down with you like an intervention.

2889
02:48:44.930 --> 02:48:49.460
<v 3>No no no.
I mean it was more of like just phone arguments kind of.</v>

2890
02:48:49.730 --> 02:48:54.730
I did a song about the pope called the pope rap and that like.

2891
02:48:55.780 --> 02:48:58.350
And I knew I was about to come out.
It was from my last album.

2892
02:48:58.430 --> 02:49:03.200
And so I went home for Christmas one year and I'd already shot the music video

2893
02:49:03.230 --> 02:49:05.750
for it and I was like well I might as well just like you know what I'll do I'll

2894
02:49:05.751 --> 02:49:09.920
just kind of I'll just kind of nip this in the bud like I'll kind of show this

2895
02:49:09.921 --> 02:49:13.140
to him while I'm here I can answer any questions about it like you know.

2896
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:14.720
So it's not like this it was a bad idea.

2897
02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:17.100
It's like ruined Christmas is a big fight.

2898
02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:19.970
And so now I just I've learned from that I'm like just just don't watch it.

2899
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:21.620
What was there are you when they say to you.

2900
02:49:22.010 --> 02:49:25.240
Well it's just like you know why would you Oh you don't even know what it is

2901
02:49:25.250 --> 02:49:29.870
it's like I think a lot of it like they think that it's a personal or they used

2902
02:49:29.871 --> 02:49:32.180
to think that it was a personal affront to them.

2903
02:49:33.740 --> 02:49:38.740
And it's not you know like like you were rebelling against mom specifically or

2904
02:49:38.961 --> 02:49:42.920
mocking because because they were Christian musicians that it is that it's and I

2905
02:49:42.921 --> 02:49:46.340
could see them thinking that but it's like what I kind of had to explain is like

2906
02:49:46.700 --> 02:49:51.700
you know what I a lot of my comedy comes is about religion history and politics.

2907
02:49:53.570 --> 02:49:55.760
<v 9>But that's because that's where I grew up I grew up on like a civil war</v>

2908
02:49:55.761 --> 02:50:00.350
battlefield in Virginia like I'd go out with my grandfather and we would like

2909
02:50:00.380 --> 02:50:03.200
you know find cannonballs with metal detectors and like you would dig them up

2910
02:50:03.201 --> 02:50:04.850
and stuff like Hey yeah it's just history was everywhere.

2911
02:50:05.090 --> 02:50:09.350
My my uncles were Civil War reenactments you know like yeah it was like a big

2912
02:50:09.351 --> 02:50:10.580
history was that the big thing.

2913
02:50:10.850 --> 02:50:13.940
<v 28>What inside were they reenacting Bolzano they were confederates it's</v>

2914
02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:20.300
so.
Gone Yeah what they did.

2915
02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:23.720
<v 6>Ali what did they do they just put the outfits on and shareholders be hundreds</v>

2916
02:50:23.721 --> 02:50:27.830
of people you would be like you know they reenact whole battles like now when

2917
02:50:27.850 --> 02:50:32.810
you say reenact they use like muskets with no balls you just flash powder and

2918
02:50:32.910 --> 02:50:36.160
they all walked across the field walking Hilaire and then all the women come and

2919
02:50:36.161 --> 02:50:39.500
they dress up at the time they kind of cheer everybody on and it's like wow yeah

2920
02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:44.740
my god that must be awesome yeah well see I was born in New York and I came down

2921
02:50:45.750 --> 02:50:50.700
in all of my family lived in Virginia and so like everyone like when I read all

2922
02:50:50.710 --> 02:50:54.320
that when I was a kid everybody would play civil war and like all of my cousins

2923
02:50:54.321 --> 02:50:58.460
had like civil war outfits and I had and I was the only Yankee so I get my ass

2924
02:50:58.461 --> 02:51:02.030
kicked all the time and I was always like you know that's not how it happened.

2925
02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:08.020
<v 5>This is not a war really panned out like you know the areas you'd have to give</v>

2926
02:51:08.021 --> 02:51:11.000
you.
So they wanted the South to win all the wars.

2927
02:51:11.570 --> 02:51:15.440
<v 4>Oh well I mean I think did they ever allow like the South to lose because you're</v>

2928
02:51:15.441 --> 02:51:17.040
reenacting the war.
Well no no.

2929
02:51:17.090 --> 02:51:19.760
<v 3>In the reenactments are one thing I'm talking about when both planes make my</v>

2930
02:51:19.761 --> 02:51:20.594
cousins like that.

2931
02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:24.830
No no no they they did it authentically to like how the battles would actually

2932
02:51:24.831 --> 02:51:25.350
play out.

2933
02:51:25.350 --> 02:51:29.150
So see it's very organized like it's people just running around and you're

2934
02:51:29.151 --> 02:51:33.890
shooting and then I guess when you run out you like fake death or die and then

2935
02:51:33.891 --> 02:51:36.110
you kind of lay on the ground for the rest of the battle.

2936
02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:38.360
<v 17>What is the fucking motivation to do that.</v>

2937
02:51:38.390 --> 02:51:41.710
I don't know how any other day don't reenact World War 2.

2938
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:44.060
They don't know one storms the beach of Normandy again.

2939
02:51:44.340 --> 02:51:48.250
<v 3>Well we have both sides here and all their battle all the battlefields are here.</v>

2940
02:51:48.940 --> 02:51:53.120
Oh OK.
So he's on.
You know we can.
Yeah you could do it.
You can go to Gettysburg.

2941
02:51:53.170 --> 02:51:55.620
It's a couple hour drive from us people.

2942
02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:58.570
<v 4>You know my step dad when he said it was really depressing.</v>

2943
02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:03.480
He said I've never felt sadness in a location before.
He said his back.

2944
02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:04.480
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2945
02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:07.900
I was there he goes you could feel it you like you feel the fact that all those

2946
02:52:07.901 --> 02:52:11.170
people died there.
If that makes any sense at all.
Now is the dark place.

2947
02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:14.650
And he's not a woo woo guy is pretty straightforward guy.

2948
02:52:15.020 --> 02:52:18.640
So when he told me that I was like Wow.
Really.
Yeah.
You could feel it.

2949
02:52:18.730 --> 02:52:22.360
I'll bet Normandy is like that.
You go there.
I bet there's a heavy Paul you know.

2950
02:52:22.730 --> 02:52:27.640
<v 12>I'd imagine there was somebody who did something on Normandy where they did they</v>

2951
02:52:27.641 --> 02:52:32.641
made like like sand images of all of the bodies like the thousand that represent

2952
02:52:34.571 --> 02:52:37.360
the thousands of people that died on that beach.

2953
02:52:37.390 --> 02:52:40.190
And it was really creepy because you looked him is it me.

2954
02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:44.170
It was I think it's important for people to understand the actual loss of life

2955
02:52:44.171 --> 02:52:46.780
that you're dealing with.
Yeah but when this guy did it it was like an artist.

2956
02:52:46.810 --> 02:52:47.643
There it is.

2957
02:52:48.310 --> 02:52:49.530
<v 4>Well that's some.</v>

2958
02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:53.440
And those things that are there are those things from the war that are still

2959
02:52:53.441 --> 02:52:57.880
there.
Is that what that is.
Those those black things yeah.
Is that what those are.

2960
02:52:58.690 --> 02:53:02.470
I think they are.
I think that's what that is.
But I don't claim I'm that wrong.

2961
02:53:02.740 --> 02:53:06.160
<v 12>They're never gonna clean it up.
But look at what that represents.
That's crazy.</v>

2962
02:53:06.190 --> 02:53:09.640
Imagine being there and seeing all those fuckin bodies in real time.

2963
02:53:10.210 --> 02:53:13.990
I mean these people were showing up in boats and as they're getting out of the

2964
02:53:13.991 --> 02:53:15.730
boats are just getting shot at.

2965
02:53:16.270 --> 02:53:20.060
<v 22>Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop.
Yeah.
I mean it's like that.</v>

2966
02:53:20.130 --> 02:53:24.310
That's the mindblowing thing about America's big battles and wars.

2967
02:53:24.330 --> 02:53:28.210
I mean you go to basic training you spend all this time like preparing and then

2968
02:53:28.211 --> 02:53:29.950
you get dropped into something like that.

2969
02:53:30.730 --> 02:53:33.700
I mean how much of it is I mean it's I guess so I guess that's why you hear all

2970
02:53:33.701 --> 02:53:36.850
those whenever you you know hear an interview it's like a war veteran and

2971
02:53:36.851 --> 02:53:38.800
they're like You know I'm not a hero.

2972
02:53:38.860 --> 02:53:40.940
The real heroes are the people that you know die that day.

2973
02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:44.530
<v 11>I mean it's just like it's just luck you know you're just like one of the people</v>

2974
02:53:44.531 --> 02:53:49.531
that got through and like you know I mean it's just not that opening scene in

2975
02:53:51.041 --> 02:53:53.410
Saving Private Ryan saving Private Ryan.

2976
02:53:53.770 --> 02:53:56.950
Yeah opening scene when everyone's getting blown up in front of him and tennis

2977
02:53:56.951 --> 02:54:00.850
shoes is fucking right.
That's real man.
That's that's the real war.

2978
02:54:01.620 --> 02:54:04.660
You know that was one of the things about that Brian Williams thing that I found

2979
02:54:04.661 --> 02:54:09.661
particularly disturbing when Brian Williams got caught not telling the truth

2980
02:54:09.731 --> 02:54:11.410
about his helicopter getting shot at.

2981
02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:16.830
<v 4>What was interesting to me was not just that this fucking news guy lied but that</v>

2982
02:54:18.311 --> 02:54:23.311
the pilot of the helicopter he was on was telling his version the story because

2983
02:54:24.001 --> 02:54:28.740
they had interviewed him and he said well our power our helicopter did get hit

2984
02:54:28.741 --> 02:54:32.670
with small arms fire and the helicopter in front of us was the one that got hit

2985
02:54:32.671 --> 02:54:37.671
by the RPG and then we had to land and we had to drop off our our load first.

2986
02:54:38.580 --> 02:54:42.270
<v 26>And that's why we were an hour behind them.
But we were all in the same convoy.</v>

2987
02:54:42.570 --> 02:54:46.500
So he's telling the stories is essentially like letting Brian Williams off the

2988
02:54:46.501 --> 02:54:49.530
hook a little bit because you're saying like when we did get hit you know we got

2989
02:54:49.531 --> 02:54:51.810
hit we know we're being attacked there's no doubt about it.

2990
02:54:52.110 --> 02:54:54.510
And then a lot of people were like well why would he lie about that.

2991
02:54:54.540 --> 02:54:59.540
Because the lie doesn't make him look any better like you were you were in a war

2992
02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:03.100
you were getting attacked you did have to land.

2993
02:55:03.150 --> 02:55:07.530
You did take small arms fire and you were stuck in a sandstorm for two for two

2994
02:55:07.531 --> 02:55:09.030
days so that that all line story.

2995
02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:13.770
It's a fucking crazy story just a sandstorm just a being just watching another

2996
02:55:13.771 --> 02:55:15.870
helicopter in front of you get hit with an RPG.

2997
02:55:16.350 --> 02:55:21.350
But then the guy said that he got calls from all these other people that were

2998
02:55:21.421 --> 02:55:24.540
saying No you didn't have Brian Williams in your helicopter.

2999
02:55:24.570 --> 02:55:26.340
This guy did or that guy did.

3000
02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:29.850
And it was like more than one story emerging of different people saying that

3001
02:55:29.851 --> 02:55:32.610
they had Brian Williams in his helicopter and then he said you know what.

3002
02:55:32.670 --> 02:55:34.770
I don't even want to I don't.
I might be wrong.

3003
02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:37.980
I don't even want to talk about this anymore because because I've been doing

3004
02:55:37.981 --> 02:55:40.920
these interviews about this now all the nightmares are coming back.

3005
02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:45.900
It's like I tried to put this aside and it put in my mind.

3006
02:55:46.470 --> 02:55:51.120
<v 4>It made me really think about getting over traumatic situations like that and</v>

3007
02:55:51.121 --> 02:55:56.121
how much how much of the truth of that you know we're talking about like 12 plus

3008
02:55:56.611 --> 02:55:57.444
years ago.

3009
02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:02.250
How much of the truth do you retain in your memory and how much of it is just

3010
02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:07.710
really really confusing and fucked up because it is just bullets and chaos and

3011
02:56:07.711 --> 02:56:11.160
nightmares and dead bodies and who knows how many times that guy saw somebody

3012
02:56:11.161 --> 02:56:16.161
die and then they're asking him to recall a very specific instance where it's

3013
02:56:16.470 --> 02:56:21.470
one very specific unremarkable at the time news guy was with them.

3014
02:56:22.430 --> 02:56:26.490
Yeah unremarkable at the time because nothing happened other than yes news guy

3015
02:56:26.491 --> 02:56:29.550
was there he probably took a bunch of different people.
Yeah.
Who knows.

3016
02:56:29.580 --> 02:56:32.220
<v 3>I mean he's not excited that Brian Williams is in a helicopter.</v>

3017
02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:36.360
<v 26>Yeah I'm here.
The crazy thing is he's in war and he's getting shot at.</v>

3018
02:56:36.430 --> 02:56:37.950
He's got these all PTSD out.

3019
02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:42.660
<v 12>And so you know he said you know respectfully I just don't want to talk about</v>

3020
02:56:42.661 --> 02:56:46.680
this anymore just because of my memories like it's really fucking me up and all

3021
02:56:46.681 --> 02:56:47.940
these things that I tried to forget.

3022
02:56:48.060 --> 02:56:51.630
Now I'm being forced to remember them again and my memory might be fucked up.

3023
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:57.790
As I wow that is that's something to consider that memories are not carved in

3024
02:56:57.871 --> 02:56:59.670
stone.
They're just not they cheer.

3025
02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:02.530
<v 3>I mean there's there they're there.</v>

3026
02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:07.710
They're almost hardly used in courts you know eyewitness stuff like because it's

3027
02:57:07.711 --> 02:57:11.670
like it's you change you know embellishment.
Mm hmm.

3028
02:57:11.850 --> 02:57:16.850
Like you know you always tell me I always like you know tell a story and then

3029
02:57:17.281 --> 02:57:20.580
somebody you know from like 10 years ago and so maybe like that's not what

3030
02:57:20.581 --> 02:57:24.450
happened it happened like this.
And then you're like oh yeah you're right it did.

3031
02:57:24.510 --> 02:57:26.580
It's just kind of it's changed.

3032
02:57:26.740 --> 02:57:30.300
And you see it a certain way like it can just like small things but you're like

3033
02:57:30.330 --> 02:57:34.020
oh I guess that was this person in my mind I remember it being this other person

3034
02:57:34.021 --> 02:57:37.230
that was there but I guess you guess that person wasn't there like you know and

3035
02:57:37.231 --> 02:57:38.160
then you have to go well.

3036
02:57:38.460 --> 02:57:40.290
<v 4>Are you sure you got it right.
Right.</v>

3037
02:57:40.530 --> 02:57:45.530
It's like oh yeah I remember some things very clearly very clearly because I

3038
02:57:46.381 --> 02:57:50.910
kind of told the story more than once and the points in the story that were

3039
02:57:50.911 --> 02:57:52.830
specific were very important.

3040
02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:57.330
Well yeah there's some other stories that are just fucking loosely pieced

3041
02:57:57.331 --> 02:57:59.730
together flashes in my brain.

3042
02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:04.790
Yeah the images that I can kind of recall kinda and chain of events that can

3043
02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:06.210
kind of recall correctly.

3044
02:58:06.300 --> 02:58:10.140
Yeah but people are just some people are married to the idea that they remember

3045
02:58:10.141 --> 02:58:11.610
everything exactly how it happened.

3046
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:12.510
<v 3>Nobody does.</v>

3047
02:58:12.570 --> 02:58:15.950
I don't think it's it's the weird thing is like when you tell a story or like

3048
02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:19.380
something say something crazy happens in college and it's a story right out the

3049
02:58:19.381 --> 02:58:22.180
gate you know kind of thing and you're telling that story and you tell it story

3050
02:58:22.181 --> 02:58:25.020
for years and years and years and then a certain point you really remember the

3051
02:58:25.021 --> 02:58:27.930
actual event anymore but you remember the story you've been telling the story

3052
02:58:27.931 --> 02:58:30.620
forever like like you said it's going to be I remember when this happened you're

3053
02:58:30.630 --> 02:58:32.760
like now but I do remember the story you know.

3054
02:58:32.820 --> 02:58:35.340
I remember it happened but I have no memory of it anymore really.

3055
02:58:35.640 --> 02:58:38.340
<v 2>And then some people remember shit you don't remember at all.</v>

3056
02:58:38.630 --> 02:58:41.280
And then like come on man no remember we did that thing together.

3057
02:58:41.320 --> 02:58:45.690
Like I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about is this guy crazy or

3058
02:58:45.691 --> 02:58:50.130
do I just not have a memory of an actual event.
Yeah which one is this.

3059
02:58:51.390 --> 02:58:54.190
<v 23>Tell you what I mean to remember forever more this podcast.
Me too.</v>

3060
02:58:54.780 --> 02:58:57.270

Yes nicotine.</v>

3061
02:58:57.900 --> 02:59:00.380
<v 1>I think we're out of time.
We're gonna turn into a pumpkin any minute now.</v>

3062
02:59:02.470 --> 02:59:05.710
