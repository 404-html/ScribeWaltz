00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.890
The joe rogan experience by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,

2
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.300
fresh off the road.

3
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.260
<v 1>Sturgill Simpson.
Ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for doing this man.</v>

4
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.090
I really appreciate it.
And Yeah,
man,
you kidding me?
Yeah,

5
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.060
I'm here.
You're here.
I,
you know,

6
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.580
I had heard about your music from several people online.

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.080
I don't remember who made me take the plunge and download your shit.

8
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.760
Like a bunch of people would recommended you.

9
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.680
I had shooter Jennings on and along those lines,
like people said like,
hey man,

10
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:46.750
if you really dig shooter Jennings,
you have a checkout Sturgill Simpson.
Right?

11
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.500
And so somewhere along the line I downloaded,
um,

12
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.420
I think it was a well downloaded two cds,

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.370
but the,
uh,
turtles all the way down song,
that was the first song I heard.

14
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.780
I was like,
Oh shit,
this guy's doing something unusual.

15
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.330
You doing some psychedelic country music,
man,
you're,

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.730
you're mixing shit up in a very bizarre way.

17
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.220
<v 2>Um,
uh,
yeah,
just,
I don't know.
I grew up listening to everything.</v>

18
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:18.840
So,
but,
uh,
for whatever reason,
if I go to write or sing a song,

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.490
I can only do one of two things and that's either the same country or bluegrass

20
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:27.120
is what primarily grew up on.
So,
uh,

21
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.950
I dunno,

22
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.830
the first record I did was a very traditional country record in terms of some

23
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.930
magical lyrical elements.
And uh,

24
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.720
so this is before it was true,
I just,
I reached a point where it was like,
um,

25
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.520
I'm very happily married,
I'm sober,
you know,

26
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.230
for the longest period.

27
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:49.950
And just so drinking songs and heartache and all that wasn't something that I

28
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:53.300
was particularly very excited about tackling.
And again,
you know.
Right.

29
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.260
<v 1>Do you feel like you have to hit certain themes if you're doing country music</v>

30
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.250
because it just sort of falls into that?

31
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.350
<v 2>It seems to be somewhat self restricting and low is,</v>

32
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:06.950
it hasn't evolved very much even since,
you know,

33
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.780
60s or 70s right over there was,
there was periods that are very dated now,

34
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:13.250
like seventies and eighties country.

35
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:17.150
You can hear the production values and it just,
there's nothing tying,
you know,

36
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:20.960
even some of the timeless,
timeless singers that ever they've ever played.

37
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:21.351
The music,

38
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:26.351
the records that they made got subjected to these really bad tastes choices.

39
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.330
Right.
And it just doesn't stand up.
Um,
so I dunno,

40
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.970
date my producer is a really close friend of mine,
Dave Cobb,

41
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:38.480
who actually did shooters first couple of records.
Um,
she was a buddy.

42
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.100
He's a good dude.
Very,
very sweet.
Such a cool guy to hang out with too.

43
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.300
Yes,
I'm David and just Kinda,
you know,

44
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.820
I came to Nashville about four years ago,
almost five now I guess.
And I just,

45
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:57.330
I knew more than anything what I didn't want to do.
And um,

46
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.650
I met with Dave shooter actually I think told him one night we were all at a

47
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:05.110
Billy Joe shaver concert.
I didn't know any of those guys.

48
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.400
And they were sitting upstairs.
It was like shooter and Jamey Johnson's mother,

49
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.080
cats and Dave.
And,
uh,
apparently shooting was like,
hey man,

50
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.280
you see that guy right there and it tastes like a sleek suppose fucking country

51
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.120
singer in Nashville.

52
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.620
So the next day somehow my manager got an email from Dave and we had lunch and I

53
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:25.270
was like,
all right,
he's from Georgia.
We both love the same records growing up.

54
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.850
I just Kinda feel like I know this dude,
I can work with this guy.
Right.

55
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.070
And there was nobody in there cause I paid for both albums entirely by myself or

56
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:34.450
like dug a big giant hole of debt.

57
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.300
<v 3>Wow.
And then how much does it cost to put on an album?
The first one?
Um,</v>

58
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.480
<v 2>I thought when I was doing it,</v>

59
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.030
this may very well be the only time I ever get to do this,
you know?
Right.

60
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:48.130
And I wanted something that I could be proud of.

61
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.420
That's something my family can be proud of for once.
You know what I mean?

62
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780
It just,
I knew it had to be right and I couldn't compromise in any way.
And um,

63
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.630
there was a certain sound we were after.
So Dave,
he said,
well,

64
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.150
let's just get the guys that played on those old records and went,
yeah,

65
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:04.630
let's fucking,
let's just do that.
I didn't know how the game works.
Right,
right.

66
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.840
So then I'm looking up and next thing I know when we were a studio,
it was like,

67
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:12.360
this guy's like pig Robbins who pretty much invented country piano.

68
00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:13.420
He played on,
let me get started.

69
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.030
The first session was with George Jones on white lightning.
And

70
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.330
<v 3>what a fucking name.
Yeah.
He's going to be played with blonde on blonde.
Yeah.</v>

71
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:22.270
He's this old blind pig.
Robbins pig.

72
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.350
Hargis pig Robbins fucking name cut.
That's an American name.

73
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.130
You could probably be English to English
pink cause he,

74
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:37.900
I mean he toured with everybody plays on Patsy Cline records and bow.
Wow.
Wow.

75
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.510
<v 2>I knew when those sessions ended,</v>

76
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:44.060
I knew that I had absolutely done my best cause I had to,
you know,

77
00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:47.810
these guys would just bust your balls in a second,
you know?

78
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.240
And uh,
so we,
I feel like we sort of cleared my throat with that one.

79
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.790
And then Lo and behold,
a year later,

80
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.180
I found myself in a position where I was going to get to make another record.

81
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.980
He was like,
all right,
well maybe I'll,

82
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.850
this one will be a little bit more selfish or self was over for me.
So we,

83
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.010
Dave and I incorporated a lot of other elements of,

84
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.590
I guess Sonic Temple and you don't normally hear in most country music.

85
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.950
And they gave me the freedom to kind of go out there with the themes as well.
So,

86
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.150
um,
I was doing a lot of reading at the time.
Um,

87
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.060
always have like weird shit,
you know?
Uh,
we'll get there,
but,
uh,

88
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.760
I don't know me,
it was the most,

89
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.350
the most truly inspirational group of songs I feel like I've ever written

90
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.140
because it was just from a such a fresh place.

91
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

92
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.190
<v 2>You know,
maybe that's why the record's done.</v>

93
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.570
<v 3>It's very unique,
you know,</v>

94
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:47.200
it's very unique in that it has a lot of country sound to it.

95
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:49.990
But I like the turtles all the way down.
Song me,

96
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:53.740
who the fuck is doing songs about mind expanding consciousness,

97
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.250
expanding drugs in country music.
I mean that's just not being done,

98
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.120
<v 1>but it's still like really good country music.
Like I,</v>

99
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.070
I'm like a lot of country music,
you know,
then the eye,

100
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.340
even songs that are even like a song that's sort of a classic song with all

101
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:13.580
those themes that you talked about before,
like drinking a heartache.

102
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:17.850
If it's well done,
I still really like it,
you know?
Absolutely.
No,

103
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.540
I mean if it's,
if it's,
if it's pure

104
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.360
<v 2>yeah.
And honest and has great music,</v>

105
00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:26.170
I just didn't feel like I had anything to offer there.
Yeah.

106
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.170
<v 1>The sound though is a,
I think people are starting to accept that but not,</v>

107
00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:32.180
not even starting to accept,

108
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.190
but sort of for a long time country got classified amongst a lot of young people

109
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.200
as being like a dumb kind of music,
you know,

110
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.600
and unfairly so.

111
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.750
And I think that as some young people started getting into some of the other

112
00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:48.890
country,
like getting into some Johnny Cash songs for instance,
you know,

113
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.370
he started going,
oh this is country to,

114
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.540
okay well you can't say Johnny Cash songs are dumb.
You just can't.
I mean,

115
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:57.780
they were just,
he had too much crazy shit going on in those songs.
You know,

116
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.470
it's undeniable.
He moves a lot going on in between the lines.

117
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.940
There's a lot going on in a boy named sue.
I mean,
just think about that song.

118
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.020
I mean he had some great fucking songs and then he did the highway men.

119
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.280
And that was an interesting song to like that thing that he did with Willie

120
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.010
Nelson and uh,
who,
who else was it?
Was it the Christopher?
So yeah,

121
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.580
it was a Wayland and they did this,

122
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.750
this crazy song about reincarnation that to this day,

123
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.020
if you never heard it,
um,
go,
go find that song.

124
00:07:28.021 --> 00:07:30.750
The highway men and uh,
it's uh,

125
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.550
this wheelie wild song cause it's all dif different versus sung by different

126
00:07:35.551 --> 00:07:38.610
Kyle.
Like willy will sing one verse and then Johnny comes in.

127
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.320
I fly a star ship.
Oh my God,
that's a good fucking song.
It's just,

128
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.243
whew.

129
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.200
<v 2>Well,
you know,
weirdly it and it's,
it's so,</v>

130
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.550
it's funny to me that the country has this really rigid perception by the public

131
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:55.240
doesn't mean all.
If you look back at any of the really good,

132
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.670
great country singer,
they were all bat shit.
You know what I mean?

133
00:07:57.671 --> 00:07:59.200
It was just like someone who was colorful,

134
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.400
weird characters to ever walk through American history,
you know?

135
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:06.460
So I mean it,
for me,
it's not really much of a stretch.

136
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:10.030
I didn't feel like I was really going out there too far.

137
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:15.350
<v 1>You know what it is,
man?
It's south FISM.
It's like racism towards the south.</v>

138
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.490
It's like thinking that anybody who has a southern accent,

139
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:22.260
it's got to be a moron.
Thank you to anybody who's singing country songs.
They've,

140
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.080
they've got to suck.
That's it's what it is.
It's an urban form of classism.

141
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.740
Like we,
you look at that style of music and they automatically,

142
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.660
some people did for a while,
but I think guys like shooter,
guys like you,
you're,

143
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:39.110
you guys are opening up when honey honey band does a lot of country type sound.

144
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:39.700
Uh,

145
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.240
I think a lot of people are opening up people's ideas of what that sound really

146
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:47.300
is.
And you hear a great song.
It's like God damn it.
That's a great song.

147
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.400
It doesn't matter if they've got a banjo playing in the background.

148
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:53.000
You can't tell me that song didn't fuck you up.
You know,
I think,

149
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.010
I think people are starting to realize like there's,
it's just good

150
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.420
<v 3>man.
There's just good,
there's good disco songs,
man.
Okay.
You ever heard kiss?</v>

151
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:04.140
I was made for loving you to good goddamn disco song.

152
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.930
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
I'm not a kiss hater man.

153
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.130
I love the monkeys.
When I was a kid,
dude,

154
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.050
the monkeys had some good fucking songs.

155
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:15.900
I don't care if they put a deal together.
Diamond wrote half that shit.

156
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.530
Did he really?
Yeah.
That's one of the songs are so fucking great,
man.
Oh Wow.

157
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.830
That makes a lot of sense.
Wow,
that's incredible.

158
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.850
I like Neil diamond songs.
I set it.
I fucking said it.

159
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.410
I don't care what he's doing.
What his hair.

160
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.170
I'd like a god Damn Neil diamond song any day.
Yeah man,

161
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.000
it goes a genius.
There's,
and I think when you expand your horizon,

162
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.040
sort of open up your ideas of musical appreciation.

163
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:44.640
Like I've tried really hard with a lot of stuff and it just can't catch like

164
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:46.860
every few months or so.
I try with Chaz,

165
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.000
I'll throw some cold train on and I'll be able to compete BBB,

166
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.630
BBB [inaudible] I'll be in my car and then five minutes in I fucking snap.

167
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:57.800
I just can't take it anymore and throw some kid rock auto.

168
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.900
So just to turn it the other way,
I just can't do it.

169
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.770
It's probably the only music I never got into like like hillbilly jazz,

170
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.740
but I don't like,
I don't know Charles Mingus and guys like that.

171
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:11.340
Maybe I can listen,
but even in brief doses,

172
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:15.000
cause I just prefer like a melody,
you know?
Yeah.
I was like a song,
good song.

173
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.440
I think one thing that it's good for like jazz at a bar,

174
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.920
like if you're having a couple drinks and some jazz is playing in the
background,

175
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:26.780
it's not like a very recognizable song.
It's just interesting music.

176
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.560
It's interesting like background music.

177
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:34.500
But as far as it being my main focal point,
you know,
not really,
maybe I'm wrong.

178
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.870
Maybe.
Maybe I need to find the right stuff.
What are you listening to?

179
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.830
I tried a bunch of different shit.
Thelonious monk.
I've tried some cold train.

180
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:43.650
I've tried obviously the,
they're great musicians.

181
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:45.360
I mean there's no denying they have skill,

182
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.430
but it just doesn't gripped me in any way.

183
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:52.150
I don't know what it is you ever a bitches brew but Miles Davis,
right?

184
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.890
Killer.
Pretty killer.
Um,
I can do that.
Yeah.

185
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.740
I mean there's some rifts that I really enjoy for a lump,

186
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:02.380
but I can't like sit like I can sit and listen to the same Leonard Skinner he

187
00:11:02.381 --> 00:11:05.700
album maybe like three times in a row,
you know?

188
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.880
But it's very hard for me to listen to the same jazz stuff over and over and

189
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:14.430
over again.
I just,
I dunno,
whatever it is,
I'm missing it.

190
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:16.050
And Woody Allen's got it and I'm missing it.

191
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.240
You know,
there's,
there's,
there's a saying,
you know,

192
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.120
you're going to go play jazz until the money runs out.
Yeah,
I'm sure.

193
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.360
Well,
we were in a,
just in Philadelphia,

194
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:33.720
I was in Philly on Friday night and we passed by the jazz bar and we thought,

195
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:38.340
man,
we should go after the show.
Could fucking see some jazz.
Never did it.
No,
no.

196
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.170
We thought about it.
It's one of those things I would stash.

197
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:43.020
I've never said that because there's some jazz.

198
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.130
So how did you get into staying in country music?

199
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:50.520
Was that what you've always sang or did you do fuck around with other forms of

200
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:54.010
music first?
Oh yeah.
Well,
actually I didn't really have a choice.
Both my

201
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.340
<v 2>grandfathers played,
um,
you know,
well,</v>

202
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:00.000
actually we were in eastern Kentucky where I'm originally from.

203
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.080
Everybody's really plays music,
but it's,
it's what you do after work,
you know?

204
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.600
Yeah.
My mom's brother,
like all his friends,

205
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:11.120
they had this house and they just as these two twin brothers and they,

206
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.400
both of them never married,

207
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.720
so they turned their house into a fucking practice space and they just had this

208
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:20.310
pa and lights and shit.
The state set up all the time on it.
And uh,

209
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.820
so I was real young kid and I'd go over there.
I always played guitar and uh,

210
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.010
yeah,
I mean,
before I even really knew anything about music or songwriting,

211
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.860
I think I was learning how to play in a band just from hanging out with those

212
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:37.300
guys.
But yeah,
it was never encouraged.
It was there were like,

213
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.070
you don't think,
oh,
I can do this for a living,
if that makes sense.
Right.

214
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:44.260
You just do it because everybody's doing it.
Right.

215
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.770
And nobody thinks they're going to leave that situation or,

216
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.760
or for many other reasons.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
uh,
it is what it is,

217
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:54.730
but so yeah,
Dad's dad was a big bluegrass guy,

218
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.490
played mandolin and just shoved that shit down my throat.
I mean,

219
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.060
repeatedly until I accepted it.
And then moms,

220
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.450
my other grandfather,
he was like a big Merle Haggard,
Marty Hart,

221
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:09.310
Robin's guy and had an old Gibson,
a very beautiful voice.
Um,
he,

222
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.870
he,
he probably more than anybody,

223
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.650
we'd watch he hall and Shit when I was a kid and TNN and he kind of tell me

224
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.700
which of the guys were actually play in and the ones that were just holding a

225
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:21.580
guitar is a prop.
Oh Wow.
You know,

226
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.540
and like Roy Clark and Jerry Reed and guys like they're cute.
Yeah.

227
00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:29.500
I knew by the time I was five,
like I don't give a fuck,
but anything else ever.

228
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.640
Wow.
I gotta to drop task old in third grade at the same result.

229
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.000
Um,
that's interesting.

230
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:40.840
So you kind of groomed in the music sense,

231
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:45.430
but not maybe in becoming a professional,
right.
Yeah.
Without knowing it may be.

232
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.970
Um,
because I'd never really played in mini vans.
Um,

233
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.210
but yeah,
I had an older cousin Mike too.

234
00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:55.490
He was like six or seven years older than me,
so you know,

235
00:13:55.491 --> 00:13:58.780
and just be older teenage neighbors with Chevy Novas and shit,

236
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:02.560
listening to guns and roses when you're in fifth grade and the,
but Mike Really,

237
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.500
I remember very vividly,
one weekend we'd go up to visit,

238
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:09.690
they had a form Ohio and uh,
I was probably in fourth or fifth grade and he,

239
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.340
he said,
I remember he knew I was really into music.

240
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:15.340
I was playing guitar and he's like,
what are you listening to?
And I don't know,

241
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.900
I mean it's probably wasn't the monkeys or something.

242
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.020
And he took me his bedroom and he had one of those like tower stereo systems

243
00:14:20.021 --> 00:14:23.070
with the glass door and the super headphones.

244
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.020
And he sent me and CD's had just come out,
you know,

245
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:30.280
this is like 87,
88,
I don't know.
And uh,

246
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:34.480
he just had this already had this fucking mountain of cds and he's like here.

247
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:39.760
And he was like Zeppelin box set and cream and Hendrix and humble pie and

248
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:41.080
traffic and all these bands.
I mean,

249
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:45.280
it was like a fucking bomb just went off in my head.
That was it.
I was done.
My,

250
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:46.570
what?
My life was ruined.

251
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.410
I very clearly remember the transition between records and cds.

252
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:52.170
I remember the first

253
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:57.170
<v 3>very first cds showing up with a record store because kids today probably don't</v>

254
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.710
even appreciate it because of the last 10 years of the Internet is dominated

255
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:04.970
digital downloads ever since Napster came along and then iTunes and everybody

256
00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:08.720
knows how to get shit online and there's no record stores in the morning.

257
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.680
Obviously there's a few,
but I mean it used to be like a local community spot.

258
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:13.880
Well I lived in Newton,

259
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:17.000
Massachusetts and we used to go down to this place that was right across the

260
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:18.440
street from a place that I worked at.

261
00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:22.700
I worked at this ice cream place called Newport creamery.
Uh,

262
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.160
we made hamburgers or wash dishes and do all that shit.

263
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.700
And the across the street from Newport creamery was the record store at all.

264
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:31.010
Kids would go there after school.
So our own cultural,

265
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.030
it was the only like output to like the,
the rock and roll of the world.

266
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.480
<v 4>But you want to,
every week a new record came out.
Yes.</v>

267
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.030
And I remember when the cds came out,
everybody's like,
what is this?
Right?
What?

268
00:15:43.031 --> 00:15:46.300
Off I look and it's got a rainbow in it.
If you wiggle it,
it makes rainbows,

269
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.800
all the digital thing.
I think in a lot of ways it's great,

270
00:15:49.801 --> 00:15:52.450
but I believe it almost entirely for

271
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:58.930
the downward spiral of,
you know,
the quality of music in the 70s.
I mean,

272
00:15:58.931 --> 00:16:02.410
if you,
if you've got a record deal,
you had to be bad.
The fuck ass right.

273
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.870
There was no slop.
Right.
Pro Tools and shit to go in and make everybody.

274
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.050
Yeah.
Right.
Actually was a quote,
pig said this too.
He's like,

275
00:16:11.051 --> 00:16:14.230
you know what they used before pro tools like fucking pros,

276
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.500
so got named peg would say,
that's awesome.
Yeah.
They used to have to,

277
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.290
you know,
the sound was a different sound too,
right?
I mean,

278
00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:29.720
the people that are real,
I'm vinyl heads.
They'll tell you I'm,

279
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:33.610
I don't recognize it.
Um,
I'm not educated.
Yeah.

280
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.110
I mean I'm a pretty good,
okay.
I'm an audio file.
Fucking sorry.

281
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.100
Super Geek about it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've never gotten into it.
I should,

282
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.630
<v 3>I should really get,
get a record player and a Marin's really into that shit.</v>

283
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:46.530
He keeps stacks of them at home.
He listens to them,

284
00:16:46.531 --> 00:16:49.100
they meticulously clean them and put them down.

285
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.580
You have to have the right ear phones and I guess it's got like,

286
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:54.730
what is this sound is different because I don't listen to that.

287
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.410
<v 4>I think it's just,
there's a warmth to it,
a warmth.
Um,</v>

288
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.500
everything just sounds really settled and cohesive.
Whereas digital,

289
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.290
I hear the separation specialist area,
you can just hear,

290
00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:08.500
it's almost like you're sitting with the mixing board and you just like some

291
00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:12.160
asshole decided that guitar needed to be like a hard two o'clock right there.

292
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.730
But in a vinyl it just kind of seems more three dimensional.

293
00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:17.620
Like it's coming from around you,
I feel like.

294
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.540
<v 3>Wow.
So you can sort of hear the different tracks.
Oh yeah.</v>

295
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.840
You know,
I,
maybe I'm just don't have a fucking ear for music.
Maybe.

296
00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:29.800
That makes sense.
Some of my,
my choice,
you've got to know you're listening for,

297
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.053
is that what it is?
Yeah.

298
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.090
Well you weren't here when we had Russell Peters on Russell Peters is a standup

299
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.490
comic friend of mine.
Very funny guy.
And he's also a DJ.
And uh,

300
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.530
we were playing some songs and he could pick out was a rap song and he could

301
00:17:44.531 --> 00:17:48.340
pick out what the samples were from.
And I was like,
what?
How do you hear that?

302
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.980
Like I didn't even,
he's like,
yeah,
you can hear right here.
She did it to do,

303
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.900
did it,
did you like that would be bump up law firm,
you know,
1984.

304
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.500
And I was like,
well I don't,
I don't know how the fuck you just did that.

305
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.720
I trust you,
but I don't know how the fuck you just did that.

306
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:06.060
He's got a separate knowledge base of old music to reference from.
But yeah,
his,

307
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.720
his is all old hip hop stuff.
He's,
he loves like old hip hop stuff.

308
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:15.380
So the thing about the record stores that people loved was that it was like,

309
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.620
uh,
like a sort of like,
because we didn't have the internet,

310
00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.220
you would go there and it was like you would see like these,

311
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.660
it was on like a big piece of paper.
Like Holy Shit,
here's,
you know,

312
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.680
here's the new Bruce Springsteen album.
I think it's right there.
And you see,

313
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.940
oh wow.
It's like,

314
00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:35.430
this is what he made is what we've been doing for the past year.

315
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.000
Bruce has been writing all these songs and Pam,
here we go.

316
00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.390
<v 2>Have,
you didn't have fucking youtube,
you didn't have,
you know,</v>

317
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.280
I think that's the worst thing that ever happened is now everything's so

318
00:18:46.281 --> 00:18:48.620
accessible in the kids' attention span is so short.

319
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.770
They'll never know that experience to sit down and listen to the album all the

320
00:18:51.771 --> 00:18:55.050
way through and then just fucking obsess about it.
And then,
you know,

321
00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.980
hold that physical thing that sleeve in your hand.
Just like,

322
00:18:57.981 --> 00:19:01.880
what the fuck are these guys doing?
Like,
like they got a secret laboratory.

323
00:19:01.881 --> 00:19:04.470
I don't think there's like a stout or something I don't know about.
Yeah.

324
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.790
And mystery,
I guess was the most important element.

325
00:19:06.791 --> 00:19:08.540
Rocker and let's just fucking gone,

326
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.880
<v 3>do you remember when the Wall came out?</v>

327
00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.540
<v 2>No,
I wasn't born in 78.
I mean I remember watching it way too young,</v>

328
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:17.630
but uh,

329
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.420
<v 3>I was in high school when I found out about the wall,</v>

330
00:19:20.421 --> 00:19:22.060
so it was after the wall come out.

331
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.370
But I remember sitting there with my friend and we had like,
uh,

332
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.360
like the headphone Jack thing plugged in so you could have two headphones both

333
00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:34.361
listening to it and you the how's everything like ties in together,

334
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.870
it seems so beyond human reach like that.

335
00:19:38.871 --> 00:19:40.730
These guys figured out how to do all this,

336
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.290
that they put these amazing songs and they just sort of flow into each other.

337
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.100
Like some wild ride you're on or like dark side of the moon.
Very similar.

338
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.800
You know,
like the,
the song they was linked with the album,

339
00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:53.600
they always link up to a,
the wizard of Oz.

340
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.890
The mean that album just everything just flows together in this crazy way.

341
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.200
It did feel like they were in a lab somewhere.
Well,

342
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.010
Marvin Gaye would do that a lot too.
A Willie Nelson did a lot of concept record.

343
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.020
They call it song cycle where you just,

344
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.590
you don't ever feel like there's an actual pause anywhere in the albums.

345
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.140
It was just this one cohesive work.
Wow.
Um,
and that does take time and plan.

346
00:20:14.141 --> 00:20:16.320
We did a little bit of a metal modern.
We're kind of,
you know,

347
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.490
pink Floyd and some other albums were definitely reference while we were,

348
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:22.520
we were cutting that shit towards the end.

349
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.140
When you first decided that you were going to be a professional country music

350
00:20:27.141 --> 00:20:31.490
singer,
did you decide slowly and gradually or did you just fucking dive in?

351
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.200
I didn't,
I only started my

352
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.400
<v 2>career or attempting to have a career about four years ago really.</v>

353
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.200
And I never would have done it to be completely honest.
My,

354
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.950
it was really my wife's side.
Yeah.
Um,

355
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.760
so she's the one that really kind of encouraged me to go for it.
And,
uh,
cause I,

356
00:20:46.761 --> 00:20:47.260
you know,
I just,

357
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.710
there's always something I did as a hobbyist and would write and play and I get

358
00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:53.680
a lot of grief from friends,
especially in my twenties.
Really?
Why aren't you out?

359
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:54.460
You know what I mean?
This is,

360
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.140
you should be doing something because we go to shows at clubs and they'd be
like,

361
00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:02.110
this is fun.
Cool.
We just,
we'd rather be at homeless in the you play,
you know?

362
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.180
And uh,
I just,
I don't know why I never thought,

363
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.073
<v 0>okay,</v>

364
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.510
<v 2>what's it like the limitations of your environment,</v>

365
00:21:09.511 --> 00:21:14.511
maybe the people that you were moved to Nashville once in 2006 I went down

366
00:21:14.521 --> 00:21:18.450
because you know,
you can play in local bands and you can,
you know,

367
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.340
if that's what you want out of it,
that's great.

368
00:21:20.341 --> 00:21:23.270
And there's a lot of people that do that.
I don't know,
on a hobbyist level,
you,

369
00:21:23.271 --> 00:21:25.500
it's what,
you know,
like I said,
it's what you do after work.

370
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.710
And for me that just never felt rewarding enough,
you know?

371
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:32.370
And I never felt like I was giving everything I could to it.
Right.

372
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.680
And it's very frustrating place and up.

373
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:38.490
And I ended up putting it down a lot of times because of that,
because it just,

374
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.580
I felt like it was bringing me more heartache than it was.
Uh,
right.
Um,
so I,

375
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:42.770
you know,

376
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:47.770
took jobs and work normal jobs and that was out working in railroad job in Utah

377
00:21:47.921 --> 00:21:51.250
for about almost four years.
And my wife was out there with me,

378
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.840
I guess for whatever reason,
from dealing with the stress of that.

379
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.810
And I didn't realize at the time I wasn't,
yeah,

380
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.450
<v 0>okay.</v>

381
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.640
<v 2>Fulfilling my fucking purpose,
Joe Rogan.
You know what I mean?</v>

382
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.340
She kind of recognized that and I started writing a lot as a,

383
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:10.420
as a result of dealing with the stress from,
from my job and playing at home.

384
00:22:10.421 --> 00:22:13.120
And She just kind of told me,
when you saw,
you know,
you don't suck at this.

385
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

386
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.660
<v 2>And,
uh,
you know,
you're going to wake up at 40
and no,
you never fucking try it.</v>

387
00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:23.010
And then I'm stuck with you're miserable ass.
We sold everything and,

388
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:27.360
and literally mean she and I and our dog and a Ford Bronco drove to Nashville.

389
00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:31.810
And Wow.
That was like four years ago.
So,
and I,
you know,
no,

390
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.570
I was older.
I was clean.
I was,
I was focused.
I had,
I had purpose.
So I just,

391
00:22:36.571 --> 00:22:39.090
the first year,
you know,
you kind of got to get the lay of the land and it's,

392
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.860
it's a hustle.
It's a total shark tank.

393
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.700
I just decided I wasn't gonna have anything to do with that shit.
I'm,

394
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.220
I'm not a social guy.
I don't go to bars and clubs and things like that.

395
00:22:47.221 --> 00:22:50.050
And so what is it like,
man?

396
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:51.450
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

397
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.070
<v 2>well there's so many facets to it.</v>

398
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:53.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

399
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.390
<v 2>You know,
depending on what the industry,</v>

400
00:22:55.391 --> 00:22:58.840
there's so many sides of the industry and you that people fall into and most,

401
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.660
and I'd say the bulk majority of it is,

402
00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:05.320
is complete and total shameless opportunists.
Hmm.
Um,

403
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.540
then the musicians come and everybody,
and I'm,
you know,

404
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.080
thinking about musicians were lazy as fuck and nobody really wants to work.

405
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.710
So you get all these guys,

406
00:23:12.711 --> 00:23:16.420
he's side players are looking for songwriters to get gigs supporting or backing

407
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:18.100
up.
Then they weren't like half the door.

408
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:22.330
What you get paid for their services because they don't want to wait tables and

409
00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:24.880
there's guys that are really good and earn that money.

410
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

411
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.770
<v 2>Um,
and then there's the side of it,</v>

412
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.400
but it just really feels like to me the first time I feel like everybody I met

413
00:23:31.401 --> 00:23:34.220
one,
it's like literally,
hey man,
how's it going?
What can you do for me?

414
00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:34.971
And while they're talking to you,

415
00:23:34.971 --> 00:23:37.920
they're looking over your shoulder to see who else they should solely talking to

416
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.180
is very Hollywood.
Like it's getting more and more.

417
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.080
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

418
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.440
<v 2>So cause that would just cause the money thing.
Cause there's money in country.</v>

419
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.100
Well there's

420
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.090
<v 3>a lot of fucking money.</v>

421
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.180
<v 2>Really.
That's the only thing still selling cds.</v>

422
00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:52.470
That's why the labels are still still gutsy.

423
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.460
Need buyers for his old school something last night there's going to be no

424
00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:58.490
platinum albums this year for the night,
for the first time.

425
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:01.670
I mean now if you have a hit record,
you drop an album on a major label.

426
00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:05.630
If you sell 200,000 copies in a week,
that's a success.
10 years ago,

427
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:09.010
if you sold 200,000 copies the first week they had a dropped your ass and then

428
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.020
Kratom you know,
so the whole thing is just,

429
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.970
it really is the wild west when the Internet and social media,
um,

430
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:17.960
it,

431
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.410
it affords guys like me and a lot of other people like me doing what I'm doing.

432
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.800
The opportunity to reach people without having to

433
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.470
<v 3>go down certain avenues I guess.
And country didn't used to be like that,</v>

434
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.880
like Nashville used to be like,
what?
What was it like?

435
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.490
It was know gatekeepers.
And um,

436
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.330
but when you,
when,
when exactly do you mean?

437
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.510
I mean before it became more Hollywood asks the way it is now,

438
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.870
has it always had an element of show business to it?
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah.

439
00:24:47.871 --> 00:24:52.760
They do Taki real well and it's kind of,
um,
but it,

440
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.870
I wouldn't say there's a certain la element to Nashville that's this kind of

441
00:24:56.871 --> 00:25:01.070
come on in the last two or three years more so.
Um,
it's very hip.

442
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.630
I blame that Hootie and the blowfish car when he crossed over.
Yeah.

443
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.600
When Doris got in a black guy who sings good country Charley Pride,
man.
Dammit.

444
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.730
I know,
but it's been a while.
Yeah,
that's true.

445
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.750
Darious snuck right in there and all those white people came running with them.

446
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.370
That's what happened.
That's what happened.
He brought him in.

447
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:26.450
It's a very interesting
situation.
I don't,

448
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:30.870
it doesn't really,
the fakeness to it.
Yeah,
it's very,
it's very studied in effect.

449
00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.960
Studying the effect is a prep way.

450
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.820
Describe it fakeness to me falling short again,
I just,

451
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.330
I,
I,
I,
you know,
a lot of journalists I've been baited,

452
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.120
I can't tell you how many times they want me to get like pulled into this

453
00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:47.080
negative conversation and just bash and talk shit on it and,

454
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.870
and I could eat,
I could do that.
But you know,
there's,

455
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.820
there's so much negativity already.
I don't feel like
whatever this,

456
00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.050
um,
opportunity is,
I don't want to use it for that.
Right.
Well,
you know what,

457
00:26:00.051 --> 00:26:03.590
quite honestly,
the negative aspects of anything,

458
00:26:03.591 --> 00:26:08.240
whether it's show business or you know,
Co standup comedy or music,

459
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.670
I don't think this isn't anything negative about talking about them.

460
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.840
I think the positive effect of talking about them is that young people recognize

461
00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:16.380
that they're not crazy,
that they,

462
00:26:16.381 --> 00:26:19.730
they sent something goofy about this and then it becomes like more clearly

463
00:26:19.731 --> 00:26:24.170
defined what's goofy about it and it gives them a high standard to not set a

464
00:26:24.171 --> 00:26:25.370
trap for themselves.

465
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:30.730
Like I know in comedy there's a thing that guys do when they first start out,

466
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.480
which really fucks you up.

467
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.260
You just trying to get laughs like you're saying things you don't even believe.

468
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:36.700
Right.

469
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.160
Cause you just hoping it would work because you just terrified cause you're on

470
00:26:39.161 --> 00:26:43.980
stage.
And I think similarly in music you could

471
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.100
<v 1>just start making stuff that you think like,
you know,</v>

472
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.690
like one of those pros that writes those pop songs.
You know those guys,

473
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.530
I was weird dudes that just know how to like make something that clicks in but

474
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.910
there's no feeling to it

475
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.420
<v 2>all.
They sit in cubicles.
Yeah.
Heaps of four and five shit,
I'm not kidding.</v>

476
00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.283
That's a reality.

477
00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.810
<v 1>Yeah,
go to work.
There's big goddamn difference between that.</v>

478
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.190
And like someone who's writing shit,

479
00:27:09.191 --> 00:27:12.590
like you're writing someone who's like writing shit that resonates.
It's,

480
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.800
I can tell no matter what your influences are in this life musically or even

481
00:27:18.491 --> 00:27:19.510
while you're creating a song,

482
00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:23.890
it's all filtering through your unique individual vision.

483
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.000
And that's entirely missing from all these like poppy things.

484
00:27:28.001 --> 00:27:31.600
And that's like something that people connect with and some,
I mean look,

485
00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.850
there's something personal about songs that,
you know,
the dude wrote it,

486
00:27:36.851 --> 00:27:39.730
you know the guy singing it like,
like my friends and honey honey band,

487
00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.510
they write all their shit.
So when they're singing it and they're,

488
00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.530
they're sitting here in the studio singing it or you seen him on stage,

489
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.500
like that's their creation.

490
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:52.530
It's 100% and there's like a uniqueness to that that your music has that a lot

491
00:27:54.491 --> 00:27:55.810
of like music that it's,

492
00:27:55.811 --> 00:28:00.660
it hits like a different frequency as opposed to like a poppy frequency and,

493
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.100
and these people that are coming in that are just trying to exploit it and

494
00:28:03.101 --> 00:28:07.270
monetize it,
they probably,
that doesn't register with them.

495
00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.600
Or even if it does,
they don't give a shit because that's not where that is.

496
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.350
<v 2>They're just worried about the quarterly report.</v>

497
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.530
Very seldom to any of the people running labels actually know anything or give a

498
00:28:15.531 --> 00:28:18.020
shit about music.
It's just really more,

499
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:21.020
that's really more of a recent development and a lot of them are run by very

500
00:28:21.021 --> 00:28:23.210
young guys now like in their thirties cause the old,

501
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.150
the old Reus Kinda went out,
retired,

502
00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.130
it kind of turned over and a lot of the dudes that were in la in the 80s making

503
00:28:31.131 --> 00:28:35.480
all those awful hair metal band records,
those producers and engineers,

504
00:28:35.481 --> 00:28:36.560
once that industry dried up,

505
00:28:36.561 --> 00:28:38.870
a lot of them move in Nashville that he's turned on the radio today.

506
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:41.930
You'll find that a lot of that shit sounds exactly like a poison record.

507
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.760
There's a reason for that.
Wow,
that's interesting.

508
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:51.090
That formulaic way of creating it.
Making hits.
Yeah.

509
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:56.590
And you know,
and I think two or three decades ago,
they,

510
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.100
they,
the,

511
00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.290
the labels still offered up the other that you had all these great bands that

512
00:29:00.291 --> 00:29:05.090
were making art because they knew they were going to sell a fuck ton of copies

513
00:29:05.091 --> 00:29:07.490
and make their money back.
So they were willing to take the risk.
And now there's,

514
00:29:07.491 --> 00:29:11.150
there's really no risk takers.
And I don't know if that's because of it,
some,

515
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:16.280
maybe there's a lack of visionaries
because the money's dried up.

516
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.960
It just,
they don't think they're just,

517
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.220
they're all sitting in their corner offices looking out the window wishing it

518
00:29:22.221 --> 00:29:27.221
would go back to 1996 and twiddling their thumbs and pray into a dying business

519
00:29:27.381 --> 00:29:32.240
model because they completely depended on radio for sale sales of singles and

520
00:29:32.241 --> 00:29:34.100
cumulus and clear channel.
Pretty much all of it.

521
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:38.690
Completely lock that out to a very politically selected group of songs,

522
00:29:38.691 --> 00:29:42.010
which somebody paid probably at least a million just to

523
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.620
<v 4>get it in rotation.
Um,
you know,</v>

524
00:29:44.621 --> 00:29:49.240
they'll pay a million or $2 million to make a hit.
Um,
that's so crazy.

525
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.180
That's sad.
That's sad to hear.
It's a business.
It is a business,

526
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:55.010
but it's sad to hear.
It's just like flipping real estate or something.
Yeah.
Um,

527
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.800
so there's no artists development anymore.
So I,
you know,

528
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.870
luckily I didn't try to do this at 22 or 26 years.

529
00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:06.220
Now I've worked real jobs when I was able to understand that the mechanical

530
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:09.580
aspect of it all,
and you know,
there's,

531
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.770
that's not the only way to do it anymore.

532
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:16.240
You can just kind of bypass around that.
It's a much longer,
harder road,
but,

533
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.260
but then again,
it's not,
but then because if he catch fire,
right,
you know,
just,

534
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.350
just spreads across the Internet.
It's much more rewarding road,

535
00:30:23.351 --> 00:30:24.184
I can tell you that.

536
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:28.430
<v 1>Oh fuck.
Yeah,
it's got to be,
I can only imagine.
I mean,</v>

537
00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:33.460
I would imagine that being stuck singing some songs that you don't believe in

538
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.620
and that,
that are not really good,
but everybody you know,

539
00:30:36.621 --> 00:30:38.570
is really responding to,

540
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.360
and you have something inside you that you wished you could've got out,

541
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.800
but now you're trapped.
You know,
that's gotta suck,
I would imagine.

542
00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.200
Do you remember when Garth Brooks came back with a different character?

543
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.690
Chris Gaines,
man.
Yeah.
Put the wig on.

544
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:54.100
<v 4>There was nobody there to say,
hey,
maybe you shouldn't do this.</v>

545
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:58.390
But he was surrounded by yes people.
You just know because somebody was like,

546
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.520
yeah,
that's,
that's fun.
That'll be cool.

547
00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:06.830
<v 1>Someone didn't say,
wait,
what?
Wait,
what?
Wait,
what?</v>

548
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.090
You're going to hold on you?
What are you gonna do?

549
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.940
You get to put a wig on and you're going to change your name,

550
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.640
but everybody's going to know it's you.
So what are you doing?

551
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.360
Are you playing the character now you're playing a character.
That's how art,
man.

552
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.890
Yeah,
you're a,
you're a goddamn superstar.
Shows these Helen some,

553
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.850
you know I got friends in low places,

554
00:31:25.851 --> 00:31:28.190
sold a lot of fucking copies and what are you going to do now?

555
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.880
You're going to put a fucking look at him.
We get it.
He had hair across his face.

556
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.190
Remember that shit?
He grew a soul patch.

557
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.220
Like what the fuck was going on there?

558
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:42.400
<v 4>It's his,
it's his filtered interpret.
I think he was going for like,
uh,
uh,</v>

559
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:45.640
Ryan Adams.
He sorta thing.
I don't know.
I think he just straight went crazy.

560
00:31:45.641 --> 00:31:49.060
I think that was fucking nuts.
That's,
that's very distinct possibility.

561
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.270
He blew a rod right there.
He's red lining is engine.
Look at those.

562
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:55.050
<v 5>Okay,</v>

563
00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.430
<v 1>thank,
thank,
thank,
thank,
thank,
thank.</v>

564
00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.330
That was blowing a rod in the engine and then from then on he kind of

565
00:32:00.331 --> 00:32:04.380
disappeared.
You never hear about Garth Brooks anymore.
Oh,
he just came back.

566
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.710
Well he's gonna.
I mean he'll still do well he's got a lot of fucking hits,

567
00:32:07.711 --> 00:32:12.180
but it's been a long time where Garth Brooks is in the public consciousness.

568
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.670
But meanwhile in the 1990s or whatever,

569
00:32:14.671 --> 00:32:18.450
it was 80 I guess nineties early nineties when did he,

570
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:20.550
<v 4>when was he just charged anti?
Yeah,</v>

571
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.310
like early nineties and he just kinda came out of nowhere.

572
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.340
She Cam type knocked it right out.

573
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.090
It really all think a lot of stuff going on today is an absolute direct

574
00:32:30.091 --> 00:32:31.260
byproduct.
It's still,

575
00:32:31.261 --> 00:32:34.260
we're still getting the ripples of all that because at some point country music

576
00:32:34.261 --> 00:32:36.810
turned into like a really Shitty van.
Halen con,

577
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.040
<v 1>not David Lee</v>

578
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.360
<v 3>Roth.
No.
Sammy Hagar.
Hagar knew.
I knew what you were going to mean.</v>

579
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.300
Come on,
man.
That's,
you know,
it's fascinating.

580
00:32:48.301 --> 00:32:50.740
There's two or religion too.

581
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.030
I think that the original van Halen with David Lee Ross was the greatest bands

582
00:32:56.031 --> 00:33:00.650
of all time,
but without a doubt,
running with the devil to this day,

583
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.530
it's like if I'm on the treadmill and I throw on running with the devil,

584
00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:07.340
I'll crank that bitch up an extra couple of miles an hour.
Fuck it.
You know,

585
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.380
it's just one of those songs,
man.
But they did just as well with Sammy Hagar.

586
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:17.330
They really did it.
It might have done better.
They got more soccer moms.
Eh?

587
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.840
What happened commercially?
I think it took him even more.

588
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.890
It made them more accessible and we're fuck is that,
I don't know.
How does,

589
00:33:24.891 --> 00:33:26.730
Aaron was my first concert ever.
My Dad took,

590
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.520
took me see van Halen with fifth grade.

591
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:34.100
Really fucking Eddie van Halen for,
you know,
for a fifth grader.

592
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.050
That's,
that's amazing.
And the fifth grade.
Yeah,

593
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:41.210
I think mine was the ninth grade and went to see the j Geils band.

594
00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:45.320
J Geils band was huge back then.
Angel was a centerfold.

595
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.290
Loved stinks.
They were giant man.
Yolo deep cuts.
Yeah.

596
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:56.410
Giant in my highschool giant in 1981 or whatever the hell it was.

597
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.900
Where are you from?
Newton.
Well that's I,
that's where I went to high school.

598
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.260
I was born in New Jersey.
I grew up kind of all over the country.

599
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:08.510
Lived in San Francisco from age seven to 11 lived in Florida from 11 to 13

600
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.960
Boston from 13 to probably 2124 and then New York for a couple of years in

601
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:19.430
California.
So I'm from California now.

602
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:21.710
I'm more Californian than anything I've ever been in my life.

603
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:25.910
But I was placed at mass.
It's a fucking mess.

604
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.220
It's not the worst place though.
It's just as too many people.

605
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.750
If you could whittle California,

606
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.990
if you could whittle Los Angeles down to like one 10th of its size as far as

607
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:41.330
like population wise.
So just so you know,
if you ever go to Seattle,

608
00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:44.690
I bet it was the shit.
I bet word his shift.
He's man.
I mean it was just,

609
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.250
it was the absolute shit.

610
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:51.350
It's just a matter of like inconvenience and overpopulation.
Like see,

611
00:34:51.351 --> 00:34:54.110
Seattle has like lived in Seattle for a very few people.

612
00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.810
That's how it kicked my ass.
Did it?
Oh yeah.
What was it?

613
00:34:56.811 --> 00:35:00.560
The rain among other things rang,
did get rid of the rain is,

614
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:03.530
I think it was a direct contributor to a lot of the other problems people

615
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:04.820
acquire while they live in Seattle.

616
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.070
But the rain keeps people from moving there too.

617
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:11.150
This is a good thing about that Goddamn name.
It really is so beautiful.

618
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.980
Especially the summers.
It's,

619
00:35:12.981 --> 00:35:15.920
I mean it's really hard to beat Seattle in the summertime.

620
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.640
It's just nine months of the most dismal.
I mean,

621
00:35:19.641 --> 00:35:21.800
I remember like hanging my towel up to drivers,

622
00:35:21.801 --> 00:35:24.970
taking a shower and you come in there two days later it'd be like fucking Lichen

623
00:35:24.971 --> 00:35:27.390
growing on.
It's just a petri dish,
you know?
Yeah.

624
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:31.100
So much precipitation that you just,

625
00:35:31.101 --> 00:35:33.380
people are jacked up on coffee or heroin all the time,

626
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.710
but I have friends that live in Seattle that will fucking defended to the death.

627
00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:39.360
Like right now,
the Voodoo chicken is raising his fist and anger.

628
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.890
You wait till I get ahold of you.
He fucking moved there from Indiana,

629
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:47.970
my friend Voodoo chicken.
That's what his official stage name is.

630
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:52.710
And when he did that man,
like he liked it way better than Indiana and I'm like,

631
00:35:52.711 --> 00:35:55.770
that's good,
that's good.
But if you ever lived in Los Angeles,

632
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.760
have you ever lived where it just doesn't fucking rain like we're babies.

633
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.570
We're used to just soak it in that side of every day.
Every day.

634
00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.490
We don't have a 320 days a year.

635
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.640
About 370 we have extra days on days.

636
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.990
It tells it fucking rain.
It's a total drought.

637
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.780
I mean we're stealing water from the Colorado River or some shit.

638
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:19.740
I don't know how we keep everything hydrated until some super genius guy figures

639
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:21.480
out how to suck water out of the ocean.

640
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.730
The W you want to get some ocean front property about like 700 yards in because

641
00:36:26.731 --> 00:36:30.090
within like three everybody's worried about the sea level rising.

642
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:34.170
All you have to do is figure out how to desalinate ocean water will drink that

643
00:36:34.171 --> 00:36:36.150
shit.
We'll use that shit and our toilets.

644
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.090
We'll just start extra golf courses with that fucking Osha.
That'll just,

645
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.760
you won't be nothing.
Don't worry about that thing rising.
Oh,

646
00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:45.450
you're worried about there'd be too much water.
Oh,
don't sweat it.
We got that.

647
00:36:45.451 --> 00:36:49.020
It doesn't rain and were abusive.
When we find a resource,

648
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.770
if we could actually tap into the ocean beach from people would be fucking

649
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:57.480
pissed because the beach would be like a couple hundred yards away and a few

650
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.820
years and a half to the shoreline.
If we'd suck that bitch dry,

651
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.610
it may come to the,
it might.
It really might.
It may very well,

652
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.350
but I don't know.
You know,
man,
I've only,

653
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.630
every time I come to California it's all,
it's always in and out.
Yeah.

654
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.530
Quicker tourist stuff.
We were here,

655
00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:18.540
we did Conan and played at the troubadour a month or two back and we were here

656
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:22.830
for about four days and that's the most time I've ever spent consecutively in
La.

657
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:23.100
So I,

658
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.290
but I've never been able to really get the lay of the land is find out what I

659
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.510
knew.
I liked Redondo.
Yeah.
Ever.
Donald's nice.
It's very chill though.

660
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.600
Heme Kinda feel that's what Tommy buns lives.

661
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:38.430
Tom's girl lives in Redondo.
He fucking loves it.
It's,
it's very chill.

662
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:41.970
Like any of those beach communities are very chill allies,
gripe.
It's great.

663
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.700
I talk shit about it sometimes,
but it's just the amount of people.

664
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:49.410
I just don't think people value things that they have in too much abundance.

665
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.410
And I think there's an issue with people when you get over a certain population,

666
00:37:52.411 --> 00:37:57.390
I think we just naturally get a little more callous or you just don't give a

667
00:37:57.391 --> 00:37:58.224
fuck about each other.

668
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.220
Like if you go to like a really small town and you go the store,

669
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.580
people say hi to each other because there's not that many fucking people.

670
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.040
It's only a few thousand people in the town.
I mean,
yeah,

671
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.490
they're going to get some small minded gossipy bullshit too.

672
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.140
But I don't necessarily think that has to be the case in a small town.

673
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.590
But I think the benefit of being in a smaller populations,

674
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.570
people are just like a little less intruded upon by sensory input.

675
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.470
Everybody's a little less on edge.
Yeah.
California is just,

676
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.230
there's 20 million people plus Mexicans in the city.

677
00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:35.620
I say plus Mexicans with respect because

678
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.930
<v 1>I mean people that have come over here from Mexico,</v>

679
00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:41.350
which I think you should just be able to come over.
I don't,
I don't believe in,

680
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.260
I think it's ridiculous that people who want to work,

681
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.500
they should be forced to stay in this shitty patch of dirt because they just got

682
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:51.010
a bad roll of the dice.
They were born there.
I think we're just scared.

683
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:52.180
The good spots like here,

684
00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:55.210
we're scared it's going to balance out somehow and they're going to come over

685
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:58.060
and fuck it up.
We just gotta figure out a way to not have it,
fuck it up.

686
00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:02.320
Just got to figure out a way to not have crime and poverty and all the different

687
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:05.410
issues that we've just completely ignored in poor communities.

688
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.490
Not have that effect.

689
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:11.491
Everybody's like low level of happiness that's living in these big groups,

690
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:16.690
but to just to imprison someone in a shit country cause they were fucked and

691
00:39:16.691 --> 00:39:19.990
they were born there just seems kind of crazy and inhumane to me.

692
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.940
Just seems weird.
You know?
It's pretty Eurocentric.
But I think,

693
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:29.170
you know,
the illegals,
first of all,
just you know,
they're here,
they're Americans,

694
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.930
we're all immigrants.
You fucks.
But if you counted them,

695
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.950
I don't think they've ever really counted them.
I don't know how many that is.

696
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.950
So I say 20 million plus Mexicans because that's what it is.

697
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:41.410
It's like the greater la area,

698
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:46.420
which is a huge area like goes all the way down and wide.
And you know,
it's,

699
00:39:46.421 --> 00:39:49.990
it's such,
so spread out in sprawl.
Something around 20 million people,

700
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.320
which is just an incredible,
that's just the nuts.

701
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.210
<v 2>I lived in Tokyo for a while.
Woe is younger.
And who were you doing there?</v>

702
00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:03.340
I was in the military.
I got stationed over there.
Wow.
And it's like,
you know,

703
00:40:03.341 --> 00:40:08.260
an island roughly the size of California with the population in United States,

704
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:10.330
you know.
So,
but it was weird,

705
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.750
something you said earlier about people being crowded.

706
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.100
I just went back last year and visited some friends of mine to help me with a

707
00:40:17.101 --> 00:40:21.460
video project.
And I noticed that even more so now that I'm older.

708
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:22.151
But I mean,

709
00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:26.770
even on a crowded subway train where you're just jammed in like sardines or

710
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:27.581
walking to the street,

711
00:40:27.581 --> 00:40:32.581
they're so aware of a little self aware and then just their surroundings.

712
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:36.970
You know,
you could be crammed in this train literally nut to butt,

713
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:41.980
but yet nobody's touching anybody.
You know?
There's just really this awareness,

714
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.560
um,
and in

715
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.620
consideration and mutual respect that I think you don't really encounter in a

716
00:40:50.621 --> 00:40:53.140
lot of big cities here.
It's just this like,
get the fuck out of my way.

717
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:53.930
You know what I mean?

718
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.100
<v 1>Yeah.
I found it incredibly polite.
I've only went,</v>

719
00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:00.740
I went to Tokyo once and I was like,
everybody's so polite here,
friendly.

720
00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.050
It's amazing.
You

721
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:06.220
<v 2>know,
that place is 20 times the size of New York City you could pass out and the</v>

722
00:41:06.221 --> 00:41:09.700
darkest alley with a hundred dollar bills sticking out of each year.

723
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:11.050
And nobody's gonna fuck with you.

724
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.740
But there's a bunch of African dudes that are moving in.
They're from Africa,

725
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:18.390
like straight from Africa.
They still hustler guys as well as the [inaudible].

726
00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.820
Some of the nightlife districts.
Yeah,
she was,
yeah.

727
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.460
He walked down the street and they try to drag you into some massage joint and

728
00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:27.780
there's like a,
there's just a look about them.
Like,
oh,
sinister shit man.

729
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.630
A wolf guarding the chicken coop.
Well it does have,

730
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:36.620
there is a very dark underbelly to,
to Tokyo for sure.

731
00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:40.160
That you,
it's hard for guys like you and me to really go fun that

732
00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.260
<v 3>well,
I've had a ensign anyway on the podcast several times.</v>

733
00:41:43.261 --> 00:41:47.550
He's an MMA fighter who was originally from Hawaii but lives in Japan now.

734
00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:52.440
And uh,
he's Japanese and he's friends with all these,
I mean he fought for pride,

735
00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:56.040
which was the biggest MMA organization in the world at one point.

736
00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:59.300
They were in Japan,
uh,
Kaytoo no,
no,
that's,

737
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:03.210
that's the k one k we get of like kickboxing.
That's a big event to,

738
00:42:03.211 --> 00:42:04.830
they had some MMA events as well,

739
00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:10.020
but pride had these enormous shows where they would do like 90,000 seat arenas.

740
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.440
I mean,
it was just gigantic and ensign was one of their big stars over there.

741
00:42:13.441 --> 00:42:16.690
And he's down with the Yakuza.
So we had all these crazy yakuza stories.
Like

742
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.300
I've hung out with a couple,
a couple

743
00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.930
<v 2>of acoustic guys once they were,
uh,</v>

744
00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.690
one was a bookie and the other one I guess he was just like,
uh,
you know,
you're,

745
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:28.180
you sitting in bars and you'd be drunk,
you know,
and they all,

746
00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.430
they all it wants this,
especially their learning,

747
00:42:30.431 --> 00:42:34.540
you're American or if you speak English when they all will talk to you and just

748
00:42:34.541 --> 00:42:36.790
figured out what you're about.
And he's got,
you know,
they were drawing,

749
00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:38.470
we just ended up kicking it for a couple of hours,

750
00:42:38.471 --> 00:42:42.860
then I kind of put it together and realize what they did.
Wow.
And uh,
they,
they,

751
00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.370
they asked me and a friend of mine that was with me if we wanted to go to

752
00:42:45.371 --> 00:42:49.840
another club and this guy had like this bad ass baby blue 67 corvette.

753
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:54.700
Um,
really they were just,
they were just young guys like flashing out,
you know,

754
00:42:54.701 --> 00:42:58.120
they just wanted to impress us.
Wow.
You,

755
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.580
and it was weird cause I could tell you to really give a fuck about being

756
00:43:00.581 --> 00:43:01.211
friends with us.

757
00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:04.870
They just wanted to like show us what they were all about and they were young,

758
00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:09.820
probably really lower level guys
and there's a lot of that,
but it's,

759
00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:13.750
it's very,
it's very,
they're in one specific part of the city,

760
00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:14.900
mostly Shinjuku role,

761
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.730
the Pachinko parlors in organized gambling takes place and the red light.

762
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:24.250
Um,
and they,
they make it very obvious who they are,
you know what I mean?

763
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.060
And it's an accepted part of the culture more and more so they become less

764
00:43:28.061 --> 00:43:28.800
corrupt.

765
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.800
The government just kind of realized we can try to fight this where we can work

766
00:43:32.801 --> 00:43:35.800
with them and they do a lot of things for the communities that they're in.

767
00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.830
Strangely enough,
you know,
to kind of keep order.

768
00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.900
But then at the same time you hear stories about some guy might owe a little too

769
00:43:43.901 --> 00:43:47.200
much money and they just literally go and beat him the fuck to death and a train

770
00:43:47.201 --> 00:43:51.400
station with baseball bats or whatever in front of people and they don't do shit

771
00:43:51.401 --> 00:43:54.280
about it.
Whoa.
Was got to get it as a club owner and her punky,

772
00:43:54.281 --> 00:43:56.880
they got murdered a couple of years ago and I don't think anything came of that.

773
00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.070
It's just like,
it's just,
that's what happens.
That's what happens.

774
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:06.420
Whoa.
They have MMA fights between,
uh,

775
00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:11.410
gang members.
They have like Yakuza MMA fights.
Yeah.

776
00:44:11.411 --> 00:44:14.720
What the fuck?
Jesus Christ.

777
00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.500
That's a crazy warrior society.
They're so kind.

778
00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.370
Those they adhere to Butoh.
I mean,
they,
that's their whole trip is,

779
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.380
is maintaining Samurai culture and they,

780
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.730
that they despise all the westernization that happened post World War II and

781
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.430
yeah,
it's all about codes and honor and you know,

782
00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:37.870
<v 3>Butoh way in UAE,
his nickname is Yamato democracy,</v>

783
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.060
which is warrior spirit.
The,

784
00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.040
this Samurai spirit that everything has to be done with Yamato.

785
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.160
Dimasi when he would go into a fight,

786
00:44:46.161 --> 00:44:49.310
he would write notes to all his friends and his family because he thought he

787
00:44:49.311 --> 00:44:53.360
would die.
Yeah,
right,
right.
A goodbye note,
big Horah and shit.

788
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.070
You just ready to go to war.
I mean,
you know,

789
00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:59.690
that guy was in his fights were so fucking exciting because of that because like

790
00:44:59.691 --> 00:45:02.060
he literally never worried about his own safety.

791
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.810
He would just go in there and just try to test himself and just swing

792
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:09.580
<v 2>you ever,
did you ever,
you ever read any of,
uh,
Maria,</v>

793
00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:14.290
you should bow or the other guy that founded I ketone?
No,

794
00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:18.840
no,
since it,
yeah,
he was more of a philosopher really than,
um,

795
00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:21.670
than a martial artist.
He was absolutely a martial artist,

796
00:45:21.671 --> 00:45:26.310
but a lot of his writings always found more interesting.
So,
uh,

797
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.810
you know,
more so than the actual

798
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:32.590
<v 3>art.
Well that was really a strange part of Samurai culture.
I'm not nuts,</v>

799
00:45:32.591 --> 00:45:34.660
I shouldn't say strange,
but unexpected.

800
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:39.010
When I started investigating it or reading about it rather was that they were

801
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.750
required to be balanced and it was encouraged to be a very balanced person.

802
00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:47.170
Balanced,
like in your discipline,

803
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.300
balanced in your artistic expression,

804
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.720
balanced in your understanding of emotions and fears.

805
00:45:52.721 --> 00:45:56.410
It was a very different than when we think of as like a warrior and we think of

806
00:45:56.411 --> 00:45:59.870
like stone cold murder,
Conan the barbarian motherfucker just

807
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.850
<v 2>I think it was just at its essence,
pure absolute Buddhism.</v>

808
00:46:04.851 --> 00:46:09.230
Like they just live completely in that moment all the time.
Whatever they do,

809
00:46:09.231 --> 00:46:12.300
they are,
they're so intensely focused on,

810
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:13.923
<v 6>you know,</v>

811
00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:19.210
<v 2>in anything,
whether it's trimming a flower or you know,</v>

812
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.950
there's this very certain

813
00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:26.410
element to that culture that I've never seen anywhere else in the world.

814
00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.090
<v 3>Yeah.
I wonder how that happens.</v>

815
00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:32.110
I'd like to talk to someone who's an expert in Japanese culture to explain how

816
00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:36.700
one society does fit into this very unusual pattern.

817
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:37.723
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

818
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.550
<v 3>one,
how much of it had to do with sword fighting?</v>

819
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:44.820
<v 2>Well you know,
that's what you should we talk about,
you know,
cause there's,</v>

820
00:46:44.821 --> 00:46:48.330
there's no,
you can't second guess on a fucking sword fight.
Like in every,

821
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.820
most of you know these Samurai movies.
That's all bullshit.

822
00:46:50.821 --> 00:46:53.640
Cause a lot of these things were one stroke.
You know,

823
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.690
you had to choose that first stroke and then cut them in half.

824
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.400
So there's a lot.
And then with,
with any kind of society like that,

825
00:47:02.401 --> 00:47:06.750
Edo or kindle or whatever,
there's a lot of mutual respect I would imagine.

826
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.930
You know,
because I mean back in the day,
if,

827
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.510
if like a peasant or somebody going to the fucking market taking their fruit to

828
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:12.751
sell,

829
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:16.380
if they pass the Sam or on the street and they didn't bow according lear just

830
00:47:16.381 --> 00:47:20.880
basically say good morning,
it got their fucking head off man.
Like right there.

831
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.750
Like no questions.
So you know,

832
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:29.320
imagine if like walking down the street on Santa Monica was like that today mean

833
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.110
people's behavior would be very different towards one another.

834
00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:36.810
<v 1>Yeah,
it's,
I don't think it's good not saying that,</v>

835
00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:38.480
but I do think I know what you're saying.

836
00:47:38.481 --> 00:47:43.481
I do think that when people are scared of other people in that way or when they

837
00:47:43.851 --> 00:47:47.420
respect that the other person has that ability to do that to them,

838
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:49.460
they're carrying a fucking sword like that.
Well,

839
00:47:49.461 --> 00:47:52.790
armed society is a polite society argument.

840
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.490
I tell them necessarily think that's the way to go.

841
00:47:55.491 --> 00:47:59.630
But I do think there is an element of people that need to know that they get

842
00:47:59.631 --> 00:48:00.950
punched in their fucking face.

843
00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:05.240
Like there's a bunch of people that say rude shit to people and they say it only

844
00:48:05.241 --> 00:48:08.930
because they think they can because they're protected by society.

845
00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.250
And because of that,

846
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:15.280
they're oftentimes less respectful than someone who would be like a physically

847
00:48:15.411 --> 00:48:16.850
dominant person in the conversation.

848
00:48:16.851 --> 00:48:21.851
Like I've seen martial artists have conversations with people where you know

849
00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.380
they're way,
way,

850
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:30.730
way more kind or way more considerate in the way they've voiced their concerns

851
00:48:32.121 --> 00:48:35.330
or opinions about something versus people that have never been in a fight in

852
00:48:35.331 --> 00:48:39.560
their life that will get people's face and scream and yell and you motherfucker.

853
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:42.500
And it's like you're only doing that because this guy's not going to punch you.

854
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:42.860
Right.

855
00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.350
You know you're having this conversation because you're out in public and you

856
00:48:45.351 --> 00:48:47.720
know,
this guy's not just going to pick you up and drop you on your head.

857
00:48:47.721 --> 00:48:50.570
But if he wanted to,
he could.
Like,
he shouldn't talk to people like

858
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.330
<v 2>that was there aren't any repercussions for being an asshole.</v>

859
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:58.780
<v 1>Exactly.
It's only the repercussions are only verbal,
you know,</v>

860
00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:03.760
and they feel like if they keep it on that ground,
like they can bully the bully,

861
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:07.630
even they could go after them if they keep it completely verbal,

862
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:09.190
if they know the guy's not going to do anything,

863
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:11.290
you big fucking stupid piece of shit.
You know,

864
00:49:11.291 --> 00:49:15.490
they can say it and they know he's not going to smash your head like a Zit.

865
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.860
As long as you're protected by society,

866
00:49:17.861 --> 00:49:20.440
you can get away with being pretty shitty to some people.

867
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:25.160
So I don't think it's good to chop people in half with swords,

868
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:30.080
but I do think it might have something to do with the reason why they're

869
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.870
considerate.
What,
you know,

870
00:49:32.871 --> 00:49:37.871
it's weird how cultures develop in these unusual ways when they're just

871
00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:39.530
separated.
Like the,

872
00:49:39.531 --> 00:49:42.800
the Japan is an island and they're separated from other people.
So they,

873
00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:46.310
they've developed it there.
I mean,
there's very similarities to other,

874
00:49:46.311 --> 00:49:49.940
each eastern cultures and their approach to things,
but they're different,

875
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:51.890
you know,
they have their own thing going on

876
00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.750
<v 2>every,
I think every place has its own thing going on.</v>

877
00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:00.300
I was in DC,
I guess back in April.
And,
uh,

878
00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:03.540
I was trying to catch the train to go to show,

879
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:06.840
I can remember as New York or Boston and I was at the Amtrak station in DC.

880
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.660
And then southern happened where there was a down power line,

881
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:12.210
like way up north that had taken out a lot of routes and they,

882
00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.150
they basically cancelled or delayed all,

883
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.370
all the trains going out of the station.

884
00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.390
And when they put the announcement up,
it just,

885
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.640
the place fucking erupted.
I mean,

886
00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:27.620
I've never witnessed

887
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:33.040
<v 3>such a self important display of human behavior in all my life as in Washington</v>

888
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:34.910
DC that they,
the Amtrak station.
They're like,

889
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:38.120
there's this line of suited briefcased,

890
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.850
you know,
guy,
they all just got right in the,
in the,
uh,

891
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.780
Amtrak employees faces one at a time.

892
00:50:44.781 --> 00:50:47.480
Like trying to explain to them how much more important their life was and

893
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:50.840
everyone else's who had just been inconvenienced,
you know,
sitting in this place.

894
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:56.120
And I mean,
it was like I had to retreat into myself.

895
00:50:56.510 --> 00:51:00.350
It was just so surrounded by it.
And,
uh,
I was just,

896
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:05.150
I saw a pregnant lady get fucking bumped out of the way.
Some dude.
I mean,

897
00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.610
he's a disgusting man and wow.
I don't know,

898
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.110
you would never see that in Japan.

899
00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:17.930
People would just deal,
I don't know if you'd ever see that in England,
you know?

900
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:20.690
I mean,
who's to say is that,

901
00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:26.110
that's just the Uber successful hyperfocus shithead thing that we have that

902
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:28.100
other countries just don't have.

903
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:32.990
Like they have the discipline but they don't have this marauding focus thing

904
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:37.190
that a lot of like American businessmen sort of embody this ids Gogi you know,

905
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:39.920
it's Wall Street fucking Gordon Gekko greed is good.

906
00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:44.380
And now that kind of Shit I was,
I would say,
you know,
Wall Street in DC,

907
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:48.590
places like this tend to cultivate a bit more intense version of that.

908
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.330
I was just there Saturday night.
I had a great fucking time.
Yeah,

909
00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:56.330
it's a great party town.
But uh,
yeah,
I don't know why.
I don't know what happened.

910
00:51:56.331 --> 00:51:57.950
I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.

911
00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:02.090
It seems like it affected her in place.
Really did.
It's a weird place.

912
00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:06.620
I mean that's the death star.
It's right there.
I mean,

913
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.740
all the world's wars are all like kind of,

914
00:52:09.741 --> 00:52:13.610
sort of are organized and it's weird geometrical building there,
you know,

915
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.510
so this is a thing.
It's there that there's the penthouse,

916
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.810
which is just outside of there.
And then there's the White House,

917
00:52:20.811 --> 00:52:25.010
which is this weird fucking building in a park where the commander in chief of

918
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.920
the number one conquering army the world has ever known.

919
00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.760
That's where he sleeps and everybody passes by the castle and some sort of

920
00:52:31.761 --> 00:52:36.380
strange formation,
a big circle.
You drive around,
everybody points at it.

921
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.030
It's a weird place to be.

922
00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.970
<v 2>You're just,
you're red like the,</v>

923
00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.210
the history of the layout of the city and why it was later.

924
00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.890
<v 3>What is the,
do you remember it?</v>

925
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.760
It's got all sorts of weird does not masonic is it?
Yes.
Yeah.

926
00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:55.620
Some weird masonic implications and it's all very specific.

927
00:52:55.621 --> 00:52:57.400
And it's geometry.
This may not be true.

928
00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.620
<v 2>I think I read somewhere that they part of it,</v>

929
00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:03.730
like why the streets are all one way and why it's so fucking confusing to drive

930
00:53:03.731 --> 00:53:06.610
around in DC is that um,
in case it was ever invaded,

931
00:53:06.611 --> 00:53:10.870
they wanted to make it difficult for whoever was coming to get from the shore

932
00:53:10.871 --> 00:53:11.704
into the capitol.

933
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:15.740
<v 3>That makes sense.
That totally makes sense.
Why do you mean,</v>

934
00:53:15.741 --> 00:53:17.940
why would you like to have it?
Like,
so you could do an easy driveway.

935
00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.380
You just get on the highway and go really fast.

936
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.860
She want to make it right with super complicated.
Like I'm like,

937
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.810
what does that street Lombard Street in San Francisco,

938
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:31.880
that's what they should do.
Have that shit set up.
It's a cool city too.

939
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:35.040
You know it well,
it's,
it's got a lot of weird history to it.

940
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:36.810
It's like if you stop thinking about it,
yeah,

941
00:53:36.811 --> 00:53:41.811
there's a website on the sacred geometry and assembles of Washington d say,

942
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:46.440
oh,
and he sort of explains sacred geometry,
the whole thing,

943
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.640
like what it mimics and the different,

944
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.100
all the different dimensions.
So freaky stuff,
man.

945
00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:58.350
It's freaky because you know that these guys,

946
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:01.980
they really were like into ancient cultures.

947
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:05.950
They really were into these weird groups that they would form.
I mean,

948
00:54:05.951 --> 00:54:09.840
there's that skull and bones shit that's not fake.
That's real.

949
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:11.190
It's fucking weird.
That's real.
They,

950
00:54:11.191 --> 00:54:14.670
when they really are a part of all this stuff.
Were they in the pine cones?

951
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:18.890
I don't know if they were in the pine cones and,
no,
that's,

952
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:22.230
that was a big thing in a lot of ancient Catholic art.

953
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.150
Right now there's a giant pine cones outside of the Vatican.
Yeah.
Yeah.

954
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:29.460
The pine cone supposedly represents the pineal gland,

955
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:34.850
which is the seat of the soul in ancient Egypt and which is where now they've

956
00:54:34.951 --> 00:54:39.390
actually proven that DMT has made,
it's pretty speculative until real recently,

957
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:44.520
at least in rodents,
right?
Yes.
It's a mammals.
Yeah.
Rick Strassman.

958
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:48.720
Um,
and that group that he's involved with,
the cottonwood research foundation,

959
00:54:48.721 --> 00:54:52.770
they put it together and just getting it in a live road and being able to prove

960
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:57.030
that this third eye in the middle of your head actually is producing the

961
00:54:57.031 --> 00:54:59.250
psychedelic chemicals pretty fucking crazy.

962
00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.140
The people that knew that they designed the White House sign all that shit.

963
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.480
Oh yeah.
Sort of.
Probably they're probably copy.

964
00:55:07.481 --> 00:55:11.490
And people who knew it probably didn't even know why they had buckets of that

965
00:55:11.491 --> 00:55:14.020
shit.
Do you think they had DMT back when they were building?
Like the,

966
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:18.210
the White House?
It was here,
but was it,
do you know,

967
00:55:18.211 --> 00:55:22.110
they didn't even find out about I only first synthesized.
That's a good question.

968
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:25.770
Um,
I think IOWASCA was discovered by Western civilization,

969
00:55:25.771 --> 00:55:29.310
the 1850s and I think it was a,

970
00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:34.320
I think they figured out what was in it when they were isolating the alkaloids

971
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:37.720
in it.
And they,
they originally wanted to call it telepathy,

972
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:39.240
the alkaloid they isolated,

973
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.410
but then they found out that it was out already isolated as a,

974
00:55:42.411 --> 00:55:45.410
the compound harming.
And that sin,
um,

975
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:50.350
that's in the plant that is connected to Iowasca has the Mao inhibitor.
Right.

976
00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:55.110
So this is like,
this is all like the early 1,980,
late 818 hundreds,
early 19.

977
00:55:55.111 --> 00:55:55.891
They figured that shit.

978
00:55:55.891 --> 00:56:00.790
How do they know what plans to boil together in order to the activity and how

979
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:05.100
they know the thousands?
Yeah.
How'd they figure it out?
It's not an easy process.

980
00:56:05.101 --> 00:56:08.340
I mean,
how many species of plants can there be in the Amazon?

981
00:56:08.341 --> 00:56:10.890
You know what I mean?
How they found the right to,
well,

982
00:56:10.891 --> 00:56:14.310
what's fucked up is that all,
there's hundreds of thousands of different plants.

983
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:18.180
They found,
uh,
not just the right to,
but they were,

984
00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:22.260
they found out how to do it in this weird way where you have to mash up the

985
00:56:22.261 --> 00:56:26.500
vines and you add in the leaves and you boil it down and it's,

986
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:31.550
it's a very involved process that takes hours to make true Iowasca but nobody

987
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:34.990
knows how they did it.
They say that the plants told them how to do it,

988
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:39.460
which is just as good an explanation as anything except that if you're high on

989
00:56:39.461 --> 00:56:42.970
mushrooms,
plants will tell you some shit.
I've had conversations with

990
00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:47.960
traffic signals,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

991
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:54.890
Imagine if everything really was alive,
we just couldn't tune into it.
You know?

992
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:56.640
I mean,
if you're,

993
00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:00.620
your table really was alive and you tables really had consciousness,

994
00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:04.040
it's just uh,
just sits there.
It's consciousness is very different than ours.

995
00:57:04.041 --> 00:57:08.570
It's not,
it's not important for it to move.
It just is where it is.

996
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:10.760
If you chop it up,
it doesn't freak it out,

997
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:15.980
but it has some sort of a feel to it.
That's interesting.

998
00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.370
I mean obviously it's not provable.
No,

999
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:24.280
but that Rupert Sheldrake guy who was on before
Rupert,

1000
00:57:24.281 --> 00:57:27.200
who was on a couple of weeks ago,
he thinks that everything has a memory.

1001
00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:32.030
He thinks that objects contain a memory and that that's why like people don't

1002
00:57:32.031 --> 00:57:34.610
want to live in a house where someone's been killed.
Like you walk in,

1003
00:57:34.611 --> 00:57:37.190
you have a weird feeling of really say one of the,

1004
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:40.220
one of the more common side effects of hide those silicide.

1005
00:57:40.221 --> 00:57:45.221
When was inanimate objects tend to develop personalities or you kind of perceive

1006
00:57:46.311 --> 00:57:48.740
them as much more characterized and normally

1007
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:55.070
it's all condensed matter.
Who fucking knows,
right?

1008
00:57:55.820 --> 00:58:00.440
Yeah.
Well who does,
that's,
that's another part of the whole what is,

1009
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:01.341
what is a thing?

1010
00:58:01.341 --> 00:58:04.340
What is an object that really fucks with your head when you start thinking about

1011
00:58:04.341 --> 00:58:08.240
the fact that most Adams,
like it's all,
it's mostly space.

1012
00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:12.770
Like is all this is starred space is all the stuff in there where it's
undefined.

1013
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:16.760
Like there's a lot,
a lot of,
lot of nothing and it's all just

1014
00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:23.640
sorta somehow or another cohesive and becomes a table energy condensed to a very

1015
00:58:24.311 --> 00:58:28.010
slow vibration.
Right?
Yeah.
That's the Hicks line.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1016
00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:32.740
Here's Tom with the weather.
All of it sounds bizarre.
The,
the,

1017
00:58:32.741 --> 00:58:34.990
just the idea that Adams,

1018
00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:38.230
we're trying to figure out what subatomic particles are and that there's these

1019
00:58:38.231 --> 00:58:39.640
particles inside Adams.

1020
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:42.340
Like we don't know what the fuck is going on with all those things.

1021
00:58:42.341 --> 00:58:46.030
Like what our roles have you followed this hydrogen collider thing?
Which one?

1022
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:49.630
The Higgs Boson.
Yes.
It's just fat.
I mean,

1023
00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:54.520
I don't know that that's the kind of stuff I was tripping out on when the record

1024
00:58:54.521 --> 00:58:57.310
got written.
I mean it's just like,
you know,
I don't know.

1025
00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:59.890
I don't pretend to understand it.
I'm definitely a hobbyist,

1026
00:58:59.891 --> 00:59:03.700
but I'm fascinated by like string theory and yeah.

1027
00:59:03.701 --> 00:59:05.800
In the concept of independent,

1028
00:59:05.801 --> 00:59:09.640
freestanding dimensional realms of energy that all kind of hold one another

1029
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:10.920
together.
Oh,

1030
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:15.930
I'm fascinated that someone's mind is so not just so tuned in to how the nature

1031
00:59:17.381 --> 00:59:22.010
of the universe works,
but so tuned in that they've taken theoretical

1032
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:27.010
<v 1>particle a made the subject of this gigantic science project that involves</v>

1033
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:31.010
hundreds of different fucking countries.

1034
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.290
Like I think it's like a hundred different countries.

1035
00:59:33.291 --> 00:59:35.810
I over 10,000 different scientists,
something like that.

1036
00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:39.510
<v 2>The photo gallery of of the actual facility.
It's the same,</v>

1037
00:59:39.511 --> 00:59:42.660
the most insane things I've ever seen like some the amount of time and years it

1038
00:59:42.661 --> 00:59:44.220
took them to build this thing.
It's just,

1039
00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:47.800
<v 1>it's incredible.
I don't even want to know what the price tag look like.</v>

1040
00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.750
It's billions,

1041
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:53.210
billions of dollars and it's all to collide particles so that they can produce

1042
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.590
this Higgs boson potter.
That's amazing origin.

1043
00:59:57.370 --> 01:00:01.780
Well they also found that cork glue glue on plasma,
I think it is,

1044
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:06.340
which is like supposedly the heaviest matter that they've ever discovered and we

1045
01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:11.140
will pull that up.
It's some insane amount of weight.
These things have that.

1046
01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:15.370
That's something that was figured out.
Yeah.
Cork one plasma weight.

1047
01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:19.750
It's just insanely dense.
The densest matter created ever.

1048
01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.110
Um,
that they,
they figured this out.

1049
01:00:23.111 --> 01:00:28.000
That is actually a real thing when they,
uh,
we're doing some of the experiments,

1050
01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:33.160
the exotic material is more than a hundred thousand times hotter than the inside

1051
01:00:33.161 --> 01:00:36.550
of the sun and is denser than a neutron star.

1052
01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.150
Wrap your fucking head around that.

1053
01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:45.760
It acts like a perfect liquid.
Can we see it?
I think they can,

1054
01:00:45.761 --> 01:00:47.410
but very brief.
You know,
it's like you're,

1055
01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:51.840
you're seeing it almost in a calculation dark.
Yeah.
Or by triggering hundreds.

1056
01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:55.540
I mean,
I think it's so heavy that if you had a piece of it,
like,

1057
01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:57.010
like that you could look at like a marble,

1058
01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.800
it would probably sink through the center of the universe.
I mean,

1059
01:00:59.801 --> 01:01:03.760
just go right to the fucking right through the,
I mean,
I don't know.
Aliens fit.

1060
01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:07.470
It would probably go to the center of the planet and just hang out there.
Yeah.

1061
01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:11.440
Aliens bit burned through the fucking courtroom.
That's insane.
Yeah.

1062
01:01:11.441 --> 01:01:15.160
It's supposed to be unbelievably heavy.
Like more like,

1063
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:17.170
I could give you the numbers if I could find it,

1064
01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.210
but I think it's one of those things where you can't even,

1065
01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.180
you can't even imagine,
it doesn't make any sense.

1066
01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:26.320
And that's something that they figured out is actually a real,

1067
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:29.600
<v 2>I mean,
if there's,
if there's,
they're looking for the point of origin,
right?</v>

1068
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:32.900
Like they're looking for the God particle or wear whatever caused the big bang.

1069
01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:36.680
Or,
you know,
there's a,

1070
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:39.670
there's this j swit priest appeared tailored day short.

1071
01:01:39.671 --> 01:01:44.150
Danny wrote a lot of really weird,
controversial things.
But,
um,

1072
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:48.820
I think he actually got blackballed by the Vatican and early 20th century.
But,

1073
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:52.790
uh,
you read this book,
the phenomenon of Man,
we talks about the Omega point,

1074
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:55.003
the origin,

1075
01:01:55.010 --> 01:02:00.010
the first point of all complex consciousness or the,

1076
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:01.260
the,

1077
01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.630
the source of the universe that like emanated everything that we know and that

1078
01:02:05.631 --> 01:02:07.340
ever has been into existence.
And he,

1079
01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:13.060
he was basically trying to establish a symbiotic relationship between science

1080
01:02:13.161 --> 01:02:15.530
and religion and evolution in spirituality,
which is,

1081
01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:19.590
it wasn't a very popular opinion in the,
in the Vatican,

1082
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.140
in the 1920s.
Um,
he,

1083
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.940
he had this theory that it all emanated from this one point or the Omega point

1084
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:31.470
and that eventually consciousness will reach a state of complexity that's so

1085
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:34.650
advanced that it will no longer require a physical vessel or,

1086
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:39.030
or a human body or anything to inhabit itself.
And then it will,

1087
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:44.150
it will keep evolving until it returns back to the highest state of complexity,

1088
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:49.460
which can only be the same place it came from because whatever started it had to

1089
01:02:49.531 --> 01:02:52.680
be the source of this true divine whatever.

1090
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:57.300
So once it goes back,
you know,
but basically,
you know,

1091
01:02:57.301 --> 01:03:01.290
the reality is we perceive it and this is a coordinate with a lot of modern

1092
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:02.124
quantum physics.

1093
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:07.970
It's just this manifestation that we sort of project out to convince ourself

1094
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.500
that we're not actually consciousness experiencing itself.

1095
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:16.410
If that makes sense.
Like there's,
you know,

1096
01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:19.200
we're not little special flowers and individuals.
We're all literally the same

1097
01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:21.320
<v 1>people are pulling the car over to the side of the road right now,</v>

1098
01:03:21.321 --> 01:03:23.860
jumping out and run into the woods.
Yeah.
Then know,

1099
01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:26.930
usually just scared the shit out of people.
It's all going well.
It.

1100
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:32.480
If the universe is 14 point whatever billion years old,
like they say,
I didn't,

1101
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:36.930
I it's not,
I didn't,
not my idea.
No,
it's a great idea of what I'm saying is what,

1102
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:39.380
why wouldn't it be,
you know,
who knows what?

1103
01:03:39.381 --> 01:03:43.530
They might be fucking 100 billion times older than that,
like might know,

1104
01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:44.450
not have any age.

1105
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:48.980
It might just be a constant cycle of that happening down too compressed tiny

1106
01:03:48.981 --> 01:03:53.060
spots,
smaller than the head of a pen,
the entire universe.
And then boom,

1107
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:56.270
big bang over and over and over again.
It might just happen.

1108
01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.580
It might just compress.
I mean,

1109
01:03:58.581 --> 01:04:01.460
just over the course of who knows how many billions of years and just

1110
01:04:01.461 --> 01:04:04.820
continually do that.
If it happened once,
like why,

1111
01:04:04.821 --> 01:04:08.930
why would we think that it's only like it's a onetime sale.
Well this,
fuck it.

1112
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.410
You know,
they don't sell,
sell the Big Bang is headed your way.

1113
01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.140
<v 2>Big Bang.
I mean it's just pockets of infinity stacked upon each other.
You know,</v>

1114
01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.520
<v 1>listen to this shit I found,
I found out what the way this stuff is.</v>

1115
01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:22.870
This is going to fuck your head up.

1116
01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:28.320
One cubic centimeter of this cork glue on plasma weighs 40 billion tons.

1117
01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:36.670
What?
It's pretty dense.
What the fuck?
How much is that?

1118
01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.620
What is 40 billion tons?
Just fuck.

1119
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:47.140
I don't both times a ton is 2000 pounds,
right?

1120
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:51.020
What is that?
What?
The skyscraper

1121
01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.910
<v 2>for way 40 billion tons.
I mean,
what does it,
what the fuck was 40 billion times?</v>

1122
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:58.460
<v 1>I don't know.
I don't even think.
Do you think a skyscraper waste 40 billion tons?</v>

1123
01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.610
That's insane.
And that's a cubic centimeter.

1124
01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.680
So if you like through that at somebody,

1125
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:06.410
they're not catching it would be wrecking house.

1126
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:10.520
I just go right through your hand.
Boom.

1127
01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.470
Right through the center of the earth.
A fucking,
they'll figure it out.

1128
01:05:14.471 --> 01:05:17.740
One centimeter weaponize it as they found it and a centimeter is tiny.

1129
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:22.960
We don't use those little bitchy ass little units of measurement and my America,

1130
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.780
but that's a little tiny fucking thing.
It's about that big,
right?

1131
01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:30.770
It's tiny cubic centimeter,
40 billion tons.

1132
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:35.030
If there was a big bang,

1133
01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:38.720
why wouldn't we think that there could be an infinite number of big bangs,

1134
01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:43.010
an infinite number of expansions and contractions and maybe what we are

1135
01:05:43.011 --> 01:05:46.820
currently and we like to think of as the highest state of life available.

1136
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:48.230
What we are is just,

1137
01:05:48.231 --> 01:05:51.860
this is what exists when you have this state of the universe and there's a type

1138
01:05:51.861 --> 01:05:56.180
of consciousness that exist when the universe becomes no longer physical and

1139
01:05:56.181 --> 01:05:59.360
that might be what you're experiencing when you smoked DMT.

1140
01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:04.280
You might be experiencing these other forms of reality that are there.

1141
01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:08.120
You just don't tune into them while you're in this state that you can access

1142
01:06:08.121 --> 01:06:10.940
them through these chemical doorways while you're sleeping,

1143
01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.580
while you're meditating,
when you,

1144
01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:17.581
you reach these different tunes of mind that people have been exercising and

1145
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:22.700
having a disciplined practices to try to reach these frequencies.

1146
01:06:22.701 --> 01:06:26.060
They've been doing it forever.
They're not doing it because there were,
well,

1147
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.230
I know I'm starving to death,

1148
01:06:27.231 --> 01:06:31.700
but I want to try to figure out a way to reach some shit that's not even real.

1149
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:32.691
Yeah,
they were.

1150
01:06:32.691 --> 01:06:35.510
They were doing it because they haven't had success in it in some way or
another.

1151
01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:39.590
Just changing the channel really.
Possibly,

1152
01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.900
you know,
possibly.

1153
01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.880
<v 2>I've never,
I've never a weird,</v>

1154
01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:48.570
my experience is very limited with,
I've only encountered it twice and I've,

1155
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:50.760
I've never had,
I guess what you call a breakthrough.

1156
01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.690
What have you had when you've done it?
Uh,
it was like,
well,

1157
01:06:54.691 --> 01:06:59.100
the first time I don't,
I,
I didn't know what I was doing and it,
the bubbling,

1158
01:06:59.101 --> 01:07:00.000
it was just weird.

1159
01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:03.010
Everything was just some weird associations that kind of freaked me out and I'm

1160
01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.560
like,
there's no way that's going to be healthy.

1161
01:07:04.561 --> 01:07:07.410
But then the second time I got like this extreme,

1162
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:12.090
I don't know how to describe it other than say it was an intense downward shift

1163
01:07:12.091 --> 01:07:14.100
in gravity.
What it felt like gravity really,
you know,

1164
01:07:14.101 --> 01:07:16.760
that crest at the top of the first hill on roller coaster from everything just

1165
01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:20.610
kind of,
I felt like something was,

1166
01:07:20.611 --> 01:07:24.200
he like pushing me down.
Um,
and then I,
you know,

1167
01:07:24.201 --> 01:07:26.860
I'd read so much in research so much,
uh,

1168
01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:31.900
most of my understanding came from reading and then how that tied together with

1169
01:07:32.341 --> 01:07:36.240
other experiences that I've had or how that related to things that I've always

1170
01:07:36.241 --> 01:07:41.220
been fascinated with or,
or subscribe to maybe on a personal notion,
but,

1171
01:07:41.221 --> 01:07:42.054
uh,

1172
01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:43.563
<v 0>it,</v>

1173
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:47.650
<v 2>it felt like something putting you almost in a,
we're going to trance,
you know,</v>

1174
01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.230
but I was still very much aware.
I was,
I,
you know,

1175
01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:52.060
I don't think I got a very strong dope.

1176
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:56.020
<v 1>We will you taking regular DMT or five Meo DMT.</v>

1177
01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:58.930
The NN NN yeah.
And you,
so he didn't have any visual.

1178
01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.180
<v 2>Oh,
I did know I had some visuals,
but it was,
I wouldn't say that it was a,</v>

1179
01:08:02.181 --> 01:08:06.060
it was probably as intense as the strongest silicide van trip I've ever had,

1180
01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:08.390
but I was still very much,
I never lost cognitive thought.

1181
01:08:08.391 --> 01:08:12.530
I was aware of my body could open my eyes.
I was still,
I knew I was in the room.

1182
01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.030
I saw,
um,

1183
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.340
almost like these Easter island head sort of things sort of just kind of coming

1184
01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:22.260
out of the way with chasers and,

1185
01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:27.140
and it felt like something one and I just was like the cusp of something and it

1186
01:08:27.141 --> 01:08:30.740
just,
it was kind of over and there was,
the room definitely looked,

1187
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:32.120
there was a weird energy,

1188
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:34.820
like everything had this crystalline sort of melty effect.

1189
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:39.500
But I mean it wasn't overwhelmed.
We certainly not anything like what uh,

1190
01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:40.520
what they've described,

1191
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:44.180
some of the research volunteers talks about the volunteers are doing it slightly

1192
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:48.390
differently because they were feeding the intravenous,
supposed to be a Moodle.

1193
01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.120
Actually that's how I got to visit with dockers Strassman about five days ago.

1194
01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:57.710
Um,
you answered a lot of questions and went more into detail,
but yeah,

1195
01:08:57.711 --> 01:08:59.570
they were like massive doses man.

1196
01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:05.330
And for like four to road before 80 to 120 milligram doses all in one morning

1197
01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:09.440
back to back.
And um,
they're hitting hard just,

1198
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.410
yeah,
there's no resisting it at that point.
Yeah.
My,

1199
01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:18.860
my knowledge is from a purely amateur academia.
So,

1200
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:23.810
and incorporating that into certain other things was like know how it may or may

1201
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:27.380
not resemble elements of Tibetan Buddhism and what people describe like these,

1202
01:09:27.381 --> 01:09:31.580
like the Bardos and independent realms of energy and where your soul was faced

1203
01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:35.330
with these entities that test you in ways and how you react to those,

1204
01:09:35.331 --> 01:09:39.530
determine how you might trans migrate or reincarnate into another life.

1205
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:42.890
And I didn't even know about it until a year ago.
Man,
it was sitting on,

1206
01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.610
I was visiting a buddy of mine that was in town and uh,

1207
01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:50.600
and it was just really strange because I've listened to your podcast off and on

1208
01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:53.270
for a while and he used to listen a lot of Terrence lectures and for whatever

1209
01:09:53.271 --> 01:09:54.560
reason,
it just never,

1210
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:57.920
I never heard about it or maybe it passed in front of me when I was younger and

1211
01:09:57.921 --> 01:10:00.920
I didn't know what it was and just said no cause related.

1212
01:10:00.921 --> 01:10:05.110
It's like a PCP or something that shit away.
And uh,
but yeah,

1213
01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:07.370
I'll send a friend of mine's house and it's his father.

1214
01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:10.610
I can't remember if his father had already passed or if he was just,

1215
01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:13.380
he had gotten very ill with terminal cancer.
And,
um,

1216
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.940
he was pretty distraught about and we're just hanging out and he's kind of

1217
01:10:16.941 --> 01:10:19.040
telling me everything he'd been dealing with and I,
you know,

1218
01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:22.970
I didn't know what to really say or two to comfort him,
you know,

1219
01:10:22.971 --> 01:10:27.260
cause he's obviously,
you know,
you find out your dad's dying fucks you up.

1220
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:30.790
And I,
you know,
I just was like,
well,
you know,
man,

1221
01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.150
some people think that there's no such thing as death and you know,

1222
01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:39.220
you lived to die when we die so we can really live.
And uh,
you know,

1223
01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:42.740
like the Buddhist think that there's this other realm you go to,

1224
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:47.300
it's just the most pure bliss and like this ocean of love and you,

1225
01:10:47.301 --> 01:10:51.380
and you feel that joy and euphoria and either go on to nirvana or you go back

1226
01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:54.470
into another life depending on how you live this one.
And he's like,
man,

1227
01:10:54.471 --> 01:10:59.030
that sounds a lot like DMT.
And I was like,
what the fuck is DMT?

1228
01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:04.070
And,
uh,
he's like,
really man,
you just come off,
there was a,
you've all people you,

1229
01:11:04.071 --> 01:11:07.700
and I was like,
I'd never,
it didn't have a clue.
And he paid,
he played an expert.

1230
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.120
We're right there on the porch from one of your podcasts where you kind of going

1231
01:11:11.121 --> 01:11:13.410
on this rant about it.
And I'm like,
all right,

1232
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.940
I need to dig in here cause I'm seeing a lot of similarities and symbiotic

1233
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:20.910
touchstones.
And I went home,
man,

1234
01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:25.710
and probably spent the next three months just reading everything I could find

1235
01:11:25.711 --> 01:11:27.490
and like scouring forums and,
and,

1236
01:11:27.491 --> 01:11:32.491
and then going back and reading metaphysical publications and a lot of theology

1237
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:33.930
and bouncing the shit around.

1238
01:11:33.931 --> 01:11:37.710
And then I found out my wife was going to have a child and it just was like my

1239
01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:40.650
last great existential listic dilemma,
you know what I mean?
So I was,

1240
01:11:40.651 --> 01:11:44.820
I want to write a record about all this shit,
uh,
record it.

1241
01:11:44.821 --> 01:11:45.960
Like it was an outer space.

1242
01:11:45.961 --> 01:11:50.220
And then Dave and I just kinda wanted to tackle it from the standpoint in terms

1243
01:11:50.221 --> 01:11:50.790
of the mix of,

1244
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:54.480
I wanted it to sound like a lot of my favorite records did that I used to listen

1245
01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:58.380
to when I was hired on my fucking mind on mushrooms or Dextromethorphan or

1246
01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:02.820
anything else.
You know,
and you can do all that with tape.

1247
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:06.060
I think like we were talking about vinyl early settled.

1248
01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:07.190
So when you put the headphones on,

1249
01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:10.860
you want it to kind of just figure eight around your head,
you know?

1250
01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.170
And you could do that with tape better than you can digitally.

1251
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.660
It's a lot of people will say no,

1252
01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:20.490
but I think at the end result is a much better,
um,

1253
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:27.050
texture for lack of a better term.
You know what I mean?
Um,

1254
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.080
I dunno.
It's hard to,
it's hard to explain,

1255
01:12:31.081 --> 01:12:33.910
but the digital manipulation with computers that you,

1256
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.780
what you can do with music now,
it's pretty incredible,
but it's easy.

1257
01:12:36.781 --> 01:12:38.250
It's so easy to overdo it.

1258
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:44.280
<v 1>You lose that human [inaudible] sound of the instruments you want everything.</v>

1259
01:12:45.191 --> 01:12:48.100
I think to a certain degree has to be understated.
Isn't there,

1260
01:12:48.101 --> 01:12:52.060
like there's something really cool about hearing the pic moving across the

1261
01:12:52.061 --> 01:12:55.740
guitar when you know that that's what you're hearing.
Yeah.
It,

1262
01:12:55.990 --> 01:13:00.990
it gives you this certain strange connection and then stead if that was like

1263
01:13:01.061 --> 01:13:05.140
cleaned up,
this perfect sound is perfect.
Synthesize how many,

1264
01:13:05.141 --> 01:13:08.680
this is still a cool thing,
but it's missing out on whatever,

1265
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:11.570
whatever makes it,

1266
01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.880
whatever that unique feeling that you get from someone's artists.
You know,

1267
01:13:15.881 --> 01:13:16.714
when you see someone,

1268
01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.750
like David Cho was here the other day and he had some paintings and just seeing

1269
01:13:19.751 --> 01:13:22.150
his paintings and knowing him,
he's amazing.
Yeah.

1270
01:13:22.151 --> 01:13:25.540
And it's like you're getting his unique art.

1271
01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:27.280
It's very uniquely his.

1272
01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.080
And yet that's what's missing with all this protools shit.
Right.

1273
01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:33.960
<v 2>Well you get perspective.
Yeah.</v>

1274
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:38.410
I mean with any real art,
I think you just kind of,

1275
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:39.990
it's somebody you know,
that's what you do.

1276
01:13:39.991 --> 01:13:43.980
You observe and you assimilate and then you put out your perception of this

1277
01:13:43.981 --> 01:13:47.760
thing and hopefully a way that everybody can relate to,
you know,

1278
01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:52.380
you're kind of putting the unspeakable
and into a visual,

1279
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:53.970
you know what I mean?
If that makes sense.

1280
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:55.470
<v 1>SORTA.
And what do you,</v>

1281
01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:58.620
what do you think about people that make like electronic music like that?

1282
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:02.310
<v 2>You know what man,
I love a lot of that shit.
I think,
I think anything,</v>

1283
01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:06.150
any good music is soul music and you can put soul in anything.

1284
01:14:06.151 --> 01:14:09.870
Like somebody really put a lot of time into sequencing all that shit out and

1285
01:14:09.871 --> 01:14:12.130
there's a lot of crap.
Just anything else,
you know,

1286
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:13.023
<v 4>just like anything else.</v>

1287
01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:18.480
But I dare anybody to go stand in front of a Scrillex concert and telling me

1288
01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:24.040
that that's not bad.
The fuck ass.
You know what I mean?
Yeah,
exactly.

1289
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.430
Yeah,
I can,
I can listen and appreciate anything as long as it's done from a,

1290
01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.140
and you can tell when it's not.
I mean,

1291
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:34.750
it's like anything else about today we were,

1292
01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:39.130
we were talking earlier about how if you had a record deal in the 1970s you had

1293
01:14:39.131 --> 01:14:40.990
to be a bad motherfucker,
had to be happy.

1294
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.970
But isn't it better that it's more accessible today?
Well,

1295
01:14:45.971 --> 01:14:49.180
you'll get more quantity and you'll get a lot of shitheads.
But you were also,

1296
01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:53.200
the quality will slip through too,
do you think?
No,
I don't,

1297
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.960
I don't think it's a good thing at all because we know people have to sift

1298
01:14:55.961 --> 01:15:00.010
through a lot of mediocre bullshit to fund the real stuff.
But they found you.

1299
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.750
So if someone finds you,
you could get spread pretty quick now.
Yeah.
But it,

1300
01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.020
it became at some point it became this thing where,
you know,
everybody wants to,

1301
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:11.940
wants to be in a band at some point,
whether it's,
um,

1302
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:16.760
excuse me,
a lot of people now,
hey,
coffee man,
bulletproof.
Uh,

1303
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:18.740
it feels to me like there's a,

1304
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.940
there's an element of it where a lot of people think that playing music for a

1305
01:15:21.941 --> 01:15:25.780
living is a right.
It's just something you can decide to go,
do.

1306
01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.820
You know what I mean?
Like,
Oh,

1307
01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:31.550
I'm going to put a Kickstarter campaign up because we need a new van to tour in,

1308
01:15:31.551 --> 01:15:35.710
so give me some money so I can go to her and played music.
Fuck you man.
You know,

1309
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:38.920
get out there and earn it.
Because even though,

1310
01:15:38.921 --> 01:15:43.921
I mean I got a wife that I love and a four month old son that I've seen exactly

1311
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:48.340
like 12 days of his life and I spent all the time in a van with three or four

1312
01:15:48.341 --> 01:15:51.580
stinky other dudes going out and playing to a bunch of drunk strangers.

1313
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:55.480
And it's still the greatest fucking job on planet,
you know?

1314
01:15:56.170 --> 01:16:00.160
And if it never went anywhere beyond where it is right now for me,

1315
01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:04.870
I feel like I've just basically clawed my way to the beginning as it were.
Um,

1316
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.570
and if we're playing clubs to three or 500 people,
I mean,
I can,

1317
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:12.150
I can make a living at some point doing that.
And it's,

1318
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:14.050
I'm not compromising in any way.

1319
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:16.480
I don't have to wake up and like report to anybody.

1320
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:19.840
I'm not sitting in fucking meetings for a week about what my haircut should look

1321
01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:20.674
like.

1322
01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.520
And I just feel like there's a lot of people like you see and you used to see

1323
01:16:26.981 --> 01:16:28.690
back in club dates and you just,

1324
01:16:28.691 --> 01:16:32.710
you can tell like the blatant blinding narcissism that permeates this industry

1325
01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.070
were people literally almost come to fucking fist fights over who's going to

1326
01:16:37.071 --> 01:16:41.500
play what sets spot at this rinky dink club that nobody gives a shit about it

1327
01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:44.440
just because they think there's going to be somebody there and it's going to

1328
01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:48.240
recognize my genius and this is going to change everything and I think could get

1329
01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:51.580
a lot of entitlement because of that.
Um,

1330
01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:54.710
and that's to me probably the worst aspect of,

1331
01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:59.200
of working in the music business is entitled

1332
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:02.320
musicians.
Yeah.

1333
01:17:02.321 --> 01:17:07.250
Well everybody comes at it from a different place and everybody,
I'm,

1334
01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.180
I'm talking about sort of all aspects of show business and everybody handles

1335
01:17:11.181 --> 01:17:14.870
their own needs in a different way.
Like some people go in less needy,

1336
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.920
some people are just completely obsessed with the idea of success and it's just

1337
01:17:18.921 --> 01:17:23.540
like permeates every cell of their body and goal as opposed to the actual art.

1338
01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:27.360
Yeah,
yeah.
You can hear that Shit really pretty easy.
But what it,

1339
01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:30.080
that's why people go crazy when that shit slips through though.
Right.

1340
01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.620
And that stuff works well.
It's always worked.
I mean it's not a new concept.

1341
01:17:33.621 --> 01:17:37.940
They're pop music's been around since the very first days of the music business

1342
01:17:37.941 --> 01:17:41.550
has what it was all about.
But there's good pop music too,
right?
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1343
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.440
Yeah.
That's what's weird about it.
Right?
It's all just good.
Song's a good song.

1344
01:17:45.441 --> 01:17:48.590
Yeah.
I don't know.
It's a,

1345
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:51.590
you can go crazy thinking about it.
So I try not to.

1346
01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:55.890
So is it necessary that you live in Nashville?
No,
it's not at all.

1347
01:17:56.030 --> 01:18:00.140
I thought it would be when in the beginning it was because you have to be

1348
01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:01.490
playing in those clubs,

1349
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:04.340
which are some of the most thankless clubs in the entire nation.

1350
01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:06.920
Like you can't make money playing in Nashville.
It's just Kinda,

1351
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:10.660
it's where you go to find people that can help you really.
Um,

1352
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:13.440
and I've been very fortunate in that regard that we're,
I,

1353
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:15.760
I was found sort of by the,

1354
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:20.400
maybe the handful of actually trustworthy folks in town.
Um,
my,

1355
01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:23.090
me and my manager never took a dollar from me for the first three years.

1356
01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:26.840
He was just kind of like a friend that gave me solid advice and told me what not

1357
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:31.540
to do because he's watched guys like me get chewed up and spit out for 20 years.

1358
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:35.270
He was almost retired basically.
And uh,
he just said,

1359
01:18:35.271 --> 01:18:38.120
I'll help you and if it turns into a Gig,
I want the Gig.
And he was like,
yeah,

1360
01:18:38.121 --> 01:18:39.590
all right man,
you got to deal.
And

1361
01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:45.500
just kind of like put this wall up between a lot of that shit that tap that

1362
01:18:45.501 --> 01:18:49.040
happens to a lot of people and they get taken advantage of and you end up bitter

1363
01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:53.930
as a result and your creativity suffers.
Right.
Um,
so I just decided,
well,

1364
01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:57.380
if I just don't have anything to do with any of that,
then that can never happen.

1365
01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:01.190
So now,
four years later,
you know,
I have a great book agent,

1366
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.120
I have a manager and,

1367
01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:06.680
and these people that kind of help facilitate us getting out and playing shows

1368
01:19:06.681 --> 01:19:10.400
on the road.
And I mean,
I could start a tour from anywhere.

1369
01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.440
So my wife and I talked about that and it was like,

1370
01:19:12.441 --> 01:19:16.490
why do we even still live here?
Because we don't go out,
you know?

1371
01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:20.450
Yeah.
It's like a,
the Hollywood thing too,
right?

1372
01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:23.380
There's a lot of people that are comics and we're on the road all the time and

1373
01:19:23.381 --> 01:19:25.430
they still live here.
But you can practice here.

1374
01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:30.260
Do you need a place to practice or can you,
you can practice in a studio,
right?

1375
01:19:30.261 --> 01:19:34.460
What do you mean?
Like rehearsals?
We never rehearse.
He never rehearse.
Yeah.

1376
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.230
I got a very small compact ban.
We,

1377
01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:39.980
we've been doing this and they're beginning.

1378
01:19:39.981 --> 01:19:43.080
We rehearsed every day for like six months to get the chemistry they were.

1379
01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:47.640
Now the shows are basically every show's different.
It's very dynamic.
And um,

1380
01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:50.390
would you like to keep it lean because of that?
He can get the freedom.

1381
01:19:50.391 --> 01:19:51.400
You can kinda just go here,

1382
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:56.270
there and everything's just sort of an extension of my acoustic guitar.

1383
01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:00.220
So you kind of just,
we never write set lists.
Really.
Yeah.

1384
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:05.030
Just kind of feel the audience fill room and try to just maintain focus on

1385
01:20:05.031 --> 01:20:07.950
dynamics.
So when you new songs,

1386
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:10.980
<v 3>um,
do you write them together?</v>

1387
01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:14.270
Do you write them yourself and then bring it to them and yeah,

1388
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:19.770
<v 2>myself typically I don't like to play songs.
I haven't recorded in the studio,</v>

1389
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:23.220
formulate it and then get it down and committed and then they,

1390
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.640
they kinda tend to come to life all on their own.

1391
01:20:26.641 --> 01:20:29.670
Over the course of a year and a half year.
You ended up at the end of the tour.

1392
01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:32.520
That song sounds nothing like the one you put down on the tape.
Why is that?

1393
01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:37.770
You just,
you get boards,
you've pushed things and go different places and try,

1394
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:39.450
you know,

1395
01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:44.450
try to just keep it exciting and take risks and it makes you a better musician,

1396
01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:49.110
you know,
obviously eight months later from the time you recorded that song,

1397
01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:52.350
if you've been playing every night for two hours,

1398
01:20:52.351 --> 01:20:54.540
if you haven't become a better musician by that time,

1399
01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:56.100
then you're doing this for the wrong reasons.

1400
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:58.920
So now when you go into make your next record,

1401
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:04.020
ideally you know you've trained harder,

1402
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:05.083
<v 3>right?
Right.</v>

1403
01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:09.740
So you will change like the rhythm will you,
will you,

1404
01:21:09.741 --> 01:21:14.290
will you add lines to songs?
Only when I forget the other ones.
Um,

1405
01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.170
does that happen all the time?
All the time,

1406
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.910
but nobody can really understand what the hell I'm saying anyways.

1407
01:21:24.850 --> 01:21:29.520
Fake my way slower through it and they don't,
they're none the wiser.
Um,

1408
01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.210
would you ever consider doing like a residency somewhere?

1409
01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.020
Like a Vegas type thing where people always came to you though we may think that

1410
01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:38.780
you always have to tour.
That's the kind of thing you do when your career's over.

1411
01:21:38.781 --> 01:21:43.210
And is that what it is?
Just getting started,
but I always wondered like,
Bam,

1412
01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:46.340
the trap,
we were talking when you got here,
you were beat because of traveling.

1413
01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:48.650
And I'm beat because of travel and I was just trying,

1414
01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:52.730
I was only traveling for two days and now just the flying back and forth from

1415
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:55.310
Philly to DC,
la to Philly,
Philly to DC,

1416
01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:58.010
DC to la and do that in two days and just like,
ugh.

1417
01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.000
If you could just stay put,
if they could all come to you.

1418
01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:04.613
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1419
01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:08.210
<v 3>Um,
you know what I mean?
Or it's part of the Gig,</v>

1420
01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:12.470
like the travel and the stuff that sucks and being away from your family,

1421
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.540
<v 2>that's what,
that's where you,
you know,</v>

1422
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:18.270
musicians play music and that's where you become a musician,

1423
01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:24.060
rule 10 thousands and all that.
But it's so truthfully for me,

1424
01:22:24.061 --> 01:22:25.350
man,
it's really bittersweet.

1425
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:28.770
Everything that's happening right now because I've been,
like I said,

1426
01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:33.570
for off and on for a lot of different reasons that I've put it down over the

1427
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:33.661
years.
What,

1428
01:22:33.661 --> 01:22:38.250
I've been doing this a long time and I've had a very thankless capacities.

1429
01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:41.850
It's all just been very passionate and driven.
And then now,

1430
01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:47.130
you know,
I've got a newborn son and uh,
everything's happening and I'm just,

1431
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:51.300
I'm just slammed so much that I'm exhausted a lot of times.
And uh,

1432
01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.300
it's really weird because I'm out here and all this stuff we've worked so hard

1433
01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:57.060
for is finally happen.
But a lot of these,
I just really want to be at home.

1434
01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:02.910
<v 3>That's the catch 22.
That's what I get for,</v>

1435
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.070
for starting at 34 that's where you get

1436
01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.970
<v 4>for being successful too.
Now you're busy.
If you weren't,</v>

1437
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.490
you'd wish you were busy,
which shows on yeah,

1438
01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:15.790
be sit on the couch wishing I had a gig.
Yeah.
It's damned if you do.

1439
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:19.300
You're way better off with this damned.
Yes.

1440
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:22.060
The damned if you do is way better than damned if you don't.
I just,

1441
01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:25.510
I just miss my family a lot.
I of course,
can you take them on the road with you?

1442
01:23:25.810 --> 01:23:27.750
Ideally that's the goal.
Right?

1443
01:23:27.751 --> 01:23:30.490
But you know that certain other thing I got to take care of,

1444
01:23:30.491 --> 01:23:32.900
the band I got to take has a lot of,
there's a lot of,

1445
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:38.200
you don't really make money touring.
It's just how you build awareness.
Wow.

1446
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.920
What a pain in the ass.
So if you don't make money touring,
how do you make money?

1447
01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:44.570
<v 2>That's a good question.
Joe Rogan</v>

1448
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:48.170
<v 4>because album sales are real issue now.</v>

1449
01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.770
It's so funny cause people that you know back home or that I haven't talked to

1450
01:23:51.771 --> 01:23:53.740
since I was in high school and you know,

1451
01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.780
all of a sudden you start getting texts from unknown numbers and shit and people

1452
01:23:56.781 --> 01:23:59.660
you haven't talked to and they're like,
man you fucking made it man.

1453
01:23:59.661 --> 01:24:03.440
It's like large blowing it up.
It's like they think because you get some press

1454
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:08.410
<v 2>and in 10 or 12 media outlets that you're just raking in the dough and that's</v>

1455
01:24:08.411 --> 01:24:11.080
just not the reality.
Making records is fucking expensive.

1456
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:14.920
Packaging records is expensive.
Like especially when I wanted to put out vinyl

1457
01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:17.050
<v 4>barely pays for itself.
Yeah.</v>

1458
01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:20.950
We never got into how much the first one cost we sorta started never uh,

1459
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.370
the first one because that,
because of some of the guys we used on the session,

1460
01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:27.520
they're doing like a pig,
the pig and the guy named Robbie Turner,

1461
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:32.010
he's placed deal for Waylon and other guy really serious to steal for Waylon.

1462
01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:35.120
And so they,
they I drink whiskey.
Yeah.

1463
01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:38.620
Well there was this dream come true scenario where this investor came into the

1464
01:24:38.621 --> 01:24:39.454
picture

1465
01:24:39.690 --> 01:24:42.340
<v 2>and what's going to help out.
And,
and Blah,
blah,
blah.</v>

1466
01:24:42.341 --> 01:24:46.160
And then at the last minute it all,
you know,

1467
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:50.250
went away
due to negotiations.

1468
01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:53.470
So then I got stuck with the bill on this record that I thought I was going to

1469
01:24:53.471 --> 01:24:57.430
have help making and it was all about all of a sudden done about 27 grand that I

1470
01:24:57.431 --> 01:24:58.810
didn't have.
Wow.

1471
01:24:58.811 --> 01:25:03.790
So spent that year on the road playing and then trying to pay that debt off.

1472
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.350
And then about a year later,
once we're coming back off tour,

1473
01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.190
we're about five grand in the black.

1474
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:12.520
And I just spent all this time on the road with this,

1475
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:14.020
with this young band had put together,

1476
01:25:14.021 --> 01:25:17.410
working out all these songs and just decided,
all right,

1477
01:25:17.411 --> 01:25:20.710
well let's just go make the,
make a record.
Wow.

1478
01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.460
It has to be quick because we don't have the cash,
you know.

1479
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:28.750
So I paid the guys in the band 1000 bucks and then the other thousand went

1480
01:25:28.751 --> 01:25:30.910
towards paying the engineers and my buddy Dave,

1481
01:25:30.911 --> 01:25:35.520
the producer just kind of did it for free on Spec to help out.
Wow.
Um,

1482
01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:36.701
that's all.

1483
01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:41.630
I think the whole thing cost about 4,500 bucks and uh,

1484
01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:47.000
which it was just very,
very inexpensive to make an help and that,

1485
01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:49.880
and now this record that sort of started,
I guess what we'll call it,

1486
01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:51.460
the beginning of a career,

1487
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:58.210
if I hadn't taken that in and tried to shop it to anybody,
you know,
any,

1488
01:25:58.211 --> 01:26:03.211
any major label or music row entity or even a lot of indie labels and laid that

1489
01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.860
down one,
it's a country record.

1490
01:26:05.890 --> 01:26:09.140
Two of talking about rep aliens and fucking turtles and shit man,

1491
01:26:09.141 --> 01:26:12.740
you know exactly as well as I do.
How that would have gone.
Yeah.
You know,

1492
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:17.260
what's the turtle thing?
What's,
that's a,
that's a,
a jocular expression,

1493
01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:20.210
I guess from a Stephen Hawking book.
Um,
it's,
it's a,

1494
01:26:20.211 --> 01:26:25.211
it's like an old comedic reference to the infinite regress problem in cosmology,

1495
01:26:26.871 --> 01:26:27.704
which,
you know,

1496
01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.713
<v 0>the,</v>

1497
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:33.870
<v 2>basically all the shit we were talking about earlier and there's a story,</v>

1498
01:26:33.871 --> 01:26:36.720
I guess there was some professor at Oxford or somewhere giving a speech and

1499
01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:41.880
explaining how the universe works and,
and,
and everything else.

1500
01:26:41.881 --> 01:26:44.820
And some little lady stood up and said,
you know,
that's really clever.

1501
01:26:44.821 --> 01:26:49.050
I know you think you're smart but you're wrong.
And he's like,
oh yeah,

1502
01:26:49.051 --> 01:26:51.090
well what's,
what's the,
what's the truth?
And she's like,
well,

1503
01:26:51.091 --> 01:26:52.740
the earth sits on the back of this chart,

1504
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:57.480
cosmic turtle and carries it through space.
And he said,
well,

1505
01:26:57.481 --> 01:26:59.820
what's carrying the turtle?
And she's like,
oh,
that's pretty clever,

1506
01:26:59.821 --> 01:27:03.720
but it's another turtle.
And he's like,
well,
what's under that?
She's like,

1507
01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:06.480
you might as well,
you're wasting your time.
It's turtles all the way down.

1508
01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.010
And so Hawkin referenced this in brief history of time,

1509
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:14.070
and it's weird because you can look back,
um,

1510
01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:18.750
Hindu cosmology and a lot of,
uh,
some native American tribes,

1511
01:27:18.751 --> 01:27:23.040
they'll hold these like earthly turtles in the higher reverence and the

1512
01:27:23.041 --> 01:27:24.180
symbology of it all.

1513
01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:29.070
And you find that story and different cultures throughout,
you know,
space,

1514
01:27:29.071 --> 01:27:30.870
but thousands of years.
But there's this weird,

1515
01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.840
weird reference to this cosmic turtle and none of the Indians or the Hindu

1516
01:27:34.841 --> 01:27:38.340
thought there were these four elephant standing on the back of the turtle and

1517
01:27:38.341 --> 01:27:41.280
the earth was a flat disk rescue.
I don't,
it's back.
Whoa.

1518
01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.570
And it just crew through space.

1519
01:27:42.571 --> 01:27:44.880
There's a lot of artwork you can find associated to this.

1520
01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:48.230
I just thought that it was really the,
the,

1521
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:50.790
the record at its core is about love,
you know,

1522
01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:53.250
being like this one universal truth.

1523
01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.860
And you get a lot of people look to religion and a lot of people look to drugs.

1524
01:27:56.861 --> 01:28:00.870
And I'm not saying you can't get really spiritual experiences from all of those

1525
01:28:00.871 --> 01:28:04.740
things,
but I think love at the end of the day is the one thing that really,

1526
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.360
I've ever found forced me to want to wake up and really try to be a better human

1527
01:28:09.361 --> 01:28:12.390
being every day.
You know?
So that was the main point of the,

1528
01:28:12.391 --> 01:28:15.580
of the album and the turtles thing was just kind of,
it's,

1529
01:28:15.581 --> 01:28:19.050
it's a way of saying if you get into an argument with somebody and you realize

1530
01:28:19.051 --> 01:28:20.910
it's just pointless and you're going back and forth,

1531
01:28:20.911 --> 01:28:23.790
it's turtles all the way down because like,
don't nobody really know Shit,

1532
01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:27.810
you know?
And we're all just trying to not kill each other.
So,

1533
01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:31.950
I don't know.
I decided it would make a good country song.

1534
01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:36.420
<v 3>Well that's a fascinating theory on her part of me.
What did she mean?</v>

1535
01:28:36.421 --> 01:28:39.020
Look at that.
There's a picture of the earth with turtles below it.

1536
01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:46.770
Who you who did that?
Jamie.
No idea.
Hollingsworth.
Steven.

1537
01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:50.560
<v 2>What a bizarre idea.
There's some really,</v>

1538
01:28:50.561 --> 01:28:52.990
really cool visual.

1539
01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:59.100
<v 3>What a bizarre idea.
I'm like,
why?
Why Turtles?
What they're trying to say.</v>

1540
01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.750
Turtles are the oldest noon

1541
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.070
<v 2>living species on</v>

1542
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:06.780
<v 3>the planet.
They probably predate crocodiles and the reps hall species.</v>

1543
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:09.930
Um,
and they the 13 symmetrical.

1544
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.540
We'll leave the design of the shells.

1545
01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:15.600
A lot of like ancient Indian tribes thought that that was in connection with the

1546
01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:20.310
13 lunar cycles.
And um,
it's just the ancient creature.

1547
01:29:20.311 --> 01:29:22.880
They live a long time.
They're very independent,
self sufficient.

1548
01:29:22.881 --> 01:29:24.600
They carry their homes on their back.
So I thought,

1549
01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:29.100
I'm really like wise old plus the pineal gland,
you know,

1550
01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.330
cut that shit open.

1551
01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:34.140
There was a little third eye Ballston some of them even have like a translucent

1552
01:29:34.141 --> 01:29:37.620
layer.
The top of their skull where the pineal gland sets,

1553
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:42.030
I save turtles for pets.
Really had to get rid of them.
My wife got pregnant,

1554
01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:45.930
same Manila.
Well,
they're just dangerous.
They're dirty,
stinky little fuckers,

1555
01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.710
you know,
there they will give off some fucking series poop disease.

1556
01:29:49.711 --> 01:29:53.130
You've got to really stare very messy.
And I would feed them goldfish.

1557
01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:55.830
They're not really meant for domestication,
but there's sure.
Cool.

1558
01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:59.490
They're the ones I had.
I had Paranas at one point in time,
allegedly,

1559
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.870
since they're illegal,
say allegedly,
uh,

1560
01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.640
and watching Puranas eat is not nearly as cool as watching turtles eat.

1561
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:08.850
Turtles are a motherfucker,
dude.
Really fucking cool.

1562
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:13.020
They grab goldfish and just bite them in half.
Just grab them with their paws.

1563
01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:17.130
It's like watching dinosaurs eat and they swim after the goldfish.

1564
01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.780
They're fucking predatory man.

1565
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.970
Like I always thought of turtles as being like the sort of slow moving thing

1566
01:30:23.971 --> 01:30:27.390
that really didn't fuck with anybody.
Not nope.

1567
01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:31.950
Hungry turtles in a fish tank and some goldfish and you just have an orgy of

1568
01:30:31.951 --> 01:30:35.130
slaughter.
I mean,
they're wild to watch that back.

1569
01:30:35.131 --> 01:30:38.690
And the only way we're like turtles,
the size of fucking school buses,
you know,

1570
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:42.060
where the,
is that how big they were?
I would find I and everything else was huge.

1571
01:30:42.210 --> 01:30:44.160
I mean,
yeah,

1572
01:30:44.410 --> 01:30:48.420
I've never had that adequately explained to me why everything was so fucking
big.

1573
01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:53.850
<v 2>And why are the species that lasted diminished through evolution?</v>

1574
01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:56.940
Like crocodile,
he'd be like 70 80 foot crocodiles.

1575
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:59.210
<v 3>It was a different species of crocodile.
But yeah,</v>

1576
01:30:59.211 --> 01:31:00.470
the ones that are out now though,

1577
01:31:00.471 --> 01:31:02.380
they've been around for hundreds of millions a year.

1578
01:31:02.381 --> 01:31:06.290
So that means the ones around now survived the thing that hit the Yucatan,

1579
01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:11.150
which is like what?
Okay.
Because sharks did too.
Right?

1580
01:31:11.151 --> 01:31:15.650
Sharks had been around in this state for more than a hundred million years.
Yeah.

1581
01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:19.820
I don't get it.
It's may amazing that those things are around on.

1582
01:31:19.821 --> 01:31:23.810
We get a chance to look at an animal that would have walked freely amongst the

1583
01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.940
dinosaurs.
When you see a crocodile,

1584
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:29.300
you're essentially seeing a prehistoric beast.
Yeah.

1585
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:34.160
Crazy prehistoric thing.
Covered in armor.
Wattles around,

1586
01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:38.480
takes gazelles out and just looking for shit to kill.
Oh,
it's disgusting.

1587
01:31:38.481 --> 01:31:42.880
Fucking monsters.
That would make a hell of a pair of shoes though.
Okay.
Yourself?

1588
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:46.910
A couple of Nice croc shoes.
Ooh.
Politan bitches up.
Nice gators.

1589
01:31:48.730 --> 01:31:50.000
Alligators or,
uh,

1590
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:53.720
I mean at one point in time they were really extinct or on the verge of

1591
01:31:53.721 --> 01:31:56.870
extinction there were really in danger.
That's when I lived in Florida.

1592
01:31:57.140 --> 01:32:00.160
We used to feed them and we said throw marshmallows into this place called

1593
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:00.821
<v 4>Lake Alice.</v>

1594
01:32:00.821 --> 01:32:04.390
And they would come up and snatch up the marshmallows and I never would've

1595
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.060
thought that they would get so plentiful that they would start hunting them,

1596
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:09.880
but now they turn,
they're trying to kill as many alligators they can.

1597
01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:11.380
They just can't keep up with him.

1598
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:16.150
I took him to Lewis Fan boat tours down in New Orleans one time we go out with

1599
01:32:16.151 --> 01:32:17.980
like some dude with three teeth,

1600
01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:22.420
jumps on the lily pond and starts smacking these alligators in the head and
shit.

1601
01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:24.520
And,
but at the end of it,

1602
01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:27.820
he had this little baby alligator and a cooler on the boat,
just,

1603
01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.050
just torturing the shit out of this poor animal,
you know,

1604
01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:32.770
and they pass it around.

1605
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:36.250
There's like 14 people in this pontoon out to her in the swamp and everybody

1606
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:39.190
gets a chance to hold this little baby alligator.
So you met,

1607
01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.810
he's probably scared shitless,

1608
01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:46.150
all these weird hormones and so I'm the fucking very last person to get this

1609
01:32:46.721 --> 01:32:49.360
thing.
Dude.
I swear to God,
as soon as they,
my wife hands it to me,

1610
01:32:49.361 --> 01:32:53.140
it just pissed all over me and him cause you're holding by the tail and just

1611
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:58.170
this fire hydrant of of urine just misting out all over me,

1612
01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:02.640
man.
I'm just like,
this was not meant to happen.
It wasn't meant to have me.

1613
01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.990
The chosen one.
Right.
It was holding in.
It's pay.

1614
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.350
It's like I'm going to get the sturgeon

1615
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:11.950
and anoint him with my knowing him and let him know he's the chosen one.

1616
01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.920
It trusted you because you were probably the only one that wouldn't smash.

1617
01:33:14.921 --> 01:33:19.330
It's call open if it pissed all over.
I mean it was nothing to do.

1618
01:33:19.331 --> 01:33:22.840
I just kind of had to hold it and let him finish because it's a mouth taped up.

1619
01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:25.580
Yeah.
He had like a big rubber band on it.
Yeah.
We had a,

1620
01:33:25.581 --> 01:33:30.220
an alligator on fear factor once at a mouth taped up to fuck that man.

1621
01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:31.751
Yeah.
This guy,

1622
01:33:31.751 --> 01:33:35.710
he jumps out on this little grass pollen and you just see like eight of them in

1623
01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:39.130
succession come out of nowhere and starts with mentors and they all jump up.

1624
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:42.860
You know,
he understands the behaviors in the sight line,
but I'm just this guide,

1625
01:33:42.861 --> 01:33:47.560
this massive scar on his bald head and literally three teeth in his head.

1626
01:33:47.561 --> 01:33:51.390
He's like nab and Devon dumped damp and then I'm like,

1627
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.400
I'm going to watch this guy died.
Well had to get this car that man,

1628
01:33:54.401 --> 01:33:57.580
I'll get her back though.
I don't know man.

1629
01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.710
I want to engage as little as possible.

1630
01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.930
I would have had to ask.
I think.
Yeah,

1631
01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:08.470
I would have had to ask that fucks with alligators and he's got an alligator

1632
01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:10.600
size bite on his head or he might,

1633
01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:13.010
I was afraid he might have been like a veteran.
It almost had like,

1634
01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:17.100
it was like a giant scar that went from the back of his neck over his goal.

1635
01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:22.610
So I didn't want to.
Right.
Where'd you get the scar man?
How that happened?

1636
01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:26.560
I lost all my friends
go on a boat ride.

1637
01:34:27.630 --> 01:34:32.260
Yeah.
Oh holy.
Of Shaky memories over it every night in the middle of the night.

1638
01:34:32.261 --> 01:34:36.220
I hear the guns,
I hear the explosions.
That's fucked up.
Yeah.

1639
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:39.040
They have watched the show.
Small people,

1640
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:42.150
they make a living just kill an alligator or you're talking about Dev?

1641
01:34:42.151 --> 01:34:46.540
Hundreds of alligator tags.
They'll get like a hundred tags and they have to,

1642
01:34:46.541 --> 01:34:48.310
they can kill a hundred alligators in a season.

1643
01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:50.760
That's when he fucking alligators or are we just sold in the skins?

1644
01:34:50.761 --> 01:34:54.370
What do they do?
Yeah,
they saw the skins and the meat to the mean is a delicious,

1645
01:34:54.371 --> 01:34:58.130
apparently it's the highest amount of protein.
It's got more protein

1646
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:01.580
<v 3>per ounce of a,
of alligator meat.
Then I think like any them,</v>

1647
01:35:01.890 --> 01:35:05.210
let's try it a couple times.
It's really chewy.
I think it's how you,

1648
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:08.120
how you prepare it.
I would like to try it fresh.

1649
01:35:08.121 --> 01:35:12.260
I've only tried it deep fried and like in batter and it was,
you know,

1650
01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.210
it was forgettable,

1651
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:18.170
but apparently if you get a fresh alligator and someone's a good chef and they

1652
01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:20.660
understand how to cook it,
they can.
It's really delicious.

1653
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:25.280
But it's one of those things like a lot of wild game gets real tricky cause

1654
01:35:25.281 --> 01:35:29.440
there's no fat.
I think alligator is probably very similar.
Rattlesnake.
Yeah,

1655
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:31.610
I've had Ralph says,
yeah,
it's weird

1656
01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:37.820
cause some to I like to just flashed it and some butter.
Yeah.

1657
01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:41.450
Oh did you cook it yourself?
No,
my uncle cook the,
Oh wow.

1658
01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:46.980
He's one of those pilgrim motherfuckers that just,
that's a chewy,
chewy.

1659
01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:50.760
The really distinct flavor.
Yeah.

1660
01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:55.670
Wild game tends to be very difficult to cook.
Right.
If you cook it too much,

1661
01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:59.180
you fuck it up and then you have to like really be careful.

1662
01:35:59.181 --> 01:36:03.940
I bet alligators probably similar in that way.
I'll tell you stood a,

1663
01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:08.480
I worked with a guy and that yard pour is a big hunter and he would you bow hunt

1664
01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:10.660
and uh,
he moved up to Wyoming so he,

1665
01:36:10.690 --> 01:36:12.570
cause he could get like four or six more tags a year.

1666
01:36:12.571 --> 01:36:15.690
Then he couldn't use hall and he drive the hour and a half every day.

1667
01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:20.240
Even like wow.
Through the winter blizzards to come to this job just so he could,

1668
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:23.360
the kid was just eat up with it,
man,
but he apparently,
he said,

1669
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.840
I think the longest distance shot in Wyoming at 23 and then he'd hunt Moose and

1670
01:36:28.971 --> 01:36:30.140
elk and everything else will the Boba,

1671
01:36:30.150 --> 01:36:34.610
he would cut and he bring in these venison like filet cutlet,

1672
01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:35.840
medallions of elk meat,

1673
01:36:35.841 --> 01:36:38.930
and we had a grill down at the switch shagging cook that she has a best fucking

1674
01:36:38.931 --> 01:36:42.650
thing I've ever tasted in my life because it's hard to go back to eating ground

1675
01:36:42.651 --> 01:36:47.480
beef after tasting it,
you know?
Yeah.
Just so good for you,
man.

1676
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:50.810
Yeah.
You just tasted in the meat that it's good for it.
You're like,
whoa.

1677
01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:54.260
Apparently Moose is like that too.
I never ate moose before,

1678
01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.490
but supposed to be unbelievably good.
Like you need it and just go,
my God,

1679
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.660
I'm sort of in all of those people that,

1680
01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.060
that want to get 40 feet from moose with a bone arrow.

1681
01:37:05.061 --> 01:37:09.560
That's pretty fucking hardcore,
40 yards,
40 feet is fucking pushing it.

1682
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:14.630
I mean the you,
you,
you better hit it,
right.
I mean,
I'm sure it's happened.

1683
01:37:14.631 --> 01:37:17.270
I'm sure someone's been 40 feet,
but you know,
close 40 feet.

1684
01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:20.930
I don't have any idea.
Yeah,
40 feet is where the bathroom,
that's the pisser.
Yeah,

1685
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:24.170
you could do it.
I mean,
it could happen,
but Goddamn,

1686
01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:27.920
the fact that the Moose hasn't run away or charged you,

1687
01:37:27.921 --> 01:37:31.490
or you have to call the men,
you have to pretend that your pussy.
Oh,

1688
01:37:31.491 --> 01:37:34.760
saw trying to get some over here.
And then he comes home.

1689
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:39.900
Warmth comes waddling through all 1500 pounds as of like a bull.
Oh,

1690
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.320
it's a giant animal.
Or He's seen him in,
in Shit.
Right.
I mean,

1691
01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.460
like they're there.
I wouldn't say they're mean.

1692
01:37:46.461 --> 01:37:49.030
They're defensive and aggressive like a mother and a calf.

1693
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.210
You don't ever want to run into that.

1694
01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:53.210
I was with a mother and a calf on an island.
We,
uh,

1695
01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.690
took a boat out to an island and me and Ari and,
uh,

1696
01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:01.350
this Guy Matt was a guide up in Alaska,
took us salmon fishing valley river jars.

1697
01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:05.580
We've pulled up onto this a island and there was a moose Amala Mama Moose there

1698
01:38:05.581 --> 01:38:09.060
with her calf.
And we were no more than 30 yards away from her.

1699
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:13.590
It was real touch and go like I was looking at this Moose and she was looking at

1700
01:38:13.591 --> 01:38:14.790
us like,
oh for real,

1701
01:38:15.090 --> 01:38:17.490
like you motherfuckers are just going to pull up onto this island.

1702
01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.610
I'm on an island with my baby.
It was one of a big island either,

1703
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.330
but his dad owns the island and he has like a resort,

1704
01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:29.130
like a camp set up like for fishermen and hunters on this island and so I was

1705
01:38:29.131 --> 01:38:32.490
like these cabins and shit there and generators and stuff and the Moose is just

1706
01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:36.170
hanging out there just keeping a good eye on us.
But it's a touch,

1707
01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:37.440
a big fucking animal.

1708
01:38:37.441 --> 01:38:41.580
It's a horse horse size animal and it just thinking about should I stomped this

1709
01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:44.910
motherfucker?
They just want to make sure you don't make any weird movements.

1710
01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:49.300
Nothing crazy,
nothing predatory.
But we saw several moves while we were there.

1711
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:50.340
They're enormous

1712
01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.990
<v 2>big animals.
It's intense man.</v>

1713
01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:58.340
There was this island out in Utah.

1714
01:38:58.341 --> 01:39:00.930
I was like stay apart antelope pile and it was a buffalo reserve,

1715
01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:02.810
but are all these hiking trails and shake?

1716
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:05.850
Could go out there with these buffalo was co would and sometimes could be

1717
01:39:05.851 --> 01:39:09.530
roaming freely.
And a friend of mine,
we'd gone out through to hike this peak.

1718
01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:11.940
We're coming back down and you can look down,

1719
01:39:11.941 --> 01:39:14.280
we could see like five or 600 yards down on the trailers,

1720
01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:19.010
these two buffalo just standing.
So you know,
we think,
well fuck,

1721
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:21.030
we'll just keep going.
By the time we get down there,
there'll be gone.

1722
01:39:21.031 --> 01:39:24.510
I get to see the herd off in the distance.
And uh,
we come around the bend,

1723
01:39:24.511 --> 01:39:27.170
this clear,
this big rock and they're,
they're standing and I didn't know man.

1724
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:31.050
I grew up around a lot of farms and cows and shit and you just walk right

1725
01:39:31.051 --> 01:39:33.060
through and get out of the way.
I have no idea.

1726
01:39:33.061 --> 01:39:36.840
I don't know anything about Buffalo.
And uh,
my buddy,

1727
01:39:36.841 --> 01:39:38.340
he's just like immediately scared shitless.

1728
01:39:38.341 --> 01:39:41.580
Britain ran and got up on this rock just kind of not knowing what to do.

1729
01:39:41.581 --> 01:39:43.650
And I'm like,
I don't know what I was thinking.

1730
01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:46.590
I just kept walking and I get literally 10 feet away from this thing,

1731
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:49.560
standing sideways broad across the trail.

1732
01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.830
And all of a sudden he just stopped eating grass and turns and looks at me and I

1733
01:39:52.831 --> 01:39:57.090
realize his head is the size of a fucking Volkswagen beetle.
And I'm just like,

1734
01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:01.920
all right,
this was not very close with you owe like 10,
15 feet.
Oh my God.

1735
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:07.990
And then it dawned on me how incredibly stupid,
oh my God.

1736
01:40:07.991 --> 01:40:10.080
And then I'd be like,
this thing probably runs 40 miles an hour.

1737
01:40:10.081 --> 01:40:13.200
Like what am I going to do?
And I took,
I didn't know what else to do,

1738
01:40:13.201 --> 01:40:16.160
so I took one more step towards,

1739
01:40:16.770 --> 01:40:19.920
towards it and it just like kicked up and kind of ran off.

1740
01:40:19.921 --> 01:40:22.890
But the fucking ground shook,
you know,
was just like,

1741
01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:28.100
<v 3>oh man.
I mean,
they could have been so bad.
No good songs.</v>

1742
01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:31.520
Yeah.
Just stand on the Rock,
you know,
laugh,

1743
01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:36.080
have death.
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1744
01:40:36.081 --> 01:40:40.670
There's a wild herd of buffalo in Mexico and we're supposed to go hunting there

1745
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:44.040
sometime this winter for that show.
Midi there.

1746
01:40:44.050 --> 01:40:48.260
We're going to go buffalo hunting.
We were in Mexico.
I'm actually with the guy,

1747
01:40:48.261 --> 01:40:50.720
the producer of the show,
mediator.
Um,
uh,
I dunno,

1748
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:54.070
somewhere in Mexico there's a giant wild of Buffalo.

1749
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:58.580
They brought there in like the 1950s most bison today,
like when you know,

1750
01:40:58.581 --> 01:40:59.770
you buy a bison stakes,

1751
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:04.300
most of it's farm raised is very little wild buffalo left in this country,

1752
01:41:04.301 --> 01:41:07.270
a lot big percentage of is owned it's property.

1753
01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:10.970
People have these big giant game preserves and they,

1754
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:15.850
they have buffalo on them that you can hunt and they have buffalo in these uh,

1755
01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:21.010
livestock places where you buy like farmers Buffalo.
That's what buffalo is.

1756
01:41:21.011 --> 01:41:25.750
Come down to Ted Turner's or,
yeah,
he's got a bunch of places that sell it,

1757
01:41:25.751 --> 01:41:28.570
right?
Isn't it just called teds or something like that?

1758
01:41:28.571 --> 01:41:32.080
It's got a big buy buffalo logo.
Apparently.

1759
01:41:32.170 --> 01:41:34.870
There's a guy that I'm going to have on the podcast,
um,

1760
01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:38.200
that Steve Vernella recommended to me that can tell,

1761
01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.000
explain in great detail what actually happened to the Buffalo.

1762
01:41:43.001 --> 01:41:47.350
But that there's a lot of misconceptions about why the buffalo population was so

1763
01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:52.210
high.
And he says there's a direct correlation between smallpox.

1764
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:54.340
Then when the French and the Spaniards,

1765
01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:56.210
when they brought over smallpox or whoever brought her,

1766
01:41:56.211 --> 01:41:57.044
I guess it was the French,

1767
01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:02.440
it wiped out like 90% of the native American population.
And during that time,

1768
01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.290
the buffalo population just explode,
flourished.

1769
01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:10.160
So when we came along and started slaughtering these,
uh,

1770
01:42:10.210 --> 01:42:13.060
buffalo in mass,
when I say we white people,

1771
01:42:13.061 --> 01:42:14.530
obviously it wasn't you me as long time ago,

1772
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:20.050
but those big piles of buffalo booms of the guilt,
white guilt strong,

1773
01:42:20.610 --> 01:42:20.880
they,

1774
01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:25.480
the reason why those guys were able to find these animals and such giant numbers

1775
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:29.510
was because the native Americans had experienced this massive loss of casualty.

1776
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:32.890
I mean massive 90% casualty rate because of smallpox,

1777
01:42:33.610 --> 01:42:36.760
because they were apparently,
at least in this guy's book,

1778
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.540
he's going to come on the podcast soon.
We're working out the dates,
um,
that he,

1779
01:42:40.541 --> 01:42:44.070
they were on the verge of a extra,
I guess extra patients,

1780
01:42:44.110 --> 01:42:49.110
what they call it in when it's local extinction because the native Americans had

1781
01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:51.340
figured out horseback riding.

1782
01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:54.460
And once they figured out horseback riding over the course of a couple of

1783
01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.210
hundred years,
whatever it was,

1784
01:42:55.210 --> 01:42:57.910
they had almost completely abandoned agriculture and they were just chasing down

1785
01:42:57.911 --> 01:43:01.060
the bison and killing them.
Like fucking crazy.
Evolved hunters.
Yeah.

1786
01:43:01.061 --> 01:43:05.710
So the idea was that that they were on the verge of killing off the buffalo even

1787
01:43:05.711 --> 01:43:10.600
before those crazy ass came in and did it.
Later on,
a hundred years later,

1788
01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:14.900
it's just a smallpox got them and then just,
Oh,
it would have been unheard bloat.

1789
01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:18.250
Even if we had to shut up,
they would have continued procreating.

1790
01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:21.850
And you've been more Indians,
you know,
probably,
right.
Native Americans.

1791
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:24.640
Native Americans.
Yeah.
It is kind of crazy.
We still call them Indians.

1792
01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:27.020
One fuck up,
you know,
shiver,

1793
01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:31.540
Columbus 600 his dumb ass reciprocated down to me sitting here on your podcast

1794
01:43:31.541 --> 01:43:35.550
and I just perpetuated it 500 plus years ago.
He thought he was in India.

1795
01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:38.380
Isn't it good enough,
Chris?
Good enough.

1796
01:43:38.381 --> 01:43:42.990
Or Chris good enough or made then the fucking Indians.
Look what I did.
Yeah,

1797
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.620
they were.
They were some brutal bastards.

1798
01:43:44.621 --> 01:43:49.330
Meaning like running around cracking babies' heads on rocks and serial killers

1799
01:43:49.331 --> 01:43:50.290
basically.
Well,

1800
01:43:50.291 --> 01:43:53.960
the accounts of the missionaries that talked about what Columbus is,

1801
01:43:53.961 --> 01:43:56.330
people did their,
they're horrific.

1802
01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.670
And we never heard that shit when they had Columbus Day.

1803
01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:02.180
I Dunno why I celebrate that idiot.
Yeah,

1804
01:44:02.181 --> 01:44:05.930
it's very strange phrase trains.
We celebrate that guy.

1805
01:44:06.150 --> 01:44:08.720
It seems like there's a bunch of people we missed.
You know,

1806
01:44:08.721 --> 01:44:13.220
how come there's no Gandhi day?
We said we celebrate Columbus.

1807
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:16.100
We don't tell Rick Gandhi Day,
you know?
I mean,

1808
01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:18.950
I would settle for a Jimmy Carter Day.
Yeah,
right.
Oh,

1809
01:44:18.951 --> 01:44:22.580
we're a Christopher Columbus.
Her's a good man.
He does it.
He deserves a day.

1810
01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:23.840
Jimmy Carter should have a day.

1811
01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:27.260
I agree with you and still to this day is a very good man,

1812
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:32.690
very moral and ethical and just very different than what you perceive to be a

1813
01:44:32.691 --> 01:44:35.120
guy who would be the president of United States.
A Hundred Thompson.

1814
01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:37.010
<v 2>He wrote a really great</v>

1815
01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:43.430
piece about Carter.
I can't remember which book it was in,

1816
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:47.510
but he just kinda seemed that he was probably like the last real great

1817
01:44:47.511 --> 01:44:51.680
politician.
He witnessed some speech somewhere.
I can't remember now.

1818
01:44:51.681 --> 01:44:54.530
The details that just,
it's like you felt for the first time,

1819
01:44:54.531 --> 01:44:58.010
like he actually heard a politician be a human being and really talking from his

1820
01:44:58.011 --> 01:45:00.590
heart.
And I think it led to a pretty heavy impression with him.
But

1821
01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:04.690
<v 3>I keep wondering if that's possible.
Again,
if somewhere in the future,</v>

1822
01:45:04.691 --> 01:45:09.430
because of the transparency that we're experiencing now with the social media,

1823
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:12.640
with the Internet,
with the access to information that we have today.

1824
01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:17.200
I wonder if like eventually the bullshit artists wall be exposed to the point

1825
01:45:17.201 --> 01:45:21.560
where they won't,
they won't be viable anymore.
So a viable business model,
right?

1826
01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.370
The accountability of the corporations that are financing these politic

1827
01:45:24.371 --> 01:45:27.760
politicians,
horrible,
short ours.
I wonder,

1828
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:30.670
I wonder if it's going to come a point in time when we start to see an emergence

1829
01:45:30.671 --> 01:45:33.770
of people that are talking in a real sense like collect.

1830
01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:35.800
You're talking about real music.
Well,

1831
01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:39.400
there's gotta be real politicians too that aren't hacks.
You know,

1832
01:45:39.401 --> 01:45:43.090
there's a bunch of shitty pop singing politicians that get pretty far,

1833
01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.140
but we recognize them.
We know they're bullshit artists.
We hear speeches,

1834
01:45:47.141 --> 01:45:51.850
these canned fucking who we Rah Rah Sarah Pailin style speeches,

1835
01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:55.120
and we go,
that's a pop star that says a shitty one at that.

1836
01:45:55.330 --> 01:45:58.290
There's gotta be some real leader out there.
You know what I'm saying?

1837
01:45:58.291 --> 01:46:02.560
That someone who is not following a mold,
but speaking from the heart,

1838
01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:06.370
somebody truly doesn't give a fuck.
They must exist and if they don't,

1839
01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:10.380
it's possible.
The gunner,
fear and loathing on the campaign trail 72 yep.

1840
01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:14.350
That's the book.
That's great fucking book.
Yeah,
I read part of it.

1841
01:46:15.370 --> 01:46:16.990
Shark hunting was a good one.
Yeah.

1842
01:46:16.991 --> 01:46:21.580
His I'm crucified documentary who explains like the creation of all this stuff,

1843
01:46:21.581 --> 01:46:25.870
like how he became an embedded reporter was so fascinating that he was like one

1844
01:46:25.871 --> 01:46:26.681
guy at all.

1845
01:46:26.681 --> 01:46:29.890
These guys that had nothing to lose because he knew he'd never do this again.

1846
01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:35.160
So he just was fucking going bonkers on PT Barnum all he talked football and got

1847
01:46:36.551 --> 01:46:40.570
his way into Nixon's car.
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy?
Sitting with Nixon,

1848
01:46:40.590 --> 01:46:41.620
the ride of the airport,

1849
01:46:41.850 --> 01:46:45.520
Hunter Thompson talking football and they made sure you're only going to talk

1850
01:46:45.521 --> 01:46:49.400
football now.
None.
None of the Vietnam stuff and they just talked football.

1851
01:46:49.930 --> 01:46:53.470
That would be bizarre.
Is Fuck be sitting there with Nixon

1852
01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:58.630
with,
I mean,
just the biggest hidden agenda ever.
You know,

1853
01:46:59.070 --> 01:47:01.590
snowball and the president of the fucking United States.
No,

1854
01:47:01.591 --> 01:47:04.860
you're going to rip his ass hole wide apart in a book.
Yeah.
Right.

1855
01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.920
Complete and total character studies.

1856
01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:12.630
Well he was one of the most incredibly bizarre former presidents.

1857
01:47:13.110 --> 01:47:14.910
He's a very odd guy.
Do you see that book?

1858
01:47:14.911 --> 01:47:18.370
There's written out that they believe he was gay and then is,
uh,

1859
01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:21.270
this guy that he's with her sometime was his boyfriend.

1860
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:24.900
So the same thing about Lincoln though.
Did they?
Yeah,

1861
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:26.760
but didn't like sleep with men to stay warm.

1862
01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.700
His bodyguard sub in his body under service agent,

1863
01:47:29.701 --> 01:47:32.790
they shared a bed and it's now it's speculated that they had a relationship due

1864
01:47:32.791 --> 01:47:35.850
to some,
some journal memoirs they found or small law.

1865
01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:40.310
You can justify us just about anything.
Who Cares?
Who gives a shit?
We could do,

1866
01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.810
we could do well with the gay president,
you know,

1867
01:47:43.210 --> 01:47:48.090
maybe even better could be,
there'd be some empathy there.
Maybe,

1868
01:47:48.210 --> 01:47:49.530
maybe not.
You know,

1869
01:47:49.531 --> 01:47:53.490
Julius Caesar was gay and I'm saying Alexander the Great was gay.

1870
01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:58.190
A lot of fucking gay warriors as people like to sleep on gay people.

1871
01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:01.980
Fuck you up to.
I would always have to fight a gay dude.

1872
01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:07.350
Whoop your ass man.
Meaning Shit.
Nixon's darkest secrets do biography digs up.

1873
01:48:07.351 --> 01:48:10.890
Rumors.
Richard Nixon's gay affair with Mafia banker.

1874
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:15.900
That's the guy.
Yeah,
the guy.
I'm just going to say yes.

1875
01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:20.070
I'm looking at the two of them together for sure.
Who knows?

1876
01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:22.410
Maybe Nixon didn't like to fuck anybody but America.

1877
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:27.300
He probably was one of those things who,
it wasn't a,
it didn't have a gender,

1878
01:48:27.301 --> 01:48:29.130
sexual,
he was nation sexual.

1879
01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:34.200
Just wanting to fuck America like a kindle.
He just didn't have any.
Yeah.

1880
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:38.490
It wasn't nothing.
Just just evil thoughts.
Well,
he was a different,

1881
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:42.900
it's different breed back then.
Different breed of politician and post.

1882
01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:47.930
I mean he's coming along post Kennedy's assassination and bizarre dark time in

1883
01:48:48.751 --> 01:48:51.840
America.
That was,
well,
it's,
that's when they can lock it all down.

1884
01:48:51.841 --> 01:48:55.680
That's when the,
all the scheduled warm lists started popping up.

1885
01:48:56.460 --> 01:49:01.200
Everything kind of,
yeah.
That again,
that's a valley.
You know,
I mean,

1886
01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:02.580
there was a great hill.

1887
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:06.540
The Great Hill was like the 1960s and then the 70s came along and that was the

1888
01:49:06.541 --> 01:49:10.320
big valley and that's where disco came from.
That's what happened.

1889
01:49:10.321 --> 01:49:13.830
Nobody had acid,
nobody had mushrooms,
just cocaine,
man.

1890
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.910
Just dance and fuel and all that bad judgment.
Just like,

1891
01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.200
it's like eighties country.
Bad judgment,
but so good fucking music.
You know?

1892
01:49:22.230 --> 01:49:24.660
If it wasn't for disco,
you wouldn't have kool and the gang.
Right.

1893
01:49:25.210 --> 01:49:29.160
And that's where I came from.
That's all dancing.
Music and bgs mean.
Yeah,
they go,

1894
01:49:29.161 --> 01:49:32.850
dude,
they had some good jams.
Seriously.
Good job they do.
Right.

1895
01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:36.990
People don't want to admit that I,
yeah.
Wasn't a woman.
Come on,

1896
01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:41.100
it's good God damn song.
Jamie's going to disagree.

1897
01:49:41.830 --> 01:49:43.820
That's a shame.
Yeah.

1898
01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:48.520
There even the stones stuck their foot in the disco water.
Yeah,

1899
01:49:48.521 --> 01:49:49.151
for sure.

1900
01:49:49.151 --> 01:49:53.680
There was some funk to a lot of their songs that didn't exist in the earlier

1901
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:57.460
music.
They were creating products at the time was man.
Yeah.

1902
01:49:57.730 --> 01:50:00.220
What's Today's time?
I mean,
what,
when you,

1903
01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:04.480
when you see this new door opening up for you,
you know,

1904
01:50:04.481 --> 01:50:07.330
when you say like all of a sudden your,
your career,
like you said,

1905
01:50:07.331 --> 01:50:09.130
you've called your way to the beginning.
You're obviously,

1906
01:50:09.131 --> 01:50:10.420
there's some shit going on man.

1907
01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.860
I mean I told you my friend Justin told me about your right when he goes,
man,

1908
01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.550
he goes,
this is dude Sturgill Simpson.
And as soon as he said that I go,

1909
01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:21.850
I tell you I've been listening to nothing but him for two fucking weeks and we

1910
01:50:21.851 --> 01:50:24.670
were laughing and joking around.
There's something going on man.

1911
01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:26.710
Well my friend Justin finds out about shit.

1912
01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.100
I always pay attention cause he's got fantastic taste in music.

1913
01:50:30.101 --> 01:50:33.350
But I had already found out like there's,
there's something going on and you've,

1914
01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:37.750
you've hit this sort of frequency where people are checking out your shit.

1915
01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:41.470
<v 2>Six weeks would be over tomorrow,
man.</v>

1916
01:50:41.730 --> 01:50:43.560
<v 3>Yeah,
but it's not going to be,
let's be honest,</v>

1917
01:50:43.710 --> 01:50:48.060
this stitch shit's gonna ride just hanging there fella.
All right,
well I've got,

1918
01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:52.110
I've got a very clear plan.
Do you?
No matter what,
I'm going to adhere to it.

1919
01:50:52.111 --> 01:50:55.680
And so we want to tell us the plan or is it secret shit,

1920
01:50:55.710 --> 01:50:57.750
this is not really a secret.
No,
I just,
I'm gonna make,

1921
01:50:57.751 --> 01:51:01.620
I'm gonna make a total of five records and then that's it and be done.
Why?

1922
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.240
<v 2>I feel like,
well,
I want,
I want them,
there's a,</v>

1923
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:10.990
there's a certain methodology to the entire thing,
but,
uh,

1924
01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:12.920
I don't know.
I think a lot of,

1925
01:51:12.970 --> 01:51:15.880
I don't know what else I would have to say beyond that.
Um,

1926
01:51:15.970 --> 01:51:20.020
and each one successfully kind of incorporate other elements of music that I

1927
01:51:20.021 --> 01:51:24.910
love and am to get more progressively opened up.

1928
01:51:25.570 --> 01:51:30.160
<v 3>And so you've got this mapped up like in a formal way,
roughly.
Yeah.</v>

1929
01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:31.990
Do you have it written down somewhere

1930
01:51:32.690 --> 01:51:36.580
<v 2>in various forms?
Voice memos and notes and things,
but yeah,
I mean,</v>

1931
01:51:36.581 --> 01:51:41.110
the idea that just,
just to lay out and in the sonic execution.
Um,

1932
01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:43.870
but then beyond that,
a lot of,

1933
01:51:43.871 --> 01:51:48.520
a lot of artists keep recording in order to maintain some sense of relevancy or,

1934
01:51:48.521 --> 01:51:51.580
you know,
or just because,
well,
it's been a year's time to make a record.

1935
01:51:51.581 --> 01:51:56.060
I just don't ever want to find myself in that position where I'm,
um,

1936
01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:58.300
I don't know.
I think I would keep,

1937
01:51:58.330 --> 01:52:01.760
I'd rather keep it more concise and focused and just try to do,

1938
01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:04.330
to know that I absolutely did my best every time.

1939
01:52:04.331 --> 01:52:07.000
And then I think after five albums,
I don't know,
I'll probably,

1940
01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:12.480
I already feel somewhat limited in terms of songwriting and how much freedom

1941
01:52:12.821 --> 01:52:14.770
there is to really get out what you want to say.
So I don't know,

1942
01:52:14.771 --> 01:52:18.100
I might try something else at some point.
Like just writing outright,

1943
01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:23.930
<v 3>like writing a book or,
yeah,
so just looking at it as another form of expression.</v>

1944
01:52:23.931 --> 01:52:28.640
But I,
I think it's a weird that you like think that you're going to run dry.

1945
01:52:29.210 --> 01:52:31.340
Like what makes you think you want?
I want,
I'm going to one dry.

1946
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:35.010
<v 2>Oh,
it's not an,
it's not an issue of running dry,
just,
uh,</v>

1947
01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:41.760
certain things that I want to say
or,
you know,

1948
01:52:41.761 --> 01:52:43.910
make a statement with,
use the opportunity to,

1949
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.580
to hopefully make it other than something just about me,
you know,

1950
01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:49.970
try to promote a bigger message,
I guess.
So.

1951
01:52:50.650 --> 01:52:52.580
And at some point you just end up repeating yourself.

1952
01:52:55.150 --> 01:52:57.610
<v 3>That's fascinating.
I hope that's wrong.</v>

1953
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.730
I hope you just keep banging them out and having a good time,

1954
01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:04.990
but you're the only one that knows what's going on in your head.
You know,

1955
01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:07.240
you're the only one who's ever going to know your vision.

1956
01:53:07.630 --> 01:53:08.463
<v 0>Right.</v>

1957
01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:11.860
<v 2>So there's a real job was just</v>

1958
01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:15.980
<v 3>keeping myself out of a situation wherever I have to compromise that.</v>

1959
01:53:16.210 --> 01:53:18.370
That's fascinating though,
that you've done that.

1960
01:53:18.371 --> 01:53:22.570
Then you have this idea of these stages that you're going to put out.

1961
01:53:22.571 --> 01:53:25.090
So you're only going to put out three more albums or five more.
Three more,

1962
01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.530
that's it.
But you've been doing music for how many years now?

1963
01:53:29.890 --> 01:53:30.723
My whole life,

1964
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.980
but I mean professionally for two albums will professionally really just like

1965
01:53:35.981 --> 01:53:39.230
the last two years I've put my first record out in 2013 okay,

1966
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:43.660
so two years for two albums.
So it's an that almost an album a year.

1967
01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:47.950
So you only got three more years ago and then what are you going to do?

1968
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:52.600
I have no idea.
Oh,
come on man.
Just keep making music.

1969
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:56.560
Han and Toucan in the jungle or something.
Do you plan on doing that?

1970
01:53:56.561 --> 01:54:01.561
Like expanding your horizons and some sort of great and unforeseen way by not

1971
01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:03.620
<v 2>doing this?
When I was younger,</v>

1972
01:54:03.621 --> 01:54:07.610
I was out doing a lot of other things that kind of culminated into whoever the

1973
01:54:07.611 --> 01:54:09.420
hell I think I'm trying to be today.
Right?

1974
01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.800
So incorporating those experiences and a lot of the stories and people I've

1975
01:54:12.801 --> 01:54:14.180
known and characters I've met,

1976
01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:18.920
and then maybe even embellishing upon that in a somewhat autobiographical

1977
01:54:18.921 --> 01:54:22.670
sentence,
but still telling these stories in a way that other people say,
yeah,

1978
01:54:22.671 --> 01:54:25.970
I feel that way too.
You know?
You don't want to just say,
hey,

1979
01:54:25.971 --> 01:54:30.080
this is what the world looks like.
It's just this is what it looks like to me.

1980
01:54:30.081 --> 01:54:32.660
And hopefully other people can can resonate with that.

1981
01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:36.200
But it's an interesting,

1982
01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:37.720
<v 0>okay,</v>

1983
01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:41.090
<v 2>there's a line you have to really kind of straddled between commercial because</v>

1984
01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.670
commercial viability and

1985
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:45.440
<v 3>making art.</v>

1986
01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:50.330
Does this a a rigid idea that you have or do you think that it's possible that

1987
01:54:50.331 --> 01:54:53.420
you could get to that three albums from now and then go,
you know what,

1988
01:54:53.421 --> 01:54:55.970
I'm enjoying the fucking shit out of this.
I'm not going to stop.

1989
01:54:55.971 --> 01:54:59.030
I'm just going to figure out a new concept.
I'm going to go,

1990
01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:03.720
I'm going to go Chris Gaines on put on,
no,
this kid,

1991
01:55:04.210 --> 01:55:07.850
is that his name?
Chris Kane.
Kane's to Garth Brooks character.

1992
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:12.290
Maybe that's what he was doing.
Well,
I mean,
outside of that,

1993
01:55:12.291 --> 01:55:15.200
I think I've already,
well,
I say that just because I have

1994
01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:19.280
<v 2>those albums pretty clearly in my head and I deal with those sound like and what</v>

1995
01:55:19.281 --> 01:55:23.830
they'll be about and
does,
you know,

1996
01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:25.030
someday you're dead.

1997
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:27.820
Everybody that ever knew he was dead and it's like you were never here,

1998
01:55:27.821 --> 01:55:32.710
but that little thing,
I don't know what else I would really have to say about,

1999
01:55:34.730 --> 01:55:35.150
<v 0>hmm,</v>

2000
01:55:35.150 --> 01:55:37.850
<v 2>my version of the human experience past a certain point.</v>

2001
01:55:37.851 --> 01:55:42.710
Unless I go turn it off and do another 30 or 40 years of living and then make

2002
01:55:42.711 --> 01:55:46.200
five alums.
Any real artists,
their best work is always in their,

2003
01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:49.260
in their pinnacle peak and then right before they die.
And then you get this,

2004
01:55:49.410 --> 01:55:50.243
this,

2005
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:51.210
<v 0>okay</v>

2006
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:55.070
<v 2>ocean of mediocrity of just kind of fumbling through existence there.</v>

2007
01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:58.200
It says it's,
is it very repeated element.

2008
01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:04.320
<v 1>That's an interesting perspective because you really think that when a guy puts</v>

2009
01:56:04.321 --> 01:56:09.321
out an album or these parallels to authors to a lot of different art form blue,

2010
01:56:09.930 --> 01:56:14.930
you spent your entire life thinking and then you express yourself like the

2011
01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:18.470
culmination of this life and your first few pieces of it

2012
01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:21.330
<v 2>work.
Well,
there's a really interesting thing of somebody,</v>

2013
01:56:21.331 --> 01:56:23.870
I think Jay and my buddy Jason has built,
put up there,
didn't retweet it,

2014
01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:26.550
talks about you.
It takes 20 years to write your first record.

2015
01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:32.090
You get a year to write your second record and a really,

2016
01:56:32.371 --> 01:56:35.430
doesn't matter what you do because music's the devil's work and you're fucked

2017
01:56:35.431 --> 01:56:40.410
anyway.
But,
um,
but yeah,
it's like,
you know,
you squeeze all this.

2018
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:45.850
I had,
I had a good 30 years of,
of fucking up and mistakes and lessons and,

2019
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:47.910
and you know,
a lot of personal,

2020
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:54.120
you own your own development and certain experiences that I had that led me to

2021
01:56:54.121 --> 01:56:57.390
kind of recognize and look at things that cause me to live that way.

2022
01:56:57.960 --> 01:56:59.430
And then to come out the other side of that,

2023
01:56:59.431 --> 01:57:04.431
like really supported and understood by someone that met me at my absolute worst

2024
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:06.840
and then help me to get right here.

2025
01:57:06.841 --> 01:57:11.340
It's just like I have all this clarity now and you know,
I think the only way

2026
01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.480
to ever really grab that fee,
I mean,

2027
01:57:15.481 --> 01:57:18.030
I probably could have made some great records in my twenties because I was so

2028
01:57:18.031 --> 01:57:21.240
fucked up.
You know,
it I'll never know,
but,

2029
01:57:21.241 --> 01:57:25.290
so I'm just trying to like reference those feelings as I remember them the best

2030
01:57:25.291 --> 01:57:27.960
I can.
And People Think,
oh,
I made this record,

2031
01:57:27.961 --> 01:57:31.920
this guy just sitting around fucking smoking DMT and he's on drugs and we didn't

2032
01:57:31.921 --> 01:57:36.330
have it.
There were no drugs involved in making this record.
Uh,
it's been,

2033
01:57:36.331 --> 01:57:38.460
you know,
I really don't even smoke dope that much anymore.

2034
01:57:38.461 --> 01:57:40.980
Especially with the sun.
Certainly not when I'm at home,

2035
01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:43.560
usually on the road and it's only them anymore to cure boredom.

2036
01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:45.233
<v 0>MMM.</v>

2037
01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:47.780
<v 2>So it's just really weird to find myself,</v>

2038
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:51.620
but I still had to tell that part of my life through stories.
When you were,

2039
01:57:51.621 --> 01:57:55.790
when you were in your 20s,
you were partying a lot.
I wouldn't even say partying.

2040
01:57:55.830 --> 01:58:00.350
Um,
it was always more exploratory for me.
I never had an addictive personality,

2041
01:58:00.351 --> 01:58:02.770
but I never,
I don't know.
I,
I've,

2042
01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:07.700
I just read a lot of the wrong books way too young and had this weird romantic

2043
01:58:08.090 --> 01:58:12.590
orientation that everything was encapsulated under the umbrella of experience

2044
01:58:12.591 --> 01:58:13.940
and I wanted to experience everything.

2045
01:58:13.941 --> 01:58:16.900
And some things you just shouldn't experience and they get a,
I mean,

2046
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:18.840
whatever man,
I mean,

2047
01:58:20.190 --> 01:58:24.320
in whatever's in front of me or I could find,
I just never,

2048
01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.960
I always just wanted to know,
you know?

2049
01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:29.063
<v 0>MMM.</v>

2050
01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:32.750
<v 2>Say when I got out of the navy,
living in Seattle,
that was,</v>

2051
01:58:32.751 --> 01:58:34.530
those were some darker days,
you know?

2052
01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:35.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2053
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:38.540
<v 1>Well you were saying that earlier that about Seattle,
not just being the weather,</v>

2054
01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:42.160
what the weather does to people.
At some

2055
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:46.870
<v 4>point,
I just became very disenchanted disillusioned with the military.</v>

2056
01:58:46.871 --> 01:58:49.690
So I got out and it stuck around there for like a year.

2057
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:52.990
So there's that disenchantment of disillusionment and then there's living in

2058
01:58:52.991 --> 01:58:57.340
Seattle where you're dealing with the dreariness at the same time,
mid uh,

2059
01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.260
a really kind of,

2060
01:59:01.210 --> 01:59:01.610
<v 2>you know,</v>

2061
01:59:01.610 --> 01:59:06.380
it was excited as this young relationship and I was going all of these parties

2062
01:59:06.381 --> 01:59:07.840
and meeting people and,

2063
01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:11.300
and expose the things I probably never would have been otherwise and just Kinda,

2064
01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:14.960
you know,
took it at face value for experience and jumped in.

2065
01:59:14.961 --> 01:59:16.250
And then there was a lot of,
you know,

2066
01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:20.330
there's a lot hard narcotics in that area and I realized that those weren't very

2067
01:59:20.331 --> 01:59:23.840
well for me.
And heroin,
heroin,

2068
01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:25.810
methamphetamine,
every,

2069
01:59:25.811 --> 01:59:28.380
anything you're looking for really cut wherever you can grab her forward.

2070
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:30.680
And I couldn't,
I wasn't 21 I couldn't go out and drink.

2071
01:59:31.130 --> 01:59:35.390
So there was all these other methods of escapism that I kind of fell into.

2072
01:59:35.391 --> 01:59:38.720
And I got really bad off for a while.
And actually as a result,

2073
01:59:38.721 --> 01:59:42.680
I ended up missing my grandfather's funeral cause I was,
I knew if I came home,

2074
01:59:42.681 --> 01:59:45.470
like my family would come,
my dad used to be an undercover narcotics officer.

2075
01:59:45.471 --> 01:59:47.930
So he,
you know,
there was some weird,

2076
01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:51.110
a lot of shame there after that,
you know what I mean?

2077
01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:55.970
So eventually ended up back in Kentucky and got away from that.

2078
01:59:55.971 --> 01:59:57.670
And then it was just really just,
I don't know,
man.

2079
01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:02.210
I never really was a very ambitious guy,
just sort of drifted and existed a lot.

2080
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:06.970
And uh,
I dunno if something,

2081
02:00:08.370 --> 02:00:11.380
it was more of exploratory just because I knew there was something else

2082
02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:15.860
<v 4>beyond whatever this is.
I mean,
that's what I was trying to find.</v>

2083
02:00:17.090 --> 02:00:20.000
Now how did you get involved with,
uh,
Rick Strassman?

2084
02:00:20.001 --> 02:00:23.330
How'd you find out about them and how'd you meet him?
Like I said,

2085
02:00:23.331 --> 02:00:25.310
my buddy played when we were talking about

2086
02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:29.390
<v 2>porch last year and then he played your little excerpts and I went home that</v>

2087
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:31.040
night,
just kind of scars scar on the Internet,
on,

2088
02:00:31.050 --> 02:00:33.230
on the subjects and a lot of things related to it.

2089
02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:35.300
And I found dark Strassman's book,

2090
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:38.860
download it and read it it probably three times.
And it just like,

2091
02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:42.550
it just absolutely blew my mind.
Um,

2092
02:00:43.130 --> 02:00:46.610
all the correlating aspects of this commerce of that conversation.

2093
02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:50.360
And I think what might have ultimately led him to it or what he was looking for

2094
02:00:50.361 --> 02:00:52.220
in terms of its relation to,

2095
02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:57.360
<v 4>you should have him on Sunday and how it's to be on.
So is it okay?
Yeah,</v>

2096
02:00:57.361 --> 02:01:01.680
he's going to be on soon to promote the new book.
When,
what date,
Jamie?
12th 12th.

2097
02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:06.510
We had a great conversation in his kitchen about five days ago and he was very

2098
02:01:06.511 --> 02:01:10.740
gracious enough to invite me out and um,
cause I read there in very nice guy.
Oh,

2099
02:01:10.741 --> 02:01:14.510
extremely.
I mean,
he's a cool dude.
He's just so sweet.

2100
02:01:14.511 --> 02:01:18.210
Probably would never think that in cell,
but he's like,
in so many ways it was,

2101
02:01:18.630 --> 02:01:20.430
I'm really glad I went and um,

2102
02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:24.630
and it answered a lot of questions and even questions I didn't even know I had.

2103
02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:28.500
But it's interesting to find out why he approached it and what he got.

2104
02:01:29.370 --> 02:01:32.850
He probably knows more than anybody else on the subject at this point.
But he's,

2105
02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:36.660
he's like,
he's like a musician that has been touring a record for a year.

2106
02:01:36.661 --> 02:01:39.350
He's so tired of talking about this is all 25 ago

2107
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.450
<v 2>he's moved on.
But um,</v>

2108
02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:44.340
<v 1>people are still finding out about it.
So it's,
yeah,
people like,
no,</v>

2109
02:01:44.341 --> 02:01:48.770
fairly obscure,
although his,
for his day to day existence,
it's been like,

2110
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:53.400
it's sort of a overwhelmed as day to day existence for the past 20 plus years.

2111
02:01:53.470 --> 02:01:56.340
But for a lot of folks,
they're just starting to read his work

2112
02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:59.010
<v 2>in the email the other day.
He's like,
so yeah,</v>

2113
02:01:59.011 --> 02:02:02.680
once I've finished the record and had it mixed and mastered,

2114
02:02:02.710 --> 02:02:04.560
I'm sort of like looking back through all the,

2115
02:02:04.770 --> 02:02:06.900
everything that sort of led to this happening.

2116
02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:11.280
And I knew I went into it before we put the album and I really did think,
okay,

2117
02:02:11.281 --> 02:02:14.140
well this is going to be the end of March.
You know,
um,

2118
02:02:14.850 --> 02:02:17.440
people are going to think this guy's nuts for what the hell happened.

2119
02:02:17.470 --> 02:02:21.180
But you know,
but hit the work that the doctors Strassman did.

2120
02:02:21.181 --> 02:02:24.840
And I guess the bravery it took on his part to open that conversation back up in

2121
02:02:24.841 --> 02:02:28.440
a,
in a field,
especially in the,
in the professional medical world,

2122
02:02:28.441 --> 02:02:30.440
was so stigmatized.
Um,

2123
02:02:30.930 --> 02:02:35.220
I can't imagine like the balls that must've taken after spending years of your

2124
02:02:35.221 --> 02:02:38.100
life following this,
this professional school he underwent.

2125
02:02:38.130 --> 02:02:40.620
And so I wrote him an email and I got the,

2126
02:02:40.621 --> 02:02:43.710
I got his contact off cotton when I just wrote him,
basically say,
Hey,
thank you.

2127
02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:47.430
I wrote a shared the record with him through a file.
It was just like,

2128
02:02:47.431 --> 02:02:50.910
I just wanted to thanks for your work and the inspiration that I got from the

2129
02:02:50.911 --> 02:02:54.780
book and along with some other things.
And he wrote back and it sort of,

2130
02:02:55.710 --> 02:02:58.360
you know,
email buddies sort of thing.
And then,
uh,

2131
02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:03.450
I was going out to Phoenix and so I just stopped by,
I have a cup of coffee

2132
02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:06.480
just like anybody else,
you know?

2133
02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:10.810
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah.
He's just a regular guy,
but he's a,
he's a,</v>

2134
02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.880
he's got some really fascinating stories of his explorations in this realm.

2135
02:03:16.090 --> 02:03:17.380
Uh,
not just physically,

2136
02:03:17.381 --> 02:03:22.300
but just dealing with the red tape that was required to do a real FDA study.

2137
02:03:22.330 --> 02:03:24.820
Two years of credit nightmare man.
Yeah.

2138
02:03:24.821 --> 02:03:28.720
To do one of the first psychedelic studies that,
you know,

2139
02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:34.860
have a real scholar involved in testing people on some serious schedule.

2140
02:03:35.201 --> 02:03:37.840
One hallucinogens that the army research labs,

2141
02:03:38.170 --> 02:03:41.890
they were where they were aware of that shit in the 60s.
Absolutely.
They had 'em.

2142
02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:43.450
That's how Mckenna found out about it.

2143
02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:48.480
Terence Mckenna got ahold of DMT through a friend who was a chemist at the army

2144
02:03:49.121 --> 02:03:53.230
research lab and apparently this guy had,
they had like a barrel roll of it.

2145
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:54.263
Oh yeah.

2146
02:03:55.090 --> 02:04:00.090
Which if you know about the effective dose of DMTs about like a pinky nail is a

2147
02:04:00.731 --> 02:04:01.564
lot.

2148
02:04:01.630 --> 02:04:05.980
Like if you had a pinky nail sized piece of DMT or pile,

2149
02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:08.560
you might as level of football stadium of weed you're going,

2150
02:04:08.590 --> 02:04:12.130
you're getting blasted mean you're going to the center of the fucking universe

2151
02:04:12.131 --> 02:04:16.930
with a pinky size.
So imagine these guys had barrels of stuff and um,

2152
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:21.520
Mckenna's store,
I found out about mechanics because of Hicks.
Hicks,

2153
02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:26.080
Rhett Rep mentioned Mckenna on one of his bits.
What Terrence me,
he would talk,

2154
02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:29.800
talk about taping mushrooms under the chair of everybody in the room.

2155
02:04:29.801 --> 02:04:33.490
Like he would like say something and then he would drag them into this.

2156
02:04:33.491 --> 02:04:35.350
I've taped mushrooms under all your chairs.

2157
02:04:35.351 --> 02:04:39.060
Reached down is what Terence Mckenna would call a heroic dose,

2158
02:04:39.570 --> 02:04:44.550
five dried grams,
you know,
and um,
I was like,
who is this mechanic guy?
And so,
uh,

2159
02:04:44.551 --> 02:04:47.020
I started looking into Mckenna and reading,
uh,

2160
02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:50.760
some of the things that I could find about him online and then listening to some

2161
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:54.270
audio recordings.
But he was a,
he was already dead,

2162
02:04:54.271 --> 02:04:59.190
but by the time I had found out about them,
unfortunately,
but his,

2163
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:03.960
you know,
his discovery of DMT and the way he described it,

2164
02:05:03.961 --> 02:05:06.930
and one of his audio recordings was just one of the most amazing things I've

2165
02:05:06.931 --> 02:05:10.920
ever heard because this is a guy who had already done like LSD and morning glory

2166
02:05:10.921 --> 02:05:14.070
seeds and needed to experience psilocybin.
And he thought he had

2167
02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:17.900
<v 4>really traveled.
He thought he kind of knew what was available in Allentown.</v>

2168
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:19.710
Did this,
they did a little traveling.

2169
02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:24.230
I guess put a man and like the Boga and like I said,

2170
02:05:24.231 --> 02:05:27.530
DMT out of mine won't really have any experience to speak of firsthand.

2171
02:05:27.531 --> 02:05:31.040
So I try not to talk about it.
We've got to change that.

2172
02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:34.050
We've got to hook that up.
Hey Man.
Allegedly,
well,
you know,

2173
02:05:34.410 --> 02:05:38.080
doctor [inaudible] said that,
and I,
I'm inclined to agree with,

2174
02:05:38.081 --> 02:05:42.880
although at this point,
like after I should have a fucking phd in this shit.

2175
02:05:42.881 --> 02:05:46.070
I've read about it and I don't even know what the firsthand aspect is,
but uh,

2176
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:49.850
he said at this point in my life now that all these things are formulating in my

2177
02:05:49.851 --> 02:05:51.590
careers,
budding and have a newborn son,

2178
02:05:51.591 --> 02:05:55.400
that there's a high potential who could make for a pretty unsettling experience.

2179
02:05:55.401 --> 02:05:59.570
Cause it's all this stuff that's finally happening in my life.
It's so positive.

2180
02:05:59.571 --> 02:06:01.790
Like the idea of thinking you're dying and having to let go.

2181
02:06:01.791 --> 02:06:06.570
That could be make for an unsettling,
you'll be fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2182
02:06:06.590 --> 02:06:09.620
I believe you.
He'll be fine.
I mean,
I've had some,
some,

2183
02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:15.590
I wouldn't say heroic as a foolish dosage.
You know,

2184
02:06:15.650 --> 02:06:18.830
the first time you ever,
you ever buy mushrooms,
everybody's there to tell you,

2185
02:06:18.831 --> 02:06:20.930
hey will,
this is how much it takes.
You know?

2186
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:24.950
So I think I bought like a quarter and just ate the whole bag mans and that was

2187
02:06:24.951 --> 02:06:29.570
my first,
I mean,
what does that accelerate salary grahams.
Whoa.
How was that?

2188
02:06:29.690 --> 02:06:33.920
That was great time,
man.
I,
you know,
I,
I never,

2189
02:06:33.921 --> 02:06:37.820
I never got the freak outs except,
uh,
well that's good.
Do you have a good soul?

2190
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:42.950
You've towns?
I tried LSD though.
I didn't really enjoy it because it all,

2191
02:06:42.951 --> 02:06:46.640
every time it seemed like on the tail end of the trip there's,
there's this,

2192
02:06:46.730 --> 02:06:51.730
it takes this turn and there's almost this almost a sinister underlying energy

2193
02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:55.950
about it.
I don't know,
that I'd never experienced with silicide.
Um,

2194
02:06:56.450 --> 02:07:00.920
so Simon's very giggly.
Yeah.
And that's a lot of people selling.
It's like,

2195
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:03.960
it's the starting gate for psychedelics.
And I add to that,
I say,

2196
02:07:03.961 --> 02:07:07.460
go eat 12 or 15 grams and telling me that you're,
yeah,

2197
02:07:07.461 --> 02:07:10.970
the starting gate is only if you have a small,
it's overwhelming.

2198
02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:13.490
It's completely overweight.
And it also

2199
02:07:13.570 --> 02:07:17.480
<v 1>very,
very visionary like you see,
I remember,
um,</v>

2200
02:07:17.590 --> 02:07:21.700
just seeing Stan hope and I did mushrooms the day war

2201
02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:26.130
<v 4>started the day the Iraq war started.
We,
we the first one or the first one,
not,</v>

2202
02:07:26.170 --> 02:07:30.880
not uh,
an eighties,
you know,
the,
the one after nine 11.
Gotcha.

2203
02:07:30.970 --> 02:07:31.803
And um,

2204
02:07:32.230 --> 02:07:36.160
we were blitzed as they were on television.

2205
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:40.030
<v 1>The war was starting and I'll never forget standing up was like,
oh my God,</v>

2206
02:07:40.031 --> 02:07:44.420
they've got a kickoff.
They're like,
war coverage begins at five.
He's like,

2207
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:47.620
war has a kickoff.
And we just fell to the ground,

2208
02:07:47.621 --> 02:07:50.800
were howling and laughing and this,
the walls around this,

2209
02:07:50.801 --> 02:07:54.220
we're all made of like these honeycomb geometric patterns.

2210
02:07:54.221 --> 02:07:57.130
Like everything was basically gone.

2211
02:07:57.370 --> 02:07:59.350
I go was trying to still have conversations with him,

2212
02:07:59.351 --> 02:08:02.640
but he was just this sea of patterns,
you know,

2213
02:08:02.650 --> 02:08:06.640
that like blur really represented what his physical form was.

2214
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:10.690
But it was all just like really tiny flower of loves,
you know,

2215
02:08:10.691 --> 02:08:14.350
that little flower of life thing.
It was like,
sir,
I mean,
that was his,

2216
02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:18.160
his entire body was made out of those,
as was all the walls around us.

2217
02:08:18.430 --> 02:08:19.050
I mean it's,

2218
02:08:19.050 --> 02:08:22.500
<v 2>it's almost identical to dimethyltryptamine in the molecular footprint,
right?</v>

2219
02:08:22.501 --> 02:08:24.270
So it's pretty close to take a high dose

2220
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:28.540
<v 1>for Fox for a [inaudible] trip.
Tryptamines how it's been explained.</v>

2221
02:08:28.570 --> 02:08:31.750
I think what happens is I'm extra oxygen does.

2222
02:08:31.751 --> 02:08:34.280
Others were obviously not chemists,
ladies and gentlemen,

2223
02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:38.890
we are not studying the periodic table.
If you read Strassman's accounts of it,

2224
02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:43.840
there's,
there's um,
where they talk about how it's synthesized in the body.

2225
02:08:44.170 --> 02:08:45.220
It's very similar.

2226
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:50.270
It's got a lot of the same elements as real natural human neurotransmitters.

2227
02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:53.410
So it's very easily accepted into the mind.

2228
02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:57.670
The blood brain barrier accepts that a crazy well,
yeah,

2229
02:08:57.671 --> 02:09:01.870
I mean dimethyltryptamine for sure.
We know that.
We know that it's cool.

2230
02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:05.200
We didn't know and it's created in the liver.
It's creating the lungs.

2231
02:09:05.230 --> 02:09:08.290
It's not just creating the pineal gland created another parts of your body.

2232
02:09:08.770 --> 02:09:11.620
They also know that it's in like,
you know,
who knows how many fucking plants,

2233
02:09:11.621 --> 02:09:13.030
like a shit load of plants.

2234
02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:18.230
<v 2>So that's just out there.
It's all over the place.
I,
you know,</v>

2235
02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:21.590
I think it's cool that guys like humor out there.
So important.

2236
02:09:21.591 --> 02:09:26.591
I know I've had some unbelievably profound introspectively healing experiences,

2237
02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:30.920
especially for mushrooms on the high dose get minutes.

2238
02:09:31.610 --> 02:09:34.820
It really forces you to look at a lot of things.

2239
02:09:34.821 --> 02:09:38.900
Maybe you don't want to have your own able to and just kind of pulls apart the

2240
02:09:38.901 --> 02:09:40.130
defense mechanism,
you know,

2241
02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:42.280
<v 1>destroying the ego.</v>

2242
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:47.440
The one thing that allows people to push forward in spite of

2243
02:09:49.810 --> 02:09:53.440
or because of everything that they've learned their whole life,

2244
02:09:53.470 --> 02:09:55.450
this to built up defense mechanisms,

2245
02:09:55.451 --> 02:09:58.240
the buildup up definitions of yourself and then you know,

2246
02:09:58.241 --> 02:10:00.430
you're pushing forward with all this stuff attached to you.

2247
02:10:00.431 --> 02:10:01.960
Like it's like an armor,

2248
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:05.830
but really you find out that that's really the shit that's kind of holding your

2249
02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:06.880
perspective back.

2250
02:10:07.330 --> 02:10:12.330
And if you release all that armor and just look around and release this idea of

2251
02:10:12.821 --> 02:10:15.490
you and then just experience,

2252
02:10:15.850 --> 02:10:20.850
it's a very different world you're living in that that different world is rarely

2253
02:10:21.341 --> 02:10:23.320
tapped into in,
in regular life.

2254
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:27.730
But that different world resets your entire perspective of your existence.

2255
02:10:28.210 --> 02:10:31.600
And if that's not good for you,
what the fuck is everybody doing?
Meditating?

2256
02:10:31.601 --> 02:10:35.470
Why is everybody going to church?
Why is everybody going to workshops and try it?

2257
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:37.850
There were trying to get better.
Everyone's trying to get better.

2258
02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:43.240
I've never seen a single thing in life that has the same effects that

2259
02:10:43.461 --> 02:10:46.690
psychedelic drugs do.
And yet they're illegal.
I mean,
the,

2260
02:10:46.691 --> 02:10:50.450
it's one of the weirdest aspects of our time that these things have these

2261
02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:55.460
unbelievably profound effects,
but they're illegal.
Whereas there's,

2262
02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:56.300
you know,

2263
02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:01.300
x number of sanction drugs that don't have these effects that are deadly

2264
02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:05.930
[inaudible],
asshole bleed and everything else sell that shit all day.
I mean,

2265
02:11:05.931 --> 02:11:09.350
they're trying to crack down now on the prescriptions.
I'm on pain,

2266
02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:10.483
pain medication,

2267
02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:13.190
prescriptions because it has so many people that are addicted to them and

2268
02:11:13.191 --> 02:11:16.520
they've realized,
look,
we've made a nation of junkies.
It's,
I mean,

2269
02:11:16.521 --> 02:11:19.610
I'll tell you the party of the country you're from,
and I mean that,

2270
02:11:19.611 --> 02:11:23.150
that is fucking,
that is prescription drug central,
right?

2271
02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:26.640
<v 2>Hillbilly heroin,
man.
It's unbelievable.
It's right.
I mean,</v>

2272
02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:30.550
the town that I'm originally from,
uh,
it's called Jackson.

2273
02:11:30.551 --> 02:11:33.240
It's like right in the middle of Southeast Kentucky,
like Appalachia.

2274
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:36.640
And I remember as a small child,
it was very much,

2275
02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:41.500
it was a wonderful community.
There were small business,
main street was thriving,

2276
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:46.300
everybody knew everybody.
Um,
and then,

2277
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:49.060
but all the major industry was based on coal,

2278
02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:53.050
which slowly evolved from strip mining or from deep mining,
I'm sorry,

2279
02:11:53.051 --> 02:11:53.861
into strip mining.

2280
02:11:53.861 --> 02:11:57.450
Once they figured out they could get the coal with less bodies.
And uh,

2281
02:11:57.540 --> 02:11:59.620
so that just kind of leveled the topography.

2282
02:12:00.130 --> 02:12:03.220
But then even when that industry sort of dried up and they moved on,

2283
02:12:03.221 --> 02:12:08.050
well the coal pulled out and then Walmart and oxycotton moved in and it,

2284
02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:12.180
I mean within a matter of years it just completely changed the entire face of,

2285
02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:14.500
of the region.
Wow.
And now it's just,
you know,

2286
02:12:14.501 --> 02:12:18.970
like why people say poor you don't even have a fucking poor is man,
you know,

2287
02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:22.930
and,
and there's,
there's,
there's a,
there's a,

2288
02:12:25.930 --> 02:12:27.370
it's sad because there's no,

2289
02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:29.613
<v 6>okay,</v>

2290
02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:30.900
<v 2>there's not even the idea of like the,</v>

2291
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:35.260
the possibility of opportunity coming to that region,
you know,
nothing.

2292
02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:38.660
No industry is going to come in there and like start building car manufacturing

2293
02:12:38.661 --> 02:12:40.700
plants.
Cause then they have to train the shit out of there.

2294
02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:46.070
It's just not logistically very sound for any type of industry other than

2295
02:12:46.610 --> 02:12:50.690
growing dope and making Meth,
you know,
uh,
like it,

2296
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:54.530
unless they really pushed the hemp legislation through and then they can put a

2297
02:12:54.531 --> 02:12:57.280
lot of money and food on people's tables down there.
But I,

2298
02:12:57.330 --> 02:12:58.190
it would be incredible.

2299
02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:02.370
[inaudible] either they're really finally pushing toward it.

2300
02:13:02.371 --> 02:13:03.410
I'll never thought I'd say this,

2301
02:13:03.411 --> 02:13:06.740
but there's a guy named Mitch Mcconnell's for once did something I agree with

2302
02:13:06.741 --> 02:13:07.574
and uh,

2303
02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:11.540
he's really trying to get that Kentucky was at one time the late the nation's

2304
02:13:11.541 --> 02:13:16.280
leading him manufacturing point of the hemp museums and little town called

2305
02:13:16.281 --> 02:13:17.114
Versailles.

2306
02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:21.580
<v 1>Lot of interesting things in Kentucky.
Kentucky reintroduced elk.
Yeah.</v>

2307
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:25.870
And they have a giant successful herds of elk.
I mean,
there are hunting them now.

2308
02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:29.140
They reintroduced them.
They've done it over a period of a few decades.

2309
02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:32.010
They used to have elk,
all crossings.
It was illegal for a long time.

2310
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.540
<v 2>Timed to out in Kentucky.
And then they,</v>

2311
02:13:34.541 --> 02:13:36.970
and I guess they're getting the population to kind of grow back.

2312
02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:38.450
<v 1>Well,
there was none.
There were none.</v>

2313
02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:43.820
The Rocky Mountain elk foundation brought elk in and they,
they,

2314
02:13:43.850 --> 02:13:47.540
they sort of seeded the area and now it's become very successful and now they

2315
02:13:47.541 --> 02:13:51.090
have hunt.
Hmm.
Well there used to be a lot of elk.
Yes.

2316
02:13:51.091 --> 02:13:55.010
There's a care that in the Daniel Boone days,
Davy Crockett days,

2317
02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:57.170
you know the shit out of it.
How did the shit out of him?

2318
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:58.660
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2319
02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:05.330
<v 1>It's,
but it's interesting that Kentucky on the ball with hemp as well,
right.</v>

2320
02:14:06.150 --> 02:14:09.540
<v 2>Bacco industry took a big hit and that really hurts the state economy and then</v>

2321
02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:12.350
<v 1>they have to do something I hope.</v>

2322
02:14:12.570 --> 02:14:17.490
Does hope really that's what becomes the the next day cause farmer and it will

2323
02:14:17.491 --> 02:14:19.850
change the consciousness to you will,
you know,

2324
02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:23.070
<v 2>that's going to go and Du Pont and all the petroleum industries and everybody</v>

2325
02:14:23.071 --> 02:14:26.550
else start throwing more money at making it not happening.
That's why.

2326
02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:28.680
That's why it was elite elite.
You know?

2327
02:14:28.850 --> 02:14:30.230
<v 1>I wonder if they're going to be it.
Yeah.</v>

2328
02:14:30.231 --> 02:14:31.910
That is why it was made illegal in the first place.

2329
02:14:31.911 --> 02:14:35.210
But I wonder if they're going to be able to do that because I feel like they

2330
02:14:35.211 --> 02:14:39.800
even,
they don't have enough resources to stop that kind of truth forever.
Right.

2331
02:14:40.010 --> 02:14:44.060
It's already come out and what you've seen with what's going on in Colorado is

2332
02:14:44.420 --> 02:14:47.660
even Warren Buffet's companies are getting in on it.
Warren Buffet,

2333
02:14:47.690 --> 02:14:52.690
Warren Buffet has a company that leases giant warehouses specifically to weed

2334
02:14:53.121 --> 02:14:55.880
growers.
They have commercials where they're there.

2335
02:14:55.910 --> 02:15:00.910
They're showing how they have these tiered systems where there's a like second

2336
02:15:00.981 --> 02:15:02.000
floor and first floor.

2337
02:15:02.010 --> 02:15:05.570
He could fit in more weed plants than a single for warehouse.

2338
02:15:05.571 --> 02:15:10.571
This is Warren motherfucking buffet and his company is involved and actively

2339
02:15:11.121 --> 02:15:16.121
pursuing marijuana growers to lease their warehouses to grow marijuana because

2340
02:15:17.451 --> 02:15:20.440
it's legal there.
So it becomes a part of,
yeah.

2341
02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:24.770
Is it going to be big corporations that are profiting on it?
Maybe,

2342
02:15:25.010 --> 02:15:29.160
but guess what,
it's not hard to grow.
Right.
You know,
it's not hard.
I mean it's,

2343
02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:32.840
it's,
this is not creating oxycontin's and some sort of fucking laboratory.

2344
02:15:32.841 --> 02:15:35.270
We have to wear a space suit.
You know,
you're,

2345
02:15:35.271 --> 02:15:37.730
you're talking about a plant that grows like that.

2346
02:15:37.970 --> 02:15:39.230
You don't even have to do anything to it.

2347
02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:41.000
Just take it in the ground and come back in a month.

2348
02:15:41.210 --> 02:15:45.450
You get some shit grow in there.
It's super easy.
I mean it is a hard,
you know,

2349
02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:48.890
hard to fuck up really.
It's hard to fuck up.
I mean you could do it better.

2350
02:15:49.010 --> 02:15:51.170
You can make the kind of weed that there's botanists,

2351
02:15:51.171 --> 02:15:54.480
motherfuckers in California and Colorado and Washington state

2352
02:15:55.420 --> 02:15:58.890
<v 2>versus when it does eventually when you know like everything else,</v>

2353
02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:04.200
at some point it is going to go mainstream and then they're going to commodify

2354
02:16:04.201 --> 02:16:05.760
the hell out of it and commercialize it.

2355
02:16:05.761 --> 02:16:08.310
And everywhere you go is going to look like a 14 year old's bedroom.

2356
02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:12.690
And this is the Warren Buffet's company.
Look at this.

2357
02:16:14.110 --> 02:16:16.520
<v 1>Cuba,
what does it's called cross crawl.</v>

2358
02:16:16.521 --> 02:16:19.630
So we could see it so we could see the name of the company,
cubic designs.

2359
02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:24.610
So this is like see how he's get these tiered systems that is entirely for

2360
02:16:24.611 --> 02:16:27.430
fucking grown wheat.
Wow.

2361
02:16:27.730 --> 02:16:31.720
We're going to go tour in Washington state when we play.

2362
02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:34.750
I love it.
I love it.
I think it's amazing.

2363
02:16:35.770 --> 02:16:38.080
I think the corporations are going to get in on it,

2364
02:16:38.081 --> 02:16:39.730
but I don't think they're going to be able to control it.

2365
02:16:39.970 --> 02:16:43.750
I just think something like weed is too easy to grow.
You've definitely,

2366
02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:45.610
they're definitely gonna make a lot of money.

2367
02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:49.090
They could definitely get exclusive deals with certain providers and stores.

2368
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:52.870
Maybe they can make it difficult to have a license to own a store where you

2369
02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:56.710
could sell a shitload of it,
but if it's legal,
people are going to grow it.

2370
02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:57.850
They're going to grow their own,

2371
02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:01.690
they're going to grow neighborhood growing weed operations,

2372
02:17:01.691 --> 02:17:04.000
and if they do allow small businesses to grow it.

2373
02:17:04.001 --> 02:17:09.001
I think the laws at stated today is that you have to grow the marijuana and then

2374
02:17:09.911 --> 02:17:13.920
sell it.
You can't buy like you couldn't grow it and then sell it to me and,

2375
02:17:13.921 --> 02:17:16.960
and I buy it and sell.
Okay.
I couldn't,
I couldn't do that.

2376
02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:19.420
I would have to grow my own and sell my own.

2377
02:17:20.410 --> 02:17:23.890
So you have to be a grower as well as a dealer,
which is fine.

2378
02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:27.580
I mean that's a small group of people could,
you know,

2379
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.900
cultivate a large amount of marijuana and make a shit load of money.

2380
02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:33.993
That's good.

2381
02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:38.580
<v 2>Saw this really not too long episode of vice where they were looking at the</v>

2382
02:17:38.581 --> 02:17:43.020
industry and yeah,
he's,
I guess they're not allowed to use banks in Colorado.

2383
02:17:43.021 --> 02:17:46.960
They're showing these starting to change blackwater guys escorting the payouts

2384
02:17:47.010 --> 02:17:48.810
every day and shit.
I was just like,
holy,
you know,

2385
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:50.280
you're going know you're consider that aspect.

2386
02:17:50.281 --> 02:17:54.150
How much money they probably took out of the cartels hands the first few years.

2387
02:17:54.151 --> 02:17:56.070
I mean,
oh yeah.
Fuck yeah.

2388
02:17:56.880 --> 02:18:00.120
It'll be interesting to see what this all really turns into.

2389
02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:05.520
<v 1>I wonder if people will remain positive,
you know.
Well,
it's too much money,
right?</v>

2390
02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.160
Too much money.
Yeah,
it is.

2391
02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:15.820
It's a curious thing because it's extremely profitable and it's current and

2392
02:18:17.031 --> 02:18:20.150
people are aware of the profitability of it.
People are aware of that.

2393
02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:22.920
Not only that,
they're aware that traffic,
uh,

2394
02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:25.910
incidents of pulling people over for Duis is at an all time low.

2395
02:18:25.940 --> 02:18:29.780
Murder is dropped,
everything's dropped,
violent crime dropped.

2396
02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:33.470
I mean you're showing a huge increase in the amount of money that's being

2397
02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:36.980
generated as far as like for state revenue more than a hundred million dollars

2398
02:18:36.981 --> 02:18:41.981
in taxes this year and then you're showing these drops in crime drops in Duis,

2399
02:18:44.030 --> 02:18:45.680
drops in murder,

2400
02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:49.040
like there's nothing you could say other than what's,

2401
02:18:49.041 --> 02:18:50.330
let's try this somewhere else.

2402
02:18:50.650 --> 02:18:54.860
Any state that struggling and he state that doesn't have some sort of a massive

2403
02:18:54.861 --> 02:18:59.240
resource pool like a natural oil or gas or something like that that's relying on

2404
02:18:59.570 --> 02:19:03.380
if they are in need of an industry,
boy that's a fucking pretty easy one.

2405
02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:06.170
It's right there for you.
Dive on.
Ambitious.

2406
02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:08.210
You can make some money three months from now,

2407
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:10.220
just going to make you some more money all over again.

2408
02:19:10.250 --> 02:19:11.450
I wonder what's going to happen.

2409
02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:14.720
I wonder how many states are going adopt at this this next upcoming election.

2410
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:16.760
I would imagine it's going to be another couple.

2411
02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:19.760
At least I would like to see five or six more.

2412
02:19:19.761 --> 02:19:22.940
Just jump in and start just wildly.
You know,

2413
02:19:22.941 --> 02:19:27.380
it'd be the shit if Texas jumped in.
Utah was talking about it are really,

2414
02:19:27.381 --> 02:19:28.020
you know,

2415
02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:29.150
<v 3>because the Mormons figured out,</v>

2416
02:19:29.151 --> 02:19:32.350
well if we can make a fuck ton of money off of this too is,
I mean if you talk,

2417
02:19:32.351 --> 02:19:35.350
I was talking about it then I can't,
I mean I,

2418
02:19:35.351 --> 02:19:38.690
I think the south will still be the last part of the country where it ever

2419
02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:40.010
materializes.

2420
02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:43.370
Does a lot of fucking stoners in Utah manages a lot of stoners in Utah.

2421
02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:45.620
I was in Utah,
did a Salt Lake City.

2422
02:19:45.621 --> 02:19:50.310
I did 'em Salt Lake City is a really liberal town,
which is weird.
The,

2423
02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:54.380
the,
I think they all kind of moved out to the outskirts.

2424
02:19:54.381 --> 02:19:59.381
So now you've got this little hotbed of a rebellion right there in the middle of

2425
02:19:59.901 --> 02:20:00.720
it all.
You know,

2426
02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:05.480
wiseguys comedy club that places the Shit and it's right in Salt Lake and all my

2427
02:20:05.481 --> 02:20:08.270
friends who worked there,
they all come back.
Go Do,

2428
02:20:08.370 --> 02:20:11.770
if you've been to salt lake is the best kept secret in the United States.
Oh,

2429
02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:15.410
it's fucking banging.
They're nice people too,
man.

2430
02:20:15.650 --> 02:20:17.900
That is a nice town.
And

2431
02:20:19.570 --> 02:20:21.890
there's a lot of weed going around Utah.

2432
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:26.360
If they grow it to they're going to start seeing massive amounts of profit and

2433
02:20:26.361 --> 02:20:28.880
they're going to see a shift in consciousness.
That's the big thing.

2434
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:30.350
The shift in consciousness,

2435
02:20:30.351 --> 02:20:34.040
they might take a few more years to recognize that and the effects of that,

2436
02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:38.120
but people were just going to be nicer.
It's just going to happen.
You can't,

2437
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:42.230
you can't smoke a ton of weed and keep the entire population with the same anger

2438
02:20:42.231 --> 02:20:44.450
level that's going to change.

2439
02:20:44.810 --> 02:20:47.540
It'll change the way people interact with each other and that won't taint,

2440
02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:52.370
that will in turn change the entire culture.
The genie's out of the bottle.

2441
02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:55.420
You don't really see fights breaking out in coffee shops in Amsterdam.
It's not.

2442
02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:59.210
It's very rare.
Very rare.
Yeah,
but oddly enough,

2443
02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:02.960
a lot of Jujitsu guys like to smoke.
Weed really didn't go.
Did you Jitsu?

2444
02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:07.070
Bruce was a big pothead with me.
Yeah.
I used to eat hash.
Yeah.

2445
02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:09.920
I thought that that killed him.
I remember when I was a teenager.

2446
02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:15.140
Is that bullshit?
They said his brain swelled from the hash.
Yeah.

2447
02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:19.020
He apparently had a head injury and yeah,

2448
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:22.850
I think he also had some sort of a reaction to the drugs he was taking for it.

2449
02:21:23.460 --> 02:21:25.340
I should probably Google that.
I think you're writing,

2450
02:21:25.341 --> 02:21:29.090
Linda gave him something for his anyway.
Yeah.
You just get,

2451
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:34.070
he's just get stone as hell workout all day,
right?
Yeah.
He loved Hash apparently.

2452
02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:39.460
Apparently he was really into it,
man.
Um,
but if you've ever eaten hash,

2453
02:21:39.470 --> 02:21:42.020
we kind of get it.
The,

2454
02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:46.940
the eating of marijuana is one of the least respected,

2455
02:21:46.941 --> 02:21:51.830
but most ass kicking of all the psychedelic experiences of prefer edibles.

2456
02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:55.580
Yeah,
man.
The shit that they're throwing around today,

2457
02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:59.240
there's these dude called Los hormonals.
The gummies that the,

2458
02:21:59.630 --> 02:22:03.020
that the name of them.
Gooney brothers.
Yeah.
These motherfuckers,

2459
02:22:03.050 --> 02:22:06.020
my friend Ari had this comedy central taping and these guys showed up,

2460
02:22:06.021 --> 02:22:10.220
but these gummy bears and then they,
I go,
I'm looking at the gummy bear.

2461
02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:13.610
It's a bear.
I go,
how much did I eat?
And the guy goes,
no more than the head.

2462
02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:16.480
I'm like,
well,
why are you making it so big?
Why?

2463
02:22:16.850 --> 02:22:19.910
What do you mean no more than the head?
What happens if I eat more than the head?

2464
02:22:19.911 --> 02:22:24.170
He's like,
don't do it.
Don't why you made it.
You made it.

2465
02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.100
Joey Diaz,
he's the whole fucking

2466
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:29.400
<v 4>thing.
Oh Man.
He's a hero.
He's a hero.
It's a man amongst men.</v>

2467
02:22:29.430 --> 02:22:31.460
We were out here months ago for this,
uh,

2468
02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:36.870
played with Gregg Allman down at the Annenberg Center and some guy came or

2469
02:22:37.711 --> 02:22:39.870
somebody gave us these little man,
they were tiny.

2470
02:22:39.871 --> 02:22:44.230
They were like these little tiny little cupcake with like a piece on the top of

2471
02:22:44.231 --> 02:22:47.630
the no bigger than a nickel.
And um,

2472
02:22:49.350 --> 02:22:51.970
it just absolutely destroyed me.
It wasn't,

2473
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:57.550
I had to somehow find my way back to my hotel room just to lay down and just,

2474
02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:03.750
it was,
there was nothing fun about it.
I was completely nonfunctional.

2475
02:23:04.290 --> 02:23:07.590
Um,
the Saturday night at 8:00 PM and I was just done.

2476
02:23:08.670 --> 02:23:09.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2477
02:23:09.010 --> 02:23:13.540
<v 1>Yeah.
They're saying that Bruce Lee's brain had been swollen.
Uh,</v>

2478
02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:18.190
when they checked his autopsy they said there was no visible external injury.

2479
02:23:18.191 --> 02:23:20.530
However,
according to autopsy reports,
his brain,

2480
02:23:20.531 --> 02:23:25.000
it's swollen considerably from 1400 to 1,575 grams,

2481
02:23:25.001 --> 02:23:28.150
which is a 13% increase,
which is pretty big.

2482
02:23:28.570 --> 02:23:33.570
He was only 32 the only substance found during his autopsy was equally Jessic.

2483
02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:39.580
I don't know what that is.
Um,
I'll Google it.
Okay.
The only subset.

2484
02:23:39.581 --> 02:23:42.700
Okay.
The doctor said in an interview that he's,

2485
02:23:42.730 --> 02:23:46.710
he died from an allergic reaction to the muscle.
Relax,

2486
02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:49.240
an equal just stick whatever it is,

2487
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:52.300
which described as a common ingredient and painkillers.

2488
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:56.770
Doctors announced neat Lee's death officially it was ruled death by

2489
02:23:56.771 --> 02:24:00.130
misadventure.
Huh.
Wow.

2490
02:24:01.210 --> 02:24:02.043
That's interesting.

2491
02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:06.410
But I guarantee he had some head injuries

2492
02:24:08.010 --> 02:24:10.410
cause he was sparring,
you know,
look if you're,

2493
02:24:10.411 --> 02:24:12.060
if you're doing the kind of shit that he was doing,

2494
02:24:12.061 --> 02:24:16.860
he was experimenting a lot with various martial arts and how to most likely he

2495
02:24:16.861 --> 02:24:19.470
got hit.
I mean that's just a part of the game.

2496
02:24:19.890 --> 02:24:23.310
And if he was doing really experimental wild stuff,

2497
02:24:23.311 --> 02:24:27.810
like I know he was involved in a lot of different sort of assimilating a lot of

2498
02:24:27.811 --> 02:24:28.980
different martial arts style.

2499
02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:31.710
<v 4>Oh sure.
Oh sure.
Dan Inosanto got a shot or two and then,</v>

2500
02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:36.580
<v 1>yeah,
all of them,
you know,
there's a,
there's some recent video,</v>

2501
02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:39.910
a recently released video of him sparring at some,
uh,

2502
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:44.990
some karate tournament thing,
and he has his head gear on his full body armor on,

2503
02:24:44.991 --> 02:24:48.560
and he,
him,
this dude had going at it.
So if he was involved and stuff like that,

2504
02:24:48.561 --> 02:24:51.700
and he's most likely he's getting hit in the head.
It's just the way it is.

2505
02:24:51.790 --> 02:24:55.270
He worked with a lot of boxers.
I know he worked with gene,
the bell,

2506
02:24:55.271 --> 02:24:59.020
he did some judo with gene.
And it's just the nature of martial arts,

2507
02:24:59.021 --> 02:25:02.980
especially when you're involved in striking sports.
So who knows?

2508
02:25:03.100 --> 02:25:06.730
Who knows what it was?
It caused his head to bleed,
but it wasn't eating hash.
No.

2509
02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:10.850
That's a shame.
Have you gotten a hold of some of the La,
um,

2510
02:25:10.930 --> 02:25:15.280
edibles while you're here?
Uh,
this trip?
No.
Yes,
you have.

2511
02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:17.050
You just don't know it yet.

2512
02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:22.000
<v 4>11 in the last experience kind of put me off,
dude.
I'm not kidding.</v>

2513
02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:27.980
That fucking cupcake.
And we,
all three of us were done.
I mean they,
they don't,

2514
02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:29.060
they gotta put a dosage

2515
02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:33.260
<v 1>that shit they do now.
They put numbers on.
It was not cool.</v>

2516
02:25:33.630 --> 02:25:36.540
<v 4>I mean it was just not,
not night.
My night was over.</v>

2517
02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:38.000
<v 1>Well they have this,
um,</v>

2518
02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:41.290
they have these things called Chiba Chews and some of them,

2519
02:25:41.291 --> 02:25:45.520
I think we're up to 250 milligrams,
which is just insane and effective dose.

2520
02:25:45.521 --> 02:25:50.260
It's like 20 or 30 and the same like 2020 is not bad for like a mellow,

2521
02:25:50.261 --> 02:25:54.400
easygoing body.
High 30.
You're pushing the boundaries of paranoia.

2522
02:25:54.610 --> 02:25:58.360
40 50.
You're in a cold sweat to 50.

2523
02:25:59.830 --> 02:26:02.680
Joey Dsa,
two of them.
It was a chocolate bar to place they go to,

2524
02:26:02.681 --> 02:26:06.580
it's 40 dos games,
40 doses in one chocolate bar.

2525
02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:11.830
What the fuck man?
How big?
It's small.
Small,
not a big bar,
you know,

2526
02:26:11.831 --> 02:26:13.150
worth like five pieces,
right?

2527
02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:18.520
Like how many inches wide sneaker size,
40 doses.
40 people.

2528
02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:22.960
I mean,
whatever magic you made it by yourself.
Two hits.
And it's like,

2529
02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:26.020
cause you want to see Buddha,
right?
There's only one way to see you.

2530
02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:29.770
Gotta Close Your Eyes,
shut the lights out and watch the dance.

2531
02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:34.720
<v 4>Yeah,
I don't know.
So at some point
while like I realize like,
oh,</v>

2532
02:26:34.770 --> 02:26:38.610
I start almost felt like I was getting anxiety from smoking it and it definitely

2533
02:26:38.611 --> 02:26:42.180
the carcinogen and as a singer now I got to really got to be cautious about,

2534
02:26:42.181 --> 02:26:46.110
so I just Kinda quit smoking.
And then the edibles,
it's,
you're right.

2535
02:26:46.111 --> 02:26:48.780
It's an entirely different feeling.
It's more of an anti anxiety,

2536
02:26:48.781 --> 02:26:52.920
almost like an overall body high.
Whereas if you try to go out on stage,
I can't,

2537
02:26:53.010 --> 02:26:56.490
I can't smoke and perform cause it's like you get so internalized,

2538
02:26:56.910 --> 02:26:59.910
I feel like I can't connect with the crowd at all.
Um,

2539
02:26:59.911 --> 02:27:03.480
so I just learned a long time ago not,
not to do that.
Um,

2540
02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:06.980
but with the edibles man,
it almost just opens you up,

2541
02:27:07.020 --> 02:27:10.520
opens you up and it's much more expressive.
I think it

2542
02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:13.030
<v 1>do you know about the,
uh,
conversion in your body?</v>

2543
02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:17.440
Like 11 hydroxy metabolite people who have heard this on the podcast?

2544
02:27:17.441 --> 02:27:21.010
Please bear with me.
I know you've heard this.
Um,
when you eat marijuana,

2545
02:27:21.011 --> 02:27:24.670
it produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite is it passes through your

2546
02:27:24.671 --> 02:27:28.560
liver and apparently it's four to five times more psychoactive than THC.
Oh,

2547
02:27:28.561 --> 02:27:31.390
absolutely.
That's why it's such an intensely different experience.

2548
02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:34.050
It's because it's a totally different drug.
When you select a trophic,
I mean,

2549
02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:38.860
yeah.
Well in this,
in the sense we depth tank,
sensory deprivation tank,

2550
02:27:38.861 --> 02:27:43.450
it's very psychedelic when you eat it because you,
you just,

2551
02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:47.050
you're in that the experience,
which is so bizarre as it is.
Yeah.

2552
02:27:47.051 --> 02:27:50.560
You don't even really need drugs and those things do.
No,
you don't need anything.

2553
02:27:50.650 --> 02:27:54.130
We'll sell.
You have one.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Want to do it?

2554
02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:59.650
How long are you here for?
I fly out tomorrow at noon.
See what we can do.

2555
02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:02.650
You should try it though.
Some point in your life for sure.

2556
02:28:02.651 --> 02:28:04.210
I don't know if they have one in Nashville,
but they're,

2557
02:28:04.330 --> 02:28:07.350
they're popping up all over the country.
They had one in DC when I was in DC.

2558
02:28:07.470 --> 02:28:10.870
Had people from the show in Philly,
the,
they have one in Philly.

2559
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:14.140
It's like they're showing up all over the country cause we're starting to open

2560
02:28:14.141 --> 02:28:17.080
up these tank tank centers.
And this is another thing that didn't,

2561
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:21.990
didn't exist in most cities.
It was hard to find more.

2562
02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:24.960
<v 2>I mean,
you got to maintain the Ph levels and</v>

2563
02:28:25.010 --> 02:28:29.240
<v 1>mine has a full filtrate.
I have a commercial level one,
Nashville float,</v>

2564
02:28:29.241 --> 02:28:32.230
Nashville,
Bam sign.
You're in.
Who,
who,
who?

2565
02:28:32.260 --> 02:28:35.300
I work on buying a car first and you don't,
it's not expensive.

2566
02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:38.930
I mean you don't have to have one.
You go and rent went out,
just go and uh,

2567
02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:41.600
you know,
seven appointment,
you should definitely try it.

2568
02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:45.440
It's one of the most profound feelings of relaxation.
Yeah.

2569
02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:49.870
<v 2>Complete and total disassociation experience.
You're like,
you can't,</v>

2570
02:28:49.871 --> 02:28:52.240
you lose feeling of your body.
Yeah.

2571
02:28:52.310 --> 02:28:54.770
<v 1>Yeah.
You don't think you're there anymore.</v>

2572
02:28:54.771 --> 02:28:58.340
You think your mind has been released from your body and your mind's flying

2573
02:28:58.341 --> 02:29:02.540
through space.
Completely untethered from the body.
You don't feel the water.

2574
02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:07.260
<v 2>The only time I've ever experienced that.
Uh,
even on,</v>

2575
02:29:07.390 --> 02:29:10.560
I never had any type of complete disassociation experiences,

2576
02:29:10.561 --> 02:29:14.400
even though I come home and really high doses,
just silicide the one time I ever,

2577
02:29:14.401 --> 02:29:19.170
I think what I would class was the most psychedelic experience I've ever had was

2578
02:29:19.171 --> 02:29:22.320
from a drug that's not even normally associated with psychedelic fan,

2579
02:29:22.321 --> 02:29:26.000
which Dextromethorphan DXM it's,

2580
02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:30.210
it's a lot of kids like pound bottles of Robitussin to get,

2581
02:29:30.670 --> 02:29:33.600
I mean by the time you consume enough DXM ruts in the road test and you're,

2582
02:29:33.601 --> 02:29:37.800
you're doing so much horrible shit to your body.
Um,
but I,
I only,

2583
02:29:37.801 --> 02:29:40.830
I only encountered at one time,
we were at this festival in Charlotte,

2584
02:29:40.831 --> 02:29:44.130
North Carolina.
Friend of mine had somehow gotten a hold of,

2585
02:29:44.131 --> 02:29:49.131
this is pure medical grade Dextromethorphan and we had a digital scale of Gel

2586
02:29:49.231 --> 02:29:51.600
cap swinging it out and it's about 400 milligrams.

2587
02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:55.920
It's just the most amazing,

2588
02:29:56.280 --> 02:30:00.690
completely inexplicable experience I've ever had from.

2589
02:30:00.691 --> 02:30:03.820
Wow.
Um,
my,
my buddy Brian,
he's like,
you know,
stores,

2590
02:30:03.890 --> 02:30:07.830
you need to hear music on this.
And he's like,
it's as good as it fucking gets.

2591
02:30:07.831 --> 02:30:09.060
So first off,

2592
02:30:09.061 --> 02:30:11.640
this is the weirdest part of the whole experiences were what were out in this

2593
02:30:11.641 --> 02:30:13.530
Koa campground in North Carolina.

2594
02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:15.940
They're just surrounded by hippies and there's night,
you know,

2595
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:20.470
tanks going off and shit and like that ain't my thing.
But tanks.
Yeah,

2596
02:30:20.471 --> 02:30:24.630
igniters tanks from the company's Hippie Festival.
He meant like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2597
02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:26.400
I understand.
Um,
hip stuff.

2598
02:30:26.910 --> 02:30:30.450
We had to make it back down to the parking lot where his truck was parked

2599
02:30:30.630 --> 02:30:33.690
through the,
through this trail.
You couldn't see shit man.

2600
02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:37.590
It was like the most complete flood or vision ever.
And I'm just stumbling,

2601
02:30:37.591 --> 02:30:42.540
not walking into trees.
And Brian was like,
oh,
maybe just close your eyes.
Like,

2602
02:30:42.541 --> 02:30:44.460
what are you talking about?
We talk about close mine.
He's like,

2603
02:30:44.461 --> 02:30:47.170
you just close your eyes.
Trust me in that,
close my eyes.
And I,
I,

2604
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:50.490
she swears I'm sitting here.
It was all of a sudden,

2605
02:30:50.491 --> 02:30:54.440
like I could see the trail plain as day directly in front of me and almost like

2606
02:30:54.450 --> 02:30:55.770
the entire canopy had this,

2607
02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:59.970
this moon lamp just turned on and flooded it with light and everything is so

2608
02:30:59.971 --> 02:31:03.980
clear.
And we walked all the way back down in his truck with your eyes closed.

2609
02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:08.700
I swear to you,
man,
I'll never,
to this day I'm not even,

2610
02:31:09.270 --> 02:31:13.830
you know,
it was,
it was an insane and we got,
you only do it once.
One time.

2611
02:31:14.310 --> 02:31:17.160
I've never been met anybody that's even heard of it or knew where to find it

2612
02:31:17.161 --> 02:31:20.250
since.
But uh,
Brian used get tons of this shit and he does,

2613
02:31:20.251 --> 02:31:22.620
he just laid with his headphones on for like eight hours in his living room and

2614
02:31:22.621 --> 02:31:27.160
listen to music.
And you're completely,
he's illegal.
Oh,
well I mean to,

2615
02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:29.510
to possess it and that kind of quantity.
Yeah.

2616
02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:33.540
What you have to have permits and things like that to,
but uh,

2617
02:31:33.541 --> 02:31:38.380
we got to the truck and he had a Toyota Tacoma with the bucket seats and a

2618
02:31:38.381 --> 02:31:39.930
really nice stereo,
like it's booming,

2619
02:31:39.931 --> 02:31:42.060
asked area and he's putting like band of Gypsies or something.

2620
02:31:42.390 --> 02:31:45.570
And I laid that bucket seat back,
man and close my eyes.

2621
02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:48.540
And within a matter of seconds,
half a minute or a minute,

2622
02:31:48.570 --> 02:31:51.320
I wasn't in that truck anymore.
I wasn't in this bucket seat.

2623
02:31:51.321 --> 02:31:55.110
I felt like you never floated down river on an inner tube is the same feeling

2624
02:31:55.111 --> 02:31:55.980
except seven or two.

2625
02:31:56.010 --> 02:31:59.520
I was laying in this little like my own little personal cloud,
just kind of like,

2626
02:31:59.610 --> 02:32:01.740
and is it just as I'm sitting here talking to you,

2627
02:32:01.741 --> 02:32:06.741
I was in this cloud cruising through this golden Sianna Purple Sunrise Sky,

2628
02:32:07.171 --> 02:32:09.090
just like the most booming,

2629
02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:15.060
blissful euphoria I've ever felt listening to Jimi Hendrix and this lasted like

2630
02:32:15.061 --> 02:32:15.810
six hours,
man.

2631
02:32:15.810 --> 02:32:20.100
You're just like cruising through the sky.

2632
02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:24.120
Wow.
I've never had that for many of,
you know,

2633
02:32:24.121 --> 02:32:28.390
what people commonly associate as hallucinogens or,
um,

2634
02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:30.690
<v 3>that's tough.
Sounds intense.
Yeah.</v>

2635
02:32:30.691 --> 02:32:33.280
I talked to doctors trashman buddy said there's not a loan.

2636
02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:37.980
There's never really been any studies.
It's not about known your Guinea pigs.

2637
02:32:37.981 --> 02:32:39.540
Turtle Simpson,
Human Guinea.
Yeah.

2638
02:32:39.710 --> 02:32:43.910
<v 2>No.
Well,
this was all years and years ago,
man.
I don't know that I'm,</v>

2639
02:32:44.570 --> 02:32:47.330
you should do a trip report on Erowid.
Oh really?

2640
02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:51.960
<v 3>Yeah.
Oh,
the forum.
I know you're talking about.
Yeah.
Well that's one of the most,</v>

2641
02:32:51.961 --> 02:32:55.480
uh,
important resources Arrow it is for people understanding what,

2642
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:58.780
what they're getting into because there's a lot of really educated,
very,

2643
02:32:59.260 --> 02:33:04.260
very like well thought out reviews of the various compounds and different,

2644
02:33:04.990 --> 02:33:07.120
different effects.
They have trip reports.

2645
02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:10.240
<v 2>I didn't know anything about it until then and I've never seen it since.</v>

2646
02:33:10.241 --> 02:33:15.040
But I do remember the guy saying that the difference in three or four or 200

2647
02:33:15.041 --> 02:33:17.610
milligrams is a thousand times stronger trip.

2648
02:33:18.990 --> 02:33:20.560
<v 3>Nobody's ever really documented.</v>

2649
02:33:23.630 --> 02:33:27.750
I thousand times stronger trip,
four or 500 milligrams,
you know,
you can.

2650
02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:32.580
Wow.
Is there any negative downsides?
Um,

2651
02:33:32.740 --> 02:33:37.740
<v 2>the only thing I remember is I might've had like a slight allergic reaction</v>

2652
02:33:37.981 --> 02:33:41.710
because I remember feeling like I had sun poisoning and it was like really

2653
02:33:41.890 --> 02:33:44.230
scratching my back.
Kind of tripping out on this for a second.

2654
02:33:44.231 --> 02:33:46.870
This is on early onset and the guys were like,
what are you doing?
I was like,
man,

2655
02:33:46.871 --> 02:33:50.650
I think I got too much sun today and I'm actually itching.
And,
and uh,

2656
02:33:51.340 --> 02:33:54.880
Chad was like,
no,
it's not.
You're fine.
And as soon as he said that,

2657
02:33:54.881 --> 02:33:58.960
like the whole sensation went away.
But,
uh,
I didn't have,
I mean it wasn't,

2658
02:33:58.961 --> 02:34:01.390
there was nothing negative about the experience.

2659
02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:04.860
<v 3>Then when it's over,
the come down just like just goes away,</v>

2660
02:34:04.890 --> 02:34:08.790
back to baseline and just kind of wears off.
Wow.
That's so weird.

2661
02:34:09.370 --> 02:34:12.210
You will always wonder like if there was,

2662
02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:17.010
if it was easy for people to do research on psychedelics and they,

2663
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:18.440
it was respected

2664
02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:22.070
<v 1>and it was something that people pursued as opposed to being like,
you know,</v>

2665
02:34:22.071 --> 02:34:25.970
if you do research on,
on certain things,
you could be thought of as a pariah.

2666
02:34:25.971 --> 02:34:29.600
You could,
it could fuck with you.
You know,
you could,
you could be ostracized.

2667
02:34:29.601 --> 02:34:31.400
People could say,
oh,
this guy just wants to get high.

2668
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:33.620
He's just trying to get people high.
He's like,

2669
02:34:33.621 --> 02:34:36.090
he's just doing some experimental drugs is not doing

2670
02:34:36.250 --> 02:34:39.800
<v 2>serious research where they think there's some hidden agenda or Zillow ruined
it,</v>

2671
02:34:39.810 --> 02:34:43.450
right?
Yeah,
it could be.
There's a massive hospital in Lexington,

2672
02:34:43.451 --> 02:34:47.650
Kentucky that is called,
is called the narcotics farm.
And it was a,
it was a,
uh,

2673
02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:51.290
criminal
institution for,

2674
02:34:51.350 --> 02:34:53.250
for drug know.

2675
02:34:53.890 --> 02:34:57.610
William Burroughs was there for a while and they did a lot of like highly

2676
02:34:57.611 --> 02:35:00.220
barbaric experimental addiction treatments.

2677
02:35:00.221 --> 02:35:05.221
They're back in like the forties and 50s and just unspeakable things like

2678
02:35:05.231 --> 02:35:10.050
dropping people's genitals and ice water or something like that.
Right.

2679
02:35:11.490 --> 02:35:13.470
Like kind of ridiculous approaches to dealing with,

2680
02:35:13.471 --> 02:35:15.550
with heroin and Methadone addiction.

2681
02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:19.000
And I know they did some psychedelic studies,
I'm sure back there.

2682
02:35:19.001 --> 02:35:20.830
But you know,
it's,

2683
02:35:20.831 --> 02:35:23.170
the hospital's still stands there and it's just the most ominous,

2684
02:35:23.171 --> 02:35:24.070
creepy building.

2685
02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:27.070
<v 1>Methadone is a weird one.
This and that.
It's horrible shit.</v>

2686
02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:29.840
They use it to get people off heroin,

2687
02:35:29.841 --> 02:35:32.910
but yet it's worse for you than heroin withdrawals are way worse.
Yeah.

2688
02:35:33.100 --> 02:35:37.940
How it just makes them well too,
right.
It doesn't get them high.
Is that the deal?

2689
02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:42.410
<v 2>It,
it,
whatever the genetical attachment that you're,
you know,
you're wanting,</v>

2690
02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:47.420
heroin is like one of those drugs that actually modifies your bodies,
you know,

2691
02:35:47.490 --> 02:35:50.520
biochemistry in a way that you become physically dependent on it.

2692
02:35:50.521 --> 02:35:53.370
So they're kind of facilitating that,

2693
02:35:54.090 --> 02:35:57.330
whatever it is that causes the sickness.
When you withdraw,

2694
02:35:58.050 --> 02:36:00.000
but at the shit it's like it's way worse for you

2695
02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:05.150
<v 1>and it doesn't get you high.
Nobody talks about I really good methadone music,</v>

2696
02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:06.750
you know,
like,
yeah,
right.

2697
02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:09.620
People did heroin and made some fucking incredible music.
Nobody did.

2698
02:36:09.621 --> 02:36:12.260
Methadone made some awesome shit.

2699
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:16.250
There was these guys that used to come to the pool holidays to hang out in white

2700
02:36:16.251 --> 02:36:19.670
plains and uh,
they were called the Methadone Ian's,

2701
02:36:19.671 --> 02:36:20.540
that's what we would call them.

2702
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:24.320
They would do dudes that came over from the Methadone clinic and they'd come

2703
02:36:24.321 --> 02:36:28.160
over and play pool and they were just Zombie Fides just dead in the eyes.

2704
02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:32.490
Yeah.
What's his deal?
I just one of those Methadone Ian's,

2705
02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.400
it's four guys came over from the Methadone clinic.

2706
02:36:36.290 --> 02:36:38.580
What do you guys do right here when you got to take a massively,

2707
02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:43.050
intensely painful pis?
You got to do it right now.
Go run.
Take a piss.
All right.

2708
02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:44.150
We're almost done.
Anyway,
you,

2709
02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:46.350
you run and I'll tell everybody how to get to your website.

2710
02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:51.150
Sturgill Simpson as he takes his little girl's bladder to the bathroom.

2711
02:36:51.570 --> 02:36:54.570
Not everyone can deal with a bulletproof coffee.
And

2712
02:36:55.450 --> 02:36:57.550
<v 0>all that stuff.
Water</v>

2713
02:36:59.020 --> 02:37:03.070
<v 1>just sitting there.
It just ways weighs on.
You have it,</v>

2714
02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:07.350
you'll have that sometimes.
Yeah,
occasionally.
Yeah.

2715
02:37:07.970 --> 02:37:12.160
But I get it occasionally too,
man.
It definitely does happen.
Uh,

2716
02:37:12.210 --> 02:37:16.190
Sturgis website.
His Twitter is Sturgill Simpson.
Um,

2717
02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:21.470
<v 3>and if you go to it,
it's a actually that image that,
um,
the,</v>

2718
02:37:21.471 --> 02:37:25.250
the,
uh,
the image of the earth sands,
the turtles underneath it,

2719
02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:29.120
similar image,
but sturgeon is,
uh,

2720
02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.450
the cds that I have a mom.
Like I said,
I'm a big fucking fan.
He's got,
uh,

2721
02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:39.860
several songs and I'm really into that.
I'm listening to right now on iTunes.
Um,

2722
02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:44.270
but the cds,
let me find them on my playlist here.

2723
02:37:46.830 --> 02:37:49.230
Met a modern sounds and country.

2724
02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:55.290
That's a,
that's the name of one.
That's the latest one.

2725
02:37:55.291 --> 02:37:56.970
That's the one that's the most psychedelic.

2726
02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:01.440
And then the other one is a high top mountain,
which is fucking fantastic.

2727
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:05.040
I really,
really dig it.
Um,
they're very different,

2728
02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:10.520
but both of them are equally equally a unique and kick ass.

2729
02:38:11.700 --> 02:38:14.100
I love all of it.
I'm sure he's got a website too.

2730
02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:19.380
Must be like Sturgill simpson.com.
Right.
Check this out.
His website,

2731
02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:23.390
sort of Colorado health officials when a band,

2732
02:38:23.391 --> 02:38:26.920
almost all recreational edibles pussies.

2733
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:32.930
Really?
Wow.
Sturgill simpson.com is his website.

2734
02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:37.220
That's ridiculous.
We just reading something on Huffington Post that they,

2735
02:38:37.221 --> 02:38:41.510
health officials in Colorado want to ban all edibles because kids are getting

2736
02:38:41.511 --> 02:38:45.170
into him and shit.
Stare just nerf in the world.
That's all they're doing.

2737
02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:46.250
They're just nerf in the world.

2738
02:38:47.010 --> 02:38:50.710
Really sensationalist piece about this on some national media news program.

2739
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:54.200
Either night because children were Halloween in a hold of them and having

2740
02:38:54.201 --> 02:38:57.860
overdoses.
There's no,
it's really scary.

2741
02:38:58.230 --> 02:39:00.530
You're gonna like outlook Clorox too.

2742
02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:03.320
Cause your kids going under the fucking sink and you're doing a bad parent.

2743
02:39:03.370 --> 02:39:05.410
I mean Cox is way worse first of all.
Right?

2744
02:39:05.411 --> 02:39:07.730
Cause the kids that are having the overdose on Pod,
they're not dying.

2745
02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:11.600
Well they might freak out,
but they're not going to die.
It does.
It's not toxic,

2746
02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:14.090
right.
It just doesn't,
you don't anything they can fuck your kids up.

2747
02:39:14.091 --> 02:39:15.970
Just don't let them get to it,
you know?
Yeah.

2748
02:39:15.980 --> 02:39:18.460
Don't let your kid play with hammers.
You know,

2749
02:39:18.570 --> 02:39:23.450
shouldn't fucking go to home depot and shut it down stupid and take away spoons.

2750
02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:24.890
The idea that adults,

2751
02:39:25.010 --> 02:39:28.580
a grown adult should not be able to buy an edible that has a clearly marked

2752
02:39:28.581 --> 02:39:31.070
label.
All these experiences that we're talking about,

2753
02:39:31.071 --> 02:39:33.470
like you ate this little thing was the size of a nickel.
You got fucked up.

2754
02:39:34.100 --> 02:39:37.520
You learn,
you learn,
you're here,
everyone's fine.

2755
02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:42.590
It's like the lowest worry version of overdose ever.

2756
02:39:42.620 --> 02:39:46.130
Cause the overdoses just,
well,
I say overdose.
It's still,

2757
02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:48.770
I mean all it means is I'm going to go lay in bed and having a really good time

2758
02:39:48.771 --> 02:39:50.560
instead of walking around and having a really good time,

2759
02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:53.780
but there's no ill effects that will affect your body doesn't break.

2760
02:39:53.810 --> 02:39:57.410
Your mind doesn't melt.
You're going to be fine.
At the end of the day,

2761
02:39:57.500 --> 02:40:00.500
you might just get a really great night's sleep.
Yeah,

2762
02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:02.900
I'm not really recommended and you give it to your kids,

2763
02:40:02.901 --> 02:40:04.970
but he did get ahold of it.
Just stay with them.

2764
02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:09.390
Just keep stay in the room with them.
Everybody's going to be okay.

2765
02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:13.990
Two deaths,
two to them,
but I don't ever want somebody one and fell out of

2766
02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:17.220
<v 1>a off of a hotel.
And the other guy,
it says,</v>

2767
02:40:17.610 --> 02:40:21.000
Richard Kirk may have been on pain meds in a palatable when he killed his wife.

2768
02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:23.790
Pain meds are guarantee.
I would go with that.

2769
02:40:23.791 --> 02:40:26.580
The pot add a bill would have probably cause it was pot out of bowl was probably

2770
02:40:26.581 --> 02:40:30.910
wrestling with the pain and beds as he was grabbing hold of the trigger.
Fuck,

2771
02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:34.290
fuck all that man.
You can't blame a guy falling off a roof on pot.

2772
02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:35.640
What are you doing on the roof?

2773
02:40:35.641 --> 02:40:39.360
Stupid Pot didn't tell you to get up on that roof.
Why'd you fall off that roof?

2774
02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:42.570
You know he probably would have fell off that roof no matter what he was on.

2775
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:46.370
You can't fuck around on rooves dummy.
Especially when you're blitzed.

2776
02:40:46.530 --> 02:40:48.930
That's a silly idea.
Who knows what he was doing.

2777
02:40:48.931 --> 02:40:53.070
But to blame that on pot is fucking stupid.
Instead of blaming that on pot.

2778
02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:57.210
How about you think about how many fucking people don't jump off the roof when

2779
02:40:57.211 --> 02:41:01.120
they're on pot?
It's like a lot more.
It also says that,
uh,

2780
02:41:01.350 --> 02:41:05.550
the cookie hate didn't give him the recommended immediate effect that he wanted.

2781
02:41:05.551 --> 02:41:10.530
So then he ate six times the recommended dose.
Silly Bitch.
You can,

2782
02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:14.540
you can fucking corner,
you know,
rest in peace.
Silly Bitch.

2783
02:41:15.430 --> 02:41:18.780
You're like,
people make mistakes,
man.
You can't blame the substance.

2784
02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:20.550
I mean it's like what are we going to do?

2785
02:41:20.551 --> 02:41:24.030
We're going to outlaw cars because people get in accidents are we gonna outlawed

2786
02:41:24.031 --> 02:41:25.710
knives cause people stab people.

2787
02:41:25.770 --> 02:41:30.770
The idea that adults can't make their own decisions has been the folly of man

2788
02:41:31.921 --> 02:41:33.510
since civilization was created.

2789
02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:36.900
We have to figure out what decisions are the right ones,

2790
02:41:36.901 --> 02:41:40.020
educate each other and then move forward from there.

2791
02:41:40.021 --> 02:41:45.021
But to tell someone that they can handle it because Jim over here jumped off the

2792
02:41:45.151 --> 02:41:48.570
fucking roof.
Everybody,
while those positive experiences that he had eaten pot,

2793
02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:53.070
we're going to flush those down the toilet because we lost Jim.
Okay.

2794
02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:56.100
Jim is a wild man.
Jim was fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2795
02:41:56.101 --> 02:41:58.370
Jim used to walk a tight rope and he,
you know,

2796
02:41:58.380 --> 02:42:01.650
he used to do a fucking back flips off the garage,
but whatever.

2797
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:04.980
We loved him and he's gone.
So no more pot for everybody.
Be like,

2798
02:42:04.981 --> 02:42:06.180
what are you talking about?

2799
02:42:06.660 --> 02:42:09.870
I mean we get an outlaw guns every time someone commit suicide are we?

2800
02:42:09.900 --> 02:42:13.560
What are we going to do?
What kind of a goofy world and we're going to create,

2801
02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:15.690
because if you just make everything illegal,

2802
02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:19.020
everything that kills you is going to be illegal.
You're going to have nothing.

2803
02:42:19.170 --> 02:42:20.880
You're going to have no electricity.

2804
02:42:20.970 --> 02:42:23.310
There'll be no water because people could fucking drown.

2805
02:42:23.730 --> 02:42:26.910
They'll be no food because sometimes food goes bad and people die of food

2806
02:42:26.911 --> 02:42:30.390
poisoning.
There'll be everything going to take away everything you,

2807
02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:33.120
you literally,
if you want to take away things that kill people,

2808
02:42:33.121 --> 02:42:35.640
you literally have to remove life itself.

2809
02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:40.490
No more dogs because dogs bite people no more spiders cause we got to skin
pores.

2810
02:42:40.491 --> 02:42:42.960
You were going to have to poison all the spiders because they can poison people,

2811
02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:45.720
but we can't have spider poison because that kills babies if they get out of it

2812
02:42:45.721 --> 02:42:50.010
under the sink,
so we'll have no life.
There will be no life.

2813
02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:51.990
It's just preposterous.

2814
02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:55.830
And the idea that how Colorado is going to step in and legislate that,

2815
02:42:55.940 --> 02:42:58.270
well we need to do is get all of those fucking people,
hi.

2816
02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:02.520
Where is that coming from?
Or what some Tommy's,
yeah.
What's,
what's the issue?

2817
02:43:02.521 --> 02:43:06.450
Like they're worried about people freaking out on edibles and that's all it is.

2818
02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:09.900
Is so strong.
Yeah,
but so what?
Don't need as much lower the dose.

2819
02:43:10.230 --> 02:43:12.150
You know what's really strong alcohol?
It's everywhere.

2820
02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:14.950
<v 3>Go to a fucking store,
drink a bottle of Jack Daniels.
You're dead.</v>

2821
02:43:15.340 --> 02:43:18.670
You're dead in three hours or whatever it takes.
You know,

2822
02:43:18.671 --> 02:43:21.550
maybe you've got a better tolerance than me,
but if you eat a fucking,
you know,

2823
02:43:21.551 --> 02:43:25.960
you drink a gallon jug of Jack Daniels,
most likely you're a goner.

2824
02:43:26.170 --> 02:43:29.560
It's uh,
it's really,
yeah,
that's,
there's some truth there.

2825
02:43:29.980 --> 02:43:34.270
I used to really drink at all anymore was just trying to think.

2826
02:43:34.271 --> 02:43:37.810
Most of that is probably related to my job,
cause he spend,

2827
02:43:37.870 --> 02:43:41.350
you spend night after night looking at rooms full of people that are very drunk

2828
02:43:41.970 --> 02:43:46.060
and it,
it,
it gives you a certain,
I don't know.

2829
02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:49.600
Plus looking back on my life,
all the dumbest shit I ever did.

2830
02:43:49.690 --> 02:43:52.720
Alcohol was pretty much directly related.
You know,
all of it.

2831
02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:56.620
The worst decisions I ever made.
It wasn't because I was on hard drugs.

2832
02:43:56.620 --> 02:43:59.710
I was like,
you know,
go figure.
No,
it's,

2833
02:43:59.711 --> 02:44:02.440
it's the number one sanction drug.
I mean,

2834
02:44:02.441 --> 02:44:05.530
it's what everybody does to have a good time after work.
Let's Kava drink.

2835
02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:09.220
I'm not opposed to having a drink.
I like having a drink.
I really do.

2836
02:44:09.250 --> 02:44:12.250
I like drinking.
I don't drink too much.
I don't get fucked up,

2837
02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:15.580
but I've been fucked up and I've had a great time,
you know?
Yeah.

2838
02:44:15.581 --> 02:44:19.810
It's bad for you.
But so it was a lot.
There's really nothing worse than a drunk.

2839
02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:24.270
Very few things.
Very obnoxious.
Trusting them.
Noxious.
Strong.
Yeah.

2840
02:44:24.310 --> 02:44:27.760
Especially a violent,
obnoxious trunk.
It's the worst.

2841
02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:30.520
The worst is you ever been on a date with a girl and you're sober and she's

2842
02:44:30.521 --> 02:44:34.060
drunk.
That's disastrous.
Really.
Drunk girls are the worst.

2843
02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:36.940
Really drunk guys.
The worst.
They're the worst.

2844
02:44:36.941 --> 02:44:38.470
I think really drunk guys have the worst cause.

2845
02:44:38.470 --> 02:44:41.050
They're more violent than the really drunk girls.
You know?
Those are the,

2846
02:44:41.051 --> 02:44:42.600
is it said at the shows are the,

2847
02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:44.610
they're the only ones that ever want to talk to me.
Like the,

2848
02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:47.350
the other guys in the van are young and they get hit on other girls and girls

2849
02:44:47.351 --> 02:44:50.320
never want to talk to sturgeon.
Me,
that's always like the really big,

2850
02:44:51.070 --> 02:44:55.240
like large drunk guy and they all like,

2851
02:44:55.241 --> 02:45:00.241
give me the bear hug and I get the Wayland and then there's just like hugging me

2852
02:45:00.581 --> 02:45:01.151
and I'm,
I'm,

2853
02:45:01.151 --> 02:45:04.150
I'm limitating off the ground and they're giving me like this thing like fucking

2854
02:45:04.151 --> 02:45:08.710
man shit.
That one song,
man.
Damn Dude.
Uh,

2855
02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:11.680
and those are the only people that I want to talk to me.

2856
02:45:11.681 --> 02:45:15.820
You're like the really huge,
like Wilbur beast drunk really redneck guys.

2857
02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:20.710
That's my curse.
Yay.
They're fun to talk to them.
They're fucking great.

2858
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:24.820
Have a good time.
Talking to a lot of those dudes.
I do,
I'd say,

2859
02:45:24.821 --> 02:45:29.500
I think this is a certain romance and fun involved in alcohol consumption that I

2860
02:45:29.501 --> 02:45:33.640
embrace.
I,
it's not the end all be all,
but it's not bad.

2861
02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:38.410
It's some fun to alcohol,
you know?
It's an irresponsible,
oftentimes reckless,

2862
02:45:38.411 --> 02:45:41.530
stupid,
impulsive feeling and state of mind.

2863
02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:45.990
But with the right people,
that shit works.
You know?
It's just,

2864
02:45:46.330 --> 02:45:49.270
it's bad for your health as the new,
a lot of people when they shouldn't,

2865
02:45:49.300 --> 02:45:53.080
that shouldn't smoke pot.
Fuck yeah.
Thing hits people differently.
Yeah.

2866
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:54.940
I know a lot of people that shouldn't drink though.

2867
02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:57.940
A lot more people that shouldn't drink and shouldn't do anything else.

2868
02:45:58.330 --> 02:46:01.290
I know friends that,
I have friends that smoked pot,
I can't drink it.

2869
02:46:01.310 --> 02:46:04.760
They're alcoholics,
but they'll still smoke pot so they don't drink well,

2870
02:46:05.100 --> 02:46:09.100
well it's not even so,
but they can,
they can smoke pot and they're fine,

2871
02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:10.100
but if they drink,

2872
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:14.480
<v 4>they're off the rails.
The G,
yeah,
that weird lot Irishman.</v>

2873
02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:18.740
A lot of that,
that weird gene gene.
It's just,
hey,
just hits them like a truck.

2874
02:46:18.980 --> 02:46:22.560
They can't do it.
They can't regulate.
It takes over.
Whoa.

2875
02:46:23.860 --> 02:46:24.351
I mean we were,

2876
02:46:24.351 --> 02:46:28.100
we were in Ireland a couple of weeks ago and there you talking about some

2877
02:46:28.101 --> 02:46:31.040
fucking savages.
Great people though.
Me.
Oh yeah.
Just

2878
02:46:32.750 --> 02:46:35.350
if all the places in Great Britain or Europe that we've played,
it's the,

2879
02:46:35.351 --> 02:46:38.690
it feels the most like the states cause they're just like,
you know,

2880
02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:43.840
and a lot of the British and the Scottish audiences are so intensely attentive

2881
02:46:44.061 --> 02:46:48.150
and appreciative and it's almost disconcertingly quiet when you get to Ireland,

2882
02:46:48.170 --> 02:46:52.340
there's like,
you're like,
Yep,
okay.

2883
02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:56.890
Done this before.
They like American country music.
They fucking love it,
man.

2884
02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:01.190
That's a Scottish and the Irish,
especially when it all came from there.
Really?

2885
02:47:01.270 --> 02:47:04.700
Yeah.
All country,
bluegrass,
anything.
It's all just a derivative of,
of,

2886
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:07.760
of Scotch Irish folk music that came over with the settlers.

2887
02:47:07.761 --> 02:47:09.480
We just kinda no shit,

2888
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:12.260
drink whiskey and sit on the porch for a hundred years and he just got faster

2889
02:47:12.261 --> 02:47:13.094
and faster.

2890
02:47:15.170 --> 02:47:20.130
Traditional Irish music and a lot of Scottish fiddle tunes.
Um,

2891
02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:24.670
like the Mandolin is tune in d uh,
like,
just like a bagpipe because of the wound,

2892
02:47:24.671 --> 02:47:25.560
the pipes got out law,

2893
02:47:25.570 --> 02:47:28.680
they started playing a lot of those songs on stringed instruments.
Wow.

2894
02:47:29.380 --> 02:47:33.260
Why did the pipes get out?
La?
No,
four.

2895
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:37.370
Basically it was their diversion.
There's the British equivalent of the,

2896
02:47:37.550 --> 02:47:39.640
the law against inciting a riot.
You know,

2897
02:47:39.770 --> 02:47:42.320
like somebody pulled out some fucking bagpipes back in the day,

2898
02:47:42.321 --> 02:47:45.290
like some shit is going to go down,
man.

2899
02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:49.690
So wow.
They made a law against Bagpipe.
Yeah,

2900
02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:54.620
they outlawed them.
How long?
I don't know.
Like years.

2901
02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:55.753
Yeah,
Jamie.

2902
02:47:58.310 --> 02:48:00.830
All of that tradition kind of came over and that a lot of,

2903
02:48:00.831 --> 02:48:02.180
it's where a lot of country music,

2904
02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:05.690
the melodies and the themes and the elements of that,
they're very similar.

2905
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:08.210
Is that why like that,
Lord of the dance shit,

2906
02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:12.170
like when they were still dancing a little bit like line dancing.
Yeah.

2907
02:48:12.171 --> 02:48:15.110
Well isn't it?
That's a little questionable.
I don't know.
We'll go,

2908
02:48:15.910 --> 02:48:20.550
what Michael was the fuck was his name?
The Lord of the dance flat.
Flatly.

2909
02:48:20.610 --> 02:48:25.370
That was short lived people like,
yeah,
let's go Irish dancing.
No,
it's not.
No,

2910
02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:27.860
I did it for a little while.
He still actually,

2911
02:48:27.861 --> 02:48:31.580
I think I saw a fucking billboard for it when I was a few suckers left in town.

2912
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:34.520
Man
was,

2913
02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:37.910
most people got hip to that and went,
hey wait,
wait,
wait.

2914
02:48:37.911 --> 02:48:41.570
What the fuck are we watch it?
What does that do?
Do it up there,
man.

2915
02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:46.370
That was weird.
Yeah.
But yeah,
it's all,
it's all interconnected.
That's amazing.

2916
02:48:46.371 --> 02:48:47.660
I really,
really do.

2917
02:48:47.690 --> 02:48:51.830
Really s man especially I've in Glasgow and Dublin and we feel like we've almost

2918
02:48:51.831 --> 02:48:55.250
been adopted at this point.
Really.
They just,
they're so appreciative.

2919
02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:59.900
How often you play over there?
I've been over five or six times this year.

2920
02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:04.100
No Shit.
Yeah.
Actually we're,
we haven't really started our us tour on the album.

2921
02:49:04.101 --> 02:49:08.040
He came back in May,
but I spent the majority of the year in Europe.
Wow.
Why is

2922
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:08.873
<v 1>that?</v>

2923
02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:11.850
<v 2>It's just,
I,
it's important.
It was always important to me to,</v>

2924
02:49:12.260 --> 02:49:15.750
to go there and play for those people.
And why?
I don't know,

2925
02:49:16.050 --> 02:49:17.850
just free travel really,
man.

2926
02:49:17.851 --> 02:49:21.930
And plus you get the fucking play music every night and see Europe and I think,

2927
02:49:21.931 --> 02:49:26.040
I honestly will hear careers can be such,

2928
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.780
it's a little,

2929
02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:30.920
it has a potential to be a little bit more flash in the pan base over here.

2930
02:49:30.930 --> 02:49:33.060
People get bored quicker.
But,
uh,

2931
02:49:33.690 --> 02:49:35.670
I've just had a lot of friends that are musicians that said,

2932
02:49:35.671 --> 02:49:39.300
if you make the effort and you go over and they see you,

2933
02:49:39.301 --> 02:49:42.300
they see you taking the trouble in time to come over.
Like they're,
they're loyal.

2934
02:49:42.301 --> 02:49:43.230
They're just fans for life.

2935
02:49:43.231 --> 02:49:47.000
I'll probably still be touring over there long after any career I have here.

2936
02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:51.370
<v 1>Yeah.
That's amazing.
What about,
is that England as well?</v>

2937
02:49:52.410 --> 02:49:55.620
<v 2>So much,
I mean there's a market but it,</v>

2938
02:49:55.660 --> 02:50:00.660
it appears to be sincerely and genuinely appreciated in the Celtic areas.

2939
02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:09.420
Dublin and Belfast and Glasgow and Edinburgh and uh,
you know,
these,
these,

2940
02:50:09.570 --> 02:50:14.190
these are really very musical cities at their core,
but they just,
you know,

2941
02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:18.960
anything poetry related or you know,
storytelling,
they just really love it.

2942
02:50:19.030 --> 02:50:24.030
<v 1>How upset were they that youtube put their songs on every iPhone where they</v>

2943
02:50:24.251 --> 02:50:28.150
bummed out?
I don't know.
It was Dublin pissed.
They've gone soft.

2944
02:50:28.570 --> 02:50:33.540
<v 2>I go out of my way to a stay as much the fuck out of their business as possible</v>

2945
02:50:33.541 --> 02:50:34.240
and I'm there.

2946
02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:38.740
<v 1>Right.
You know,
just show up and do my job because it's always,
you know.</v>

2947
02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:42.160
Do you know the story about youtube putting their youtube,

2948
02:50:42.180 --> 02:50:44.260
put their new album on every iPhone.

2949
02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:48.940
The other day I'm in my car and starts playing random and all of sudden I got

2950
02:50:48.941 --> 02:50:50.560
some youtube,
oops,
I'm sorry.

2951
02:50:50.561 --> 02:50:55.180
Bondo apologizes for you to the album be automatically added to apple iTunes

2952
02:50:55.181 --> 02:50:55.440
live.

2953
02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:56.540
<v 2>Now that you say that,
man,</v>

2954
02:50:56.550 --> 02:51:00.000
I was backstage yesterday sinking my phone up to to a new laptop.

2955
02:51:00.001 --> 02:51:03.320
I got on the road and I was getting all the clouds shit and I looked down there

2956
02:51:03.321 --> 02:51:04.410
was a fucking youtube album.

2957
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:09.480
<v 1>Exactly.
Okay.
I was wondering why is this here?
Yeah,
why is that there?</v>

2958
02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:11.220
I don't want that.
I don't want that.

2959
02:51:11.490 --> 02:51:14.490
I'm in my car the other day and I had my car plugged in.
I got the thing,

2960
02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:17.730
you know the plugs into the stereo system.
It's playing random.

2961
02:51:17.731 --> 02:51:18.810
I just do it that sometimes.

2962
02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:23.040
So they monopolize the iTunes basically while they figured out a way to launch

2963
02:51:23.041 --> 02:51:24.810
their album on iTunes.

2964
02:51:24.811 --> 02:51:29.400
But the problem is a lot of people that buy an iPhone aren't you two fans.

2965
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:31.440
It's a fucking very presumptuous thing.

2966
02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:35.520
And you're dealing with billions of these fucking things being sold.

2967
02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:39.240
So how many of them have you two songs on them?
All of them.

2968
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:43.110
I mean how many of their selling and you mean they might sell 100 million

2969
02:51:43.111 --> 02:51:47.370
iPhones,
right?
That's all with a u two album on it.
That's stupid.

2970
02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:50.790
That's not how many youtube would sell.
Youtube is a very popular band.

2971
02:51:50.791 --> 02:51:54.540
I'm sure a lot of people would be super happy to get you to song for free with

2972
02:51:54.541 --> 02:51:57.210
the new iPhone.
But a lot of people with them,

2973
02:51:57.211 --> 02:52:01.950
they pushed him under the existing funds.
Yes,
I had a five s Oh really?

2974
02:52:02.490 --> 02:52:05.980
To show that.
Oh No.
So when you update the operating system,

2975
02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:10.120
<v 4>not even that.
No showed up what their iTunes?</v>

2976
02:52:10.270 --> 02:52:13.000
No,
just showed up this dirty,

2977
02:52:13.410 --> 02:52:17.360
even dirty already purchased it and you just didn't download it yet.
Showed up.

2978
02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:21.760
That's,
that's actually discussed.
That's a disaster.
That's why he's had,
sorry.

2979
02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:26.630
Why did he let that go?
I read the other day [inaudible] he also said that,
uh,

2980
02:52:27.850 --> 02:52:30.790
he's been wearing those fucking classes for 20 years cause he's got glaucoma.

2981
02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:35.710
Do you buy that?
You look a little incredulous.
Yup.

2982
02:52:35.740 --> 02:52:37.840
The jury's out.
Jury's out.

2983
02:52:37.900 --> 02:52:42.220
I wonder he's probably got called on it and you know,
people are like,
hey man,

2984
02:52:42.490 --> 02:52:44.140
why is it just now coming up though?

2985
02:52:44.141 --> 02:52:46.480
I mean people have been wondering what the fuck.

2986
02:52:46.481 --> 02:52:48.280
I mean remember he had like the fly these big,

2987
02:52:48.281 --> 02:52:52.090
the big black ones back in the day.
Like everybody just let that shit slide.

2988
02:52:52.091 --> 02:52:56.500
Like nobody was like,
hey man,
what the fuck?
I wonder if he smokes weed.

2989
02:52:56.930 --> 02:52:59.690
Cause if you have glaucoma you're allowed to reduce,

2990
02:52:59.710 --> 02:53:01.060
reduces interocular pressure.

2991
02:53:01.150 --> 02:53:04.480
It's one of the legit reasons to get a medical marijuana prescription.

2992
02:53:05.170 --> 02:53:09.310
My grandfather has really bad glaucoma now,
but he's never,
I would never,

2993
02:53:09.370 --> 02:53:12.340
I don't even know how I would approach that conversation with him.
We'd,
Oh yeah,

2994
02:53:12.341 --> 02:53:17.080
he's such an old school,
like just a hillbilly,
you know?
Right.

2995
02:53:17.230 --> 02:53:19.470
Just never,
never,
you know,

2996
02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:23.860
I don't even know how I would convince him that this actually will make you feel

2997
02:53:23.861 --> 02:53:28.240
better.
Just sit them down,
you know?
Um,

2998
02:53:28.390 --> 02:53:32.830
set them down.
Yeah.
Get him drunk first.
Andrew Hayes,
he's pretty,

2999
02:53:32.890 --> 02:53:35.230
pretty stoic guy.
Got me.
Well then just sit them down.

3000
02:53:35.231 --> 02:53:36.190
Maybe I just don't tell him.

3001
02:53:36.191 --> 02:53:40.090
Just give him the brownies and I freak out and have a heart attack and die.

3002
02:53:40.120 --> 02:53:44.560
Well that would be very bad.
Yes.
Sit them down.
All right.
I'll send it down.

3003
02:53:44.560 --> 02:53:47.800
You're a grown man now my off to go home and actually see you,

3004
02:53:49.310 --> 02:53:53.350
but listen man,
we're out of time.
We just did ran through three hours.
Really?
Yup.

3005
02:53:53.380 --> 02:53:56.590
Holy Shit.
Crazy right?
That's nuts.
Time flies.

3006
02:53:57.160 --> 02:53:58.540
It all just slips away.

3007
02:53:58.780 --> 02:54:03.630
I tell people a your website Sturgill simpson.com.
Um,
your,

3008
02:54:03.750 --> 02:54:05.650
your two albums,
uh,

3009
02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:10.330
you could get them on iTunes and I listed them off while you were taking a leak.

3010
02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:15.040
If anybody's interested,
you got to,
I mean,
my favorite songs,
I,

3011
02:54:15.050 --> 02:54:16.840
there's a bunch of them.
You can have the crown.

3012
02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:20.050
I fucking love that off your first one.
That's a great fucking,

3013
02:54:20.430 --> 02:54:21.850
why are you laughing?
Oh Man.

3014
02:54:22.860 --> 02:54:27.450
It's nothing what it,
it's,
it's that.

3015
02:54:27.620 --> 02:54:30.790
It's that song.
Everybody's got that song.

3016
02:54:30.791 --> 02:54:34.960
They wish they never wrote a song.
That song's great.
Yeah,

3017
02:54:34.961 --> 02:54:37.180
I fucking love that.
So there's a lot of fun and I had an,

3018
02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:40.660
I wrote it in about 20 minutes to like seven 30 in the morning and we ended up

3019
02:54:40.661 --> 02:54:44.020
recording it that day.
We just happened to go into the studio,

3020
02:54:44.021 --> 02:54:46.560
actually Wayland's old studio in Nashville.
He'll be central.

3021
02:54:46.570 --> 02:54:49.030
We got the opportunity to record in there and Dave was like,

3022
02:54:49.031 --> 02:54:50.080
what are you guys new?

3023
02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:53.860
And I'd written that song and another song literally that morning before I knew

3024
02:54:53.861 --> 02:54:55.430
we were going to be in there.
I was like,
well I,

3025
02:54:55.610 --> 02:54:58.300
so I played it for him and the rest of the guys of course there is laughing

3026
02:54:58.301 --> 02:55:00.520
their ass off and you're like,
we've got to cut that.

3027
02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.550
So we cut it and then I heard that the of the day I heard the playback and I'm

3028
02:55:04.551 --> 02:55:08.720
like,
I'm going to be singing that fucking thing when I'm 60 years old.

3029
02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:13.610
I was going to be the one and sure as shit man,
every show,

3030
02:55:14.030 --> 02:55:17.570
every fucking show,
uh,
the,
it never fails.

3031
02:55:17.571 --> 02:55:22.571
There's that one guy and in between every song came tire mother tired.

3032
02:55:24.510 --> 02:55:27.800
You know,
there's these,
any like he follows us.
It has to be the same guy.

3033
02:55:27.801 --> 02:55:28.540
I don't know.

3034
02:55:28.540 --> 02:55:32.450
<v 3>What will you start off with songs saying I spent all my money on weed and
pills.</v>

3035
02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:36.500
Yeah,
that's,
that's,
that's how it launches.
You got,

3036
02:55:36.530 --> 02:55:39.800
you got to get both albums folks there.
They're both very different,

3037
02:55:39.801 --> 02:55:41.840
which I thought was really fascinating too,

3038
02:55:41.841 --> 02:55:46.100
before I got to meet you and understand what it's from.
Uh,
what,
what caused it.

3039
02:55:46.370 --> 02:55:48.950
Um,
and then the other one met a modern,

3040
02:55:49.310 --> 02:55:54.200
met a modern sounds in country music.
I love that too,
man.
Thank you dude.

The Internet knows all.
It's fucking scary.
