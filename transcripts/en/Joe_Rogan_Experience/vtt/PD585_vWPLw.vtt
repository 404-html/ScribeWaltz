00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.893
<v Speaker 1>Hello</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 2>stitches,</v>

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:04.531
<v Speaker 2>it's a process.</v>

5
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:04.711
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

6
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 2>we're all a part of this process.</v>

7
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.091
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

8
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 2>you and I have both seen each other evolve.</v>

9
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 2>We just don't really realize it as much because we evolve together.</v>

10
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

11
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 2>But if we went back in time 10 years ago to when we met and then like when we</v>

12
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 2>meet,</v>

13
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.460
<v Speaker 2>we'll use it.</v>

14
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 2>It was about 10 years ago.</v>

15
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 2>A little over that I think.</v>

16
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:19.501
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

17
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:19.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:21.520
<v Speaker 2>I might've been like 2001 or something like that.</v>

19
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 2>What's it like even before that dude?</v>

20
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.030

23
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I bet you don't remember this.</v>

24
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time that you really,</v>

25
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.451
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

26

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.273

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.073
<v Speaker 1>I think you had,</v>

34
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>this was right around when you just started smoking weed or you'd become,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

41
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:51.600

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>it was an annoying thing.</v>

45
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.880
<v Speaker 1>It was really funny cause I was sitting man.</v>

46
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>No I was sitting next to you and I at the time I had been,</v>

47
00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

48
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I went through this being a marijuana advocate phase,</v>

49
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>like you know a few,</v>

50
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>a few years before.</v>

51
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>But remember sitting nice and you were talking about weed and as a joke cause I</v>

52
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:08.941
<v Speaker 1>didn't know you that well.</v>

53
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:13.650

57
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 3>As you thought how it you gotta put some fake dress up on his head.</v>

58
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 3>He was all Gary Oldman.</v>

59
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Him Mom,</v>

60
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.331
<v Speaker 3>you seem to know.</v>

61
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:25.164
<v Speaker 3>I said it should be okay.</v>

62
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>You Eagle and you seem so pissed.</v>

63
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>And then Cory like was like to shut up,</v>

64
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:29.941
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

65
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Don't say anything because you,</v>

66
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know each other and I could have seem like a real asshole at the time.</v>

67
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

68
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>then I don't remember that at all.</v>

69
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.051
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

70
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I think you might just be a little paranoid.</v>

71
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I think he tuned me out.</v>

72
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.823
<v Speaker 1>I probably would.</v>

73
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would cut it like,</v>

74
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

75
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>like got angry with you and you don't get angry.</v>

79
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.151
<v Speaker 2>one of two things.</v>

80
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Either you were trying to make a joke,</v>

81
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>which would be not funny and I would be bored with it or I'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and sometimes you go nuts and that's,</v>

123
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 4>and you get stigmatized for it,</v>

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 4>now this is a crazy person.</v>

150
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's just something happened.</v>

151
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 4>The operating system temporarily crashed and quite often I think that could be a</v>

152
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 4>very good thing.</v>

153
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 4>I think that having your,</v>

154
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.620
<v Speaker 4>your personality or your ego or crash can often mean that you were trying to be</v>

155
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 4>somebody that you aren't and some people invest so much energy,</v>

156
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.510
<v Speaker 4>so much energy into trying to find me.</v>

157
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.941
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

158
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 4>They just want to be some thing.</v>

159
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:47.741
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

160
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:47.901
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

161
00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:48.491
<v Speaker 4>they it,</v>

162
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 4>since there were a kid there,</v>

163
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 4>mother was telling them,</v>

164
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 4>you should be like this and then they try to be like this and they hold up this</v>

165
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

166
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.670
<v Speaker 4>They're always working to hold up this giant tail feather in their arms start</v>

167
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 4>shaking and that they can't hold it up and that's when they have like anger</v>

168
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 4>outbursts are suddenly like their friends are like you.</v>

169
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 4>You turned into someone that I've never met.</v>

170
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know who that is.</v>

171
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.601
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

172
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

173
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.011
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>

174
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 4>you met them,</v>

175
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 4>you met underneath the tail feather,</v>

176
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 4>the seeding,</v>

177
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 4>see anger and disappointment and sadness.</v>

178
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 4>They that you met,</v>

179
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 4>that thing that they're,</v>

180
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to avoid by looking up at this mask.</v>

181
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 4>They're holding up to the world,</v>

182
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 4>but that fucking saving,</v>

183
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 4>see of disappointment,</v>

184
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 4>anger and horror and sadness.</v>

185
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 4>That's where it's at,</v>

186
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

187
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 4>You got to go into that thing and it's,</v>

188
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:36.731
<v Speaker 4>for some people,</v>

189
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 4>the only way they can go into that is by having a full scale nervous breakdown</v>

190
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 4>because then they can have permission to dive into that,</v>

191
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.450
<v Speaker 4>into that awful vortex of darkness because underneath that vortex of darkness is</v>

192
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:49.714
<v Speaker 4>paradise.</v>

193
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.553
<v Speaker 4>Underneath that,</v>

194
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 4>that's love and happiness and joy and connection and tranquility and all that</v>

195
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 4>stuff and everyone's thinks that the way to get to that point is by avoiding</v>

196
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 4>this awful black forest that surrounds the garden of Eden,</v>

197
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 4>which is inside everybody.</v>

198
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.370
<v Speaker 4>It's inside everybody.</v>

199
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.353
<v Speaker 4>It's there,</v>

200
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 4>it's there and it doesn't matter.</v>

201
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 4>You know you can work out and that will definitely give you a temporarily</v>

202
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 4>temporary good feeling,</v>

203
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 4>but until you address the internal structures that you haven't acknowledged,</v>

204
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 4>you're always going to go back to that place where you find yourself morose and</v>

205
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 4>depressed and angry,</v>

206
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 4>and you don't know why.</v>

207
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 4>You always go back to that place until you sit with the sadness inside of you.</v>

208
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 4>You have to do that.</v>

209
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 4>What you're describing is coming out of the closet.</v>

210
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

211
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.251
<v Speaker 4>For a lot of people,</v>

212
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:37.001
<v Speaker 4>that is what it is,</v>

213
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:37.391
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

214
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:40.160
<v Speaker 4>It's coming out of the closet and there's a lot of closets,</v>

215
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

216
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 4>There's not just the gay closet,</v>

217
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

218
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 4>There's all kinds of closet.</v>

219
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 4>There's the artists closet.</v>

220
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Some people are fucking accountants.</v>

221
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 4>They're wearing suits and their ties on tight and they're fucking like organized</v>

222
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 4>and disciplined,</v>

223
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 4>but inside they're probably painters.</v>

224
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 4>They probably want it fucking paint.</v>

225
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 4>They want to paint day mountains down at the beach.</v>

226
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 4>That's what they really are,</v>

227
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 4>but their daddy or their mommy wanted them to be a good little businessman,</v>

228
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 4>so they became this thing that's the opposite of what they are.</v>

229
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 4>This is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita.</v>

230
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.901
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

231
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 4>forgive me cause I've quoted it way too many times,</v>

232
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

233
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 4>it's better to be an honest street sweeper than a dishonest king.</v>

234
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.980
<v Speaker 4>It's better to be a happy guy brushing fucking leafs up the street than it is to</v>

235
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 4>be some zillionaire who inside is dying or numb or miserable,</v>

236
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:27.014
<v Speaker 4>mostly numb,</v>

237
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.011
<v Speaker 4>numbs the word.</v>

238
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 4>Most people are just not.</v>

239
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 4>As long as these people can quantify on paper,</v>

240
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 4>I still have a x million dollar home.</v>

241
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 4>My car still cost x thousand dollars this suit is an ex suit.</v>

242
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 4>I am still ahead.</v>

243
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 4>I am not going to abandon all of these things.</v>

244
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 4>As long as they don't see through the bullshit of the game.</v>

245
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 4>They think they're winning.</v>

246
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.290
<v Speaker 4>They have to file.</v>

247
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like you have to fall to to really,</v>

248
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 4>that's what you got to appreciate those moments when it all falls apart on you</v>

249
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 4>because that means you've got an opportunity to try it again.</v>

250
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.930
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

251
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 4>let's take a new fresh perspective.</v>

252
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.970
<v Speaker 4>This is the cool thing that at this retreat I went to this Guy Jack Cornfield's</v>

253
00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:04.131
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

254
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 4>which I really loved.</v>

255
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] great name by the way.</v>

256
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

257
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.243
<v Speaker 4>With a k,</v>

258
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.021
<v Speaker 4>not a c,</v>

259
00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 4>Jack Kornfield,</v>

260
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 4>mortal Kombat,</v>

261
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 4>k Jack Cornfield.</v>

262
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.261
<v Speaker 4>But he,</v>

263
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

264
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 4>he's really cool man.</v>

265
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 4>But he was cool.</v>

266
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.990
<v Speaker 4>He's a cat,</v>

267
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 4>like the cigarette corny.</v>

268
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 4>Now this guy was awesome and he was one of the things he talked about his in</v>

269
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 4>some religious tradition,</v>

270
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 4>how they like hold the scriptures a rabbi like had his students hold the</v>

271
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:30.680
<v Speaker 4>scriptures over their heart and uh,</v>

272
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 4>when they were memorizing them and they would say,</v>

273
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 4>why do we do this?</v>

274
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.821
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

275
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 4>so that when your heartbreaks,</v>

276
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 4>they'll fall in.</v>

277
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 4>And it's a beautiful idea,</v>

278
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 4>which is that heartbreak is actually your ego cracking.</v>

279
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.030
<v Speaker 4>And the moment that cracks,</v>

280
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 4>you're in the experience of truth.</v>

281
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 4>And when you're in the experience of truth,</v>

282
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.480
<v Speaker 4>that's when you can really become who you are.</v>

283
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

284
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 4>but to get to who you are,</v>

285
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.371
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you know,</v>

286
00:07:53.371 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 4>when a bone heals the wrong way,</v>

287
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 4>like that's what a lot of people's entire personality is.</v>

288
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:02.981
<v Speaker 4>It's like a bone that grew the wrong way and that needs a fucking a snap,</v>

289
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.123
<v Speaker 4>a crack,</v>

290
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:04.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

291
00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:04.821
<v Speaker 4>and we,</v>

292
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:05.760
<v Speaker 4>you get that through sex,</v>

293
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.251
<v Speaker 4>you need that,</v>

294
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 4>that initial fucking thing.</v>

295
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 4>And it's a beautiful analogy and it hurts.</v>

296
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:11.991
<v Speaker 4>It hurts.</v>

297
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 4>But we're paying avoiding creatures.</v>

298
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 4>So we think that,</v>

299
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 4>so we're always running away from this pain.</v>

300
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is as we're running away from pain,</v>

301
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 4>we're still exactly in pain.</v>

302
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.340
<v Speaker 4>It's basically like being on fire and running away from water.</v>

303
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 4>You're just running away from the water because you,</v>

304
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:28.101
<v Speaker 4>for some,</v>

305
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:28.461
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

306
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 4>that's a stupid analogy actually for doing great.</v>

307
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:34.240
<v Speaker 4>Up until that you had a lot of great points.</v>

308
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:35.074
<v Speaker 4>What it's true,</v>

309
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

310
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 4>there's the monster in the dark and the faster you run,</v>

311
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 4>the more likely you are to run into something that's actually going to hurt you</v>

312
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to turning around and saying,</v>

313
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.071
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck,</v>

314
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:43.904
<v Speaker 4>there is no monster.</v>

315
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.461
<v Speaker 4>No Monster.</v>

316
00:08:44.461 --> 00:08:44.721
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

317
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 4>But you never get to know that until you stop and turn around.</v>

318
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:47.670
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

319
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.390
<v Speaker 4>And in some cases people don't have the discipline or the,</v>

320
00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 4>the assistance or the balls to stop.</v>

321
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 4>And turn around so they have to trip over something and then there's</v>

322
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.311
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

323
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:57.144
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

324
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 2>there's the classic story of someone hiding a secret and going completely out of</v>

325
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>control because of the pressure of hiding that.</v>

326
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:04.741
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

327
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the Ted Haggerty who's the secretly gay guy who's preaching against</v>

328
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:10.141
<v Speaker 2>gay people.</v>

329
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:15.141
<v Speaker 2>Ted Haggard in Colorado was snorting meth off his gay lovers.</v>

330
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

331
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

332
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 2>We was just going so far the other way.</v>

333
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 2>He just so off the rails crazy himself.</v>

334
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 2>He's being himself.</v>

335
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.480
<v Speaker 2>He was a guy who likes to snort math off of Cox,</v>

336
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.340
<v Speaker 2>who I still a little math and he likes to,</v>

337
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

338
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a few Cox,</v>

339
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 2>but I would say he wasn't being himself.</v>

340
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 2>What I would say is that his,</v>

341
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.390
<v Speaker 2>his behavior was so extreme because he was seeking balance between that and the</v>

342
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 2>other bull shit in his life.</v>

343
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if he weren't living that,</v>

344
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 2>he'd be right in the middle.</v>

345
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

346
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

347
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 4>Well to give it to get to the middle.</v>

348
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:46.801
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

349
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 4>the way to get to the middle weirdly is whatever the behavior is that you're</v>

350
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 4>doing that you're so horrified about and terrified of sometimes.</v>

351
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 4>They're really weird ideas.</v>

352
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.890
<v Speaker 4>This is like something that I liked that Ron doss has,</v>

353
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 4>which is like if you don't feel like meditating,</v>

354
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:01.404
<v Speaker 4>don't meditate.</v>

355
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.461
<v Speaker 4>Don't force it.</v>

356
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:03.930
<v Speaker 4>Don't impose this on yourself.</v>

357
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 4>Keep doing the thing you're doing that's upsetting you so much.</v>

358
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 4>Have the balls to keep doing the fucking thing that you're doing.</v>

359
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Keep doing it.</v>

360
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.470
<v Speaker 4>If society is going to tell you,</v>

361
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 4>don't be like this.</v>

362
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Stop being like this.</v>

363
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 4>You have to change.</v>

364
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 4>That's what your parents always say.</v>

365
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.710
<v Speaker 4>The idea is like no,</v>

366
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 4>sink into what you are right now.</v>

367
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 4>Just be that thing.</v>

368
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.020
<v Speaker 4>Stop resisting exactly where you are right now is perfect and that's a hard</v>

369
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 4>truth to grasp.</v>

370
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 4>I will take,</v>

371
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:37.920
<v Speaker 4>I would take 5,000 Casey Anthony's over one.</v>

372
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Nancy grace any day of the week.</v>

373
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 4>Nancy grace is a fucking foul.</v>

374
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 4>Necrophiles I think she is so much more disgusting than some strippers kid</v>

375
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:49.980
<v Speaker 4>gotten to her ecstasy or whatever happened.</v>

376
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:50.580
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

377
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 4>who?</v>

378
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.930

381
00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 4>She left the kid in the backseat of the car,</v>

382
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 4>fell on the Kiddie pool cause she's negligent or whatever.</v>

383
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like sad and terrible.</v>

384
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:05.391
<v Speaker 4>But Nancy grace get like clearly getting off on the whole situation.</v>

392
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.660

393
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna need your help here.</v>

394
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.503
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

395
00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

396

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.900
<v Speaker 4>You're weeping because this one mother got off the hook.</v>

400
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.620
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

401
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.750
<v Speaker 4>every year in Afghanistan and Iraq,</v>

402
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.230
<v Speaker 4>the UN is dropping bombs on neighborhoods.</v>

403
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.080
<v Speaker 4>Kids are getting blown to smithereens.</v>

404
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.290
<v Speaker 4>Kids are getting transformed into hamburger meat on a daily basis and the Middle</v>

405
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.481
<v Speaker 4>East,</v>

406
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:51.740
<v Speaker 4>because of our fucked up drones that keep accidentally bombing weddings and</v>

407
00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods and these murder,</v>

408
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 4>these death hags are freaking out over one dead child.</v>

409
00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:58.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

410
00:11:58.931 --> 00:11:59.764
<v Speaker 4>it's sad.</v>

411
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.820
<v Speaker 4>It's very sad.</v>

412
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 4>That cake Caylee Anthony died.</v>

413
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:03.071
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

414
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I think that's terribly sad.</v>

415
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 4>But when you hear Nancy grace being like Kylie,</v>

416
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:12.151
<v Speaker 4>Anthony's bleached bones were found but cable or pyre up writer and all those</v>

417
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.321
<v Speaker 4>honor.</v>

419
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 4>one bit of her taste shirt.</v>

420
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's a grow,</v>

421
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.840
<v Speaker 4>there's a disgusting,</v>

422
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.030
<v Speaker 4>there's something perverse behind it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm a big Fan Bashing Nancy grace.</v>

428
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:27.923
<v Speaker 1>What a pig.</v>

429
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.250
<v Speaker 1>There's something gross about when I,</v>

430
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 1>whenever I see someone who's angry and they're fat like that and I'm like,</v>

431
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe you need to go on a diet and you won't be so fucking angry dog.</v>

432
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.221
<v Speaker 1>The bounty.</v>

433
00:12:37.221 --> 00:12:40.030
<v Speaker 1>I see someone with his big jowls in this big,</v>

434
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.001

<v Speaker 1>Take some yoga classes.</v>

438
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.580
<v Speaker 1>You'll approach this all totally different somewhere.</v>

439
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 1>The devil is dancing to not the top.</v>

440
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Mom's off the hook.</v>

441
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Tiger Woods.</v>

442
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a another one.</v>

443
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:54.941
<v Speaker 1>She went after.</v>

444
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 1>She went off to tiger woods for like,</v>

445
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.580
<v Speaker 1>you guys need to stop watching me.</v>

446
00:12:57.581 --> 00:12:58.600
<v Speaker 1>So much slides.</v>

447
00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

448
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I think him and Nancy Grace are going to burn and a specific part of whatever</v>

449
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 1>hell there may be my baby that gets eaten by Florida for it.</v>

450
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 1>It will turn into a mouth and eat that baby.</v>

451
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I think he's hoping the swamps will open up and you'll see teeth come out of the</v>

452
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

453
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Snatch up the child.</v>

454
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.111
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

455
00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I would love to dead babies.</v>

456
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.110
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't looking for Laura De,</v>

457
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:13:21.461 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 1>it'd be so fun.</v>

459
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.640
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird thought that I've had to wait a minute.</v>

460
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You yeah,</v>

461
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

462
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Get Out.</v>

463
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>But if Nancy grace as a full grown thing is disgusting and foul,</v>

464
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.920
<v Speaker 1>but if you could shrink Nancy grace down and have like a pocket Nancy grace that</v>

465
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 1>lived in a little aquarium,</v>

466
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.210
<v Speaker 1>some little judgemental death con that you hadn't been in an aquarium.</v>

467
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:44.044
<v Speaker 1>That was just</v>

468
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.010
<v Speaker 1>a little show to the right thing.</v>

469
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Tiger Woods,</v>

470

473
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Is it a dead baby in Florida?</v>

474
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It is the semen stains on the mattress.</v>

475
00:14:04.091 --> 00:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Can we zoom in on those?</v>

476
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's get dog the bounty hunter and here to dirty nails scratching your clit,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's her mantra.</v>

481
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:18.671
<v Speaker 1>When she walks,</v>

482

<v Speaker 1>she chant Simon steins and Nancy grace holds the world record for the longest</v>

483
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.510
<v Speaker 1>squirt ever by a female vagina kind of</v>

484
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.840
<v Speaker 1>squirt like 18 feet.</v>

485
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

486
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that that sport happened,</v>

487
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.241
<v Speaker 1>did not score.</v>

488
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:33.670
<v Speaker 1>It happened when she saw Jon Benet Ramsey death picture.</v>

489
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.371
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

490
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

491
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten more than one email from really dumb people think that because I am</v>

492
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:45.970
<v Speaker 2>playing at the Masonic Auditorium,</v>

493
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.990
<v Speaker 2>it just proves that I am a new world order shill.</v>

494
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.301
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

495
00:14:50.301 --> 00:14:51.760
<v Speaker 6>you're an reptile dude.</v>

496
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.690
<v Speaker 6>You follow why bringer.</v>

497
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 6>Lord Lucifer,</v>

498
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I am a part of the masonic,</v>

499
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:57.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

500
00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.630
<v Speaker 2>what do they call themselves?</v>

501
00:14:58.631 --> 00:14:59.464
<v Speaker 2>Brotherhood.</v>

502
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.310
<v Speaker 2>They're a fraternity and fraternity part of the Masonic fraternity.</v>

503
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.001
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

504
00:15:04.001 --> 00:15:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean with the new world order,</v>

505
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.630
<v Speaker 2>because I'm planning at the Nob Hill Masonic it,</v>

506
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.930
<v Speaker 6>you know what a Mason told me once he said that what it's all about is that math</v>

507
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.970
<v Speaker 6>or geometry is the first language of the universe.</v>

508
00:15:18.971 --> 00:15:20.980
<v Speaker 6>It's like the first language of God.</v>

509
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.023
<v Speaker 6>And so like,</v>

510
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.720
<v Speaker 6>they're super into sacred geometry.</v>

511
00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:26.921
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

512
00:15:26.921 --> 00:15:28.000
<v Speaker 6>that's a big thing.</v>

513
00:15:28.001 --> 00:15:32.020
<v Speaker 6>And like the whole thing is based on building the Temple of Solomon,</v>

514
00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:32.830
<v Speaker 6>which is where you,</v>

515
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.420
<v Speaker 6>how's the Ark of the covenant?</v>

516
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:34.961
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

517
00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:36.310
<v Speaker 6>it's all symbolic of course.</v>

518
00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:39.670
<v Speaker 6>But the new temple of Solomon that they're trying to build according to the</v>

519
00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:42.940
<v Speaker 6>conspiracy theorists is society like this is it.</v>

520
00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:45.550
<v Speaker 6>Like society is the New Temple of Solomon.</v>

521
00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:49.120
<v Speaker 6>And part of that was getting the United States revolution to happen because they</v>

522
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.760
<v Speaker 6>help fund that and also fucking DC,</v>

523
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:56.970
<v Speaker 6>the street layout of DC is all masonic symbols and that goddamn obelisks popping</v>

524
00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.690
<v Speaker 6>up out of the middle of fucking DC,</v>

525
00:15:58.691 --> 00:15:59.530
<v Speaker 6>that weird thing.</v>

526
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.480
<v Speaker 6>And it's all over our fucking money.</v>

527
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.021
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

528
00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:02.560
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

529
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 6>we are worried about you.</v>

530
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.580
<v Speaker 2>There is something going on behind the scenes,</v>

531
00:16:11.581 --> 00:16:11.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

532
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:12.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

533
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.290
<v Speaker 2>it's clear if you look at the design of Washington DC and folks who should</v>

534
00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:17.700
<v Speaker 2>really should look this up online,</v>

535
00:16:17.701 --> 00:16:18.810
<v Speaker 2>cause it's not something that,</v>

536
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.130
<v Speaker 2>it's irrefutable.</v>

537
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.120
<v Speaker 2>The Grid,</v>

538
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.571
<v Speaker 2>the grid,</v>

539
00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:23.190
<v Speaker 2>the way they've lined up the streets,</v>

540
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.870
<v Speaker 2>the way they put the buildings and everything.</v>

541
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean it literally is masonic symbols.</v>

542
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:27.840
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

543
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.700
<v Speaker 2>And it's all of our fucking money to,</v>

544
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

545
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:31.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

546
00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:33.620
<v Speaker 2>What's up with that fucking all seeing eye,</v>

547
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.590
<v Speaker 6>just an eye on top of a pyramid that makes sense.</v>

548
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.250
<v Speaker 6>The United States and its long love affair with Egypt.</v>

549
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.800
<v Speaker 6>Think how the Egyptians help form our constitution.</v>

550
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.560
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

551
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.710
<v Speaker 6>No one thinks about that shit.</v>

552
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.730
<v Speaker 6>That's what's so fun about the call.</v>

553
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.001
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

554
00:16:50.001 --> 00:16:52.190
<v Speaker 6>cause the word a call itself means hidden,</v>

555
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.790
<v Speaker 6>but it's like hidden in plain view because this shit's in front of everybody.</v>

556
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.380
<v Speaker 6>Like all the people who deny conspiracy theories and stuff in their wallet or</v>

557
00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:04.640
<v Speaker 6>Fucking rectangles covered in Egyptian occult symbology did.</v>

558
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 6>They don't even think about,</v>

559
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.940
<v Speaker 2>for folks who don't know the,</v>

560
00:17:07.941 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 2>what the symbols are in Washington DC,</v>

561
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:15.911
<v Speaker 2>the way it's set up is one of them is a Lucifer,</v>

562
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

563
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 2>uptight upside down Pentagram.</v>

564
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

565
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

566
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:22.190
<v Speaker 2>so the horns stick up in the air.</v>

567
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

568
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

569
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.560
<v Speaker 2>that's there.</v>

570
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean they did design this.</v>

571
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.800
<v Speaker 2>They really did design the streets like this.</v>

572
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.330
<v Speaker 2>And the other one is,</v>

573
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

574
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.080
<v Speaker 2>like that masonic symbol that looks like a measuring device.</v>

575
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

576
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.281
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

577
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:34.531
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>

578
00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:35.420
<v Speaker 6>that means a lot.</v>

579
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:35.721
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

580
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:36.201
<v Speaker 6>that's why,</v>

581
00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 6>that's why they liked that,</v>

582
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:37.994
<v Speaker 6>because they're trying,</v>

583
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:43.090
<v Speaker 6>what they're trying to do is to sort of articulate the primary,</v>

584
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.533
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

585
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.400
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

586
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:45.920
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

587
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.500
<v Speaker 6>the very first way that the universe form,</v>

588
00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:53.501
<v Speaker 6>which is through geometry or through like a cascade of like specific physical</v>

589
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.790
<v Speaker 6>laws that are based on math.</v>

590
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 6>It's super fucking cool,</v>

591
00:17:58.351 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

592
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.210
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

593
00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 6>it's what masons are.</v>

594
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:00.721
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

595
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 6>that's what amazing told me at a wedding.</v>

596
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:03.391
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

597
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 6>He's drunk too.</v>

598
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:05.124
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

599
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

600
00:18:07.161 --> 00:18:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I met a drunk mason at a,</v>

601
00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:11.810
<v Speaker 2>at a show at the laugh factory in Houston.</v>

602
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.510
<v Speaker 2>It was showing me his mason ids and shit.</v>

603
00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:15.380
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

604
00:18:15.381 --> 00:18:16.850
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is being a mason?</v>

605
00:18:16.851 --> 00:18:17.150
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

606
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.961
<v Speaker 2>what do you guys do?</v>

607
00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:18.231
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

608
00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:18.681
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

609
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:20.090
<v Speaker 2>it's just secret society.</v>

610
00:18:20.091 --> 00:18:20.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

611
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:21.343
<v Speaker 2>hung out together.</v>

612
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:21.901
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

613
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:22.770
<v Speaker 6>Hang out together.</v>

614
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 6>We had two rituals where you come out of a fucking coffin.</v>

615
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:26.700
<v Speaker 6>I know that happens.</v>

616
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:27.231
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

617
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:30.560
<v Speaker 2>But how much power do you really think they have?</v>

618
00:18:30.561 --> 00:18:32.720
<v Speaker 2>We'll try to use,</v>

619
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.280
<v Speaker 2>is there really anything to what they're doing or is like being a mason?</v>

620
00:18:37.281 --> 00:18:38.114
<v Speaker 2>Just fun?</v>

621
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:38.990
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

622
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.330
<v Speaker 6>I an elk's lodge ever.</v>

623
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.000
<v Speaker 6>There's bunches,</v>

624
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.650
<v Speaker 6>there's many different levels of the thing and I imagine that a lot of Masons,</v>

625
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

626
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 6>are probably in politics and when you're,</v>

627
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:52.260
<v Speaker 6>when you're in a fraternity and you're in politics,</v>

628
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:56.520
<v Speaker 6>you're probably going to pay deference to other people in your fraternity when</v>

629
00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 6>it comes to working together to make laws happen or whatever you're up to.</v>

630
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.160
<v Speaker 6>So I though a lot of people say it's a waning population that,</v>

631
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 6>that the masons are kind of like dying out because fewer young people are</v>

632
00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 6>signing up because they don't recruit.</v>

633
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.560
<v Speaker 6>So to become a mason you have to ask a mason,</v>

634
00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:15.480
<v Speaker 6>so you'd have to go to the masonic lodge and be like,</v>

635
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.950
<v Speaker 6>I want to become a Freemason.</v>

636
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.610
<v Speaker 6>And then they do like background checks on you and become masons.</v>

637
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:21.180
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

638
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:21.770
<v Speaker 6>let's do it.</v>

639
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 6>I think it'd be a blast.</v>

640
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 6>What do you think is good about being a mason?</v>

641
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.880
<v Speaker 6>I think ceremony is people</v>

642
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.013
<v Speaker 2>that's right now in front of</v>

643
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.640
<v Speaker 7>Peter.</v>

644
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.900
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking shit.</v>

645
00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 7>He's a fucking new world order.</v>

646
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 7>Shields.</v>

647
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.700
<v Speaker 7>Where's the Alex Jones hotline number?</v>

648
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.200
<v Speaker 7>I need to call him.</v>

649
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:37.830
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

650
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.830
<v Speaker 7>Joe Rogan has publicly admitted on his show that he is amazing.</v>

651
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:48.830
<v Speaker 7>He has Duncan Trussell on talks about how wonderful it is to be amazing and</v>

652
00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:51.900
<v Speaker 7>spreading propaganda.</v>

653
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:56.490
<v Speaker 7>And this information about Mason's being about geometry,</v>

654
00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 7>they're about control or about taking your soul,</v>

655
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.410
<v Speaker 7>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

656
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.010
<v Speaker 7>not going to stand for,</v>

657
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:08.701
<v Speaker 6>well man,</v>

658
00:20:08.701 --> 00:20:09.181
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

659
00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:09.730
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

660
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:10.410
<v Speaker 6>I who knows.</v>

661
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.150
<v Speaker 6>I think uh,</v>

662
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 6>ceremony is a,</v>

663
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:18.330
<v Speaker 6>as something that is missing from a lot of people's lives in our culture because</v>

664
00:20:18.331 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 6>it's so goddamn weird.</v>

665
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.191
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

666
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:21.300
<v Speaker 6>someone wants to get married.</v>

667
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:22.883
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

668
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:23.461
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

669
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:24.210
<v Speaker 6>I guess so.</v>

670
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:24.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

671
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:25.570
<v Speaker 6>If someone wants to get mad,</v>

672
00:20:25.571 --> 00:20:26.760
<v Speaker 6>well that is that definitely,</v>

673
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 6>that is definitely a ceremony.</v>

674
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:28.830
<v Speaker 6>But like,</v>

675
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

676
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:32.130
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of other ceremonies to that aren't quite so,</v>

677
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:32.700
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

678
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.980
<v Speaker 6>based on like on stupid shit.</v>

679
00:20:34.981 --> 00:20:35.814
<v Speaker 6>But I mean there,</v>

680
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.800
<v Speaker 6>but they are like,</v>

681
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.260
<v Speaker 6>there's their,</v>

682
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 6>their psychedelic man.</v>

683
00:20:39.661 --> 00:20:40.950
<v Speaker 6>And like I read this somewhere,</v>

684
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:41.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember who said it,</v>

685
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:42.330
<v Speaker 6>but it was uh,</v>

686
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 6>an interesting point,</v>

687
00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 6>which is that a rock show is a ceremony and the sense that you're going to this</v>

688
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.400
<v Speaker 6>to watch people on stage crew like doing like songs which are a kind of chant</v>

689
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.400
<v Speaker 6>that everyone already knows and you're taking psychedelics to go enjoy this</v>

690
00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 6>thick.</v>

691
00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.923
<v Speaker 6>So it's like that,</v>

692
00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.381
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

693
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:03.340
<v Speaker 6>that Youngian idea that like there's just certain basic things that tend to</v>

694
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:05.710
<v Speaker 6>repeat through all different cultures.</v>

695
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.350
<v Speaker 6>And the way it's repeated in our culture is more through,</v>

696
00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to go see a rock show and dress in a certain way and take a</v>

697
00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:15.700
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic and trip out and have a kind of transcendent experience that comes</v>

698
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:16.534
<v Speaker 6>through the music.</v>

699
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.680
<v Speaker 6>But it used to be like,</v>

700
00:21:17.681 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 6>there's more formal versions of that idea,</v>

701
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.060
<v Speaker 6>which is like you take a psychedelic and then you do a series of like</v>

702
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.780
<v Speaker 6>intonations or whatever the fuck it is depending on what religion or cult you're</v>

703
00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:28.300
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>

704
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 6>And that creates a kind of transcendent connective experience,</v>

705
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.400
<v Speaker 6>which I think is fucking awesome.</v>

706
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:38.530
<v Speaker 6>And it's fun to just watch regardless of whether or not you believe in what that</v>

707
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:40.900
<v Speaker 6>red religion or ritual is trying to invoke.</v>

708
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:45.010
<v Speaker 6>It's just cool to watch that form of dance and movement happen</v>

709
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.070
<v Speaker 2>that the horrible idea,</v>

710
00:21:47.071 --> 00:21:50.880
<v Speaker 2>especially horrible to bring it up to anybody who's had poor fortune in this</v>

711
00:21:50.881 --> 00:21:54.360
<v Speaker 2>life is to somehow or another connected with past lives.</v>

712
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:54.741
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

713
00:21:54.741 --> 00:21:56.180
<v Speaker 2>and you've ever heard someone say that like,</v>

714
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

715
00:21:56.341 --> 00:21:58.170
<v Speaker 2>you must've been a real fuck had in his past life.</v>

716
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.010
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

717
00:21:59.010 --> 00:21:59.641
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

718
00:21:59.641 --> 00:22:00.930
<v Speaker 2>like what are you really?</v>

719
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure?</v>

720
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.950
<v Speaker 2>You sure could it just not be a roll of the dice and maybe part of your Karma is</v>

721
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.610
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that?</v>

722
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.511
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

723
00:22:10.511 --> 00:22:10.691
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

724
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 1>that's why I like the uh,</v>

725
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:12.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

726
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

727
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.623
<v Speaker 1>Buddha.</v>

728
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

729
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I like him.</v>

730
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Like Buddha said,</v>

731
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 1>don't well,</v>

732
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 1>don't think about the afterlife so much.</v>

733
00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I think even Christ said,</v>

734
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I am the god of the living,</v>

735
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 1>not the god of the dead.</v>

736
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.000
<v Speaker 1>The idea being the voice.</v>

737
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I am the god of the living.</v>

738
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a good,</v>

739
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.410
<v Speaker 1>I think real spiritual masters always tend to try to bring people back into the</v>

740
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 1>present moment because it's like,</v>

741
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:33.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

742
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 1>you know what the present moment is everything.</v>

743
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I know when Shit goes wrong in my life,</v>

744
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I know why it went wrong.</v>

745
00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to go back to when I was a fryer and the 18 hundreds and like</v>

746
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.250
<v Speaker 1>fisted a fucking,</v>

747
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.420
<v Speaker 1>you know none.</v>

748
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I know that if shit's going wrong right now,</v>

749
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:49.414
<v Speaker 1>generally it's like,</v>

750
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.250
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm fucking up now.</v>

751
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It's good for,</v>

752
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 1>and people can get lost.</v>

753
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 1>People can start blaming their,</v>

754
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 1>their Karma,</v>

755
00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

756
00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.200
<v Speaker 1>or where they're at right now in past lives.</v>

757
00:22:59.201 --> 00:23:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And it puts him in this place of stupid hopelessness and they don't do the</v>

758
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:04.900
<v Speaker 1>things they need to do right now to get to a better place.</v>

759
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Praise Jesus.</v>

760
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Praise the Lord.</v>

761
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Because I,</v>

762
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.550
<v Speaker 2>his name's so many fucking say,</v>

763
00:23:08.551 --> 00:23:08.681
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

764
00:23:08.681 --> 00:23:09.170
<v Speaker 2>his name,</v>

765
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:09.440
<v Speaker 2>how many</v>

766
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.430
<v Speaker 1>simple things you could do,</v>

767
00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:10.910
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

768
00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:11.390
<v Speaker 1>all you got.</v>

769
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you have to do.</v>

770
00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.220
<v Speaker 1>This is my new theory.</v>

771
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Identify the vampire in your life.</v>

772
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Find the vampire,</v>

773
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.230
<v Speaker 1>identify the parasite.</v>

774
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.600
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be that you have parasites in life.</v>

775
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.080
<v Speaker 1>It is possible that you could've gotten lucky and there's no parasites and you</v>

776
00:23:27.081 --> 00:23:27.860
<v Speaker 1>get off groovy.</v>

777
00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.071
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

778
00:23:28.071 --> 00:23:28.281
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

779
00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying everyone's got one,</v>

780
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.340
<v Speaker 1>but if you got one,</v>

781
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.720
<v Speaker 1>if you're walking around with those fucking vampire blues,</v>

782
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you've got the fucking heavy heart and you'd,</v>

783
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.980
<v Speaker 1>and you can't feel happy and you feel bad,</v>

784
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.470
<v Speaker 1>there may be an action that you need to take that you're afraid take.</v>

785
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the vampire and you've got to fucking not even a person.</v>

786
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.391
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

787
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a situation,</v>

788
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:52.904
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

789
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.241
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

790
00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:54.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a vampire in your life.</v>

791
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Find the life sucking situation that you're afraid to kill.</v>

792
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I say vampires because vampire is only go or they're invited.</v>

793
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 1>And generally the situation that you're in,</v>

794
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.540
<v Speaker 1>you invited it in,</v>

795
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you invited this thing into your life and now it's sucking your life energy in</v>

796
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 1>your blood and your happiness away,</v>

797
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.360
<v Speaker 1>don't it?</v>

798
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's in a lot of times you'll try to believe,</v>

799
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 1>you'll try to convince yourself that this thing is not a vampire,</v>

800
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.271
<v Speaker 1>but in your heart,</v>

801
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 1>you know you're a servant.</v>

802
00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>To a fucking blood sucker.</v>

803
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.020
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>

804
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.853
<v Speaker 1>Ren felt.</v>

805
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 1>This thing is like sucking your life as it's way.</v>

806
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's doing it with a trade.</v>

807
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Quite often there'll be a bad trade.</v>

808
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:32.931
<v Speaker 1>You'll be,</v>

809
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:33.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

810
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:34.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever the situation you're in and you'll,</v>

811
00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:35.061
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

812
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 1>it'll be,</v>

813
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel like you're in the situation.</v>

814
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:37.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

815
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:38.361
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>

816
00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:39.051
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of bad,</v>

817
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:39.884
<v Speaker 1>but it's totally worth it.</v>

818
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 1>This happens with jobs quite often,</v>

819
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:42.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

820
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:42.561
<v Speaker 1>or you're like,</v>

821
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:42.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

822
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:43.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

823
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:44.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's good enough.</v>

824
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the vampire.</v>

825
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.170
<v Speaker 1>You got to take a fucking stake and drive it into its art to how do you kill a</v>

826
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:51.561
<v Speaker 1>vampire?</v>

827
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Two ways.</v>

828
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Direct Action.</v>

829
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't kill a vampire by like making up with a vampire.</v>

830
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:59.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't kill the vampire by like having a sit down and talk with a vampire.</v>

831
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be able to like,</v>

832
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

833
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

834
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

835
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:03.510
<v Speaker 1>make friends with the vampire.</v>

836
00:25:03.511 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 1>There's two ways to kill a vampire.</v>

837
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

838
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you fucking,</v>

839
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

840
00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

841
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

842
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:08.660
<v Speaker 1>put a stake in its heart.</v>

843
00:25:08.661 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 1>The other one is light,</v>

844
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 1>sunlight,</v>

845
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.713
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

846
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 1>light that it's the greatest metaphor of all time.</v>

847
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.620
<v Speaker 1>You shine the light of truth onto the situation,</v>

848
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>fearlessly analyze it and then you'll destroy it.</v>

849
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:22.881
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

850
00:25:22.881 --> 00:25:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Because if you really allow yourself a few can act,</v>

851
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.301
<v Speaker 1>you got to add.</v>

852
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with people is not recognizing the enemy.</v>

853
00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.200
<v Speaker 1>It's acting on that enemy.</v>

854
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem.</v>

855
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.440
<v Speaker 1>And that enemy being,</v>

856
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

857
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:34.221
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>

858
00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:35.210
<v Speaker 1>your personal demons,</v>

859
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:35.361
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

860
00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:36.860
<v Speaker 1>your personal jihad,</v>

861
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a personal issue.</v>

862
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.540
<v Speaker 1>You got to fight the beast and it's,</v>

863
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.050
<v Speaker 1>and you know what I mean?</v>

864
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:43.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody's beast is different.</v>

865
00:25:43.461 --> 00:25:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Chapter two of the Bhagavad Gita,</v>

866
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.520
<v Speaker 1>arginase dejection arginine has drawn between these two forces.</v>

867
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 1>He does not want to fight.</v>

868
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>He drops his bow and God says to him,</v>

869
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you've got rise to the fight.</v>

870
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

871
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.560
<v Speaker 1>You're a warrior.</v>

872
00:25:57.561 --> 00:25:58.970
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're here for.</v>

873
00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.953
<v Speaker 1>Fight,</v>

874
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:00.531
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

875
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:00.980
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

876
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 1>it's better to die.</v>

877
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 1>It's better to die in a righteous battle.</v>

878
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Then goes skulking off into the fucking woods and be a beggar.</v>

879
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.330
<v Speaker 1>It's better to fucking do what you do on your award or you got to fucking do it,</v>

880
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:11.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

881
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.830
<v Speaker 1>It fucking sucks.</v>

882
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.390
<v Speaker 1>When when you're drunk and you want to throw up and you try to not make yourself</v>

883
00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:18.224
<v Speaker 1>throw up,</v>

884
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.370
<v Speaker 1>just throw up.</v>

885
00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.720
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel better.</v>

886
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.920
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel better in the end.</v>

887
00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 1>When you're puking it's going to suck because you're helpless and you can't</v>

888
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 1>breathe.</v>

889
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:25.551
<v Speaker 1>Go through it,</v>

890
00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:26.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

891
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Fucking jab a fucking knife into the fuck.</v>

892
00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Not Literally of course,</v>

893
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

894
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 1>you got to act and you got to make the big fucking decisions sometimes and it's</v>

895
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:34.154
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>

896
00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.390
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't scary,</v>

897
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:36.410
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be worth anything.</v>

898
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

899
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.810
<v Speaker 1>For some people it's almost like they don't know how to start the,</v>

900
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 1>they know that there's actions that need to take in their life,</v>

901
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 1>but they're paralyzed trying to think about it,</v>

902
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.290
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to start and they can never gather up the courage to</v>

903
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:49.930
<v Speaker 1>get away.</v>

904
00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

905
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:50.611
<v Speaker 1>what's not.</v>

906
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people stay in abusive relationships.</v>

907
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

908
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.820
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the courage to leave.</v>

909
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.601
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

910
00:26:54.601 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's scary and it in it and it seems like it,</v>

911
00:26:57.001 --> 00:26:57.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

912
00:26:57.361 --> 00:27:00.870
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things that people will like w ideas people will create.</v>

913
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.160
<v Speaker 1>They'll keep you trapped.</v>

914
00:27:02.161 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 1>And whenever prisoner,</v>

915
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 1>it's very similar to um,</v>

916
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>

917
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

918
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.050
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about in the UFC with these fucking fighters,</v>

919
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.800
<v Speaker 1>this is a visual representation of what anyone can do in their life.</v>

920
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:14.670
<v Speaker 1>But you mean you're not getting,</v>

921
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:17.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe not all of us are going to get obviously be worldclass fighters.</v>

922
00:27:17.871 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 1>They get in a ring in front of the entire planet and fucking knock someone out.</v>

923
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 1>But you have in your life right now,</v>

924
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:26.730
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't already done this,</v>

925
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.650
<v Speaker 1>is you have the chance to be heroic.</v>

926
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.510
<v Speaker 1>You have the ability right now to make a heroic act.</v>

927
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 1>They could kill you.</v>

928
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

929
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.451
<v Speaker 1>these actions,</v>

930
00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not always guaranteed that because you do the right thing,</v>

931
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.890
<v Speaker 1>you're going to end up in a great place.</v>

932
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.390
<v Speaker 1>You might end up fucked.</v>

933
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.290
<v Speaker 1>You might end up,</v>

934
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you might end up temporarily and a homeless or you might end up temporarily</v>

935
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 1>jobless.</v>

936
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.520
<v Speaker 1>If there wasn't risk associated with it,</v>

937
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.110
<v Speaker 1>you would have already done it.</v>

938
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.183
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>

939
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:53.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

940
00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't risk associated with,</v>

941
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be worth anything.</v>

942
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:56.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

943
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:57.750

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 1>if the Himalayas where you know,</v>

947
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.410
<v Speaker 1>a little green grass covered hill in a park,</v>

948
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.060
<v Speaker 1>nobody takes pictures of them at the top.</v>

949
00:28:07.061 --> 00:28:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Budding a flag into what is a danger.</v>

950
00:28:08.971 --> 00:28:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Makes it heroic.</v>

951
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.041
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

952
00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes you just have to fucking,</v>

953
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I sound like Tony Robbins.</v>

954
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Take the leap.</v>

955
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Kill the vampire in your life till the vamp on you love is a brilliance.</v>

956
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.121
<v Speaker 1>Preach,</v>

957

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:20.703
<v Speaker 1>you're dead right.</v>

960
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you fucking kill that vampire,</v>

961
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.480
<v Speaker 1>if you survive,</v>

962
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.540
<v Speaker 1>flowers will rain from heaven.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How's your bloom?</v>

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Everybody can get better.</v>

966
00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:32.730
<v Speaker 1>We can all over their eyes and move forward.</v>

967
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.500
<v Speaker 1>But you've got to be positive as fuck.</v>

968
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Don't be convinced that you have anything figured out.</v>

969
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.870
