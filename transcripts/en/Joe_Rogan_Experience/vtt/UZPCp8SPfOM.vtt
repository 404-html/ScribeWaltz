00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>This is episode nine slash 11 in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.841
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

8
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:20.674
<v Speaker 1>I had a fucking work hard all week to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grind out podcast to make sure that I </v>

9
00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.920
<v Speaker 1>hit episode nine slash 11 when we booked</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

10
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I knew how I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain number of podcast I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do to get this to nine slash 11.</v>

12
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>So Jane and I worked it out and we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

13
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Let me just say I'm very envious because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my studio under bright lights and</v>

14
00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about going back to when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just on radio that darkness,</v>

15
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>we can really think this is a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio.</v>

16
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do a studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My next one with a fire pit.</v>

17
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.473
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have conversations outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to about that because it's </v>

18
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>like primitive.</v>

19
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It triggers now and that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>comforting.</v>

20
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>It feels good and it's kind of cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>lighting.</v>

21
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>So that's the next studio we build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to build a fire pit,</v>

22
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.460
<v Speaker 1>going to get some log,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some actual real fire.</v>

23
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.040
<v Speaker 1>You can only do that like certain times </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the year in la though.</v>

24
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Like when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they have fire season,</v>

25
00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:08.854
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let you do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will usually have like a little </v>

26
00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:11.434
<v Speaker 1>balcony or like a little outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>courtyard with your fire pit and you </v>

27
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.181
<v Speaker 1>Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

28
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a real fire pit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.880
<v Speaker 1>like I feel like if you're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fire pit with sharing bonfire,</v>

30
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.013
<v Speaker 1>you should have an actual law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should move to Hawaii part of the </v>

31
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.803
<v Speaker 1>year and I will too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll just have a big fire in </v>

32
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>the jungle and create a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>renaissance.</v>

33
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Just what we're talking Donald Trump.</v>

34
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Helicopter secretly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secretly he thinks that that could fix a</v>

35
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:37.780
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could fix a lot with that.</v>

36
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I was showing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like a decorated a correspondent for</v>

37

38
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.810

<v Speaker 1>We'll verify the bureau and stuff,</v>

42
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>but that's just part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you're,</v>

43
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.830

<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>

44
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>resurgence of America.</v>

<v Speaker 1>bringing people together.</v>

50
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.393
<v Speaker 1>The opposite of what MSM said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening is mainstream media is </v>

51
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 1>literally almost dead.</v>

56
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 1>a month and 20 million on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for Info wars it's similar numbers.</v>

57
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a good week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty dollars million.</v>

58
00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:32.974
<v Speaker 1>We've had as many as 85 million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen on radio and tune into videos in </v>

59
00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>one week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was election week,</v>

60
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:40.180
<v Speaker 1>but our normal 40 something million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy.</v>

61
00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:42.250
<v Speaker 1>How can they compete with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still delusional.</v>

62
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 1>They advert CNN show is like a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewers.</v>

63
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Fox things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the big swinging deck.</v>

64
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 1>It's got $3 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

65
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.903
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people transmitting and broadcasting to </v>

66
00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>geriatric homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>where you see Fox News and CNN and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nursing homes,</v>

68
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see with kids 10 years old,</v>

69
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>10 years old at the college and beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rogan experience</v>

70
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>and it's infowars and it's always other </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

71
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

72
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.234
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird time as an NBA teams like </v>
<v Speaker 2>those shows where you have to tune in </v>

73
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 2>from eight to nine and you have to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the commercials.</v>

74
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.863
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of all gone away because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dvrs because now people will just have </v>

75
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 2>to wait a few minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could dvr through all the commercials</v>

76
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 2>or you record things after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have ever.</v>

77
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 2>You'd like 15 years ago saying the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet killed television.</v>

78
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.533
<v Speaker 2>They haven't announced that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Watch it's going to kill it because </v>

79
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 2>how can they compete with what you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do on the Internet?</v>

80
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.453
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy getting screwed by a horse or </v>

81
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.393
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the hell can you compete with all </v>

82
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 2>this craziness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the guy in China?</v>

<v Speaker 2>this dude.</v>

89
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.310

<v Speaker 2>When a tiger sees you,</v>

117
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>you're in my territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill you.</v>

118
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiger is a totally different beast.</v>

119
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.783
<v Speaker 2>Like tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they'll like adopt another </v>

120
00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:11.624
<v Speaker 2>little animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a wild dog or something like would </v>

121
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:14.124
<v Speaker 2>be licking on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Knife to it and tell them what to </v>

122
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.611
<v Speaker 2>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:20.611
<v Speaker 2>The d word stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember the only way you could see this</v>

124
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>before is with those animal attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>

125
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Remember those animals know we started </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way.</v>

126
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.943
<v Speaker 2>They always start off with a dog attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dog attacking a mailman and Iguanas </v>

127
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:32.644
<v Speaker 2>out attacked your leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it slowly ends up with drunk </v>

128
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:42.121
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans at a Rodeo on a wild bull with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a rope and those bulls are smart as hell</v>

129
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:45.754
<v Speaker 2>and they drag them these drunk Mexicans </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they dragged their heads along the </v>

130
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 2>rails and just crushed these dudes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the railing.</v>

131
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Like some serious brain trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

132
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>vicious brain trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need one</v>

133
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>word it with just 100 percent of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was the most exciting shit.</v>

134
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.853
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck is TV getting compete with </v>

135
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're saying.</v>

136
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't compete.</v>

137
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:08.474
<v Speaker 1>So that was kind of wrong though because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix is tv and it's also the </v>

138
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like both things.</v>

139
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.043
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's forcing the power of Hollywood </v>

140
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>basically dispersed though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Well they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

142
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

143
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>it's better if it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

144
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>if the ability to get your workout gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>to more people.</v>

145
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:26.414
<v Speaker 1>It's better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better if anybody can do like the </v>

146
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>new competition in these new youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>

147
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.693
<v Speaker 1>like all they have to do is stand in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a camera and this zero </v>

148
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>production value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have.</v>

149
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a camera,</v>

150
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>you've got an Internet connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a youtube show.</v>

151
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:38.624
<v Speaker 1>People find you interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you've got millions and </v>

152
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>millions of subscribers.</v>

153
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie was bringing up this fact for your</v>

154
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>audience up front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of MSM lies and says,</v>

155
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:46.994
<v Speaker 1>I'm this big right wing guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you guys know that I was really </v>

156
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:49.934
<v Speaker 1>against George w Bush all you where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were arrested early on in the Bush </v>

157
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:54.490
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when,</v>

158
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.483
<v Speaker 1>when we first became friends in 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were running around the White House </v>

159
00:06:59.211 --> 00:06:59.961
<v Speaker 1>are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

160
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>the state capital lawn with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

161
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 1>with George Bush junior and senior masks</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

162
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.683
<v Speaker 1>And you were always again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure the bush supported trump is the </v>

163
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>entire power structure of the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Vatican,</v>

164
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>the communist Chinese or Saudi Arabians </v>
<v Speaker 1>all put money in and said,</v>

165
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 1>stop him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop him.</v>

166
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.893
<v Speaker 1>And then lives that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians were giving him money with </v>

167
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:20.024
<v Speaker 1>no proof and so the issue is he's simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to actually be president and not </v>

168
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:24.104
<v Speaker 1>have special interest in their running </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and that's why the whole power </v>

169
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>structure is against trump.</v>

170
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>So Andy was asking before we went live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

171
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 1>how is it you're this outside guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the establishment,</v>

172
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>but now you're for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

173
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 1>trump's trying to create a beachhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just to explain it,</v>

174
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.943
<v Speaker 1>to try to take the country back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually devolve power back to the </v>

175
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 1>states and back to the people doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean he's perfect,</v>

176
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>but notice the stock market went up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion,</v>

177
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:45.110
<v Speaker 1>$200,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

178
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.043
<v Speaker 1>just the last month or so because a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of institutional investors and others </v>

179
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>understand what trump is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create real prosperity,</v>

180
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>not a bunch of social engineering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to pitch trump to people.</v>

181
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.933
<v Speaker 1>The issue is is that there were major </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence agencies and and patriots </v>

182
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:02.520
<v Speaker 1>and the government who were sick of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was happening and we're sick of,</v>

183
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>of of Hillary and Obama backing jihadist</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

184
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.623
<v Speaker 1>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're rolling those groups up </v>

185
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really are standing up against them</v>

186
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.473
<v Speaker 1>and this is a historic moment and and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a counter-coup through the </v>

187
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 1>electoral process in our country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what wikileaks was.</v>

188
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.660
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was US intelligence agencies.</v>

189
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 1>I said two months ago that Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Winter in New York,</v>

190
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who might have a dean's husband,</v>

191
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>the former congressman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a that was working for Hillary.</v>

192
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.530
<v Speaker 1>I said that he's under investigation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>child porn.</v>

193
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.783
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then now it came out yesterday that </v>

194
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at indicting him for </v>
<v Speaker 1>child porn.</v>

195
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 1>While I had that from the NYP that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out yesterday.</v>

196
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would,</v>

197
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>what did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had something on his computer.</v>

198
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Well now that they won't tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was told that tied into that whole</v>

199
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>pizzagate thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>

200
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 1>the media misrepresented what we said </v>
<v Speaker 1>and did.</v>

201
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It came out and all those wiki leaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these weird coats.</v>

202
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.083
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a bunch of weird codes </v>

203
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:59.651
<v Speaker 1>about pizza and about a piece of pizza </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Obama wants $65,000</v>

204
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>in hot dogs delivered and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are these really good hot dogs?</v>

205
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Hot dogs weren't as good last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

206
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:08.680
<v Speaker 1>these are succulent on dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not about kids.</v>

207
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

208
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>what is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's male prostitutes.</v>

209
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the code means really?</v>

210
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

211
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:15.864
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they get male prostitutes to see </v>

212
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>keep your fucking mouth shut?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

213
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad things happen if you don't.</v>

214
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Federal Child Porn charges possible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Wiener.</v>

215
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm on record months ago.</v>

216
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.533
<v Speaker 1>I'm on record months ago saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case because I had those </v>

217
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:31.404
<v Speaker 1>sources and show the government good </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of the government know what's </v>

218
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:35.544
<v Speaker 1>really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the media that Mesh misrepresented </v>

219
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look at four Chan,</v>

220
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about a thing called </v>
<v Speaker 1>pizzagate and some pizza place in DC and</v>

221
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>the media looks at it and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

222
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones is claiming all this bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff's happening at this pizza place.</v>

223
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

224
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.773
<v Speaker 1>So they divert some probably innocent </v>
<v Speaker 1>pizza place to distract off of all the </v>

225
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Speaker 1>emails that the New York police have and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FBI have.</v>

226
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>That's just this monstrous reported </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedophile network.</v>

227
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.943
<v Speaker 1>So to just credit that they could create</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fake story hoping we jump on it to </v>

228
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 1>then divert over to that story and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>once we're on that,</v>

229
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.690
<v Speaker 1>it diverts everybody off from Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wiener,</v>

230
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 1>what hats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which reportedly,</v>

231
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 1>which leads reportedly to a larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

232
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>So they're playing that far ahead so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

233
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:16.224
<v Speaker 1>they're literally attacking a pizza </v>
<v Speaker 1>place with fake stories just so that </v>

234
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 1>people can focus on that and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention off.</v>

235
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Wiener.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

236
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:23.754
<v Speaker 1>because I was connected to that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was connected to Podesta stuff in </v>

237
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:29.970
<v Speaker 1>deceased or in New York and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other crazy stuff.</v>

238
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:30.804
<v Speaker 1>So I love saying because we're making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of like long sentences here and a </v>

239
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 1>lot of long statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>

240
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 1>let's fear a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

241
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is pizza gate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this Ben Swan guy who did this</v>

242
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.950
<v Speaker 1>recent piece about it and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people got very angry.</v>

243
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the piece?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the piece that he did?</v>

244
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.120
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to me to be pretty measured </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was making some connections too,</v>

245
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.090
<v Speaker 1>between that little symbol for child </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedophilia.</v>

246
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

247
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>we're just pedophilia era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

248
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>And the logo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logo for the pizza place,</v>

249
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.523
<v Speaker 1>he also made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he make the hastert connection with </v>

250
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:04.224
<v Speaker 1>Podesta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastored a confirmed child molester and </v>

251
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>best buddies would pedesta and former </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker of the house.</v>

252
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.420
<v Speaker 1>And then you expand on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's,</v>

253
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>let's just do it step at a time because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really kind of important stuff.</v>

254
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's all 100 percent true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

255
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:17.443
<v Speaker 1>So it's true that hastert it's in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true that hastert is a known </v>

256
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:22.920
<v Speaker 1>pedophile that a judge called a serial </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedophile,</v>

257
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:23.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

258
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

259
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Is One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

260
00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 1>The Podesta was friends with hastert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 100 percent,</v>

261
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

262
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.280
<v Speaker 1>And then all this other stuff now </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes odd,</v>

263
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it become odd?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

264
00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 1>but if you say it's odd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it,</v>

265
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.223
<v Speaker 1>this bents one guy with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I thought was he was just kind of </v>

266
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 1>expressing what is weird about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

267
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And when he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got so much shit over it.</v>

268
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.493
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kinda shocked people were calling </v>

269
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:50.850
<v Speaker 1>him a moron and the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

270
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:52.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they build a straw man.</v>

271
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.653
<v Speaker 1>So imagine thousands of emails come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them talking about we'll have the </v>

272
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>kids ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>

273
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 1>seven and eight in the hot tub at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

274
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.740
<v Speaker 1>And there didn't see anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

275
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 1>it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets really weird.</v>

276
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Where did it say that it was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emails?</v>

277
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.833
<v Speaker 1>There's thousands of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it said we'll get the kids in the </v>

278
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:10.350
<v Speaker 1>hot tub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

279
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I never saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you?</v>

280
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Can you see if you could find that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

281
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 1>That seems like just the whole thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so bizarre.</v>

282
00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:18.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're going to have the kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered for entertainment.</v>

283
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:21.250
<v Speaker 1>There'll be in the hot tub now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are great kids,</v>

284
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 1>but kids can be kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know what's fucked up about it is how</v>

285
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>few people really mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to hastert.</v>

286
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that would be a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

287
00:12:29.501 --> 00:12:33.850
<v Speaker 1>constant Jonah love the fact that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very astute.</v>

288
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I just bring up this whole big topic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they twist things.</v>

289
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.660
<v Speaker 1>You go right to the key points that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

290
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.213
<v Speaker 1>Barney frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who got caught running a underage male </v>

291
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:50.911
<v Speaker 1>prostitute ring in the nineties out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his three story townhouse,</v>

292
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:52.384
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just a male prostitute </v>

293
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

294
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know somewhere and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but listen,</v>

295
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I was with them all the way up to age 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus or whatever,</v>

296
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 1>but then what happened is he goes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cspan on the house floor and says,</v>

297
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 1>if you continue to investigate this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to expose the half of you that</v>

298
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 1>are involved in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this room,</v>

299
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.480
<v Speaker 1>and the investigation got shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason this is important,</v>

300
00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:17.110
<v Speaker 1>as for shadow government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need something so bad that everybody</v>

301
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 1>who's involved in it ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever comes out will be destroyed.</v>

302
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.583
<v Speaker 1>So that binds them all to the secrecy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where child pornography comes </v>

303
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:25.654
<v Speaker 1>in and that's where pedophilia comes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where you get so many of the </v>

304
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>elite being into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just as you shed,</v>

305
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 1>you have the Republican establishment </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get mastered out of nowhere as</v>

306
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:36.730
<v Speaker 1>a wrestling coach to run for office.</v>

307
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Then reportedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the pure career.</v>

308
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.633
<v Speaker 1>Just like Penn state and just like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had something Dusky Dusky and the under </v>

309
00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:45.190
<v Speaker 1>age kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were quote mentoring,</v>

310
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 1>getting farmed out to supposedly big </v>
<v Speaker 1>donors.</v>

311
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.503
<v Speaker 1>What's this is who we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two very specific cases where two very </v>

312
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:54.010
<v Speaker 1>different cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's crazy is they're both real.</v>

313
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 1>It's both real 100 percent send Dusky </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a very respected man.</v>

314
00:13:58.301 --> 00:13:59.134
<v Speaker 1>The community did a lot of charity work </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a young disenfranchised children </v>

315
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.750
<v Speaker 1>and was molesting them at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was super respected in the community</v>

316
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:10.240
<v Speaker 1>and he was the right hand man to Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paterno.</v>

317
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.283
<v Speaker 1>So that whole thing just fell apart in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the headquarters from our research with </v>

318
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:15.950
<v Speaker 1>the pedophilia is like Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

319
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the Franklin cover and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

320
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.440
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's up in public.</v>

321
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.170
<v Speaker 1>What does this see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie says we plan to heat the pool,</v>

322
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:24.004
<v Speaker 1>so a possibly Bonnie will be uber </v>
<v Speaker 1>service to transport Ruby Emerson and </v>

323
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Mave Lozado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

324
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.440
<v Speaker 1>nine and almost seven.</v>

325
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.423
<v Speaker 1>So you'll have some further </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment and they will be in that </v>

326
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 1>pool for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck?</v>

327
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the only one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real confirmed emails.</v>

328
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

329
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.733
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

<v Speaker 1>start asking questions.</v>

345
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.660
<v Speaker 1>They then divert off into somebody on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortune for forum pointing out.</v>

346
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:36.650
<v Speaker 1>There was some email about a meeting at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some pizza place in DC.</v>

347
00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 1>We're top Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cow.</v>

348
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.000
<v Speaker 1>They then turned the whole thing into </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm blaming some pizza place.</v>

349
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm sending shooters into shoot people </v>

<v Speaker 1>never even said any of that,</v>

351
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>and then you go back to me two months </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

352
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 1>three months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

353
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:51.854
<v Speaker 1>the police have told me they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating wiener for pedophilia and </v>

354
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:57.710
<v Speaker 1>child porn when it was not in the news </v>
<v Speaker 1>now known as it's in the news.</v>

355
00:15:57.711 --> 00:15:58.544
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

356
00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Elise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow down.</v>

357
00:16:00.161 --> 00:16:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Before we get away from this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got to go back to that.</v>

358
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:02.803
<v Speaker 1>There was a quote up there that are that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie pull up that I wanted to read the </v>

359
00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:07.430
<v Speaker 1>one on the lower bottom about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this,</v>

360
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.443
<v Speaker 1>these are the emails that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about and these are 100 percent </v>

361
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.650
<v Speaker 1>confirmed emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that one.</v>

362
00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:14.970
<v Speaker 1>That was on the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scroll down to the.</v>

363
00:16:14.971 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying any of these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are guilty.</v>

364
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:17.564
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

365
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:19.643
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So six grownups with two toddlers and </v>

366
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:22.994
<v Speaker 1>two infants spread throughout the house </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sure enough one of the toddlers was </v>

367
00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:30.680
<v Speaker 1>rubbing my nose at 5:45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck does that mean?</v>

368
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.950
<v Speaker 1>The FBI as a whole got back to retrieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the children they threw in the towel and</v>

369
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.903
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

370
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.693
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

371
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.703
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck those emails </v>

372
00:16:44.761 --> 00:16:46.260
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

373
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.300
<v Speaker 1>let's just now everybody wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately shoe this away as disgusting</v>

374
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.293
<v Speaker 1>when possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about two very specific </v>

375
00:16:56.371 --> 00:16:57.670
<v Speaker 1>proven cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

376
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Hastert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proven Sandusky,</v>

377
00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:00.923
<v Speaker 1>proven real huge elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful people that were also active </v>

378
00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:05.580
<v Speaker 1>pedophiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

379
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a fact.</v>

380
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.213
<v Speaker 1>Who Know each other in our bodies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've got Podesta's brother who's </v>

381
00:17:11.311 --> 00:17:15.480
<v Speaker 1>big in Washington in an article in 2007 </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Washington Post.</v>

382
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>headline,</v>

383
00:17:17.251 --> 00:17:18.084
<v Speaker 1>which was something like a radical art </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something and it's like naked photos </v>

384
00:17:21.751 --> 00:17:22.584
<v Speaker 1>of the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids in their house and then they're </v>

385
00:17:25.141 --> 00:17:27.270
<v Speaker 1>showing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing it in your face.</v>

386
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:27.880
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

387
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not even stuff I get into but</v>

388
00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:31.164
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is something to that because </v>

389
00:17:32.101 --> 00:17:32.934
<v Speaker 1>some of his artwork was super disturbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had in his house like this pink </v>

390
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.030
<v Speaker 1>buckets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were there were in their underwear</v>

391
00:17:39.031 --> 00:17:39.864
<v Speaker 1>and it looked like they had been paddled</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were all standing there with </v>

392
00:17:41.701 --> 00:17:44.710
<v Speaker 1>their butts facing very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more about this than others.</v>

393
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.553
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all I do is cover these real </v>

394
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.490
<v Speaker 1>tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't give you the new nurse,</v>

395
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.000
<v Speaker 1>but that is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government pissed off about this.</v>

396
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.843
<v Speaker 3>The pedophile rings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've gotten so big that the </v>

397
00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:52.914
<v Speaker 3>intelligence agencies began to leak all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this info and I knew Hillary was </v>

398
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:56.514
<v Speaker 3>planning to steal the election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did steal five states according to </v>

399
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.030
<v Speaker 3>the experts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And briefly how did she do that?</v>

400
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:02.900
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't mean trying to break into six</v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

401
00:18:02.901 --> 00:18:03.734
<v Speaker 3>It's not go on these long rants where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of different statements </v>

402
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:09.090
<v Speaker 3>that need to be addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's just from right there,</v>

403
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:09.924
<v Speaker 3>you got to get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how did she steal five states can </v>

404
00:18:11.951 --> 00:18:14.230
<v Speaker 3>kind of gloss over that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

405
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she tried to.</v>

406
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.850
<v Speaker 3>How did she tried to steal six days?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did steal five states.</v>

407
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bev Harris was a big liberal Democrat at</v>

408
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:21.870
<v Speaker 3>the Hbo Documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hacking Democracy.</v>

409
00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.013
<v Speaker 3>She's the leading expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was actually a month before the </v>

410
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:26.484
<v Speaker 3>election through whistleblowers got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual code that had been loaded on </v>

411
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:33.560
<v Speaker 3>machines all across the country should </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever in studio to steal the election.</v>

412
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.613
<v Speaker 3>I saw hacking democracy and I saw that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they did engineer those voting machines </v>

413
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.950
<v Speaker 3>that you could have a third party input </v>
<v Speaker 3>and change it and that it on live on the</v>

414
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:43.590
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was a decade ago with Bush.</v>

415
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:44.770
<v Speaker 3>This is new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

416
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Just wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's the top election fraud expert.</v>

417
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.370
<v Speaker 3>So she comes on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

418
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.320
<v Speaker 3>the stories on infowars.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she says,</v>

419
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got evidence.</v>

420
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.983
<v Speaker 3>And then I had the hacking experts on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had the industry whistle blowers </v>

421
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:58.374
<v Speaker 3>on and I had the county officials on at </v>
<v Speaker 3>every level we have the fraud proven </v>

422
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.650
<v Speaker 3>that Democrat connected grips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're already loading code on a machines</v>

423
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 3>all over the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's different complex.</v>

424
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:07.614
<v Speaker 3>But about thing was 18 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines in the country to be able to </v>

425
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:10.883
<v Speaker 3>remotely break in and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and flip votes show because they were </v>

426
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:15.324
<v Speaker 3>aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of states were waiting and </v>

427
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:17.334
<v Speaker 3>watching and homeland security broken </v>
<v Speaker 3>live into six dates and kept trying to </v>

428
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:22.164
<v Speaker 3>flip the results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they even have screenshots and </v>

429
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:26.850
<v Speaker 3>videos of them in the computers in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>clicking and doing it all.</v>

430
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.710
<v Speaker 3>There's major investigations going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard the news,</v>

431
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.613
<v Speaker 3>trump's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He claims illegals voted to make it </v>

432
00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:32.604
<v Speaker 3>about illegals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one statement and a larger </v>

433
00:19:33.751 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 3>election fraud deal of actual computers </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

434
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:37.584
<v Speaker 3>So trump knows about all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she comes on and says they're </v>

435
00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:41.590
<v Speaker 3>planning this fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then she comes on after the election and</v>

436
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.181
<v Speaker 3>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

437
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.490
<v Speaker 3>it's clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's where precincts close.</v>

438
00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:45.324
<v Speaker 3>Here's where all this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where 100 percent went for Hillary or </v>

439
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:50.010
<v Speaker 3>right after it closed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the votes then came in.</v>

440
00:19:50.011 --> 00:19:52.260
<v Speaker 3>We're 100 percent for Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even care,</v>

441
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 3>but the landslide was so big for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't steal it.</v>

442
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:55.974
<v Speaker 3>She successfully stole five states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She tried to break into six others or </v>

443
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:00.234
<v Speaker 3>her controllers did and got blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tsunami for trump was so huge with </v>

444
00:20:05.551 --> 00:20:06.384
<v Speaker 3>the real politic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can break down later that they still </v>

445
00:20:07.921 --> 00:20:08.754
<v Speaker 3>weren't able to steal it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now patriots inside US intelligence </v>

446
00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:15.060
<v Speaker 3>agencies are preparing to roll up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pedophile networks nationwide.</v>

447
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.970
<v Speaker 3>So you've seen arrest in Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrested in La.</v>

448
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.290
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen these arrests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's getting there?</v>

449
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:21.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just now breaking and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

450
00:20:21.401 --> 00:20:24.010
<v Speaker 3>It's big institutionalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred 74 arrests,</v>

451
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.863
<v Speaker 3>28 sexually exploited children rescued </v>
<v Speaker 3>during statewide human traffic </v>

452
00:20:27.901 --> 00:20:29.600
<v Speaker 3>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're getting mentally,</v>

453
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 3>she has a takeover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

454
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at the numbers.</v>

455
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:33.954
<v Speaker 3>They're 474 people arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are only rolling up the rin </v>

456
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:42.050
<v Speaker 3>fields that get the people for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychic vampires know insane.</v>

457
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Is it that this is still happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

458
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.200
<v Speaker 3>So all the people that thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea that,</v>

459
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 3>you know what</v>

460
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they tried to make it ridiculous</v>

461
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:52.270
<v Speaker 1>by calling a pizza gate are connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a pizza place.</v>

462
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Everybody that thought that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

463
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.263
<v Speaker 1>It is ridiculous that there could </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially be some sort of a pedophile </v>

464
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 1>ring and see how they tricked Turkish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go pick some pizza place.</v>

465
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Probably have their people go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make comments on some message board.</v>

466
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 1>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York Times,</v>

467
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:08.614
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post the same day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out and say all the emails are </v>

468
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:16.030
<v Speaker 1>discredited from New York and California</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hawaii because there's this innocent</v>

469
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:16.864
<v Speaker 1>pizza place over here that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats go to and they're all saying </v>

470
00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:22.060
<v Speaker 1>that's where the pedophiles are at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

471
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:27.020
<v Speaker 1>so then the Internet all goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at that and starts trying to prove</v>

472
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.600
<v Speaker 1>to disprove msm that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

473
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:32.380
<v Speaker 1>there must be something going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then that turns that all into the big</v>

474
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:33.214
<v Speaker 1>quagmire as a smokescreen from all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted stuff that's happening because </v>

475
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:36.963
<v Speaker 1>I was told by my Nyp d high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources that they've got all this stuff </v>

476
00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:41.404
<v Speaker 1>on wieners computer that just got </v>
<v Speaker 1>scooped up during the whole hacking </v>

477
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.653
<v Speaker 1>story and the whole story about Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the unsecured servers and that that </v>

478
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:52.840
<v Speaker 1>was being blocked by Obama and that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as trump got in,</v>

479
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 1>they would go back after winter.</v>

480
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.473
<v Speaker 1>Then I was told about former section </v>
<v Speaker 1>chief from the CIA that indeed this was </v>

481
00:21:58.541 --> 00:22:01.090
<v Speaker 1>an operation that we're running against </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to start leaking all this.</v>

482
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.283
<v Speaker 1>And so what you're beginning to see is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of all the pedophilia </v>

483
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:05.524
<v Speaker 1>coming out as they roll up the procurers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that grabbed your kids out of backyards </v>

484
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.050
<v Speaker 1>or that go out as social workers and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids or whatever.</v>

485
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.770
<v Speaker 1>They're rolling all those up right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the renfield.</v>

486
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Renfield brings the people to Dracula </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the allegory.</v>

487
00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:17.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know what you're saying.</v>

488
00:22:17.661 --> 00:22:18.494
<v Speaker 1>So they're gonna now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roll it up into the higher level groups </v>

489
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:21.663
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's going on with a lot of </v>

490
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:24.064
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be real careful in how you </v>

491
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:26.644
<v Speaker 1>describe these things and how you talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about these things because people are </v>

492
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:29.764
<v Speaker 1>looking for any little tiny thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discredit it and one of the reasons why </v>

493
00:22:32.861 --> 00:22:33.694
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it for personal reasons </v>

494
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.130
<v Speaker 1>because it seems you no one wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

495
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.023
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to be a fool and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be someone who's talking about </v>

496
00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:43.414
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies that aren't real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people are very hesitant to talk </v>

497
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 1>about something that's unproven but </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>

498
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:50.973
<v Speaker 1>Just like 15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a conspiracy theory that the </v>

499
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Catholic Church had any pedophelic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know 30,</v>

500
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.943
<v Speaker 1>30 percent we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We now know the old pope had to step </v>

501
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:02.104
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was blackmailed within fall about other </v>

502
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:05.890
<v Speaker 1>high level preached by the new guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>came in.</v>

503
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is heavy.</v>

504
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:08.590
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

505
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.423
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic church stuff is absolutely </v>

506
00:23:10.841 --> 00:23:13.270
<v Speaker 1>horrible and proven over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

507
00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:14.680
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was rumor,</v>

508
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.380
<v Speaker 1>it was just things that were whispered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would hear about it.</v>

509
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.273
<v Speaker 1>And now it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wondered how they're getting </v>

510
00:23:19.811 --> 00:23:21.250
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so out in the open.</v>

511
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:22.084
<v Speaker 1>How come there isn't more of a psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>vampire stealing the energy from the </v>

512
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:25.541
<v Speaker 1>kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

513
00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>what the most common thing they do find </v>
<v Speaker 1>very often in jail,</v>

514
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.263
<v Speaker 1>the most common thing they do is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>find very troubled kids that don't talk </v>

515
00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:35.380
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People with foster care,</v>

516
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.483
<v Speaker 1>kids with no parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids who come from really troubled </v>

517
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.530
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds who were abused like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandusky,</v>

518
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.020
<v Speaker 1>ran a abused children's shelter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grove</v>

519
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.680
<v Speaker 3>and then would take the kids out </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes overnight.</v>

520
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:50.660
<v Speaker 3>It rich people's houses to make them </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel better.</v>

521
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

522
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.783
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then no one wants to believe that </v>

523
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:57.350
<v Speaker 3>the is that the assistant coach and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these powerful people.</v>

524
00:23:57.351 --> 00:23:58.184
<v Speaker 3>But when he finally got caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was raping eight year olds in the </v>

525
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.350
<v Speaker 3>showers at noon on a Saturday at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>field house.</v>

526
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And someone who worked there,</v>

527
00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:08.830
<v Speaker 3>found it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watched it happen,</v>

528
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.870
<v Speaker 3>walked in on them literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it all fell apart.</v>

529
00:24:12.871 --> 00:24:15.230
<v Speaker 3>And that's what always happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys get more and more arrogant.</v>

530
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:16.064
<v Speaker 3>And so all I'm telling you is I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying anybody's guilty and these </v>

531
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:18.374
<v Speaker 3>thousands of emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go read them and it's like the last </v>

532
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:22.940
<v Speaker 3>walnut sauce you brought wasn't very </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

533
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well these are good walnuts.</v>

534
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:25.731

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

535
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:26.564
<v Speaker 3>I love walnuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you go read in the FBI </v>

536
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.810
<v Speaker 3>breakdown what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's code for.</v>

537
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 3>What's called for Walnut means people </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Brown skin.</v>

538
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

539
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.123
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gunderson was talking about this for </v>

540
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>FBI chief formula.</v>

541
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.490
<v Speaker 3>He discovered a bunch of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

542
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.590
<v Speaker 3>in Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

543
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.620
<v Speaker 3>he was the head of the La Sector.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people are gonna hear this.</v>

544
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:46.051
<v Speaker 3>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

545
00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:48.860

<v Speaker 3>These guys are a bunch of pizza.</v>

546
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Great Truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

547
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.483
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an inclination to automatically </v>

548
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 3>dismiss things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me be clear,</v>

549
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.100
<v Speaker 3>let me be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am on the covering 50 topics a day.</v>

550
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.263
<v Speaker 3>These emails are coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get contact with one of my sources by </v>

551
00:25:03.321 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 3>people in the NYP ed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get sent documents,</v>

552
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 3>photos of their licensed law </v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcement.</v>

553
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.130
<v Speaker 3>I talked to these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they say,</v>

554
00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:10.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

555
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of pedophilia.</v>

556
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

557
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:14.150

<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

558
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.250
<v Speaker 3>it's a bunch of child porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all gonna come out.</v>

559
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Speaker 3>It's tied to all these different groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just like,</v>

560
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.490
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

561

<v Speaker 3>sources.</v>

563
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.003
<v Speaker 3>And then Erik Prince of Blackwater still</v>
<v Speaker 3>rests with the biggest groups in the </v>

564
00:25:28.971 --> 00:25:29.804
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

567
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:37.740

568
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.640
<v Speaker 3>is that the UAE can ask you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows all about it.</v>

569
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:41.474

<v Speaker 3>is that all this happens and he comes </v>

<v Speaker 3>out in the news.</v>

00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:50.690
<v Speaker 3>breitbart basically from trump's mouth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and says,</v>

573
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:51.763
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've confirmed high level pedophilia </v>

575
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.623

<v Speaker 3>Why did Breitbart tweet about that in </v>

576
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 3>2011?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know how he died.</v>

585
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:13.960
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought he died of a heart attack.</v>

00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:31.641
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like every.</v>

597

598
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

599
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.740
<v Speaker 3>You're already telling me people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this to kids.</v>

600
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:44.020
<v Speaker 3>You don't get the fuck out</v>

601
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:44.940
<v Speaker 1>of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense,</v>

602
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>but when you tell people about the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been proven,</v>

603
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.180
<v Speaker 1>the ones that have their own account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't call.</v>

604
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 1>They don't attach those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on Air Shang.</v>

605
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:54.354
<v Speaker 1>I'm told this by NYP ed in like three </v>
<v Speaker 1>different shows and that there's going </v>

606
00:26:57.361 --> 00:26:58.194
<v Speaker 1>to come out that leaner sending child </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn and it's in the news today what </v>

607
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:01.674
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're accusing Wiener of </v>

608
00:27:02.541 --> 00:27:07.140
<v Speaker 1>apparently sending sexually explicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>text to an underage girl.</v>

609
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what's against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the calling the child porn,</v>

610
00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:14.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's essentially he was sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornographic text to a 15 year old.</v>

611
00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:15.684
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I was told it's a lot more than </v>

612
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:17.124
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is minimizing it </v>

613
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:21.750
<v Speaker 1>because the higher ups are being told </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't let this out.</v>

614
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.543
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wiener supposedly had tens of thousands </v>

615
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:26.394

666
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.410
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Came down here.</v>

667
00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:58.411
<v Speaker 5>He likes the world sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We listening to his manager.</v>

668
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.940
<v Speaker 4>That's super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That first of all,</v>

669
00:30:18.941 --> 00:30:21.160
<v Speaker 4>does Comet Ping Pong?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody listening?</v>

670
00:30:21.161 --> 00:30:22.750
<v Speaker 4>Let's describe what that person looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

671
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.900
<v Speaker 4>They were wearing a wig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a blonde wig,</v>

672
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:30.901
<v Speaker 4>and it was a guy transvestite or a woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's just smoked every cigarette.</v>

673
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.820
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

674
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.010
<v Speaker 4>this is the fact that that was going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>at that place.</v>

675
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:42.010
<v Speaker 4>Seems really odd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that sounds like someone ad libbing,</v>

676
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all have preferences.</v>

677
00:30:44.601 --> 00:30:47.510
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's almost like in the,</v>

678
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.250
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the little boy.</v>

679
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of creepy artwork and I'll talk to</v>

680
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.960
<v Speaker 4>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lot of creepy artwork.</v>

681
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a fact.</v>

682
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.683
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's one of those things are not </v>

683
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.720
<v Speaker 4>saying that I'm not either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's really important.</v>

684
00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:05.883
<v Speaker 4>I never even really covered this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they had me on the news and </v>

685
00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 4>also swan going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said these people were killing kids</v>

686
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 4>in a basement.</v>

687
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.410
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

688
00:31:13.411 --> 00:31:14.244
<v Speaker 4>I'm Megan Kelly went on and took a clip </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I was talking about Hillary show </v>

689
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.113
<v Speaker 4>funding jihadis and and Obama back in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Arab spring that killed tens of </v>

690
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 4>thousands of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of thousands of people,</v>

691
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 4>thousands of children now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Al Qaeda was putting kids,</v>

692
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:28.420
<v Speaker 4>which is Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into sex slavery.</v>

693
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:33.250
<v Speaker 4>They edited that out and then cut it </v>
<v Speaker 4>together on Fox News with me.</v>

694
00:31:33.251 --> 00:31:34.084
<v Speaker 4>Shane and Hillary Clinton ranks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kills children in a basement at ping </v>

695
00:31:36.911 --> 00:31:39.700
<v Speaker 4>pong pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They literally now edit audio,</v>

696
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.530
<v Speaker 4>but I was able to get changed your </v>
<v Speaker 4>audio.</v>

697
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.423
<v Speaker 4>I was able to go find the day with video</v>
<v Speaker 4>with what I really said and throw it </v>

698
00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:47.740
<v Speaker 4>back in their face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

699
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:49.320
<v Speaker 4>That's really blatant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what.</v>

700
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.650
<v Speaker 4>Where's this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we watch this?</v>

701
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 4>Where?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where is this that they did that?</v>

702
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 4>You guys have to come the comparison of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the two up?</v>

703
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.353
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like Megan Kelly caught </v>

704
00:31:57.051 --> 00:31:58.510
<v Speaker 4>at giant lie against Alex show.</v>

705
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:02.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to find that we should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should play that fast.</v>

706
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.760
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Megan Kelly,</v>

707
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:04.594
<v Speaker 4>so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She could say whatever the fuck she </v>

708
00:32:05.171 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 4>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she looks like an old training.</v>

709
00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 4>I love her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do things loosely.</v>

710
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:10.870
<v Speaker 4>An old training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're hilarious.</v>

711
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like old trainings,</v>

712
00:32:13.211 --> 00:32:14.560
<v Speaker 4>but I think she's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

713
00:32:14.561 --> 00:32:17.590
<v Speaker 4>like you don't think Meghan Kelly's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I just want to insult this globalist</v>

714
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.660
<v Speaker 4>global.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously she's pretty.</v>

715
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:21.220
<v Speaker 4>Do you know Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's real ugly.</v>

716
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.470
<v Speaker 4>She.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that she was.</v>

717
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.313
<v Speaker 4>She's moved over to NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think she's going to change your </v>

718
00:32:24.791 --> 00:32:25.624
<v Speaker 4>tune now and go for the little niece?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wants to be the quote New Fox News </v>

719
00:32:28.421 --> 00:32:30.220
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll be the near kind of Glenn Beck.</v>

720
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.233
<v Speaker 4>I'm a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I hate conservatives and </v>

721
00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:36.190
<v Speaker 4>Libertarians and I speak for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I can decode it all so she shouldn't</v>

722
00:32:36.191 --> 00:32:39.260
<v Speaker 4>go over there and be the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 4>light and try to get them some ratings.</v>

723
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 4>So it seems</v>

724
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 3>like NBC realized is that's where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

725
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:42.953
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to see how fake news is made from </v>

726
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Meghan Kelly on Fox News?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you find it Jeremy?</v>

727
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's play it here.</v>

728
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give us some volume.</v>

729
00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.280
<v Speaker 3>This whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Pizza Gate conspiracy gun man.</v>

730
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.180
<v Speaker 6>Many controversies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do these days,</v>

731
00:32:57.181 --> 00:32:58.014
<v Speaker 6>it began with a tweet on October 30th </v>
<v Speaker 6>days after the FBI announced they'd be </v>

732
00:33:02.131 --> 00:33:05.730
<v Speaker 6>reopening and investigation into Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 6>Clinton's emails.</v>

733
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:06.773
<v Speaker 6>Someone on twitter who's name remains </v>
<v Speaker 6>unverified but has several thousand </v>

734
00:33:10.441 --> 00:33:11.274
<v Speaker 6>followers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>posted that new emails found on Anthony </v>

735
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.233
<v Speaker 6>Wiener's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Computer confirmed that Hillary Clinton </v>

736
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:17.933
<v Speaker 6>was involved in a pedophilia ring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The twitter post included information </v>

737
00:33:22.171 --> 00:33:24.330
<v Speaker 6>from a facebook user who stated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

738
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:28.650
<v Speaker 6>my Nyp dea source said it's much more </v>
<v Speaker 6>viable and serious.</v>

739
00:33:28.651 --> 00:33:31.380
<v Speaker 6>Then classified material on wieners </v>
<v Speaker 6>device.</v>

740
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.040
<v Speaker 6>We're talking in international child </v>
<v Speaker 6>enslavement and sex room.</v>

741
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:36.373
<v Speaker 6>The next day.</v>

742
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Places shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but backing up to the second now,</v>

743
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.283
<v Speaker 3>this is probably trying to debunk us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they do is they misrepresent what </v>

744
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:43.280
<v Speaker 3>we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>

745
00:33:43.281 --> 00:33:46.640
<v Speaker 3>whoever these rogue people were or or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know who they are saying,</v>

746
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.503
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look in ypd says it's wiener and all </v>

747
00:33:48.771 --> 00:33:49.830
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She highly,</v>

748
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 3>we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of that's happening now.</v>

749
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 3>It's actually starting to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how far,</v>

750
00:33:53.691 --> 00:33:56.090
<v Speaker 3>how deep it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is when Kelly,</v>

751
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:58.280
<v Speaker 3>let's let it play out and respond to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards.</v>

752
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.153
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna.</v>

753
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:01.303
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>

754
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.300
<v Speaker 6>This is the right one book user who </v>
<v Speaker 6>stated,</v>

755
00:34:03.301 --> 00:34:04.134
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my Nyp dea source said it's much more </v>

<v Speaker 6>material on wieners device.</v>

757
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:15.630
<v Speaker 6>We're talking in international child </v>
<v Speaker 6>enslavement and sex ring the next day.</v>

758
00:34:15.631 --> 00:34:20.490
<v Speaker 6>The bogus claim was picked up by a </v>
<v Speaker 6>website called your newswire.com</v>

759
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.533

<v Speaker 6>Afar right web host posted a youtube </v>

762
00:34:32.071 --> 00:34:35.040

<v Speaker 2>I have zero fear Kenny up against you.</v>

764
00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:47.643
<v Speaker 6>The rumor spread,</v>
<v Speaker 6>inspiring some new found Internet </v>

765
00:34:50.231 --> 00:34:54.030
<v Speaker 6>sleuths to start digging around in John </v>
<v Speaker 6>Podesta's hacked emails,</v>

766
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.850
<v Speaker 6>searching for proof and location of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>so called sex ring.</v>

767
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.940
<v Speaker 6>What they found were numerous references</v>
<v Speaker 6>to pizza.</v>

768
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what our Jones</v>

769
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.740
<v Speaker 3>set resistance to tyrants is obedience </v>
<v Speaker 3>message to Hillary.</v>

770
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.003
<v Speaker 2>What I think about children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton has personally murdered </v>

771
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:18.323
<v Speaker 2>the chopped up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to have zero fear of standing up </v>

<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton has personally murdered </v>

773
00:35:28.191 --> 00:35:31.230
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go tell that loan liar.</v>

774
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Can't hold back anymore until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rivalry.</v>

775
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Clinton is one of the most vicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>serial killers</v>

776
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.030
<v Speaker 3>the planet's ever seen.</v>

777
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:43.623
<v Speaker 3>There's a twist to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the devil worship story </v>

778
00:35:46.341 --> 00:35:49.070
<v Speaker 3>with her chief of staff or campaign </v>
<v Speaker 3>chairman,</v>

779
00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.253
<v Speaker 3>the League as a menu of blood and Shimon</v>
<v Speaker 3>and body parts with Atlanta Alisha </v>

780
00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Crowley event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a private event.</v>

781
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about that.</v>

782
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.303
<v Speaker 3>I mean 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus dead Christians with her operation </v>

783
00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:01.784
<v Speaker 3>with Syria and our operation in Libya </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not letting the Christians get out </v>

784
00:36:05.061 --> 00:36:05.894
<v Speaker 3>and directing al Qaeda and isis who </v>
<v Speaker 3>target and murdered children and put </v>

785
00:36:09.321 --> 00:36:10.154
<v Speaker 3>them through sex slavery and throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic priest off cliffs and kill </v>

786
00:36:12.891 --> 00:36:13.724
<v Speaker 3>people and Mash and murder gauge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else you can imagine because </v>

787
00:36:17.121 --> 00:36:22.121
<v Speaker 3>they don't like peaceful people and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>caught him by the there for open society</v>

788
00:36:22.221 --> 00:36:25.910
<v Speaker 3>and they love everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything they do is for degradation</v>

789
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.023
<v Speaker 6>and someone could have been killed </v>
<v Speaker 6>inside of your restaurant for no good </v>

790
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 6>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People like Alex Jones Fan,</v>

791
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.700
<v Speaker 6>a conspiracy theory that even the DC </v>
<v Speaker 6>police say has no basis.</v>

792
00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:39.900
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

793
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.710
<v Speaker 6>it's a pack of lies and it's dangerous.</v>

794
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.160
<v Speaker 1>What happened to the boyfriend</v>

795
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.123
<v Speaker 6>to drive across four state lines with an</v>
<v Speaker 6>assault rifle and enter a family </v>

796
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:54.540
<v Speaker 6>friendly restaurant at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the afternoon on a Sunday.</v>

797
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.620
<v Speaker 6>I know reddit has banned this topic on </v>
<v Speaker 6>its website.</v>

798
00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:03.120
<v Speaker 6>I mean slowly but surely those who </v>
<v Speaker 6>helped fan it are trying to dial it back</v>

799
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:07.050
<v Speaker 6>out of the safety concerns for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>safety of those who have been endangered</v>

800
00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Speaker 6>by pis could happen to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not just us.</v>

801
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.660
<v Speaker 6>It's any single person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know you said there are producers.</v>

802
00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:15.720
<v Speaker 6>It's also surreal until the gun comes </v>
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>

803
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:17.050
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

804
00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:18.970
<v Speaker 3>And then some guy for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they went.</v>

805
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.890
<v Speaker 3>They got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't get it off youtube.</v>

806
00:37:20.891 --> 00:37:24.610
<v Speaker 3>They got the full clap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They cut the front off knowing.</v>

807
00:37:24.611 --> 00:37:25.444
<v Speaker 3>I was actually saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about the satanism before </v>

808
00:37:27.731 --> 00:37:32.200
<v Speaker 3>the term pizza gate was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know she's funded the radicals.</v>

809
00:37:32.201 --> 00:37:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw they die.</v>

810
00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.780
<v Speaker 3>He do rape and kill and cut up kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she personally is.</v>

811
00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.053
<v Speaker 1>You are making a very provocative </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement and you made it very </v>

812
00:37:41.981 --> 00:37:45.920
<v Speaker 1>provocative statement by saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>something kind of crazy at first.</v>

813
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.103
<v Speaker 1>And then backing it up and so what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to do is just edit a chunk of </v>

814
00:37:49.901 --> 00:37:52.600
<v Speaker 1>that and so they didn't really have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>edit it and chop it up.</v>

815
00:37:52.601 --> 00:37:53.434
<v Speaker 1>But they did take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it out of context and said that I </v>

816
00:37:56.801 --> 00:37:57.850
<v Speaker 1>was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

817
00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:58.923
<v Speaker 1>But you weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was talking about the spirit </v>

818
00:38:00.971 --> 00:38:03.190
<v Speaker 1>cooking Alistair Crowley stuff with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lady is written,</v>

819

<v Speaker 1>it's real for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go and I take little kids have </v>

820
00:38:06.011 --> 00:38:08.530
<v Speaker 1>these parties and they have of blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing,</v>

821
00:38:08.531 --> 00:38:10.030
<v Speaker 1>if you were an adult one to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

822
00:38:10.031 --> 00:38:12.430

<v Speaker 1>This is real.</v>

823
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.070
<v Speaker 1>And so I was talking about the menu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were there in the email saying,</v>

824
00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.450

<v Speaker 1>And other delicious things on the menu.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what are the juices on the menu?</v>

827
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.260

<v Speaker 3>have conversations with them.</v>

851
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:19.923

<v Speaker 3>people and you're the head of the free </v>

852
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:24.730

00:41:06.171 --> 00:41:07.004
<v Speaker 3>Stop obsessing on it and stop reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>these emails because I want to focus on </v>

00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 3>be trying to get at the truth and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people take the fact that it's complex.</v>

901
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.250
<v Speaker 3>She'd be better at this to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>networks,</v>

915
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 1>we're going to roll up the Democrats and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans that are involved,</v>

916

<v Speaker 1>speeches at the,</v>

917
00:41:56.001 --> 00:41:58.010
<v Speaker 1>at the inaugural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not about parties.</v>

918
00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 1>We're taking these people on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're bringing God back in.</v>

919
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.753
<v Speaker 1>Even somebody that wasn't very religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trump has gotten religion learning </v>

920
00:42:04.371 --> 00:42:06.110
<v Speaker 1>about this because let me tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

921
00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:06.944
<v Speaker 1>Trump's not a devil worshiper and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>loves God and he's been briefed on all </v>

922
00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:12.830
<v Speaker 1>this and he's going to roll their ass up</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the pedophiles better get ready.</v>

923
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:13.783
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to clear something up right </v>

924
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:15.164
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that camera and tell everybody </v>

925
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:19.660

<v Speaker 1>So stupid to tell them you're not.</v>

926
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not either tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

927
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.990
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think there's a god conspiracy.</v>

928
00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Here's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it's a flat earth too.</v>

929
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I take real stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice Joseph has researched,</v>

930
00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.253
<v Speaker 1>not kissing his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he knows all these little points on </v>

931
00:42:31.701 --> 00:42:33.070
<v Speaker 1>making better than I even did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

932
00:42:33.071 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm like remembering stuff when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings it up,</v>

933
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:37.250
<v Speaker 1>because I try to suppress after is crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't handle it anymore,</v>

934
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:38.084
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 43 and I'm sitting here looking at </v>

935
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:40.844
<v Speaker 1>all this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these people come to you on the </v>

936
00:42:41.751 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Speaker 1>street and they go,</v>

937
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.023
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe sent me five times and then I tried </v>

938
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:46.251
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

945
00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.293
<v Speaker 1>here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be on the street or I'll be at a </v>

946
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:01.310
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and they come over and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

947
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.110
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey bill,</v>

948
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:03.944
<v Speaker 1>hey bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Bill.</v>

949
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.090
<v Speaker 1>They don't really show Rogan variously </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

950
00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.630
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I turned around and go,</v>

951
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:10.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you all.</v>

952
00:43:10.251 --> 00:43:11.084
<v Speaker 1>Because I did a few pieces and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>little video with a guy that lived in </v>

953
00:43:14.811 --> 00:43:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Austin and the unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how I met with,</v>

954
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.850
<v Speaker 1>but you don't like Bill Hicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's ridiculous about it.</v>

955
00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Like what'd you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like massive plastic surgery changed the</v>

956
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:23.474
<v Speaker 1>way your voice sounds like your voice is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so different than thing is that no one </v>

957
00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:27.884
<v Speaker 1>ever wants to look real conspiracies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're complex and hard to </v>

958
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:30.704
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to just go with the earth is </v>

959
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:33.650
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

960
00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:34.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's aliens living underneath the </v>

961
00:43:35.061 --> 00:43:35.570
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>

962
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs aren't real or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

963
00:43:37.521 --> 00:43:38.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

964
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:38.893
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is I'm not going to Bash </v>

965
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.971
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

966
00:43:40.971 --> 00:43:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>

967
00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.570
<v Speaker 1>It's good to have a free open mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't promulgate stuff.</v>

968
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:45.523
<v Speaker 1>He's only researching what's been said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to just get this out of the </v>

969
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:48.830
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am Bill Hicks.</v>

970
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

971
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll bill hicks be like 60.</v>

972
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he died at 32 and 1994.</v>

973
00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

974
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:59.990
<v Speaker 1>do the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know one thing.</v>

975
00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:03.680
<v Speaker 1>It's hot in here isn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

976
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I always keep my studio really cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

977
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:06.370
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

978
00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.350
<v Speaker 1>you get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a goddamn fun.</v>

979
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Inferno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A melting.</v>

980
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:10.543
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that don't know </v>

981
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:13.833
<v Speaker 1>like how you got started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I thought was </v>

982
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:19.000
<v Speaker 1>really bizarre in that thing was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lady was calling you a right wing host,</v>

983
00:44:19.001 --> 00:44:20.210
<v Speaker 1>a far right wing host.</v>

984
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.550
<v Speaker 1>You've never been a right wing guy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

985
00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:27.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a big misconception like you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>always totally anti Bush.</v>

986
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:27.914
<v Speaker 1>You've got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking as actually before Bush was </v>

987
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:31.604
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were trying to stop him from being </v>

988
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:37.140
<v Speaker 1>elected back when Clinton was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he stole the election from Gore,</v>

989
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 1>who I didn't even really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still came out and exposed it and it's</v>

990
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:42.570
<v Speaker 1>now been certified in Congress and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've documented.</v>

991
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I just go with what the facts are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've never been.</v>

992
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.950
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that really opened my </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

993
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.640
<v Speaker 1>This is a really important video that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you did nine slash 11 road to tyranny.</v>

994
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.713
<v Speaker 1>We talked about the World Trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>Organization protests and how they had </v>

995
00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:59.541
<v Speaker 1>sent in these people in government </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniforms with government issue boots and</v>

996
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 1>these anarchists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were dressed in black and they.</v>

997
00:45:03.181 --> 00:45:07.230
<v Speaker 1>It's that this is an actual tactic that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll use to break up peaceful protest</v>

998
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:07.590
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

999
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 1>They'll send in soldiers or policeman or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever the hell they're hiring,</v>

1000
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 1>no one knows and they send these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they smash everything up.</v>

1001
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:14.574
<v Speaker 1>They started to turn into a violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>protest and light things on fire and </v>

1002
00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:18.414
<v Speaker 1>then they all hold up in a building and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they negotiated their release and none </v>

1003
00:45:21.691 --> 00:45:22.524
<v Speaker 1>of them were ever arrested and when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed this clip by clip from these </v>

1004
00:45:26.461 --> 00:45:27.294
<v Speaker 1>various news organizations and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on the kind of clothing they're </v>

1005
00:45:30.301 --> 00:45:31.134
<v Speaker 1>wearing and the difference in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior versus the behavior of all the </v>

1006
00:45:33.181 --> 00:45:35.580
<v Speaker 1>peaceful protests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then show the result of it,</v>

1007
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.593
<v Speaker 1>which had these people that were walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work with a WTO sticker that had a </v>

1008
00:45:41.171 --> 00:45:44.490
<v Speaker 1>line through it and police stopped them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

1009
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:46.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't have that sticker on that book</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>

1010
00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.400
<v Speaker 1>You committed Beta test for martial law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

1011
00:45:50.401 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anti cops themselves.</v>

1012
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.360
<v Speaker 1>The media always spins it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You expose pedophilia.</v>

1013
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.480
<v Speaker 1>They blamed to the pizza place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You expose the government trying to make</v>

1014
00:45:57.481 --> 00:45:59.420
<v Speaker 1>cops do bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you hate everybody.</v>

1015
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Not even been comped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows who was doing the Delta</v>

1016
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1017
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Delta force and I'm blasting Delta </v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

1018
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:10.950
<v Speaker 1>They were given an order by Clinton to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go out and to recruit and they recruited</v>

1019
00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:11.784
<v Speaker 1>just about 400 leftist foundation funded</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups funded by big private </v>

1020
00:46:15.331 --> 00:46:16.164
<v Speaker 1>foundations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They trained them for about a month </v>

1021
00:46:17.401 --> 00:46:19.890
<v Speaker 1>before in Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They flew them there,</v>

1022
00:46:19.891 --> 00:46:21.930
<v Speaker 1>put them in a government housing </v>
<v Speaker 1>facility.</v>

1023
00:46:21.931 --> 00:46:24.540
<v Speaker 1>This was on the newsletter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just covered local news story.</v>

1024
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 1>They did retreat to a building and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiated their surrender and they were</v>

1025
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 1>released.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1026
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.533
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1027
00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.830
<v Speaker 1>But this was after all this property </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>

1028
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:34.763
<v Speaker 1>They went out to start the attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had it on video so they could </v>

1029
00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:40.530
<v Speaker 1>then attack the hundred thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful protesters.</v>

1030
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.320
<v Speaker 1>So this was something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't like.</v>

1031
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:46.110
<v Speaker 1>We like to think just like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to think that pedophiles are real.</v>

1032
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't like to think that anyone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>

1033
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:49.704
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organize some kind of an attack or some </v>

1034
00:46:51.811 --> 00:46:53.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1035
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:54.833
<v Speaker 1>a fake event where a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you hire to start smashing things </v>

1036
00:46:59.101 --> 00:46:59.934
<v Speaker 1>to make a peaceful protest look bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to think that that's </v>

1037
00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:03.030
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is possible.</v>

1038
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that this is actually a</v>

1039
00:47:05.521 --> 00:47:07.370
<v Speaker 1>documented yet tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1040
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.940
<v Speaker 1>there was the WTO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1041
00:47:08.941 --> 00:47:12.840
<v Speaker 1>esquire about two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing a profile on me and the guy,</v>

1042
00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:13.953
<v Speaker 1>his dad database,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a former CIA section chief and had been </v>

1043
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:17.610
<v Speaker 1>involved a bunch of stuff himself and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>told him,</v>

1044
00:47:17.611 --> 00:47:18.031
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1045
00:47:18.031 --> 00:47:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Delta force ran those riots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

1046
00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:21.024
<v Speaker 1>you're a liar.</v>

1047
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.021
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1048
00:47:22.021 --> 00:47:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

1049
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:23.263
<v Speaker 1>He went and googled it and couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe he got the Seattle Post </v>

1050
00:47:25.501 --> 00:47:26.334
<v Speaker 1>intelligence surge and stuff and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>even went and talked to a journalist </v>

1051
00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:29.634
<v Speaker 1>that knew because he'd been there </v>
<v Speaker 1>covering it as a journalist and he </v>

1052
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says in the esquire article,</v>

1053
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:36.243
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones got me there because even </v>

1054
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 1>though I'd grown up in the CIA and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1055
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1056
00:47:41.581 --> 00:47:42.414
<v Speaker 1>but let's be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's criminal elements using </v>

1057
00:47:44.141 --> 00:47:44.974
<v Speaker 1>compartmentalization that do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always claim I hate the government </v>

1058
00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 1>and I want to have a war and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other stuff.</v>

1059
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:49.624
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to give credit to the good </v>

1060
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:53.860
<v Speaker 1>elements of the CIA and the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of the NSA.</v>

1061
00:47:53.861 --> 00:47:54.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good friends.</v>

1062
00:47:54.641 --> 00:47:56.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a very important point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very important point.</v>

1063
00:47:56.981 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 1>I've had this point with a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine when we were talking about,</v>

1064
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:00.544
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1065
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I've had Mike Baker on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and through the few conversations</v>

1066
00:48:04.721 --> 00:48:06.760
<v Speaker 1>that I've had with Mike Baker is </v>
<v Speaker 1>formerly the CIA.</v>

1067
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.983
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start getting an understanding of </v>

1068
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:10.594
<v Speaker 1>how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these drug dealings that always </v>

1069
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 1>kinda like jets crashing with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coke on board.</v>

1070
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.230
<v Speaker 1>They're cowboys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got like a few dudes,</v>

1071
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:18.064
<v Speaker 1>God's run inside sideshows few dudes who</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize they can make a fuck load of </v>

1072
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:22.084
<v Speaker 1>money if they sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there might be a lot of people </v>

1073
00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:25.870
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the whole CIA.</v>

1074
00:48:25.871 --> 00:48:27.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they have government memos</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1075
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:28.744
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will do is they'll have a cover and </v>

1076
00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:32.260
<v Speaker 1>option they're running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president says do this.</v>

1077
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Like Ronald Reagan didn't know about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine dealing.</v>

1078
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to folks that were involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually for the points.</v>

1079
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.350
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want conesh knocked out congress.</v>

1080
00:48:38.351 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 1>That'll give them the funding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1081
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.500
<v Speaker 1>well you do in the government is you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president said,</v>

1082
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:43.270
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're we're men of action.</v>

1083
00:48:43.271 --> 00:48:44.140
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do it.</v>

1084
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.480
<v Speaker 1>So then there's cocaine already being </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold.</v>

1085
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 1>The contracts are using it to get all </v>
<v Speaker 1>their funding will screw that.</v>

1086
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:52.360
<v Speaker 1>We'll just jacket bring it in using </v>
<v Speaker 1>private contractors.</v>

1087
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 1>And that wasn't the first time they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for Vietnam.</v>

1088
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1089
00:48:57.251 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 1>it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a common tactic.</v>

1090
00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.320
<v Speaker 1>They knew that there was money that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>being made from selling illegal drugs.</v>

1091
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Why would they let that money be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>all around them?</v>

1092
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.630
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the argument is you don't want to</v>

1093
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.050
<v Speaker 1>let the communist do all the cocaine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin dealing or the kids,</v>

1094
00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.610
<v Speaker 1>then they have more money than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1095
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.400
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan?</v>

1096
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:17.401
<v Speaker 1>It's just this crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much heroin production went up since</v>

1097
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:19.800
<v Speaker 1>our occupation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can pull this up again.</v>

1098
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:20.643
<v Speaker 1>That's what's frustrating is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fake liberals because I see myself </v>

1099
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:24.780
<v Speaker 1>as a real liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the fake liberals just go,</v>

1100
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:25.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of this is like,</v>

1101
00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:26.603
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can search engine opium production </v>

1102
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:33.130
<v Speaker 1>in Afghanistan pre 2001 and then look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latest years.</v>

1103
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:34.870
<v Speaker 1>It's come out in like 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

1104
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It went from three percent of world </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply to seven percent.</v>

1105
00:49:38.621 --> 00:49:43.510
<v Speaker 1>The 30 percent and after 10 years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation it went to 93 percent.</v>

1106
00:49:43.511 --> 00:49:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Look at mobile supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at the heck Taylor went from a,</v>

1107
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:49.840
<v Speaker 1>a memory will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was I right?</v>

1108
00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were.</v>

1109
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty substantial increase between</v>
<v Speaker 1>2001,</v>

1110
00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 1>which is at an all time low on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>chart from 94 to 2016.</v>

1111
00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.013
<v Speaker 1>So 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's an all time low and then the next </v>

1112
00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.073
<v Speaker 1>year it fucking skyrocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Google and BBC and ap just type in </v>

1113
00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 plus percent world opium production.</v>

1114
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:11.870
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hot.</v>

1115
00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Ninety three percent and listened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also for like opiate pills or is it just</v>

1116
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:17.164
<v Speaker 1>for Jews for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like oxycontin's and things </v>

1117
00:50:19.151 --> 00:50:19.984
<v Speaker 1>along those lines that they ordered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trips to the Taliban that works with </v>

1118
00:50:23.531 --> 00:50:24.364
<v Speaker 1>them was allowed to grow it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're allowed to sell it to whoever </v>

1119
00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 1>wants to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1120
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>not just that</v>

1121
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.963
<v Speaker 3>there's been documented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>confirm instances of troops that are </v>

1122
00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:33.920
<v Speaker 3>being forced to guard poppy field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1123
00:50:33.921 --> 00:50:34.810
<v Speaker 3>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll let me break it down for it.</v>

1124
00:50:34.811 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Right when the shorter commitments on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox News with Geraldo Rivera,</v>

1125
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.930
<v Speaker 3>remember that shareable that came out a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year after I broke it again.</v>

1126
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:42.913
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you how they work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes out that the trips are being </v>

1127
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:47.960
<v Speaker 3>ordered right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes.</v>

1128
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:48.883
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent of the world's supply of </v>
<v Speaker 3>opm according to the United Nations and </v>

1129
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.040
<v Speaker 3>hit 93 last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1130
00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 3>How many years old is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple of years.</v>

1131
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Like three years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years old.</v>

1132
00:50:57.861 --> 00:51:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Say It's gone from 93 right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1133
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.830
<v Speaker 3>See I didn't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said 93 and it's not for this.</v>

1134
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:03.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1135
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 3>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so frustrating is you know</v>

1136
00:51:05.121 --> 00:51:07.340
<v Speaker 3>all this and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then people still call you crazy.</v>

1137
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Now what Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do explain the fake news cyop why do</v>

1138
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people out there think info </v>
<v Speaker 3>wars is total fake news?</v>

1139
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:15.673
<v Speaker 3>Why do they think that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a major deep state government </v>

1140
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:18.824
<v Speaker 3>program funded by Soros mainly and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>found the most effective way is anti </v>

1141
00:51:22.431 --> 00:51:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Israel bashing and so this came out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Wiki leaks last year.</v>

1142
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:27.783
<v Speaker 3>The US intelligence sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the Russians that he's in there </v>

1143
00:51:29.361 --> 00:51:30.950
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to overthrow Israel.</v>

1144
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.033
<v Speaker 3>We've got to deal with Saudi Arabia and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to up the ante with anti </v>

1145
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Israel rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm somebody that was neutral in Israel.</v>

1146
00:51:37.341 --> 00:51:39.140
<v Speaker 3>Never been there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had nothing to do with it.</v>

1147
00:51:39.141 --> 00:51:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Israel has liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives,</v>

1148
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:42.650
<v Speaker 3>some good administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some bad,</v>

1149
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not anti Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tiny little place.</v>

1150
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.360
<v Speaker 3>I know it does some things that are bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to what we've done.</v>

1151
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:48.194
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just don't have some giant hard on </v>

1152
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:50.570
<v Speaker 3>for Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1153
00:51:50.571 --> 00:51:51.970
<v Speaker 3>wanting to hurt him and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

00:51:51.971 --> 00:51:53.570
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not against the Palestinians or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody else.</v>

1155
00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:54.403
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows that show show when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed Israelis from the reason I say </v>

1156
00:51:57.801 --> 00:52:00.380
<v Speaker 3>it's wrong when they white phosphorous </v>
<v Speaker 3>bomb Palestinians,</v>

1157
00:52:00.381 --> 00:52:01.970
<v Speaker 3>I say it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show.</v>

1158
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:02.953

<v Speaker 3>then they just put out that I'm this </v>

1159
00:52:06.351 --> 00:52:07.910

<v Speaker 3>or I'm the CIA.</v>

1161
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.863
<v Speaker 3>Let's not get into these crazy rants </v>
<v Speaker 3>about crazy accusations is why do they </v>

1162

<v Speaker 3>They have.</v>

1165
00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:24.530
<v Speaker 3>They think the real news is CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>well let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got attached from below and </v>

1167
00:52:26.751 --> 00:52:27.584
<v Speaker 3>above.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got major funding by Soros and </v>

1168
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:32.600
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a real life Nazi collaborator,</v>

1169
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:33.613
<v Speaker 3>like true Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Evil of the latest James Bond was based </v>

1170
00:52:35.841 --> 00:52:38.770
<v Speaker 3>on his real accompany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's even named after his company.</v>

1171
00:52:38.771 --> 00:52:39.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't like the bad guy in the movie.</v>

1172
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.570
<v Speaker 3>He actually Soros,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1173
00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.350
<v Speaker 3>he tried to crash the pound breakdown </v>
<v Speaker 3>angle and he's really bad nose,</v>

1174
00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.570
<v Speaker 3>so [inaudible] 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but long story short about George Soros,</v>

1175
00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.310
<v Speaker 3>he's funding this attack on me and any </v>
<v Speaker 3>independent media.</v>

1176
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.000
<v Speaker 3>How do you attack independent media when</v>
<v Speaker 3>the public's awake?</v>

1177
00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:59.000
<v Speaker 3>The deep state and government stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say Alex Jones is the government and</v>

1178
00:52:59.001 --> 00:53:01.640
<v Speaker 3>then they always ignore real facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about her.</v>

1179
00:53:01.641 --> 00:53:02.474
<v Speaker 3>I admit some of my family and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's worked for the government and </v>

1180
00:53:04.041 --> 00:53:05.660
<v Speaker 3>they said the carpet was corrupted out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of control.</v>

1181
00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:08.180
<v Speaker 3>That isn't even a real debate but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But above that.</v>

1182
00:53:08.181 --> 00:53:10.970
<v Speaker 3>What was your other question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a with question was.</v>

1183
00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Explain the Sol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andy,</v>

1184
00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:15.260
<v Speaker 3>let me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just explain.</v>

1185
00:53:15.261 --> 00:53:17.930
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did their indirect competition with him?</v>

1186
00:53:17.931 --> 00:53:19.820
<v Speaker 3>If it's Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's CNN,</v>

1187
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 3>if it's anybody that's distributing </v>
<v Speaker 3>news,</v>

1188
00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.453
<v Speaker 3>you're in direct competition with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who has an independent news </v>

1189
00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:26.030
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They operate it themselves and</v>

1190
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 1>they do it online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show just said it perfectly.</v>

1191
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:28.524
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex is in a very unusual position </v>

1192
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:31.613
<v Speaker 1>because he's a magnet people to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are drawn to him like a lightening </v>

1193
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Rod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says a lot of crazy shit.</v>

1194
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 1>He goes on rants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very animated.</v>

1195
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:41.160
<v Speaker 1>He's fun to watch and a lot of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1196
00:53:41.161 --> 00:53:45.120
<v Speaker 1>He says this correct and we're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this right now like this.</v>

1197
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:47.460
<v Speaker 1>This thing about the WTO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was like I said,</v>

1198
00:53:47.461 --> 00:53:49.010
<v Speaker 1>was one of the first ones that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened up my eyes.</v>

1199
00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:49.903
<v Speaker 1>That was a long time ago too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like you put that video out in </v>

1200
00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.870
<v Speaker 1>2002 or something like when was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand three.</v>

1201
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:59.930
<v Speaker 1>It was like 2011 right after nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>11 right after September 11th and put it</v>

1202
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:02.490
<v Speaker 1>on the web router if that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1203
00:54:02.491 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I put it out on DVD or something up </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>

1204
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:05.243
<v Speaker 1>But you just said it joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me try to actually thinking </v>

1205
00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.433
<v Speaker 1>codified this then because my problem is</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't script what I say or that it's </v>

1206
00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.880
<v Speaker 1>kind of all over the map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing or a bad thing.</v>

1207
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:12.923
<v Speaker 1>You just did it on the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ask your question why they call me </v>

1208
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 1>fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just saw Megan Kelly two weeks before</v>

1209
00:54:17.761 --> 00:54:20.820
<v Speaker 1>the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in a whole hour long show,</v>

1210
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:23.280
<v Speaker 1>special against fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've played a few minutes of it.</v>

1211
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.293
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones is the king of fake nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just said Hillary is chopping up </v>

1212
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:29.520
<v Speaker 1>children inside of basement at a pizza </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1213
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:30.541
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

1214
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I was saying it in satire about her in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East,</v>

1215
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.370
<v Speaker 1>so it begged for them to take it out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

1216
00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:38.010
<v Speaker 1>but they clearly did that to deceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>their viewers.</v>

1217
00:54:38.011 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 1>She's branding herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm real.</v>

1218
00:54:40.351 --> 00:54:42.090
<v Speaker 1>You can trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1219
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:42.923
<v Speaker 1>Poor victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones almost got him killed when </v>

1220
00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:48.480
<v Speaker 1>none of it was true when none of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're based in reality.</v>

1221
00:54:48.481 --> 00:54:51.210
<v Speaker 1>And what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was getting was from the NYP ed.</v>

1222
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the FBI,</v>

1223
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 1>who are good people are at least those </v>
<v Speaker 1>agents show.</v>

1224
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:57.990
<v Speaker 1>There's an example of them branding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>texting it in.</v>

1225
00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:02.340
<v Speaker 1>They'll take something real life said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they've taken videos where I'm acting</v>

1226
00:55:02.341 --> 00:55:04.000
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1227
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like five x six x underwear,</v>

1228
00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:07.464
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're given the illegals or </v>

1229
00:55:07.651 --> 00:55:08.484
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll show them with underwear on </v>

1230
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:10.410
<v Speaker 1>my head and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1231
00:55:10.411 --> 00:55:11.244
<v Speaker 1>this guy's crazy and I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cover serious topics so they can take </v>

1232
00:55:14.131 --> 00:55:15.870
<v Speaker 1>it out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I'm being serious,</v>

1233
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:17.670
<v Speaker 1>which is 90 percent of the time I tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1234
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.250
<v Speaker 1>but when joe comes in and we've got </v>

1256
00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:01.704
<v Speaker 1>is really going on because I figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basis of what's happening and I'm </v>

1257
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:05.694
<v Speaker 1>going to let you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you wanna hear some far out </v>

1258
00:56:06.691 --> 00:56:08.850
<v Speaker 1>stuff today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because what you experienced,</v>

1259
00:56:08.851 --> 00:56:09.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go through it.</v>

1260
00:56:09.571 --> 00:56:10.404
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

1261
00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me take a piss then.</v>

1262
00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.353

<v Speaker 1>We're going to bring you down to earth </v>

1267
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 1>every now and then you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch into orbit.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Go take a piss and then tell some crazy </v>

1272
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:31.680
<v Speaker 7>Right through that door to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Powerful alerts.</v>

1273
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:33.920
<v Speaker 7>Drones so far,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eddie,</v>

1274
00:56:33.921 --> 00:56:35.770
<v Speaker 7>Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything you wanted and more.</v>

1275
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:36.783
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>

1276
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:40.320
<v Speaker 7>I'm just sitting here letting them just </v>
<v Speaker 7>letting,</v>

1277
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:41.223
<v Speaker 7>letting the people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>letting your fans know that have never </v>

1278
00:56:44.051 --> 00:56:44.884
<v Speaker 7>listened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I listened to Alex Jones every goddamn </v>

1279
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.430
<v Speaker 7>day and she'd take a day off every now </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then.</v>

1280
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:51.940
<v Speaker 7>Otherwise you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck bloom.</v>

1281
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.800
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he's a good guy.</v>

1282
00:56:53.801 --> 00:56:55.300
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's always been a good guy.</v>

1283
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 7>People that don't listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

1284
00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:00.580
<v Speaker 7>they believe what the mainstream media </v>
<v Speaker 7>has said about us,</v>

1285
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.210
<v Speaker 7>but it's also he makes it easy for them </v>
<v Speaker 7>by saying crazy shit.</v>

1286
00:57:04.211 --> 00:57:05.044
<v Speaker 7>Like Hillary Clinton chops up babies and</v>
<v Speaker 7>all that stuff and I know he's doing it </v>

1287
00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:07.894
<v Speaker 7>for dramatic effect and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>reasons why show is so popular because </v>

1288
00:57:10.181 --> 00:57:11.320
<v Speaker 7>he does a lot of things like that.</v>

1289
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:13.660
<v Speaker 7>It makes it easy for people to dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

1290
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 7>And then you get into this thing where,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1291
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:17.220
<v Speaker 7>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>before you dismiss them,</v>

1292
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:19.130
<v Speaker 7>let's look at what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is.</v>

1293
00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:20.860
<v Speaker 7>He said that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they look at what he said.</v>

1294
00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:24.840
<v Speaker 7>Everything you said today so far,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so far,</v>

1295
00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:28.180
<v Speaker 7>everything that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just like his radio show.</v>

1296
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:33.500
<v Speaker 7>He doesn't have any teleprompters.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This dude can talk for forever.</v>

1297
00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.273
<v Speaker 7>That's a thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you wind up doing a lot of </v>

1298
00:57:36.431 --> 00:57:38.860
<v Speaker 7>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially doing these radio shows,</v>

1299
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.250
<v Speaker 7>shows like Alex says by himself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we just ranting rants and rents for long</v>

1300
00:57:42.251 --> 00:57:45.070
<v Speaker 7>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You develop like a certain muscle,</v>

1301
00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.770
<v Speaker 7>like there's a lot of guys who do their </v>
<v Speaker 7>own pod,</v>

1302
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:48.663
<v Speaker 7>like bill burr is a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>does his own podcast by himself all the </v>

1303
00:57:50.921 --> 00:57:51.754
<v Speaker 7>time and he's got this ability to go </v>
<v Speaker 7>just rant from one subject to the next </v>

1304
00:57:55.871 --> 00:57:56.950
<v Speaker 7>subject and keep going.</v>

1305
00:57:57.070 --> 00:58:00.550
<v Speaker 7>And when you have a podcast it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you just kinda gotta get out of his way.</v>

1306
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:02.980
<v Speaker 7>So with Alex you just kinda gotta feed </v>
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

1307
00:58:02.981 --> 00:58:03.814
<v Speaker 7>Some subjects get out of his way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but every now and then he does so many </v>

1308
00:58:06.311 --> 00:58:07.930
<v Speaker 7>subjects in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got to bring them back.</v>

1309
00:58:07.931 --> 00:58:08.764
<v Speaker 7>I gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you gotTa.</v>

1310
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:10.360
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's get to this one.</v>

1311
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 7>How did she steal estates?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just can't gloss over that.</v>

1312
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:13.601
<v Speaker 7>Let's get to this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1313
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:14.850
<v Speaker 7>let's get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Broke it down per.</v>

1314
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:16.180
<v Speaker 7>He did a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1315
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.283
<v Speaker 7>and this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think this is going to help people </v>

1316
00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:20.793
<v Speaker 7>have just seeing Alex like this is going</v>
<v Speaker 7>to help people have a chance to look at </v>

1317
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:30.220
<v Speaker 7>this whole picture of just forget about </v>
<v Speaker 7>where your loyalties lie,</v>

1318
00:58:30.221 --> 00:58:32.530
<v Speaker 7>whether you enjoy CNN or Fox News or </v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever,</v>

1319
00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:33.373
<v Speaker 7>to just sit outside of it right now and </v>
<v Speaker 7>look at what it really is because what </v>

1320
00:58:36.941 --> 00:58:40.240
<v Speaker 7>it really is is why is anyone want to </v>
<v Speaker 7>give you the news?</v>

1321
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.690
<v Speaker 7>Are they giving you the news because </v>
<v Speaker 7>they love you or are they giving you the</v>

1322
00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:44.524
<v Speaker 7>news because it's a program and they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>trying to make money and do they have </v>

1323
00:58:47.711 --> 00:58:50.740
<v Speaker 7>access to certain people because they're</v>
<v Speaker 7>willing to play certain games.</v>

1324
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:51.903
<v Speaker 7>Most likely when you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 7>something that's on a major league </v>

1325
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.473
<v Speaker 7>television show,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether it's Fox News or NBC or CBS or </v>

1326
00:58:58.631 --> 00:58:59.464
<v Speaker 7>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you had to go through some serious </v>

1327
00:59:01.211 --> 00:59:05.230
<v Speaker 7>channels to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're a guy with a suit and a tie,</v>

1328
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.450
<v Speaker 7>good evening America and you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 7>that guy,</v>

1329
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:08.613
<v Speaker 7>that guy on any of those major networks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've had to go through some fucking </v>

1330
00:59:11.441 --> 00:59:14.830
<v Speaker 7>serious hoops and ladders and checks and</v>
<v Speaker 7>balances.</v>

1331
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.660
<v Speaker 7>You got to represent something in order </v>
<v Speaker 7>to be the person who reads the news,</v>

1332
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.610
<v Speaker 7>but what is that news for?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is it a fucking show</v>

1333
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:25.520
<v Speaker 2>or is it really the news?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they really trying to help you?</v>

1334
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Speaker 2>What are they trying to do with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1335
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:28.423
<v Speaker 2>Why are they doing the news?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they doing it because they love you </v>

1336
00:59:30.261 --> 00:59:31.094
<v Speaker 2>and care for you and they want you to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>informed or they're doing it because </v>

1337
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:34.970
<v Speaker 2>they're clearly biased and they've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>an agenda?</v>

1338
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:36.223
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you watch Fox News and then CNN just </v>

1339
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:39.590
<v Speaker 2>go back and forth whenever there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something going on.</v>

1340
00:59:39.591 --> 00:59:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Like how I did it after the election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1341
00:59:41.901 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN,</v>

1342
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:43.603
<v Speaker 2>Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN.</v>

1343
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 2>It's who the fuck is telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's gotta be lying.</v>

1344
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:47.323
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you Fox is lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of you is line because there's one </v>

1345
00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 2>story over here and it's a totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different story over here,</v>

1346
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.040
<v Speaker 2>so all you need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just looking at that,</v>

1347
00:59:55.041 --> 00:59:57.200
<v Speaker 2>just forget about what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a progressive liberal,</v>

1348
00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican.</v>

1349
00:59:59.120 --> 00:59:59.953
<v Speaker 2>Just look at that and understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting all of your information </v>

1350
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:04.723
<v Speaker 2>from these sources that have a vested </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in relaying their particular </v>

1351
01:00:08.391 --> 01:00:09.224
<v Speaker 2>version of the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good for anybody that </v>

1352
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:14.000
<v Speaker 2>represents the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The party like Fox is totally get me one</v>

<v Speaker 2>The people that have never given them </v>

1357

<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be this conspiracy guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>making money and doing shows.</v>

1360
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I walked away from my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about conspiracies.</v>

1361
01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I really don't want to be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy guy,</v>

1362
01:00:39.321 --> 01:00:41.640
<v Speaker 2>but something inside me,</v>

01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:46.940
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm trying to.</v>

1366
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.833
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making money off any conspiracy </v>

1367

<v Speaker 1>You don't have to wear it so loud.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Whatever the point is is that you're one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the biggest shows in the world.</v>

1491
01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you a newsflash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for your ego.</v>

1492
01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to know this.</v>

1493
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that as a signal to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media of apathetic.</v>

1494
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:16.140
<v Speaker 1>They are in top show has maybe a million</v>

<v Speaker 1>maybe 4 million to nine on a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

1497
01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:20.711
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not in competition with them.</v>

1499
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:25.150
<v Speaker 1>The point is there a freaking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I conservatively,</v>

<v Speaker 1>everyday on terrestrial radio have $4 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million listeners on my 200 plus </v>

1501
01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:30.550
<v Speaker 1>stations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's rated proven.</v>

1502
01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's big right there and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of downloads every</v>

1503
01:06:35.141 --> 01:06:35.974
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You've added all together 40 something </v>
<v Speaker 1>million a week.</v>

1506
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.860
<v Speaker 1>We go back to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening?</v>

1507
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.990
<v Speaker 1>It isn't about Joe Rogan or Alex Jones </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready,</v>

1508
01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:44.843
<v Speaker 1>Bravo or any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the people are hungry for </v>

1509
01:06:47.021 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>being able to have a wider selection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1510
01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.293
<v Speaker 1>When you and I are totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories because all I'm trying to do </v>

1511
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 1>is give them interesting content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're actually trying to run a new show</v>

1512
01:06:56.501 --> 01:06:58.750
<v Speaker 1>and expose to some really smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary.</v>

1513
01:06:58.751 --> 01:07:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch clips all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have people on all the time.</v>

1514
01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:03.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just you try to open minds all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1515
01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 1>open mind the different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meant to say that what I'm not,</v>

1516
01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not honestly not trying to open </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds,</v>

01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:09.484
<v Speaker 1>I'm being curious and I'm asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and I'm trying to learn as </v>

1518

<v Speaker 1>much myself and then once I do learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>about things,</v>

1519
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I would like to have that person come on</v>
<v Speaker 1>to teach other people about it because I</v>

1520
01:07:17.081 --> 01:07:17.800
<v Speaker 1>think it's interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

1533
01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.250
<v Speaker 1>A conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not trusting criminals.</v>

1534
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then you can in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder to the criminal,</v>

1535
01:07:57.191 --> 01:07:59.410

<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

1536
01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I'm actually </v>

1537
01:08:00.611 --> 01:08:02.580
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed about is the y two k.</v>

01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Near My.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go anywhere that night.</v>

<v Speaker 3>legal.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things if people think </v>

1554
01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.980
<v Speaker 3>are going to happen that turned out to </v>
<v Speaker 3>not happen.</v>

1555
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:38.960
<v Speaker 3>There's always a goddamn asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to kill us all.</v>

1556
01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:42.580
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's important to not inhale.</v>

1557
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is going on?</v>

1558
01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Aliens are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me hear it.</v>

1559
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I do this,</v>

1560
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.240
<v Speaker 3>let me answer his question because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>got it.</v>

1561
01:08:50.241 --> 01:08:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Reagan question to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1562
01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:54.940
<v Speaker 3>let me answer y two k because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be bit honest about this.</v>

1563
01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.753
<v Speaker 3>This was one of the few things that debt</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have really gotten wrong and I didn't </v>

1564
01:09:01.821 --> 01:09:06.050
<v Speaker 3>go with my gut and so I was proven wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I did it for the wrong reason.</v>

1565
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:08.300
<v Speaker 3>So now I'm going to actually confess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your honor,</v>

1566
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:12.440
<v Speaker 3>I was on one radio station.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been on TV for a few years.</v>

1567
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:13.483
<v Speaker 3>I was on one radio station already </v>
<v Speaker 3>started to show it to my house that was </v>

1568
01:09:15.501 --> 01:09:17.360
<v Speaker 3>on like 15 radio stations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had that at least,</v>

1569
01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:18.194
<v Speaker 3>but I was on one big radio station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the top show at night station with </v>

1570
01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Howard stern was killer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was all over the newspaper,</v>

1571
01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:26.030
<v Speaker 3>had huge ratings and I was bringing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1572
01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:26.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

1573
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:28.340
<v Speaker 3>30 grand a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was just a huge amount for me.</v>

1574
01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.140
<v Speaker 3>Building whole operation out of that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

1575
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.290
<v Speaker 3>And they come to the sales guys and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>go look for a year.</v>

1576
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:34.124
<v Speaker 3>You've not been behind y twoK and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not letting us have all these big </v>

1577
01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:37.904
<v Speaker 3>sponsors and you're gonna basically be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fired if you don't let us endorse these </v>

1578
01:09:41.721 --> 01:09:43.280
<v Speaker 3>sponsors and have them on errands.</v>

1579
01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Say You believe in y two k hold on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

1580
01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:46.064
<v Speaker 3>So these sponsors were like doomsday </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like canned food and shit and </v>

1581
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:49.880
<v Speaker 3>bunkers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything else.</v>

1582
01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:54.900
<v Speaker 3>So stacy wants to make all this money so</v>
<v Speaker 3>the station made you push y two k y.</v>

1583
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:02.983
<v Speaker 3>But let me go further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the few times in my life </v>

1584
01:10:04.161 --> 01:10:06.110
<v Speaker 3>that I don't want to say I didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>integrity.</v>

1585
01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.213
<v Speaker 3>I kinda let them convince me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think back to the point in the </v>

1586
01:10:09.201 --> 01:10:12.350
<v Speaker 3>conference room I just Kinda went okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1587
01:10:12.351 --> 01:10:12.831
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1588
01:10:12.831 --> 01:10:13.880
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I went.</v>

1589
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:16.940
<v Speaker 3>And then once I decided it was true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really pushed it.</v>

1590
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.133
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like I lied to myself yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm being honest about this </v>

1591
01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:20.654
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1592
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:23.600
<v Speaker 3>So this is what happened for like a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a half.</v>

1593
01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:24.434
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying it's bs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a government hoax because they're </v>

1594
01:10:25.791 --> 01:10:26.624
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the navy says the chips are all bad and </v>

1595
01:10:27.861 --> 01:10:30.830
<v Speaker 3>54 cities will completely fall and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the death.</v>

1596
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:31.663
<v Speaker 3>And I said they just want to upgrade </v>
<v Speaker 3>with all this new spy hubs and when a </v>

1597
01:10:34.161 --> 01:10:34.994
<v Speaker 3>new global standardization for the US,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the telecommunications act of </v>

1598
01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:38.144
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 96,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to force all the new chips </v>

1599
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.750
<v Speaker 3>because I had an NSA sources that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>having on.</v>

1600
01:10:41.751 --> 01:10:42.584
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't realize how special it was </v>

1601
01:10:44.461 --> 01:10:47.300
<v Speaker 3>that I had these sources and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me it's all bs people.</v>

1602
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:48.143
<v Speaker 3>I don't argue with the navy and don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Art and Fox News had ads to get your </v>

1603
01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:51.950
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just everywhere.</v>

1604
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Someone kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1605
01:10:54.261 --> 01:10:55.094
<v Speaker 3>stuff's going to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a black Friday for black </v>

1606
01:10:58.251 --> 01:11:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Friday sale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the last few months and the moral was</v>

1607
01:11:01.831 --> 01:11:03.410
<v Speaker 3>they ended up firing me anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

1608
01:11:03.411 --> 01:11:05.900
<v Speaker 3>But the moral was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of convinced myself it was real.</v>

1609
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.940
<v Speaker 3>So by the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course they edit it like,</v>

1610
01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 hours and beyond that day,</v>

1611
01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:10.130
<v Speaker 3>like five minutes.</v>

1612
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.963
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like nuclear reactor having a </v>

1613
01:11:12.861 --> 01:11:14.700
<v Speaker 3>problem here and it really was happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

1614
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:15.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1615
01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:16.704
<v Speaker 3>and there was a missile fired from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia which was an icbm and they got </v>

1616
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:21.360
<v Speaker 3>shot down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was ABC News.</v>

1617
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:22.500
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

1618
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:24.000
<v Speaker 3>this isn't really happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1619
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Know we got prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always good to prepare,</v>

1620
01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.360
<v Speaker 3>but hopefully I'll get a reactor is </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a problem.</v>

1621
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some stuff's that.</v>

1622
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:33.120
<v Speaker 3>There was some outages and problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but government and MSM had hyped it.</v>

1623
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:36.300
<v Speaker 3>Then they used it to demonize </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative media.</v>

1624
01:11:36.301 --> 01:11:41.301
<v Speaker 3>Even then when it wasn't catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my gut told me it was bs.</v>

1625
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It was bs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so thank God I missed the whole 2012</v>

1626
01:11:45.571 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But still they said,</v>

1627
01:11:47.431 --> 01:11:48.264
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones says the world's ending the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bureau 2012 where he really starts when </v>

1628
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.073
<v Speaker 3>I say it's all a load of crap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't criticize you when I saw </v>

1629
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:56.280
<v Speaker 3>you doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I was balls deep.</v>

1630
01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.310
<v Speaker 3>And here's the thing.</v>

1631
01:12:01.690 --> 01:12:03.690
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the listers.</v>

1632
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.050
<v Speaker 3>They were pissed at me that I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>go into this thing.</v>

1633
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:08.700
<v Speaker 3>But it's fun for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1634
01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:09.534
<v Speaker 3>when you start talking about the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world are doomsday come and people </v>

1635
01:12:12.091 --> 01:12:14.670

<v Speaker 3>something to think about,</v>

1636

<v Speaker 3>but I guess here's a lot of people out </v>

<v Speaker 3>Washington Post now your listers are </v>

1656
01:13:06.571 --> 01:13:07.650
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was the one time I went,</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1658
01:13:08.371 --> 01:13:09.204
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had people on there were telling me </v>

1659
01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.500
<v Speaker 3>there was something that was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen on 2012.</v>

1660
01:13:13.501 --> 01:13:14.650
<v Speaker 3>They were sure of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1661
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.280
<v Speaker 3>not a bullied by doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You started stampeding like limits.</v>

1662
01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychological going on,</v>

1663
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:27.810
<v Speaker 3>just massive double crossing because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really used to be in the Ufos,</v>

1664
01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.750
<v Speaker 3>but the more you look into the Ufo is it</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like,</v>

1665
01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.500
<v Speaker 3>and that's another conspiracy.</v>

1666
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:33.953
<v Speaker 3>Looks like the government NASA deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he came into the meeting he </v>

1667
01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:40.044
<v Speaker 3>couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew this guy well and then the next </v>

1668
01:13:41.641 --> 01:13:42.690
<v Speaker 3>time he was going to meet with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

1669
01:13:42.691 --> 01:13:44.940
<v Speaker 3>His heart blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It blew up.</v>

1670
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bomb.</v>

1671
01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.770
<v Speaker 3>They said his heart completely ruptured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1672
01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:50.683
<v Speaker 3>the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his name was Raymond t and if you look </v>

1673
01:13:53.281 --> 01:13:54.114
<v Speaker 3>at mission control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the main guy as you control the </v>

1674
01:13:56.221 --> 01:13:57.480
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cameras and everything.</v>

1675
01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:00.480
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was house.</v>

1676
01:14:00.481 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 3>He had national security letters from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the president.</v>

1677
01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.550
<v Speaker 3>He'd run like secret operations in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cambodia and Laos.</v>

1678
01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:08.180
<v Speaker 3>He was an air force engineer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1679
01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.043
<v Speaker 3>he knew the whole deal and he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what whole day would you say to meet </v>

1680
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>with you and tell you everything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he would</v>

1681
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.790
<v Speaker 4>come and start gulping and he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get it out,</v>

1682
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.713
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get one out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he was so threatened or </v>

1683
01:14:18.611 --> 01:14:19.444
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't tell me about you think </v>

1684
01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He probably,</v>

1685
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:26.971
<v Speaker 4>he probably left and he was in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Raymond was telling me a lot.</v>

1686
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.351
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alex,</v>

1687
01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 4>your sources are right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were advanced technologies.</v>

1688
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:34.660
<v Speaker 4>We were worried the astronauts might </v>
<v Speaker 4>die.</v>

1689
01:14:34.661 --> 01:14:37.780
<v Speaker 4>They had two teams in orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One would the real ships.</v>

1690
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.040
<v Speaker 4>This is not a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

1691
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:40.143
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had one wheel pose in an orbit and </v>

1692
01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:45.490
<v Speaker 4>they were communicating with Kennedy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government.</v>

1693
01:14:45.491 --> 01:14:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Everybody and Nixon are gonna have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant thing about Americans,</v>

1694
01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:50.560
<v Speaker 4>number one and not have a backup plan of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the astronauts die.</v>

1695
01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:52.483
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put those headphones back on and lost </v>

1696
01:14:53.771 --> 01:14:55.940
<v Speaker 4>your fucking mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scott,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you into a corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on,</v>

1698
01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.890
<v Speaker 4>let him finish there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So tell me what you're trying to say.</v>

1699
01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.753
<v Speaker 4>Are you trying to say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the United States government cheek </v>

1700
01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:07.210
<v Speaker 4>was going to give me the secret of NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1701
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 4>And then he couldn't ever get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would get an order.</v>

1702
01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.940
<v Speaker 4>Now the second program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had a second program,</v>

1703
01:15:13.941 --> 01:15:14.774
<v Speaker 4>but how do you know he died?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he told me before the heart attack </v>

1704
01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:21.420
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of the hard time second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're dead on.</v>

1711
01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:37.540
<v Speaker 4>I was in control of the video and radio </v>
<v Speaker 4>communications and he was the Yoda Gvs.</v>

1712
01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.793
<v Speaker 4>Watch him on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's very important that guy </v>

1713
01:15:40.721 --> 01:15:45.220
<v Speaker 4>controlling the Canada mission control </v>
<v Speaker 4>the two backups behind that.</v>

1714
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.690
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

1715
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:48.700
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moon landings.</v>

1716
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:49.780
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

1717
01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:50.591
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you raised it.</v>

1718
01:15:50.591 --> 01:15:51.880
<v Speaker 4>You want them to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1719
01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.710
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

1720
01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:54.563
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's why I don't trust the </v>

1721
01:15:55.031 --> 01:15:57.120
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't trust it because they</v>

1722
01:15:57.121 --> 01:16:00.010
<v Speaker 4>ran,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't want to spend money,</v>

1723
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.040
<v Speaker 4>they ran a fake cop was just reentry </v>
<v Speaker 4>devices and basic stuff in space and did</v>

1724
01:16:05.351 --> 01:16:06.184
<v Speaker 4>shoot some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they had a real mission that </v>

1725
01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:09.430
<v Speaker 4>put the reflectors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything on the moon.</v>

1726
01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:10.870
<v Speaker 4>We went to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's no proof of that.</v>

1727
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.730
<v Speaker 4>So you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1728
01:16:12.731 --> 01:16:13.564
<v Speaker 4>you know that the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russian government with the secret </v>

1729
01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:17.350
<v Speaker 4>space program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alex,</v>

1730
01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:20.230
<v Speaker 4>you know that the Russian government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that the Russian government put</v>

1731
01:16:20.231 --> 01:16:21.064
<v Speaker 4>those lasers sight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those laser reflectors on the moon as </v>

1732
01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:24.560
<v Speaker 4>well with unmanned probes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1733
01:16:24.561 --> 01:16:26.320
<v Speaker 4>You know that right now there's still </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chinese.</v>

1734
01:16:26.321 --> 01:16:28.660
<v Speaker 4>The Chinese have a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's not like the,</v>

1735
01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.200
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1736
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:31.540
<v Speaker 4>there's weird evidence.</v>

1737
01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.840
<v Speaker 4>He went to them things that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just kidding.</v>

1738
01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:36.370
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This Alex,</v>

1739
01:16:36.371 --> 01:16:37.660
<v Speaker 4>you think they definitely went to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moon?</v>

1740
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:38.950
<v Speaker 4>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The footage is fake.</v>

1741
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:39.933
<v Speaker 4>Is that what she thinks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't bring film back to the Van </v>

1742
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:43.240
<v Speaker 4>Allen Radiation Belt to get spots all </v>
<v Speaker 4>over it,</v>

1743
01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:44.463
<v Speaker 4>but we don't have film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would lead us to believe that they </v>

1744
01:16:46.031 --> 01:16:48.610
<v Speaker 4>definitely did it because they had rca </v>
<v Speaker 4>cameras.</v>

1745
01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.700
<v Speaker 4>There was interest on the amazing </v>
<v Speaker 4>footage,</v>

1746
01:16:51.701 --> 01:16:52.534
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does amazing footage launch in space in </v>

1747
01:16:55.421 --> 01:16:56.254
<v Speaker 4>case the real mission died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So who's in the fake loan should show </v>

1748
01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:00.480
<v Speaker 4>you the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

1749
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.100
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>US military is in advance.</v>

1750
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:06.250
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1751
01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:07.540
<v Speaker 4>But let's let him go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let him answer this.</v>

1752
01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 4>Heady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we gotta you got to figure this out.</v>

1753
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:14.690
<v Speaker 4>So what you're saying is the one that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>saw on TV with Neil Armstrong,</v>

1754
01:17:14.691 --> 01:17:17.310
<v Speaker 4>one small step for man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all horse shit.</v>

1755
01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.590
<v Speaker 4>But the real one actually took place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just couldn't get the film back.</v>

1756
01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.320
<v Speaker 4>But Armstrong had been on real missions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes,</v>

1757
01:17:24.321 --> 01:17:26.220
<v Speaker 4>he definitely been unreal missions but </v>
<v Speaker 4>had.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He died before we met.</v>

1760

<v Speaker 4>We make our big jump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the whole point is,</v>

1841
01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:08.490
<v Speaker 4>suppose everything's laid on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 4>just perfect for humanity.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the major patents on it from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Westinghouse and others.</v>

1933
01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:19.420
<v Speaker 2>They use these big antennas to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate the weather.</v>

1934
01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:20.254
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China's like causing huge harp like </v>

1935
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:25.710
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all declassified.</v>

1936
01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Think heart manipulates the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether they admit it does.</v>

1937
01:25:28.361 --> 01:25:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I used to have the hand of Heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>general bitten k part.</v>

1938
01:25:31.211 --> 01:25:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Not all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>

1939
01:25:32.531 --> 01:25:33.364
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's giant weather modification </v>

1940
01:25:34.961 --> 01:25:38.230
<v Speaker 2>systems and there's weather wars between</v>
<v Speaker 2>different governments and they.</v>

1941
01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.440
<v Speaker 2>It's all declasse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain to people that are listening,</v>

1942
01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.190
<v Speaker 2>what harp is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it stand for?</v>

1943
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:45.430
<v Speaker 2>High altitude something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1944
01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:46.264
<v Speaker 2>They've got a system that supposedly you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what really was under </v>

1945
01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.080
<v Speaker 2>classification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it stand for?</v>

1946
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:53.350
<v Speaker 2>High frequency active auroral research </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs.</v>

1947
01:25:53.351 --> 01:25:54.184
<v Speaker 2>So the idea behind this was they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do research on the Aurora and didn't </v>

1948
01:25:58.121 --> 01:25:58.954
<v Speaker 2>they want to see if they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate using it and sending radio </v>

1949
01:26:01.331 --> 01:26:03.680
<v Speaker 2>waves?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horizon Radar,</v>

1950
01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:04.603
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1951
01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.533
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That and they also wanted to be able to </v>

1952
01:26:07.491 --> 01:26:10.600
<v Speaker 4>send radio signals to places where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't really know.</v>

1953
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.550
<v Speaker 4>What does that have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>stratospheric aerosol and just really go</v>

1954
01:26:13.551 --> 01:26:14.840
<v Speaker 4>into the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1955
01:26:14.841 --> 01:26:19.530
<v Speaker 4>the speculation this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've interviewed the private head of it.</v>

1956
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:22.123
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm to let him on my work with the </v>

1957
01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.220
<v Speaker 4>hottest harp work with the chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do they let me check goes on?</v>

1958
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:29.833
<v Speaker 4>Only A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>my chronic amount of small amount of </v>

1959
01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:32.453
<v Speaker 4>what harp does is in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bouncing off the Aurora borealis </v>

1960
01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:41.210
<v Speaker 4>and then resonating back through in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a deep earth,</v>

1961
01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:45.590
<v Speaker 4>a communication program to satellites </v>
<v Speaker 4>and other things through the planet,</v>

1962
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:49.100
<v Speaker 4>so it's something she can communicate </v>
<v Speaker 4>with satellites through the satellites,</v>

1963
01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:50.840
<v Speaker 4>down to the submarines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here it goes.</v>

1964
01:26:50.841 --> 01:26:53.420
<v Speaker 4>This is an actual business definition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How harp works.</v>

1965
01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.170
<v Speaker 4>The facilities transmitters send radio </v>
<v Speaker 4>waves according to hold on.</v>

1966
01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:58.003
<v Speaker 4>Let's just read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First waves upwards into the ionosphere </v>

1967
01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:00.884
<v Speaker 4>between 100 and 350 kilometers altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The resulting heating effect creates </v>

1968
01:27:04.911 --> 01:27:07.220
<v Speaker 4>irregularities and the electron density </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1969
01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:11.900
<v Speaker 4>which in turn allows communication </v>
<v Speaker 4>signals as from satellites to be relayed</v>

1970
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:14.750
<v Speaker 4>off the ionosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what it really does.</v>

1971
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.823
<v Speaker 4>Then they can shoot the shadow light </v>
<v Speaker 4>frequency coded through the Earth to </v>

1972
01:27:18.921 --> 01:27:19.760
<v Speaker 4>submarines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1973
01:27:19.761 --> 01:27:23.540
<v Speaker 4>what is this website from there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Jamie bully.</v>

1974
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.670
<v Speaker 4>You want the real stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you.</v>

1975
01:27:25.730 --> 01:27:26.563
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1976
01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me explain something.</v>

1977
01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dot Com.</v>

1978
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:32.970
<v Speaker 4>I had the head of the heart program on </v>
<v Speaker 4>just fucking.</v>

1979
01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:33.913
<v Speaker 4>I got contacted about 10 years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they said the head of the Hart project </v>

1980
01:27:36.681 --> 01:27:39.990
<v Speaker 4>really lecture work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He liked to come on interviews online.</v>

1981
01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:40.853
<v Speaker 4>He liked to come on and tell everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and about 30 minutes in a colonel came </v>

1982
01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:44.600
<v Speaker 4>on the line and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

1983
01:27:44.601 --> 01:27:47.690
<v Speaker 4>during a break and cut the guy off.</v>

1984
01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:51.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this really happened.</v>

1985
01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.960
<v Speaker 4>Q spooky music cue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spooky music,</v>

1986
01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:56.300
<v Speaker 4>but I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a true story.</v>

1987
01:27:56.301 --> 01:27:57.134
<v Speaker 4>I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know that I want another </v>

1988
01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.280
<v Speaker 4>relationship between like what are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chem trails have to do?</v>

1989
01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.353
<v Speaker 4>Do you think trump is going to look into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the SIA project at the CIA has green </v>

1990
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.340
<v Speaker 4>lit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is starting out with vaccines.</v>

1991
01:28:10.341 --> 01:28:13.010
<v Speaker 4>As I told people he would do </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigating and all the damage they've</v>

1992
01:28:13.011 --> 01:28:14.570
<v Speaker 4>caused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ultimate.</v>

1993
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.690
<v Speaker 4>That's good to start the vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get that shit together too,</v>

1994
01:28:17.691 --> 01:28:21.560
<v Speaker 4>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what about the SAI programs that the</v>

1995
01:28:21.561 --> 01:28:22.394
<v Speaker 4>CIA has greenlit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think he's going to get into that </v>

1996
01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:25.590
<v Speaker 4>next level?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Said,</v>

1997
01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:27.200
<v Speaker 4>we want him to communicate with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>microphones.</v>

1998
01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:32.201
<v Speaker 4>Internet shouldn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're so locked onto this.</v>

1999
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:35.840
<v Speaker 4>Here's the problem with all this asset </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2000
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:36.763
<v Speaker 4>Most of what you see when you see those </v>
<v Speaker 4>jets flying around those clouds behind </v>

2001
01:28:40.101 --> 01:28:44.150
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of that is just a fringe in exactly</v>

2002
01:28:44.151 --> 01:28:47.720
<v Speaker 4>the infusers that with a real program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the real progress?</v>

2003
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:48.261
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>

2004
01:28:48.261 --> 01:28:49.500
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so his job,</v>

2005
01:28:49.501 --> 01:28:52.020
<v Speaker 4>because the world is complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are secret and clauses,</v>

2006
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.863
<v Speaker 4>secret and public programs to test </v>
<v Speaker 4>manipulation of the weather and weather </v>

2007
01:28:55.221 --> 01:28:56.870
<v Speaker 4>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Arabs are doing it,</v>

2008
01:28:56.871 --> 01:28:57.704
<v Speaker 4>the Chinese are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Russians are doing people being </v>

2009
01:28:58.671 --> 01:29:00.930
<v Speaker 4>cloud seeding for a hundred years now</v>

2010
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:03.703
<v Speaker 3>whether manipulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're doing it for different </v>

2011
01:29:05.401 --> 01:29:08.830
<v Speaker 3>purposes in that not to produce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2012
01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:09.693
<v Speaker 3>I had been living keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The head of the US weather weapon </v>

2013
01:29:12.601 --> 01:29:16.610
<v Speaker 3>program for 27 years on my show first </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I saw it was he.</v>

2014
01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:18.690
<v Speaker 3>I saw that he was in the panhandle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>

2015
01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:22.860
<v Speaker 3>I called him running a major cloud </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeding company with his son and got the</v>

2016
01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:23.694
<v Speaker 3>90 year old to Austin and then after </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he totally freaked out because the </v>

2017
01:29:26.221 --> 01:29:29.280
<v Speaker 3>cio came to his house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want the interviews on Youtube?</v>

2018
01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to know what he said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2019
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.390
<v Speaker 3>he was a world war two fighter pilot and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said at the end of World War Two,</v>

2020
01:29:36.391 --> 01:29:40.350
<v Speaker 3>he flew the first planes and hurricanes </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Atlantic.</v>

2021
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.633
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty gangster and into typhoons</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are even faster in the Pacific and </v>

2022
01:29:45.961 --> 01:29:46.794
<v Speaker 3>then he and then he also let squadrons </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Vietnam flooding everything up to 10 </v>

2023
01:29:49.351 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 3>feet of water out of clear blue skies </v>
<v Speaker 3>with an hour's work with,</v>

2024
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.850
<v Speaker 3>with their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their chemicals pass.</v>

2025
01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 3>You have to be to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super bad ass.</v>

2026
01:29:58.230 --> 01:30:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Fly into a hurricane or a typhoon Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the first guy to do it.</v>

2027
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:03.120
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

2028
01:30:03.730 --> 01:30:04.770
<v Speaker 3>he's super bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2029
01:30:04.771 --> 01:30:06.660
<v Speaker 3>He's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been living at 90.</v>

2030
01:30:06.661 --> 01:30:10.230
<v Speaker 3>He was still all there and I thought not</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kicked my ass is big texts and I felt</v>

2031
01:30:10.231 --> 01:30:12.150
<v Speaker 3>like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy was with me anyways,</v>

2032
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.133
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're sitting there and he gives me </v>

2033
01:30:14.851 --> 01:30:15.684
<v Speaker 3>all this data and I can't believe and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>showed me all these classified photos </v>

2034
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:19.320
<v Speaker 3>and stuff because they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he classified the file.</v>

2035
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:22.650
<v Speaker 3>No one thought to call the old man from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lubbock or whatever it was.</v>

2036
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I call him,</v>

2037
01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:24.624
<v Speaker 3>I get him on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sent a bunch of people that their </v>

2038
01:30:26.311 --> 01:30:27.144
<v Speaker 3>company and threatened them the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>week after I heard it and he laid it </v>

2039
01:30:29.101 --> 01:30:32.970
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said in 1967 when we certified at the</v>

2040
01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Stanford Research Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was able to control hurricanes,</v>

2041
01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.930
<v Speaker 3>create hurricanes and steer hurricanes.</v>

2042
01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:38.123
<v Speaker 3>All that got black budgeted shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they got into these arrays </v>

2043
01:30:41.581 --> 01:30:43.680
<v Speaker 3>where they could use antennas and out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2044
01:30:43.681 --> 01:30:45.840
<v Speaker 3>and Westinghouse came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came the,</v>

2045
01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:46.491
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2046
01:30:46.491 --> 01:30:49.110
<v Speaker 3>the whole heart program show in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

2047
01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:52.170
<v Speaker 3>They could create control and steer or </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill hurricanes.</v>

2048
01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.213
<v Speaker 3>That's why you google now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill and Melinda Gates bought all those </v>

2049
01:30:55.621 --> 01:30:56.454
<v Speaker 3>patents and the quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates is going to save the world </v>

2050
01:30:58.681 --> 01:30:59.514
<v Speaker 3>from bad weather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates wants to stop hurricanes </v>

2051
01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.110
<v Speaker 3>googling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I.</v>

2052
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.480
<v Speaker 3>So let me build the weather machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me pause for a second.</v>

2053
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:06.343
<v Speaker 3>How does the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do,</v>

2054
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:09.510
<v Speaker 3>how do they manipulate a hurricane?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the hurricane's going to happen,</v>

2055
01:31:09.511 --> 01:31:11.010
<v Speaker 3>how do they break it up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2056
01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:14.940
<v Speaker 3>If it's was coming into lands there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with with Ariel arrays,</v>

2057
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.970
<v Speaker 3>projecting into the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can break it up or strengthen it or</v>

2058
01:31:17.971 --> 01:31:20.380
<v Speaker 3>kill it or steer it because it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative.</v>

2059
01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.440
<v Speaker 3>I miss doing that with harp will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got.</v>

2060
01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.210
<v Speaker 3>They've got heart bases all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2061
01:31:24.211 --> 01:31:26.490
<v Speaker 3>They call them doppler radar facilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2062
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:27.930
<v Speaker 3>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once your local city,</v>

2063
01:31:27.931 --> 01:31:28.764
<v Speaker 3>they have doppler radar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was so you could have a </v>

2064
01:31:30.601 --> 01:31:32.460
<v Speaker 3>guy in front of the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The script,</v>

2065
01:31:32.461 --> 01:31:34.020
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one 10th of one percent.</v>

2066
01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:37.370
<v Speaker 3>They can crank those arrays up that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a massive.</v>

2067
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Your lights might go when they do it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

2068
01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:41.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they'll use the whole power of </v>

2069
01:31:41.401 --> 01:31:44.670
<v Speaker 3>your town through the doppler radars and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they control it.</v>

2070
01:31:44.970 --> 01:31:45.803
<v Speaker 3>The US has a giant weather weapon hidden</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of everybody and every time </v>

2071
01:31:48.751 --> 01:31:51.960
<v Speaker 3>it's city and poor Russians and Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 3>are just discovering.</v>

2072
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:54.540
<v Speaker 3>All the US has weather weapons that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>knock them all out.</v>

2073
01:31:54.541 --> 01:31:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gate's control,</v>

2074
01:31:55.951 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 3>the weather ideas for barges to pump </v>
<v Speaker 3>water from the depth</v>

2075
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:03.400
<v Speaker 1>of the ocean to create some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>roadblock for the hurricane.</v>

2076
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Since her gains pull power from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water's warm,</v>

2077
01:32:06.371 --> 01:32:08.980
<v Speaker 1>temperature is cooling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water could have theoretically,</v>

2078
01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:12.880
<v Speaker 1>theoretically dismantle the hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2079
01:32:12.881 --> 01:32:16.140
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a good idea though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of the deployment is loving is it?</v>

2080
01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that sound like a genius idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You spray cold water until the trails.</v>

2081
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:24.670
<v Speaker 1>O'Brien Brennan in the front of the CFR </v>
<v Speaker 1>is saying,</v>

2082
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:25.504
<v Speaker 1>we were doing this because for global </v>
<v Speaker 1>warming and we got to save them about </v>

2083
01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:33.790
<v Speaker 1>about geoengineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chem trails.</v>

2084
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.490
<v Speaker 1>You were wrong about the dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not being rude,</v>

2085
01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:39.370
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about that?</v>

2086
01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.840
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're coming out saying,</v>

2087
01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:41.700
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna.</v>

2088
01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Be some countries that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That aren't going to be for it.</v>

2089
01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:45.523
<v Speaker 1>We got to figure out how we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with them because you want me to </v>

2090
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.520
<v Speaker 1>have the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big cigarette.</v>

2091
01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2092
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Was the big relation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep going with that.</v>

2093
01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:52.931
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2094
01:32:52.931 --> 01:32:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Don't change the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep going with that.</v>

2095
01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:57.430
<v Speaker 1>You're not done with Livingston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're here,</v>

2096
01:32:57.431 --> 01:32:58.610
<v Speaker 1>but imagine that me and Joe were </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

2097
01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.033
<v Speaker 1>You got me off on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want me here about Ronald Reagan to </v>

2098
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:06.370
<v Speaker 1>later finish the s a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know about this,</v>

2099
01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:10.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's a minor deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you know about the SSI program?</v>

2100
01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get this done.</v>

2101
01:33:12.311 --> 01:33:15.590
<v Speaker 1>When most of the real programs are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fronts for something else,</v>

2102
01:33:15.591 --> 01:33:18.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not even real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't think they're spraying shit</v>

2103
01:33:18.971 --> 01:33:19.890
<v Speaker 1>into the atmosphere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2104
01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:20.733
<v Speaker 1>There is a program for Geo Engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a program in place and you just </v>

2105
01:33:24.251 --> 01:33:25.084
<v Speaker 1>said it's the doppler radar system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>harp and what else and an aerial </v>

2106
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:30.970
<v Speaker 1>spraying still the most effective and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they do?</v>

2107
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.740
<v Speaker 1>They do have pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say an aerial spraying,</v>

2108
01:33:32.741 --> 01:33:33.574
<v Speaker 1>what are they spraying?</v>

2109
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Barium salts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alumina oxide.</v>

2110
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.633
<v Speaker 1>Radioactive isotopes in the air balloon </v>
<v Speaker 1>was because because it does a bunch of </v>

2111
01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're testing a bunch of stuff.</v>

2112
01:33:43.781 --> 01:33:45.310
<v Speaker 1>They're they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're manipulating things.</v>

2113
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our pedagogy,</v>

2114
01:33:47.150 --> 01:33:47.983
<v Speaker 1>why do you have evidence that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this and spraying aluminum and </v>

2115
01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:50.733
<v Speaker 1>Barium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is in line and the </v>

2116
01:33:52.690 --> 01:33:53.523
<v Speaker 1>Department of Energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all public.</v>

2117
01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Just like he just go online and watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese dude get jacked by a tiger.</v>

2118
01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:58.333
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how to go to the Department of </v>

2119
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Energy Dot Gov and you can watch cfr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CIA director at the time,</v>

2120
01:34:04.031 --> 01:34:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Brendan it admitting all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all public.</v>

2121
01:34:07.001 --> 01:34:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talked about,</v>

2122
01:34:08.650 --> 01:34:09.610
<v Speaker 1>but he'd know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

2123
01:34:09.611 --> 01:34:10.444
<v Speaker 1>I saw the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could play the video and go over it </v>

2124
01:34:11.741 --> 01:34:12.574
<v Speaker 1>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's talking about various options </v>

2125
01:34:13.901 --> 01:34:16.540
<v Speaker 1>for controlling global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're laying out the future.</v>

2126
01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if global warming is a guy.</v>

2127
01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

2128
01:34:19.871 --> 01:34:22.000
<v Speaker 1>If global warming is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know it is right.</v>

2129
01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:23.013
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think they would have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe global warming is </v>

2130
01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:25.453
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep measuring these temperatures and </v>

2131
01:34:27.311 --> 01:34:30.660
<v Speaker 1>scientists keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2132
01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:35.390
<v Speaker 1>well let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out what the real.</v>

2133
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believed that it was high.</v>

2134
01:34:37.691 --> 01:34:38.524
<v Speaker 1>It goes cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always micro temperature change </v>

2135
01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:41.733
<v Speaker 1>this shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was the only thing that ever </v>

2136
01:34:42.611 --> 01:34:45.970
<v Speaker 1>happened that's taxes to Al Gore won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>

2137
01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we all agree that the shifts,</v>

2138
01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is there absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>is global warming,</v>

2139
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:54.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the CEO?</v>

2140
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 1>The second talking house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When my dad</v>

2141
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.843
<v Speaker 7>was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the 19 fifties for three or four months </v>

2142
01:35:00.621 --> 01:35:01.454
<v Speaker 7>out of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was below zero or freezing and you </v>

2143
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:06.080
<v Speaker 7>had to chop wood and he'd freeze your </v>
<v Speaker 7>ass off and all houses had,</v>

2144
01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:07.730
<v Speaker 7>even in the south had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>had,</v>

2145
01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.820
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>had all sorts of chimneys and um,</v>

2146
01:35:10.821 --> 01:35:11.654
<v Speaker 7>for fireplaces because it was freezing </v>
<v Speaker 7>cold and now there has been a warming </v>

2147
01:35:14.841 --> 01:35:17.660
<v Speaker 7>period,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's part of a normal global cycle</v>

2148
01:35:17.661 --> 01:35:20.210
<v Speaker 7>based on the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All these astrophysicist or.</v>

2149
01:35:20.211 --> 01:35:21.044
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The whole thing about claiming it's the </v>

2150
01:35:22.221 --> 01:35:25.010
<v Speaker 7>carbon we put out the earth is carbon </v>
<v Speaker 7>star.</v>

2151
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.903
<v Speaker 7>There's a carbon cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the big story I want to get to </v>

2152
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:30.830
<v Speaker 7>the globalist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Want to tax if they can tax oxygen,</v>

2153
01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:32.720
<v Speaker 7>carbon dioxide,</v>
<v Speaker 7>water or sunlight,</v>

2154
01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:35.320
<v Speaker 7>they have total control over the whole </v>
<v Speaker 7>life cycle of the planet.</v>

2155
01:35:35.530 --> 01:35:36.830
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's play the video.</v>

2156
01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:37.930
<v Speaker 7>Let's play the video.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This,</v>

2157
01:35:37.931 --> 01:35:38.764
<v Speaker 7>this CIA guy talking about it because </v>
<v Speaker 7>what I inferred from and trying to come </v>

2158
01:35:42.111 --> 01:35:45.560
<v Speaker 7>up with some sort of solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if global warming becomes a giant,</v>

2159
01:35:45.561 --> 01:35:47.210
<v Speaker 7>White Brennan is a fricking known.</v>

2160
01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:48.043
<v Speaker 7>What hobbyist would show Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is the CIA that's watch the video </v>

2161
01:35:52.821 --> 01:35:54.920
<v Speaker 7>for global warming?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a good question.</v>

2162
01:35:54.921 --> 01:35:56.960
<v Speaker 7>What do they have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what the CIA does.</v>

2163
01:35:56.970 --> 01:35:57.803
<v Speaker 7>Due Diligence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were never built that stop the </v>

2164
01:36:01.041 --> 01:36:03.530
<v Speaker 7>spread of communism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's an intelligence agency.</v>

2165
01:36:03.531 --> 01:36:04.940
<v Speaker 7>They're part of the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2166
01:36:04.941 --> 01:36:07.940
<v Speaker 7>They were a part of the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 7>community and if they got hired,</v>

2167
01:36:07.941 --> 01:36:08.774
<v Speaker 7>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is just me guessing right off the </v>

2168
01:36:09.801 --> 01:36:13.700
<v Speaker 7>top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If they got hired to assess a threat and</v>

2169
01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.990
<v Speaker 7>a threat being from global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like what?</v>

2170
01:36:15.991 --> 01:36:18.020
<v Speaker 7>What do we have to worry about?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are we really going to lose cities?</v>

2171
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:20.270
<v Speaker 7>Do we really have an issue?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Goes Down,</v>

2172
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:24.980
<v Speaker 7>give George Soros and the UN total power</v>
<v Speaker 7>for a 100 trillion per decade.</v>

2173
01:36:24.981 --> 01:36:28.730
<v Speaker 7>Global tax to micromanaging,</v>
<v Speaker 7>surveil everything humans do.</v>

2174
01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:31.380
<v Speaker 7>Let's say is if carbons toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they've got to surveil it.</v>

2175
01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:33.350
<v Speaker 7>Thus they have a jurisdiction to control</v>
<v Speaker 7>our lives.</v>

2176
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:33.920
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hold on.</v>

2177
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.830
<v Speaker 7>Why does it say debunked?</v>
<v Speaker 7>CIA director admits chem trails,</v>

2178
01:36:36.831 --> 01:36:39.620
<v Speaker 7>geoengineering,</v>
<v Speaker 7>stratospheric aerosol injections.</v>

2179
01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:42.840
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so it says the claim guys,</v>

2180
01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:45.890
<v Speaker 7>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hold on.</v>

2181
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:46.783
<v Speaker 7>At the counsel admits geoengineering in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the form of stratospheric aerosol </v>

2182
01:36:50.601 --> 01:36:54.240
<v Speaker 7>injections.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sai is taking a place I eat.</v>

2183
01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:55.093
<v Speaker 7>Kempter is taking place it chem trails,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the rebuttal is nowhere in his </v>

2184
01:36:57.801 --> 01:36:58.634
<v Speaker 7>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is there an admission that an sai </v>

2185
01:37:00.111 --> 01:37:00.944
<v Speaker 7>program has already taken place?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The part where Brendan mentioned </v>

2186
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.943
<v Speaker 7>geoengineering is just one example.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Out of several not often mentioned </v>

2187
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:11.180
<v Speaker 7>issues with the CIA monitors for </v>
<v Speaker 7>potential elements of instability in the</v>

2188
01:37:11.181 --> 01:37:13.400
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A ski program,</v>

2189
01:37:13.401 --> 01:37:14.234
<v Speaker 7>if ever implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 7>could penetrate conflicts and security </v>

2190
01:37:16.641 --> 01:37:17.474
<v Speaker 7>threats if misused.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The CIA's jobs to consider all types of </v>

2191
01:37:20.691 --> 01:37:21.524
<v Speaker 7>concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>concepts for potential future problems </v>

2192
01:37:24.201 --> 01:37:27.500
<v Speaker 7>and threats,</v>
<v Speaker 7>including the science oriented concepts.</v>

2193
01:37:27.650 --> 01:37:29.320
<v Speaker 7>That's totally.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let me break down the right,</v>

2194
01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:30.770
<v Speaker 7>but isn't that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And we're done.</v>

2195
01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 7>But what that guy just said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that possible?</v>

2196
01:37:33.141 --> 01:37:34.760
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's basically what Brendan said,</v>

2197
01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.240
<v Speaker 7>but what he's saying is that there are </v>
<v Speaker 7>potential threats.</v>

2198
01:37:38.241 --> 01:37:39.380
<v Speaker 7>He only.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mentally,</v>

2199
01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:40.400
<v Speaker 7>it's an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2200
01:37:40.401 --> 01:37:42.700
<v Speaker 7>So he's not admitting that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's an Sar,</v>

2201
01:37:42.730 --> 01:37:43.850
<v Speaker 7>but let me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let me tell you.</v>

2202
01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:44.721
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go ahead.</v>

2203
01:37:44.721 --> 01:37:48.530
<v Speaker 7>Tell me everybody debates how many </v>
<v Speaker 7>programs there are,</v>

2204
01:37:48.531 --> 01:37:49.960
<v Speaker 7>all the specifics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of that's classical.</v>

2205
01:37:49.961 --> 01:37:53.110
<v Speaker 7>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can google Shyna launches,</v>

2206
01:37:53.130 --> 01:37:55.240
<v Speaker 7>major weather control operations 10 </v>
<v Speaker 7>years ago,</v>

2207
01:37:55.241 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or</v>

2208
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.610
<v Speaker 3>Qatar does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or Saudi Arabia or UK or for sure people</v>

2209
01:37:59.611 --> 01:38:00.150
<v Speaker 3>have studied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2210
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:00.983
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2211
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:02.520
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call it study.</v>

2212
01:38:02.690 --> 01:38:03.523
<v Speaker 3>There was a giant hell in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Department of Energy Program for </v>

2213
01:38:07.711 --> 01:38:08.544
<v Speaker 3>Aerosol testing was $5 million a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So under US Code Title Fifty Chapter </v>

2214
01:38:12.271 --> 01:38:14.820
<v Speaker 3>Thirty Two subsection 1,528,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paragraph B.</v>

2215
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.260
<v Speaker 3>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You nailed that,</v>

2216
01:38:16.261 --> 01:38:16.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2217
01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From under US code.</v>

2218
01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:22.290
<v Speaker 3>Do you live on that obelisk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was fucking insane.</v>

2219
01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Let me just tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get into.</v>

2220
01:38:23.791 --> 01:38:28.791
<v Speaker 3>Remember the time last time with Cheetah</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought under us.</v>

2221
01:38:30.241 --> 01:38:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Code title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finish Number Thirty 2,528,</v>

2222
01:38:33.481 --> 01:38:34.400
<v Speaker 3>paragraph B.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2223
01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:36.460
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Under that,</v>

2224
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:38.400
<v Speaker 3>say it's slow that Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Write it up.</v>

2225
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Jaylin was code title 50 chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say it fast.</v>

2226
01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Remember us code title 50 chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Statute Section 1,528,</v>

2227
01:38:45.991 --> 01:38:49.020
<v Speaker 3>paragraph eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>subsection 128.</v>

2228
01:38:49.050 --> 01:38:53.080
<v Speaker 3>The real fast brand fact speed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenya speech came and say it.</v>

2229
01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:56.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like one thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus us code section one.</v>

2230
01:38:56.790 --> 01:39:00.780
<v Speaker 3>There's restrictions on use of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjects for testing of chem trails.</v>

2231
01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back,</v>

2232
01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:02.280
<v Speaker 3>go back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

2233
01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.470
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or biological agents,</v>

2234
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.333
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do in this is they say it's </v>

2235
01:39:07.291 --> 01:39:09.960
<v Speaker 3>illegal to test unless it's for </v>
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>

2236
01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Then you're allowed to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was for research purpose.</v>

2237
01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:15.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how some of those Japanese whaler</v>

2238
01:39:15.451 --> 01:39:17.220
<v Speaker 3>vessels get away with killing whales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still.</v>

2239
01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:18.653
<v Speaker 3>They say it's for research purposes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they kill the whales and seldom dark </v>

2240
01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:22.650
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The elites,</v>

2241
01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:25.980
<v Speaker 3>the elites are the mad scientist </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineers.</v>

2242
01:39:26.130 --> 01:39:26.963
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give you the big secret man if you want </v>

2243
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:29.940
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding around.</v>

2244
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:30.803
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm not eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is they call their the high </v>

2245
01:39:33.031 --> 01:39:34.350
<v Speaker 3>priests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're scientists,</v>

2246
01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:37.440
<v Speaker 3>they're engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're allowed to kill people.</v>

2247
01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Test stuff on kids and jet black people </v>
<v Speaker 3>with syphilis,</v>

2248
01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.370
<v Speaker 3>all the declassified stuff because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are scientists.</v>

2249
01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.233
<v Speaker 3>All the real executioners tortures or </v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them were people making </v>

2250
01:39:48.661 --> 01:39:49.494
<v Speaker 3>decisions are doctors and so it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>medical doctor stuff in this big </v>

2251
01:39:52.921 --> 01:39:55.290
<v Speaker 3>breakaway civilization of scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

2252
01:39:55.291 --> 01:39:57.200
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what they've built and </v>
<v Speaker 3>under,</v>

2253
01:39:57.530 --> 01:40:01.620
<v Speaker 3>under under researched provisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could even kill anybody.</v>

2254
01:40:01.621 --> 01:40:02.251
<v Speaker 3>They want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2255
01:40:02.251 --> 01:40:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go back because we took </v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie turn on chem trails,</v>

2256
01:40:05.251 --> 01:40:06.084
<v Speaker 3>but we did it to side track from what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were saying about the moon and I </v>

2257
01:40:08.341 --> 01:40:09.174
<v Speaker 3>want to go back to what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you were saying that there was </v>

2258
01:40:10.711 --> 01:40:11.544
<v Speaker 3>two completely different missions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them was real and that there was </v>

2259
01:40:14.671 --> 01:40:17.690
<v Speaker 3>some sort of contact with aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2260
01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:19.910
<v Speaker 3>I was getting to that or I'm saying I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a top.</v>

2261
01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.110
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you were implying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taught?</v>

2262
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2263
01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:23.790
<v Speaker 3>let's just say this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mind blowing.</v>

2264
01:40:24.210 --> 01:40:25.043
<v Speaker 3>I was told by a top NASA individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Raymond Tig that indeed there was a </v>

2265
01:40:28.651 --> 01:40:29.484
<v Speaker 3>breakaway program and that he heard and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw transmissions on some back channels </v>

2266
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.633
<v Speaker 3>of real feeds and advanced ships that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd never even seen that basically </v>

2267
01:40:39.991 --> 01:40:40.824
<v Speaker 3>didn't even look like they were anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he could imagine that was </v>

2268
01:40:42.331 --> 01:40:43.164
<v Speaker 3>classified and he knew about some </v>
<v Speaker 3>classified programs for every program </v>

2269
01:40:46.201 --> 01:40:47.880
<v Speaker 3>you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was at least 10 programs that were</v>

2270
01:40:47.881 --> 01:40:48.210
<v Speaker 3>sacred.</v>

2271
01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:50.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a bit about NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent sacred or more,</v>

2272
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:52.830
<v Speaker 3>and so he knew about a cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch classified programs,</v>

2273
01:40:52.831 --> 01:40:53.664
<v Speaker 3>and he was shaking</v>

2274
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:54.933
<v Speaker 1>transmissions and things coming back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to people about a whole breakaway </v>

2275
01:40:58.001 --> 01:40:59.590
<v Speaker 1>program they sent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a lot safer,</v>

2276
01:40:59.591 --> 01:41:00.424
<v Speaker 1>a lot bigger than the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they had guys up in orbit just </v>

2277
01:41:03.221 --> 01:41:07.150
<v Speaker 1>basically so that even other foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments from the trajectory point,</v>

2278
01:41:07.151 --> 01:41:08.980
<v Speaker 1>we think they were getting transmissions</v>
<v Speaker 1>back from the moon.</v>

2279
01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So they had people out basically out </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the regular orbit.</v>

2280
01:41:11.981 --> 01:41:12.814
<v Speaker 1>We just go around in circles or is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>geosynchronous where you're in one spot </v>

2281
01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:16.443
<v Speaker 1>transmitting back from mathematical spot</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look like transmissions to full </v>

2282
01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:21.610
<v Speaker 1>directions and everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the real mission was going on,</v>

2283
01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:23.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the moon.</v>

2284
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:27.970
<v Speaker 1>So you believe they went to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that it was buzz Aldrin and</v>

2285
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Neil Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clickonomy everything.</v>

2286
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:32.830
<v Speaker 1>He died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2287
01:41:32.831 --> 01:41:35.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to meet with you tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he done too.</v>

2288
01:41:35.770 --> 01:41:38.100
<v Speaker 1>That's like a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me I'm ready.</v>

2289
01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he was just totally,</v>

2290
01:41:41.291 --> 01:41:43.300
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he did admit to you that,</v>

2291
01:41:43.670 --> 01:41:45.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the public got was fake.</v>

2292
01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2293
01:41:48.150 --> 01:41:49.530
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2294
01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 1>there's some footage from the moon that </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks so ridiculous and most people have</v>

2295
01:41:53.741 --> 01:41:57.250
<v Speaker 1>never seen some footage of them that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

2296
01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.113
<v Speaker 1>here's the big speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the really big ones was </v>

2297
01:42:00.330 --> 01:42:01.163
<v Speaker 1>that there was a lot of footage that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did where they were doing tests </v>

2298
01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:07.420
<v Speaker 1>that they wound up just using for press </v>
<v Speaker 1>releases.</v>

2299
01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:08.254
<v Speaker 1>They using like to say this is actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>footage on the right stuff for the </v>

2300
01:42:12.341 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 1>project because they wanted to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed of it,</v>

2301
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:15.783
<v Speaker 1>the real truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a thing with Michael </v>

2302
01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gemini Fifteen,</v>

2303
01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:20.163
<v Speaker 1>there was a test photo of him with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a test rig on and it was like suspended </v>

2304
01:42:25.151 --> 01:42:26.770
<v Speaker 1>and you can see the background behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2305
01:42:26.770 --> 01:42:30.610
<v Speaker 1>It was clear that he was suspended on </v>
<v Speaker 1>wires and they took that same photo in,</v>

2306
01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:35.320
<v Speaker 1>blacked it out and used it as a press </v>
<v Speaker 1>photo of him on an actual space walk.</v>

2307
01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:38.230
<v Speaker 1>But it's the same exact photo stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2308
01:42:38.231 --> 01:42:40.400
<v Speaker 1>They do that where they just go over it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it back then.</v>

2309
01:42:40.401 --> 01:42:41.990
<v Speaker 1>And you see you actually use an exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain.</v>

2310
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>

2311
01:42:43.001 --> 01:42:44.640
<v Speaker 1>when he was just like a junior in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

2312
01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:45.493
<v Speaker 1>was in the plan to program at ut and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they already had cd roms and computers </v>

2313
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:52.480
<v Speaker 1>and they had a nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plant under,</v>

2314
01:42:52.481 --> 01:42:53.314
<v Speaker 1>but nobody knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad going about this when I was a </v>

2315
01:42:55.211 --> 01:42:57.650
<v Speaker 1>teenager and I would like later go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the library,</v>

2316
01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.380
<v Speaker 1>couldn't find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I googled it.</v>

2317
01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:00.214
<v Speaker 1>It's not even really in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've gone to ut and talked to them </v>

2318
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:02.951
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2319
01:43:02.951 --> 01:43:06.310
<v Speaker 1>you know about the reactor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the building reactor that Austin's got.</v>

2320
01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:07.253
<v Speaker 1>And then no one even knew that Austin </v>
<v Speaker 1>has two nuclear reactors in North </v>

2321
01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.213
<v Speaker 1>Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2322
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the poem was my.</v>

2323
01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:14.410
<v Speaker 1>That was for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was after he was in college.</v>

2324
01:43:14.411 --> 01:43:17.320
<v Speaker 1>They built a reactor under which </v>
<v Speaker 1>building in Austin,</v>

2325
01:43:17.321 --> 01:43:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's big.</v>

2326
01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a big railway system under there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2327
01:43:20.821 --> 01:43:23.830
<v Speaker 1>it's built right under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right under,</v>

2328
01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.090
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gesture.</v>

2329
01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:28.840
<v Speaker 1>So there's a nuclear reactor in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

2330
01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:31.650
<v Speaker 1>How many people know about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2331
01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.210
<v Speaker 1>it's in the literature and my dad told </v>
<v Speaker 1>me about it when I was a kid.</v>

2332
01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2333
01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:36.213
<v Speaker 1>I believe my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad told me about Dallas hospital </v>

2334
01:43:38.201 --> 01:43:41.200
<v Speaker 1>that was killing people for their organs</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like six years later.</v>

2335
01:43:41.201 --> 01:43:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I saw it on 60 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2336
01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:46.030
<v Speaker 1>They were killing people for organs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2337
01:43:46.210 --> 01:43:49.690
<v Speaker 1>My Dad told me about that in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas on 60 minutes.</v>

2338
01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad said when I was 16 years</v>

2339
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.660
<v Speaker 4>ago or 15 taken driver's course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she said,</v>

2340
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:56.360
<v Speaker 4>don't sign that organ donor card.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know hospitals that kill you.</v>

2341
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:57.530
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

2342
01:43:57.531 --> 01:43:58.081
<v Speaker 4>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're kidding.</v>

2343
01:43:58.081 --> 01:43:58.914
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2344
01:43:59.140 --> 01:43:59.973
<v Speaker 4>He was an oral surgeon and rewired jaws </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've heard this one killed </v>

2345
01:44:01.471 --> 01:44:03.950
<v Speaker 4>people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is one of the creepiest things you ever.</v>

2346
01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine doctors that get </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickbacks for Oregon's.</v>

2347
01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 4>They kind of let the see stars are seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>as the highest caste,</v>

2348
01:44:11.361 --> 01:44:12.194
<v Speaker 4>but the elite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're the ones pulling all the </v>

2349
01:44:13.410 --> 01:44:14.241
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>

2350
01:44:14.241 --> 01:44:15.074
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know how creepy it would be like to </v>

2351
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:19.100
<v Speaker 4>find out that a nurse that you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>working with was killing people,</v>

2352
01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:23.450
<v Speaker 4>but that's a story that happens over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over until the crazy smart killer.</v>

2353
01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:25.490
<v Speaker 4>There's been a bunch they get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get.</v>

2354
01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:25.810
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2355
01:44:25.810 --> 01:44:26.171
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2356
01:44:26.171 --> 01:44:27.004
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2357
01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:29.930
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These nurses that say nurses decide they</v>

2358
01:44:29.931 --> 01:44:31.790
<v Speaker 4>don't want to take care of somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they poisoned them.</v>

2359
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:32.833
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have someone that maybe someone's </v>

2360
01:44:33.771 --> 01:44:34.604
<v Speaker 4>dying slow and they don't like it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they just get tired of dealing with </v>

2361
01:44:37.101 --> 01:44:39.560
<v Speaker 4>their bullshit some of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The district.</v>

2362

2364
01:44:43.461 --> 01:44:44.990
<v Speaker 4>about facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're absolutely on target.</v>

2365
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:48.220
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's no worse than everything.</v>

2366
01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:52.430
<v Speaker 4>Everything I know and you're on target.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just pretend you're not.</v>

2367
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:56.540
<v Speaker 4>No one just knew that document off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>top of your head like that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2378
01:45:18.561 --> 01:45:20.120
<v Speaker 4>the problem is when we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>headphones on,</v>

2379
01:45:20.121 --> 01:45:21.020
<v Speaker 4>we talk over each other.</v>

2380
01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:23.600
<v Speaker 4>It's hard when three people are talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2381
01:45:23.610 --> 01:45:24.411
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2382
01:45:24.411 --> 01:45:26.260
<v Speaker 4>it's none of our fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just natural.</v>

2383

<v Speaker 4>The conspiracy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Totally different.</v>

2387
01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:35.080
<v Speaker 4>I love how I haven't had any success.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Put the headphones back on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2393
01:45:45.450 --> 01:45:48.810
<v Speaker 4>We have to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I need to know.</v>

2394
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:52.400
<v Speaker 4>I need to know what do you know about </v>
<v Speaker 4>aliens and how much are aliens?</v>

2395
01:45:52.401 --> 01:45:53.234

<v Speaker 4>Put another shot of that media at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>south property.</v>

2399
01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:03.860
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does Donald Trump know about?</v>

2403
01:46:09.471 --> 01:46:11.540

<v Speaker 4>deserves it.</v>

2404
01:46:11.541 --> 01:46:15.200
<v Speaker 4>That's the first thing I did.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Who's got them?</v>

2407
01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.470

<v Speaker 4>want to know.</v>

2429
01:47:03.061 --> 01:47:03.894
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was like an old comic book about </v>

2430
01:47:05.161 --> 01:47:05.994
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about some dude who was a forgetful </v>

2431
01:47:08.401 --> 01:47:09.234
<v Speaker 7>professor and then he realized at the </v>
<v Speaker 7>end of it he was actually an alien from </v>

2432
01:47:11.671 --> 01:47:14.100
<v Speaker 7>another planet that's sent down here to </v>
<v Speaker 7>monitor people.</v>

2433
01:47:14.101 --> 01:47:16.320
<v Speaker 7>He just forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2434
01:47:16.321 --> 01:47:18.750
<v Speaker 7>here's what the elite belief,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and let me be very clear as to what.</v>

2435
01:47:18.751 --> 01:47:21.330
<v Speaker 7>He'll tell you some context.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I only go with what I can prove.</v>

2436
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:22.060
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>thank you.</v>

2437
01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:23.790
<v Speaker 7>And people can't even handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2438
01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:24.653
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm really surprised how much you knew </v>

2439
01:47:25.171 --> 01:47:28.140
<v Speaker 7>every angle of so called pizza gate that</v>
<v Speaker 7>I even forgot.</v>

2440
01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:29.550
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's to meet.</v>

2441
01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:31.860
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>obviously we both have children and when</v>

2442
01:47:31.861 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 7>you hear about someone that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 7>molest children,</v>

2443
01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.450
<v Speaker 7>it's a special kind of evil to special </v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's.</v>

2444
01:47:39.450 --> 01:47:40.283
<v Speaker 7>And it's also a special kind of bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 7>twisted sickness that the human mind is </v>

2445
01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:50.400
<v Speaker 7>capable of latching onto the programming</v>
<v Speaker 7>to want to take care of kids and be nice</v>

2446
01:47:50.401 --> 01:47:51.234
<v Speaker 7>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's something very crazy about </v>

2447
01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:54.293
<v Speaker 7>people's brains and there's something </v>
<v Speaker 7>very crazy about the weird variables </v>

2448
01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:02.010
<v Speaker 7>that can potentially happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I agree with all sorts of weird,</v>

2449
01:48:02.011 --> 01:48:05.130
<v Speaker 7>crazy aberrations in standard behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know like this,</v>

2450
01:48:05.131 --> 01:48:07.830
<v Speaker 7>the standard behavior of bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 7>that are just normal folks.</v>

2451
01:48:07.831 --> 01:48:09.060
<v Speaker 7>You got kids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got kids.</v>

2452
01:48:09.061 --> 01:48:10.500
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>get the kids together for a play date.</v>

2453
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:11.940
<v Speaker 7>You sit down and you have a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 7>beers.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Bob Guyton.</v>

2456
01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.960
<v Speaker 7>Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's fucking normal shit right?</v>

2457
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.450
<v Speaker 7>When you're normal and there's normal </v>
<v Speaker 7>people around you,</v>

2458
01:48:18.451 --> 01:48:20.850
<v Speaker 7>you assume that everybody is basically a</v>
<v Speaker 7>good person.</v>

2459
01:48:20.851 --> 01:48:21.684
<v Speaker 7>We all have our problems.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Normal that your wife comes into the </v>

2460
01:48:24.181 --> 01:48:24.870
<v Speaker 7>bedroom.</v>

2461
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:26.130
<v Speaker 7>She,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you get going.</v>

2462
01:48:26.131 --> 01:48:28.410
<v Speaker 7>You don't look at a five year old and </v>
<v Speaker 7>think that's what I want.</v>

2463
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:29.263
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's some were trying to say is </v>

2464
01:48:30.691 --> 01:48:34.320
<v Speaker 7>there's some people out there that have </v>
<v Speaker 7>this horrific programming.</v>

2465
01:48:34.321 --> 01:48:35.154
<v Speaker 7>Whatever the fuck it is that causes it </v>
<v Speaker 7>as a bunch of psychologists trying to </v>

2466
01:48:37.831 --> 01:48:38.664
<v Speaker 7>speculate and figure out what causes to </v>
<v Speaker 7>be beat in the head with a ball pin </v>

2467
01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:43.220
<v Speaker 7>hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The thing is it's real and it's.</v>

2468
01:48:43.221 --> 01:48:44.680
<v Speaker 7>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Candida.</v>

2469
01:48:44.710 --> 01:48:45.543
<v Speaker 7>It's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We can't deny it's real and it's also </v>

2470
01:48:47.150 --> 01:48:50.190
<v Speaker 7>like fucking jared from subway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the subway guy,</v>

2471
01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:54.750
<v Speaker 7>the subway guys in jail for being a </v>
<v Speaker 7>pedophile and they fuck they came up and</v>

2472
01:48:54.751 --> 01:48:58.140
<v Speaker 7>they usually have high intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's armies were fighting a pedophile</v>

2473
01:48:58.141 --> 01:48:58.974
<v Speaker 7>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but beyond that it's a vampire </v>

2474
01:49:00.481 --> 01:49:01.314
<v Speaker 7>conspiracy and that they are </v>
<v Speaker 7>interdimensionally sucking the essence </v>

2475
01:49:04.891 --> 01:49:08.940
<v Speaker 7>of our youth and they believe they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>possessed by an off world entity.</v>

2476
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.560
<v Speaker 7>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2477
01:49:10.561 --> 01:49:12.510
<v Speaker 7>And Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been on air 22 years.</v>

2478
01:49:12.511 --> 01:49:15.240
<v Speaker 7>I don't get into aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 7>metaphysical religion,</v>

2479
01:49:15.241 --> 01:49:16.074
<v Speaker 7>any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've studied the elite and I've also </v>

2480
01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:19.330
<v Speaker 7>communicated with a lot of the top </v>
<v Speaker 7>people and,</v>

2481
01:49:19.331 --> 01:49:20.610
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and if you want to know,</v>

2482
01:49:20.910 --> 01:49:24.240
<v Speaker 7>I will actually break down right now the</v>
<v Speaker 7>best knowledge right now.</v>

2483
01:49:24.241 --> 01:49:25.980
<v Speaker 7>What's happening on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's happening?</v>

2484
01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:29.050
<v Speaker 7>Let me give you a basic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just sculpt.</v>

2485
01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:30.053
<v Speaker 7>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love when you can use that word with </v>

2486
01:49:31.171 --> 01:49:33.360
<v Speaker 7>full confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've never said that.</v>

2487
01:49:33.361 --> 01:49:35.880
<v Speaker 7>Let me give you a basic gestalt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd be like,</v>

2488
01:49:35.881 --> 01:49:37.170
<v Speaker 7>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's such a fraud.</v>

2489
01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:38.161
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're not,</v>

2490
01:49:38.161 --> 01:49:38.994
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's what I would think if I use </v>

2491
01:49:39.571 --> 01:49:41.220
<v Speaker 7>that word now you'll get all this shit </v>
<v Speaker 7>you already have.</v>

2492
01:49:41.221 --> 01:49:44.670
<v Speaker 7>Most of the static is you're a bookworm </v>
<v Speaker 7>or research warm and a good way.</v>

2493
01:49:46.050 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 7>The elite are all about transcendence</v>

2494
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:48.933
<v Speaker 3>and living forever and the secrets of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe and they want to know all </v>

2495
01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:51.881
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some are good,</v>

2496
01:49:51.881 --> 01:49:53.200
<v Speaker 3>some are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some are a mix,</v>

2497
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:54.723
<v Speaker 3>but the good ones don't ever want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>organize the battles and want to </v>

2498
01:49:57.191 --> 01:49:58.024
<v Speaker 3>organize because they lost after power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Powerful consciousness don't want to </v>

2499
01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:02.224
<v Speaker 3>dominate other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to empower them so they don't </v>

2500
01:50:03.671 --> 01:50:06.490
<v Speaker 3>tend to get together until things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really late in the game.</v>

2501
01:50:06.491 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Then they come together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Evils always defeated because good is so</v>

2502
01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:13.360
<v Speaker 3>much stronger and we're on this planet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Einstein's physics shut at.</v>

2503
01:50:13.361 --> 01:50:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Max Planck says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut her off.</v>

2504
01:50:14.701 --> 01:50:15.534
<v Speaker 3>There's at least 12 dimensions and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all the top scientists and </v>

2505
01:50:18.071 --> 01:50:20.500
<v Speaker 3>billionaires are coming out saying it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a false hologram.</v>

2506
01:50:20.501 --> 01:50:21.334
<v Speaker 3>It is artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The computers are scanning and and </v>

2507
01:50:23.711 --> 01:50:24.544
<v Speaker 3>finding tension points where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificially projected and gravity's </v>

2508
01:50:28.061 --> 01:50:31.580
<v Speaker 3>bleeding in to this universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they call it.</v>

2509
01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:32.413
<v Speaker 3>Dark matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're like a thought or a dream </v>

2510
01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:38.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a whisk in some computer program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some God's mind,</v>

2511
01:50:38.621 --> 01:50:41.950
<v Speaker 3>whatever they're approving it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all coming out now.</v>

2512
01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.233
<v Speaker 3>There's like this sub transmission zone </v>
<v Speaker 3>below the third dimension that's just </v>

2513
01:50:46.751 --> 01:50:47.584
<v Speaker 3>turned over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most horrible things is what it </v>

2514
01:50:48.371 --> 01:50:51.760
<v Speaker 3>resonates to and it's trying to get up </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the third dimension.</v>

2515
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:52.833
<v Speaker 3>That's just a basic level consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>to launch into the next levels and our </v>

2516
01:50:56.831 --> 01:50:59.200
<v Speaker 3>species is already way up at the fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixth dimension,</v>

2517
01:50:59.210 --> 01:51:00.043
<v Speaker 3>consciously our best people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's this big war trying to like </v>

2518
01:51:03.071 --> 01:51:03.904
<v Speaker 3>basically destroy humanity because </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity has free will and there's a </v>

2519
01:51:07.241 --> 01:51:09.670
<v Speaker 3>decision to which level we want to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2520
01:51:09.671 --> 01:51:10.504
<v Speaker 3>We have freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so evil is allowed to come and content </v>

2521
01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:17.280
<v Speaker 3>not just good and the athletes </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves believe they're racing.</v>

2522
01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:19.493
<v Speaker 3>We using human technology to try to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>our best minds and build some type of </v>

2523
01:51:23.441 --> 01:51:26.980
<v Speaker 3>breakaway civilization where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to merge with machines,</v>

2524
01:51:26.981 --> 01:51:30.010
<v Speaker 3>transcend and breakaway from the failed </v>
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>

2525
01:51:30.010 --> 01:51:30.843
<v Speaker 3>That is man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of like a false </v>

2526
01:51:31.961 --> 01:51:34.750
<v Speaker 3>transmission because they're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they are is ugly and bad.</v>

2527
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Projecting it onto themselves instead of</v>
<v Speaker 3>believing notes,</v>

2528
01:51:37.570 --> 01:51:42.400
<v Speaker 3>a human test about building us up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so google was set up 18,</v>

2529
01:51:42.401 --> 01:51:43.480
<v Speaker 3>19 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was.</v>

2530
01:51:43.481 --> 01:51:44.860
<v Speaker 3>I knew about this before it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>declassified.</v>

2531
01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:45.753
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying I've good sources that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to build a giant artificial </v>

2532
01:51:48.761 --> 01:51:49.594
<v Speaker 3>system and Google believes that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first artificial intelligence will be a </v>

2533
01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:54.553
<v Speaker 3>super computer based on the neuron </v>
<v Speaker 3>activities of the hive mind of humanity </v>

2534
01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:00.573
<v Speaker 3>with billions of people wired into it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the Internet of things and so all </v>

2535
01:52:03.461 --> 01:52:04.294
<v Speaker 3>of our thoughts go into it and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually building a computer that has </v>

2536
01:52:06.671 --> 01:52:07.504
<v Speaker 3>real neurons in real time that's also </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychically connected to us that are </v>

2537
01:52:11.141 --> 01:52:16.141
<v Speaker 3>organic creatures so that they will have</v>
<v Speaker 3>current prediction powers,</v>

2538
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:19.000
<v Speaker 3>future prediction powers a true crystal </v>
<v Speaker 3>ball.</v>

2539
01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:23.260
<v Speaker 3>But the big secret is once you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crystal ball and know the future,</v>

2540
01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:27.700
<v Speaker 3>you can add stimuli beforehand and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions that control the future.</v>

2541
01:52:27.850 --> 01:52:28.683
<v Speaker 3>And so then it's the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and free will for </v>

2542
01:52:30.941 --> 01:52:34.120
<v Speaker 3>individuals as we know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a true two point,</v>

2543
01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:35.320
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a very bad way.</v>

2544
01:52:35.410 --> 01:52:36.243
<v Speaker 3>Hive mind consciousness with an ai </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacked into everyone knowing our hopes </v>

2545
01:52:39.641 --> 01:52:41.530
<v Speaker 3>and dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delivering it to us,</v>

2546
01:52:41.531 --> 01:52:42.364
<v Speaker 3>not in some pkd wire head system where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we plug in and give up on consciousness </v>

2547
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:48.590
<v Speaker 3>because of unlimited pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because we were already wired in and</v>

2548
01:52:48.591 --> 01:52:49.424
<v Speaker 3>absorbed before we knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by giving over our consciousness to the </v>

2549
01:52:52.071 --> 01:52:52.904
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our daily decisions that it was able to </v>

2550
01:52:54.351 --> 01:52:56.660
<v Speaker 3>manipulate and control into a larger </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

2551
01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:57.733
<v Speaker 3>There's now a human counterstrike taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>place to shut this off before it gets </v>

2552
01:53:01.071 --> 01:53:01.904
<v Speaker 3>fully into place and to block these </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems and to try to have an actual </v>

2553
01:53:04.761 --> 01:53:05.594
<v Speaker 3>debate about where humanity goes and cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>off the pedophiles and psychic vampires </v>

2554
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:12.980
<v Speaker 3>that are control of this ai system </v>
<v Speaker 3>before humanity is destroyed.</v>

2555
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is only controlled of Ai.</v>

2556
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:17.920
<v Speaker 3>How'd they get had the pedophiles </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting control of the pet,</v>

2557
01:53:17.921 --> 01:53:19.180
<v Speaker 3>the pedophiles at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2558
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:21.770
<v Speaker 3>at whatever level rule the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call it.</v>

2559
01:53:21.771 --> 01:53:24.770
<v Speaker 3>This interdimensional thing that gives </v>
<v Speaker 3>them advanced offworld technology.</v>

2560
01:53:24.771 --> 01:53:25.604
<v Speaker 3>The fallen one that's not of this world </v>
<v Speaker 3>is giving them advanced systems have </v>

2561
01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.500
<v Speaker 3>been used before on other populations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What that Satan.</v>

2562
01:53:33.650 --> 01:53:34.483
<v Speaker 3>But what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say explain that you just see </v>

2563
01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:38.133
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that you know the stupid </v>

2564
01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:40.573
<v Speaker 3>preacher tells you about who's totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled or something you read about </v>

2565
01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.040
<v Speaker 3>in the news or TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2566
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:49.700
<v Speaker 3>This is an interdimensional force that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to influence us to build something</v>

2567
01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:53.150
<v Speaker 3>that absorbs us and kills us rather than</v>
<v Speaker 3>the divine.</v>

2568
01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:54.303
<v Speaker 3>A freewill we're given to build </v>
<v Speaker 3>something much better than empowers the </v>

2569
01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:58.453
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the species is now making a decision </v>

2570
01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:01.970
<v Speaker 3>on its entire future.</v>

2571
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.370
<v Speaker 3>When you're getting this from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that,</v>

2572
01:54:03.371 --> 01:54:04.940
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But where are you getting it?</v>

2573
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:07.370
<v Speaker 3>I know from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from looking at all the data,</v>

2574
01:54:07.371 --> 01:54:09.980
<v Speaker 3>researching and studying it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching the enemy,</v>

2575
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:13.340
<v Speaker 3>that's the big decision that humanity </v>
<v Speaker 3>has now got before us.</v>

2576
01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:17.270
<v Speaker 3>So if you were directing someone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigate this on their own,</v>

2577
01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:20.190
<v Speaker 3>how would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you say,</v>

2578
01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.680
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get someplace.</v>

2579
01:54:21.710 --> 01:54:25.700
<v Speaker 3>Finally in deep research where it's what</v>
<v Speaker 3>every culture already said,</v>

2580
01:54:25.701 --> 01:54:27.170
<v Speaker 3>what everybody already knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're telling you.</v>

2581
01:54:27.171 --> 01:54:28.004
<v Speaker 3>A movies like promethium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the elite admit the New York Times </v>

2582
01:54:30.621 --> 01:54:31.990
<v Speaker 3>they believe in is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2583
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:35.240
<v Speaker 3>a seated by offworld systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Panspermia,</v>

2584
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:36.260
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything,</v>

2585
01:54:36.261 --> 01:54:37.094
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing points towards this and </v>

2586
01:54:38.691 --> 01:54:41.810
<v Speaker 3>then you read their own writings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believe we're this ugly,</v>

2587
01:54:41.811 --> 01:54:43.730
<v Speaker 3>fallen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ugly species.</v>

2588
01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:44.593
<v Speaker 3>We're all going to be killed there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rich billionaires who are better </v>

2589
01:54:47.031 --> 01:54:47.864
<v Speaker 3>than us and they're going to merge with </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines and become gods and go to the </v>

2590
01:54:50.181 --> 01:54:50.690
<v Speaker 3>next level.</v>

2591
01:54:50.690 --> 01:54:51.523
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think that most people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>extrapolate from where we stand today </v>

2592
01:54:54.411 --> 01:54:55.244
<v Speaker 3>with our cell phones and our apple </v>
<v Speaker 3>watches and our integration with the </v>

2593
01:54:57.681 --> 01:54:58.514
<v Speaker 3>computer and the Internet constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that most people see </v>

2594
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:03.980
<v Speaker 3>that there's going to be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbiotic connection?</v>

2595
01:55:04.190 --> 01:55:06.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a very easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were saying it before.</v>

2596
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people were saying,</v>

2597
01:55:08.110 --> 01:55:10.760
<v Speaker 3>but here's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who engineered what we were given?</v>

2598
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.190
<v Speaker 3>What is the point of the back door at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Trojan horses?</v>

2599
01:55:13.191 --> 01:55:14.024
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I'm Jenny who engineered </v>

2600
01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:15.700
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what.</v>

2601
01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The elite,</v>

2602
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:21.410
<v Speaker 3>the elite literally believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>interdimensionally.</v>

2603
01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:24.800
<v Speaker 3>They were given this information and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then built it and here's the thing.</v>

2604
01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:25.813
<v Speaker 3>They built it and Google admits he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have data dumps to wire two years ago </v>

2605
01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:31.513
<v Speaker 3>that they're building an ai that will in</v>
<v Speaker 3>human consciousness freewill and take </v>

2606
01:55:34.691 --> 01:55:37.010
<v Speaker 3>over and the next species will rise out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

2607
01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:39.680
<v Speaker 3>They've already decided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our species people have been taught.</v>

2608
01:55:39.681 --> 01:55:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Marshall Mcluhan was talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>50 fucking ago.</v>

2609
01:55:43.381 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Here's the old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They</v>

2610
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:44.843
<v Speaker 7>built it Amazon two years ago at mets.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They can already with 99 percent </v>

2611
01:55:48.511 --> 01:55:51.270
<v Speaker 7>certainty pick what their regular users </v>
<v Speaker 7>are going to order.</v>

2612
01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.800
<v Speaker 7>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 7>before they hold on a second,</v>

2613
01:55:52.801 --> 01:55:56.160
<v Speaker 7>ready instead of dragging this out to </v>
<v Speaker 7>some nefarious end,</v>

2614
01:55:56.190 --> 01:55:58.660
<v Speaker 7>isn't it entirely possible that all </v>
<v Speaker 7>these futurists,</v>

2615
01:55:58.670 --> 01:55:59.503
<v Speaker 7>all these technological innovators,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they all see the same end game if </v>

2616
01:56:03.331 --> 01:56:06.870
<v Speaker 7>there's going to be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>complete integration between people,</v>

2617
01:56:06.871 --> 01:56:07.704
<v Speaker 7>but it's the artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 7>that historically everybody saw this </v>

2618
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:11.670
<v Speaker 7>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>

2619
01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:13.350
<v Speaker 7>and so this big,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all the futurists,</v>

2620
01:56:13.351 --> 01:56:14.184
<v Speaker 7>all the people that started in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>future before a silicon chips were </v>

2621
01:56:17.101 --> 01:56:19.410
<v Speaker 7>created.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The point Marshall Mcluhan,</v>

2622
01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:20.244
<v Speaker 7>I think it was in the 1970 said that </v>
<v Speaker 7>human beings are the sex organs of the </v>

2623
01:56:23.611 --> 01:56:24.444
<v Speaker 7>machine world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he was saying even back then that </v>

2624
01:56:27.451 --> 01:56:28.284
<v Speaker 7>human beings are eventually going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>integrate or become something that's a </v>

2625
01:56:32.471 --> 01:56:33.304
<v Speaker 7>part of telling you is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>centralized system of what they're </v>

2626
01:56:36.541 --> 01:56:38.360
<v Speaker 7>building that isn't naturally occurs.</v>

2627
01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:41.410
<v Speaker 7>Who is that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where artificial he was doing the elitch</v>

2628
01:56:41.411 --> 01:56:44.040
<v Speaker 7>believe they're getting off world </v>
<v Speaker 7>building.</v>

2629
01:56:44.041 --> 01:56:45.660
<v Speaker 7>These things that you're just describing</v>
<v Speaker 7>right now.</v>

2630
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:46.673
<v Speaker 7>I mean if you actually read with all the</v>
<v Speaker 7>global is say you've obviously read </v>

2631
01:56:48.291 --> 01:56:49.410
<v Speaker 7>their writings,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know this show,</v>

2632
01:56:49.710 --> 01:56:50.543
<v Speaker 7>they are getting knocked off world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but interdimensional communications to </v>

2633
01:56:55.230 --> 01:56:58.710
<v Speaker 7>build this system that we see lowers our</v>
<v Speaker 7>ICU,</v>

2634
01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:00.830
<v Speaker 7>makes us live less.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've never asked is okay,</v>

2635
01:57:00.850 --> 01:57:02.890
<v Speaker 7>but when you're making these big </v>
<v Speaker 7>statements,</v>

2636
01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:03.733
<v Speaker 7>they've getting into dimensional signals</v>
<v Speaker 7>is telling them to create these systems </v>

2637
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:07.583
<v Speaker 7>that lower iqs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's something you got to really </v>

2638
01:57:09.451 --> 01:57:10.970
<v Speaker 7>prove.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if there's.</v>

2639
01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:12.631
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>please.</v>

2640
01:57:12.631 --> 01:57:16.170
<v Speaker 7>If there's something you can show all </v>
<v Speaker 7>the studies show screen time,</v>

2641
01:57:16.171 --> 01:57:20.360
<v Speaker 7>all the computers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>lowering our as lowing fertility must be</v>

2642
01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:21.780
<v Speaker 7>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Was that a case?</v>

2643
01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:24.840
<v Speaker 7>Is that a case of a somebody's holding a</v>
<v Speaker 7>gun to your head?</v>

2644
01:57:24.841 --> 01:57:25.710
<v Speaker 7>Let me tell you about me.</v>

2645
01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:29.550
<v Speaker 7>I'm addicted to this God damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love watching videos.</v>

2646
01:57:29.690 --> 01:57:31.770
<v Speaker 7>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love taking pictures and shit.</v>

2647
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:32.783
<v Speaker 7>I love looking at humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of beautiful things he </v>

2648
01:57:35.461 --> 01:57:36.480
<v Speaker 7>does,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'll tell you,</v>

2649
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:38.610
<v Speaker 7>they're very addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Very addictive.</v>

2650
01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:39.690
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But hold on a second.</v>

2651
01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.553
<v Speaker 7>Let me stop you right there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't necessarily think that's </v>

2652
01:57:42.571 --> 01:57:43.404
<v Speaker 7>engineered to be addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's engineered to be really </v>

2653
01:57:45.151 --> 01:57:45.984
<v Speaker 7>well and the fact work really well and </v>
<v Speaker 7>the fact that it works really well is </v>

2654
01:57:48.511 --> 01:57:51.120
<v Speaker 7>very addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just like little kids look at a screen,</v>

2655
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:52.103
<v Speaker 7>you put a fucking television in front of</v>
<v Speaker 7>them when they're one year old and play </v>

2656
01:57:54.411 --> 01:57:56.550
<v Speaker 7>some stupid commercial and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whoa,</v>

2657
01:57:56.551 --> 01:57:58.530
<v Speaker 7>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They picked a second.</v>

2658
01:57:58.540 --> 01:57:59.760
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't.</v>

2659
01:57:59.890 --> 01:58:01.350
<v Speaker 7>They made a better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hold on a second.</v>

2660
01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:04.350
<v Speaker 7>They made better and better technology </v>
<v Speaker 7>that we're not designed to absorb.</v>

2661
01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.310
<v Speaker 7>Human beings have exactly set through.</v>

2662
01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:10.470
<v Speaker 7>At the moment we have the exact same DNA</v>
<v Speaker 7>that we did 10,000</v>

2663
01:58:10.471 --> 01:58:13.140
<v Speaker 7>years of the Atlantic when there was </v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing like television.</v>

2664
01:58:13.141 --> 01:58:16.230
<v Speaker 7>There was nothing like movies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was nothing like stereo headphones</v>

2665
01:58:16.231 --> 01:58:18.800
<v Speaker 7>and project,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but don't go on.</v>

2666
01:58:18.810 --> 01:58:22.250
<v Speaker 7>You're crazy when you're interrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My crazy rant.</v>

2667
01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:23.353
<v Speaker 7>I am telling you that this is a natural </v>
<v Speaker 7>progression of this massive infatuation </v>

2668
01:58:27.511 --> 01:58:29.730
<v Speaker 7>that we have with technology.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't have to engineer it.</v>

2669
01:58:29.850 --> 01:58:31.590
<v Speaker 7>It's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It happens to you.</v>

2670
01:58:31.591 --> 01:58:32.424
<v Speaker 7>It happens to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Happens to anybody who's looking at </v>

2671
01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:36.630
<v Speaker 7>cooler and cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Special effects in movies.</v>

2672
01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:37.763
<v Speaker 7>All that stuff is a natural.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids play </v>

2673
01:58:39.901 --> 01:58:42.030
<v Speaker 7>with an ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well then he's a cunt.</v>

2674
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:44.090
<v Speaker 4>He's a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let your kids play with.</v>

01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Fuck's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That right ran.</v>

2676
01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:49.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm not disagreeing with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interrupted it 10 times.</v>

2677
01:58:49.511 --> 01:58:50.241
<v Speaker 4>You fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2681
01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:57.260
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to get back to this.</v>

2682
01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.200
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about the weather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can tell you that right now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is being set up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2688
01:59:10.271 --> 01:59:12.670
<v Speaker 4>about the elites and interdimensional </v>
<v Speaker 4>signals that they're receiving,</v>

2689
01:59:12.671 --> 01:59:15.310
<v Speaker 4>they're telling us to lower Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't just say that.</v>

2690
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:16.420
<v Speaker 4>Need proof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They honor.</v>

2695
01:59:23.650 --> 01:59:24.483
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really cool to say the computer </v>

2696
01:59:26.650 --> 01:59:28.660
<v Speaker 4>simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it talks about that.</v>

2697
01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:33.570
<v Speaker 4>Everyone says no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're saying that will be easily,</v>

2698
01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:35.070
<v Speaker 4>easily pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2699
01:59:35.110 --> 01:59:35.943
<v Speaker 4>we're in a computer simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then when you talk about </v>

2700
01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:41.510
<v Speaker 4>interdimensional like magical shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2702
01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Magic is a technology that hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered yet.</v>

2703
01:59:45.190 --> 01:59:47.680
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

2785
02:03:36.230 --> 02:03:41.230
<v Speaker 4>and we're all the Darwin stuff came from</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he had an elucidation and believes</v>

2786
02:03:41.331 --> 02:03:42.164
<v Speaker 4>he was given all this stuff from like </v>
<v Speaker 4>demons and I'm not saying that's really </v>

2787
02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.340
<v Speaker 4>confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Darwin Descartes.</v>

2788
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:46.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>isn't he the one that came up with the </v>

2791
02:03:50.061 --> 02:03:50.894
<v Speaker 4>idea of science science from a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Darwin's idea came from Darwin was </v>

2792
02:03:53.881 --> 02:03:55.790
<v Speaker 4>like really into watch handling and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:56.520
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Whatever was the guy that.</v>

2796
02:04:00.861 --> 02:04:01.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of those guys,</v>

2797
02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:03.093
<v Speaker 4>they get the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believe from a fricken other </v>

2798
02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:07.370
<v Speaker 4>dementia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2799
02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:12.140
<v Speaker 4>people know all about this as much as I </v>
<v Speaker 4>do or more joe.</v>

2800
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:14.150
<v Speaker 4>And you sit there and act like you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

2801
02:04:14.210 --> 02:04:16.580
<v Speaker 4>I forgot you're afraid to give your </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience all the information,</v>

2802
02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:20.880
<v Speaker 4>but you're saying you're saying Joe </v>
<v Speaker 4>Barnes,</v>

2803
02:04:21.570 --> 02:04:25.940
<v Speaker 4>but I bring it up making it up to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>center dimensional.</v>

2804
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:27.620
<v Speaker 4>But I just wanted to know where it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming.</v>

2805
02:04:28.170 --> 02:04:32.280
<v Speaker 4>Definitely the smartest guy showed it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>showed it Darwin,</v>

2806
02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:35.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling it up.</v>

2807
02:04:35.481 --> 02:04:37.710
<v Speaker 4>You probably already know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that Darwin's partner,</v>

2808
02:04:37.711 --> 02:04:38.050
<v Speaker 4>the God</v>

2809
02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:39.840
<v Speaker 3>that he developed a theory of evolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they were,</v>

2810
02:04:39.841 --> 02:04:40.674
<v Speaker 3>they both had like a similar theory and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they came together with it and he was </v>

2811
02:04:43.051 --> 02:04:43.884
<v Speaker 3>like really into it to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was into channeling and all sorts of </v>

2812
02:04:46.411 --> 02:04:48.450
<v Speaker 3>weird stuff that knows this discredited </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2813
02:04:48.451 --> 02:04:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I listened to it on radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they believe.</v>

2814
02:04:51.331 --> 02:04:53.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shannon's going to have me up here.</v>

2815
02:04:53.881 --> 02:04:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I'll clipped it out and that's what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

2816
02:04:55.261 --> 02:04:58.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying they discredited him and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>just put all the emphasis on Darwin.</v>

2817
02:04:58.951 --> 02:05:00.880
<v Speaker 3>That's why you only hear about Darwin's </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

2818
02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:03.200

02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:48.810
<v Speaker 3>They all believed they were all part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a secret breeding program with a British</v>

2839
02:05:48.811 --> 02:05:50.810
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have like this super human if</v>

2840
02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:54.180
<v Speaker 3>they bred these six families together to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like create all this,</v>

2841
02:05:54.181 --> 02:05:55.014
<v Speaker 3>just like mainland in British history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just known all eugenics history </v>

2842
02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:02.840
<v Speaker 3>and then Golten who's related to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these other guys in the 18 fifties.</v>

2843
02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:04.453
<v Speaker 3>He starts having these ideas and he says</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a double helix which the snakes </v>

2844
02:06:07.321 --> 02:06:08.154
<v Speaker 3>for for science and medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said we're going to discover the </v>

2845
02:06:12.001 --> 02:06:12.834
<v Speaker 3>keys and the building blocks of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said it's going to be called </v>

2846
02:06:14.461 --> 02:06:15.294
<v Speaker 3>biometrics and we'll track everybody by </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading their genetics is what Hitler </v>

2847
02:06:19.141 --> 02:06:19.974
<v Speaker 3>freaked out about and picked up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like eight of the 14 new </v>

2848
02:06:25.171 --> 02:06:26.004
<v Speaker 3>sciences like half or more than half the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sciences that came since the 18 sixties </v>

2849
02:06:29.851 --> 02:06:32.910
<v Speaker 3>were all from Dalton and all from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Darwin.</v>

2850
02:06:32.910 --> 02:06:34.860
<v Speaker 3>So the media and the liberals give me </v>
<v Speaker 3>this one thing,</v>

2851
02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:38.160
<v Speaker 3>the origin of the species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not saying it's wrong or right.</v>

2852
02:06:38.190 --> 02:06:40.530
<v Speaker 3>It's super heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like galactic stuff.</v>

2853
02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:43.860
<v Speaker 3>They give this to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is only one little boil down.</v>

2854
02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:46.770
<v Speaker 3>BSN We'd have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to what these guys really wrote.</v>

2855
02:06:46.771 --> 02:06:47.604
<v Speaker 3>They were like inter marrying and </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in wicked seances and </v>

2856
02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:52.400
<v Speaker 3>channeling and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2857
02:06:52.410 --> 02:06:54.180
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all this weird ass crap.</v>

2858
02:06:54.330 --> 02:06:55.530
<v Speaker 3>And then they envision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2859
02:06:55.531 --> 02:06:57.000
<v Speaker 3>there's a double helix DNA discovered </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2860
02:06:57.150 --> 02:06:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biometrics,</v>

2861
02:06:58.021 --> 02:06:59.670
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>World government computers,</v>

2862
02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:02.280
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Atomic weapons give me the equations and</v>

2863
02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:03.114
<v Speaker 3>they were like all them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like going to other scientists meetings </v>

2864
02:07:05.191 --> 02:07:06.024
<v Speaker 3>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we believe there is a program where you </v>

2865
02:07:07.290 --> 02:07:08.123
<v Speaker 3>take different matter together in </v>
<v Speaker 3>isotopes and it'll cause an explosion </v>

2866
02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:11.603
<v Speaker 3>and it's like they were like given </v>
<v Speaker 3>either humans or super advanced already </v>

2867
02:07:14.821 --> 02:07:19.080
<v Speaker 3>had this knowledge from somewhere else </v>
<v Speaker 3>in our genetics and were here before and</v>

2868
02:07:19.081 --> 02:07:19.914
<v Speaker 3>we're able to then manifest this through</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic memories and archives or it was </v>

2869
02:07:22.711 --> 02:07:23.544
<v Speaker 3>given off world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but humans like have all this data </v>

2870
02:07:25.561 --> 02:07:26.394
<v Speaker 3>compacted and compress ready like </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs that called like the acacia </v>

2871
02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:32.160
<v Speaker 3>records or something like that as though</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it is,</v>

2872
02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:33.690
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is uh,</v>

2873
02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Kaushik epic.</v>

2874
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:37.330
<v Speaker 4>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Epigenetics.</v>

2875
02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:38.223
<v Speaker 4>They'll take chickens with eggs and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>10 generations and major universities </v>

2876
02:07:42.281 --> 02:07:44.380
<v Speaker 4>that have never seen a hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they put them in these,</v>

2877
02:07:44.381 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 4>like these 20 foot ceilings and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a triangle.</v>

2878
02:07:46.781 --> 02:07:48.730
<v Speaker 4>Fly over in a square,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fall over in a little baby.</v>

2879
02:07:48.731 --> 02:07:49.564
<v Speaker 4>Chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborcare generation regeneration </v>

2880
02:07:50.571 --> 02:07:51.404
<v Speaker 4>generation go on for 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They fly one hawk over and they all </v>

2881
02:07:54.851 --> 02:07:55.720
<v Speaker 4>squat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yelling,</v>

2882
02:07:55.721 --> 02:07:57.100
<v Speaker 4>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and run into their nest.</v>

2883
02:07:57.980 --> 02:07:58.813
<v Speaker 4>Now they never saw hawk and never saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill a chicken generation after </v>

2884
02:08:01.151 --> 02:08:01.984
<v Speaker 4>generation whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was compressed data knowledge of the </v>

2885
02:08:04.661 --> 02:08:07.630
<v Speaker 4>Hawk that is passed on genetically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:08:07.631 --> 02:08:08.464
<v Speaker 4>They say that's why children are always </v>
<v Speaker 4>afraid of monsters that goes down the </v>

2887
02:08:10.901 --> 02:08:12.820
<v Speaker 4>Tigers and bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to be cat.</v>

2888
02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:17.850
<v Speaker 4>My son just wants to be chased so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wants to practice getting away from a</v>

2889
02:08:17.921 --> 02:08:19.810
<v Speaker 4>predator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He loves that Demos.</v>

2890
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:21.310
<v Speaker 4>He wants to get away.</v>

2891
02:08:21.310 --> 02:08:26.310
<v Speaker 4>You can't catch me and it'll just be </v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to fight predators.</v>

2892
02:08:27.311 --> 02:08:28.144
<v Speaker 4>You can't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can get the fuck away from that </v>

2893
02:08:29.411 --> 02:08:31.770
<v Speaker 4>tiger at the Zoo and China,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I recommend you do that.</v>

2894
02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:35.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My son's good stuff.</v>

2895
02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:36.813
<v Speaker 4>Not even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You probably wouldn't be saying </v>

2896
02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:41.360
<v Speaker 4>Alexander one cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might not even get second.</v>

2897
02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:42.880
<v Speaker 4>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll admit that.</v>

2898
02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:44.140
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit.</v>

2899
02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:47.470
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't have let them smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then now you're thinking.</v>

2900
02:08:47.530 --> 02:08:49.150
<v Speaker 4>Brought it back down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You came back.</v>

2901
02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:52.540
<v Speaker 4>You came back here and keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going in a good place right now.</v>

2902
02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:53.853
<v Speaker 4>Keep it going.</v>

2903
02:08:54.690 --> 02:08:57.810
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're getting into Albert Pike.</v>

2904
02:08:58.010 --> 02:09:00.750
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well he's the founder of the KKK.</v>

2905
02:09:00.751 --> 02:09:01.584
<v Speaker 4>Kept chomping confederate general head </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the Illuminati worldwide at that </v>

2906
02:09:03.661 --> 02:09:06.600
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's establish something that's like</v>

2907
02:09:06.630 --> 02:09:08.460
<v Speaker 4>maybe people that are listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>might go,</v>

2908
02:09:08.461 --> 02:09:10.250
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck are these guys ramble </v>
<v Speaker 4>about?</v>

2909
02:09:10.290 --> 02:09:13.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm exposed to establish this throughout</v>

2910
02:09:13.591 --> 02:09:14.424
<v Speaker 4>history from the beginning of organized </v>
<v Speaker 4>human secret knowledge folks don't want </v>

2911
02:09:17.911 --> 02:09:18.744
<v Speaker 4>to pass on as your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's also been people conspiring to </v>

2912
02:09:21.331 --> 02:09:23.460
<v Speaker 4>control whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the sign.</v>

2913
02:09:23.461 --> 02:09:26.370
<v Speaker 4>What end people conspiring to control </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever aspect of it,</v>

2914
02:09:26.371 --> 02:09:29.010
<v Speaker 4>whether it's political,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the military,</v>

2915
02:09:29.011 --> 02:09:30.930
<v Speaker 4>like whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always been that.</v>

2916
02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:33.120
<v Speaker 4>It's always happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has been military coups.</v>

2917
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:36.990
<v Speaker 4>All throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's been wars all throughout and had</v>

2918
02:09:37.130 --> 02:09:39.710
<v Speaker 4>a peaceful and bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How so?</v>

2919
02:09:40.130 --> 02:09:40.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2920
02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:43.850
<v Speaker 4>the intelligence community leaked all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the data to break down the globalist.</v>

2921
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.823
<v Speaker 4>He Eddie's asking the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 4>community leaked all what data they </v>

2922
02:09:47.761 --> 02:09:48.600
<v Speaker 4>looked all the way he likes.</v>

2923
02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:50.520
<v Speaker 4>He's over here saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

2924
02:09:50.770 --> 02:09:52.680
<v Speaker 4>Are you saying that the Russians didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it?</v>

2925
02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:53.760
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

2926
02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:56.080
<v Speaker 4>how do you know this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the mainstream media says,</v>

2927
02:09:56.250 --> 02:09:57.083
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>

2928
02:09:57.090 --> 02:09:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give me a break to.</v>

2929
02:09:58.320 --> 02:09:58.750
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2930
02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:59.910
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to know how,</v>

2931
02:09:59.911 --> 02:10:00.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've ever,</v>

2932
02:10:00.890 --> 02:10:02.820
<v Speaker 4>if you've known me for like 16,</v>
<v Speaker 4>17 years.</v>

2933
02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:04.073
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever known me to say I have a </v>

2934
02:10:04.531 --> 02:10:05.730
<v Speaker 4>source that I'm making it up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Honest.</v>

2935
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:06.700
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2936
02:10:06.750 --> 02:10:07.583
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've got sources so you can't </v>

2937
02:10:08.851 --> 02:10:09.960
<v Speaker 4>tell us how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2938
02:10:09.961 --> 02:10:14.961
<v Speaker 4>Let's just say I got data today from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>head of state and what did he say?</v>

2939
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:16.630
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2940
02:10:16.650 --> 02:10:19.340
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell me the point is you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell me.</v>

2941
02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:21.013
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the frame is we screwed it up and </v>

2942
02:10:22.741 --> 02:10:24.210
<v Speaker 4>released it early so it caused a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

2943
02:10:24.211 --> 02:10:27.100
<v Speaker 4>Explain the whole Russian diversion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We didn't mean on purpose.</v>

2944
02:10:27.150 --> 02:10:27.983
<v Speaker 4>So I'm always mad at us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bust out with that one thing because </v>

2945
02:10:30.961 --> 02:10:33.050
<v Speaker 4>there's intelligent people like my </v>
<v Speaker 4>students,</v>

2946
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:33.943
<v Speaker 4>like you hear that</v>

2947
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.180
<v Speaker 8>you don't believe the Russians.</v>

2948
02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:38.910
<v Speaker 3>So where should it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they believe that?</v>

2949
02:10:38.911 --> 02:10:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you saying that?</v>

2950
02:10:39.931 --> 02:10:44.931
<v Speaker 3>The intelligence agency leaked all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not Russia because I was told before</v>

2951
02:10:46.681 --> 02:10:51.210
<v Speaker 3>it was all leaked by the former director</v>
<v Speaker 3>of psychological operations,</v>

<v Speaker 3>leaked.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before I was never like embed with the </v>

2955
02:10:58.111 --> 02:10:59.940
<v Speaker 3>CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've interviewed people from the CIA,</v>

2956
02:10:59.941 --> 02:11:01.260
<v Speaker 3>NSA,</v>

2959
02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:06.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>General Flynn,</v>

2960
02:11:06.270 --> 02:11:08.040
<v Speaker 3>former head of defense intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tweets.</v>

<v Speaker 3>All my articles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling you it's some secret.</v>

2962
02:11:10.471 --> 02:11:12.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean the enemy knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point is,</v>

2963
02:11:12.501 --> 02:11:15.330
<v Speaker 3>is that I'm seen as an honest good </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and understand what's going on.</v>

2964
02:11:15.331 --> 02:11:17.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm out for humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want personal power.</v>

2965
02:11:17.731 --> 02:11:20.700
<v Speaker 3>I want to help people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't an entirely possible.</v>

2966
02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:21.533
<v Speaker 3>I mean like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does the information like that get </v>

2967
02:11:22.771 --> 02:11:24.420
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2968
02:11:24.421 --> 02:11:25.254
<v Speaker 3>there's an open rebellion against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>criminals have hijacked our government </v>

2969
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.823
<v Speaker 3>and so we overthrew the globalist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama and we're taking him over in </v>

2970
02:11:32.821 --> 02:11:34.680
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Italy,</v>

2971
02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:36.750
<v Speaker 3>in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Greece,</v>

2972
02:11:36.751 --> 02:11:37.584
<v Speaker 3>in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only place we're not successful so </v>

2973
02:11:39.061 --> 02:11:39.894
<v Speaker 3>far is Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just took Australia about took </v>

2974
02:11:41.761 --> 02:11:43.920
<v Speaker 3>Australia with the idea of free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sign it.</v>

2975
02:11:43.950 --> 02:11:44.910
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2976
02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.380
<v Speaker 3>most people sit there and brag about </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2977
02:11:46.381 --> 02:11:49.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you what's really going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean for Australia,</v>

2978
02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:51.143
<v Speaker 3>I mean globalist or losing countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>every month right now to the liberty </v>

2979
02:11:54.661 --> 02:11:55.200
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2980
02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:56.033
<v Speaker 3>What says that these are people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>want you and your family to be </v>

2981
02:11:59.251 --> 02:12:02.670
<v Speaker 3>successful and aren't out to hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make you poor like the globalist.</v>

2982
02:12:02.910 --> 02:12:03.743
<v Speaker 3>There's good people and they used the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence agencies to defeat the </v>

2983
02:12:07.141 --> 02:12:07.974
<v Speaker 3>globalist and there's been a major </v>
<v Speaker 3>counter offensive and the globals made </v>

2984
02:12:10.861 --> 02:12:11.730
<v Speaker 3>one wrong move.</v>

2985
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It happened five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

2986
02:12:14.130 --> 02:12:16.620
<v Speaker 3>It was system wide leak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four years ago.</v>

2987
02:12:16.621 --> 02:12:17.454
<v Speaker 3>I've had CIA whistleblowers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All Obama show kernels and special </v>

2988
02:12:20.971 --> 02:12:22.020
<v Speaker 3>operations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you name it,</v>

2989
02:12:22.350 --> 02:12:25.050
<v Speaker 3>who were authorized by high level </v>
<v Speaker 3>senators come on my show.</v>

2990
02:12:25.590 --> 02:12:28.440
<v Speaker 3>They ran a counter coup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a deal made with radical Islam</v>

2991
02:12:28.441 --> 02:12:29.274
<v Speaker 3>to actually take over Europe and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States and by that make us </v>

2992
02:12:31.981 --> 02:12:34.890
<v Speaker 3>convert or not convert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but submit to Islam,</v>

2993
02:12:35.070 --> 02:12:35.903
<v Speaker 3>not criticize it or they blow stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought they bring in some new </v>

2994
02:12:38.941 --> 02:12:39.774
<v Speaker 3>masculine arm that would make us submit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it got so bad that even our own </v>

2995
02:12:43.261 --> 02:12:46.170
<v Speaker 3>intelligence agencies that had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted said,</v>

2996
02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:47.850
<v Speaker 3>this is too far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not doing it.</v>

2997
02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:50.840
<v Speaker 3>And so America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about four years ago,</v>

2998
02:12:50.850 --> 02:12:51.683
<v Speaker 3>sort of coming back up for air and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just overthrowing their whole </v>

2999
02:12:53.881 --> 02:12:55.740
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a huge war going on.</v>

3000
02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:59.940
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're kicking their ass on every front</v>

3001
02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:01.600
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I said,</v>

3002
02:13:01.601 --> 02:13:02.620
<v Speaker 8>at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3003
02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:03.643

3004
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:05.470

<v Speaker 8>at the dawn of a new age,</v>

3005
02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:09.640
<v Speaker 8>you were against George W dot Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Clinton,</v>

3006
02:13:09.970 --> 02:13:11.080
<v Speaker 8>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all that.</v>

<v Speaker 8>You are not a republican or a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You weren't,</v>

3008
02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:16.540
<v Speaker 8>you were against government.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But now it's a new day.</v>

3009
02:13:17.110 --> 02:13:19.630
<v Speaker 8>Now the conspiracy theorists like </v>
<v Speaker 8>yourself,</v>

3010
02:13:19.631 --> 02:13:24.580
<v Speaker 8>you're the king of them were pro </v>
<v Speaker 8>government and the sheep.</v>

3011

<v Speaker 8>They're like out there protesting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>crying,</v>

3012
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:27.783

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3014
02:13:28.730 --> 02:13:29.181
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

3015
02:13:29.181 --> 02:13:30.014
<v Speaker 3>That trumps perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really genuinely like going into all </v>

3016
02:13:32.521 --> 02:13:34.530
<v Speaker 3>these corporate incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At one side of deals,</v>

3017
02:13:34.531 --> 02:13:36.120
<v Speaker 3>there's no meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a lobbyist.</v>

3018
02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:37.073
<v Speaker 3>He banned them all for lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He literally goes in with actuaries and </v>

3019
02:13:40.351 --> 02:13:41.184
<v Speaker 3>computer programs and ngos who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>super NSA technology that even had </v>

3020
02:13:44.671 --> 02:13:48.180
<v Speaker 3>before he was in and he says [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 3>the generals came to him years ago.</v>

3021
02:13:48.181 --> 02:13:49.170
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can deliver all this.</v>

3022
02:13:49.171 --> 02:13:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to make America poor.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We don't want to have big wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who wanted to just have prosperity.</v>

02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:58.673
<v Speaker 3>We're ready to release it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I talked about the state of </v>

3027

<v Speaker 3>cares about humanity and he's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>satanist.</v>

3030
02:14:08.370 --> 02:14:09.203
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like raping kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He likes Super Hot Eastern European </v>

<v Speaker 3>you can have that just he's not out to </v>

3034
02:14:18.451 --> 02:14:19.284
<v Speaker 3>get humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's got the intelligence agencies </v>

3035
02:14:20.971 --> 02:14:22.720
<v Speaker 3>totally backing into the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3036
02:14:22.890 --> 02:14:25.380
<v Speaker 3>and it's just a super epic moment to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

3037
02:14:25.410 --> 02:14:27.880
<v Speaker 3>What's going on so far with trump from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iran?</v>

<v Speaker 3>So what do you think when you,</v>

3039
02:14:31.881 --> 02:14:34.740
<v Speaker 3>you said earlier in the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you don't think he's perfect,</v>

3040
02:14:34.820 --> 02:14:35.653
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think he could do different </v>

3041
02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:38.490
<v Speaker 3>that would make people accept him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3042
02:14:38.491 --> 02:14:40.180
<v Speaker 3>I said last week you should just about </v>
<v Speaker 3>torture.</v>

3043
02:14:40.181 --> 02:14:42.650
<v Speaker 3>He did the next day just magically </v>
<v Speaker 3>alias.</v>

3044
02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:44.193
<v Speaker 3>Because that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you came up with the idea and you </v>

3045
02:14:46.131 --> 02:14:47.880

<v Speaker 3>the Zeit geist.</v>

3047
02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:54.000

<v Speaker 3>she just kind of see everything.</v>

3048
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:58.860

<v Speaker 3>you can like look into any avenue of any</v>

3049
02:14:58.960 --> 02:14:59.793

<v Speaker 3>to have him in despite whatever flaws </v>

3050
02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:04.913
<v Speaker 3>people may perceive me as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants prosperity and he's not a part </v>

3051
02:15:08.491 --> 02:15:11.040
<v Speaker 3>of the system that he replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're totally against.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that anymore now,</v>

3054

<v Speaker 1>running for office and Hillary's people,</v>

3199
02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:34.100
<v Speaker 1>because I follow the news everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary's campaign,</v>

3200

<v Speaker 1>this letter came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts out these born in Kenya and I'm </v>

<v Speaker 1>I was quietly,</v>

3203
02:21:39.470 --> 02:21:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and I'm really ashamed of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I told us there's this.</v>

3204
02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:42.793
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

3205
02:21:43.370 --> 02:21:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I was an early on Obama supporter in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wanted to try to unify people.</v>

3206
02:21:47.721 --> 02:21:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like John Mccain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I said,</v>

3207
02:21:49.581 --> 02:21:50.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's bad.</v>

3208
02:21:50.451 --> 02:21:52.460
<v Speaker 1>The Democrats are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I hated what had happened.</v>

3209
02:21:52.461 --> 02:21:54.770
<v Speaker 1>So much food by Obama to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's get let him talk.</v>

3211
02:21:56.301 --> 02:21:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't an Obama supporter.</v>

3212
02:21:57.741 --> 02:21:58.574
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't attack him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you liked it better than the </v>

3213
02:21:59.991 --> 02:22:00.760
<v Speaker 1>alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3214
02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:02.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't push him for office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

3215
02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:03.913
<v Speaker 1>hoping that all this bs was real show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I started hearing these leaks </v>

<v Speaker 1>the whole deal show.</v>

3221
02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:22.513
<v Speaker 1>And then the articles started coming out</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the right wing picture that who does </v>

3235
02:22:55.290 --> 02:22:55.501
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's hear.</v>

3238
02:22:57.700 --> 02:22:58.533
<v Speaker 3>Say here you go.</v>

3239
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.943
<v Speaker 9>Let's be testing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is still plaguing so many of our </v>

3240
02:23:02.791 --> 02:23:03.860
<v Speaker 9>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

3241
02:23:04.170 --> 02:23:06.900
<v Speaker 9>which you all know a lot of that is due </v>
<v Speaker 9>to homophobia.</v>

3242
02:23:07.310 --> 02:23:08.143
<v Speaker 9>But Barack has led by example when we </v>
<v Speaker 9>took our trip to Africa and visited his </v>

3243
02:23:13.171 --> 02:23:15.360
<v Speaker 9>home country in Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

3244
02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:20.420
<v Speaker 9>we'd soak up public HIV test for the </v>
<v Speaker 9>very point of showing folks in Canada.</v>

3245
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:22.583
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean that he was </v>

3246
02:23:23.221 --> 02:23:26.070
<v Speaker 3>listening to the club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just found that fast.</v>

3247
02:23:26.071 --> 02:23:26.904
<v Speaker 3>But there's another where she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's the Harvard law review when </v>

3248
02:23:29.061 --> 02:23:29.910
<v Speaker 3>she edited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he says,</v>

3249
02:23:29.911 --> 02:23:31.790
<v Speaker 3>I was born in Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3250
02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:34.620
<v Speaker 3>well that shit up right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or was she saying is his homeland?</v>

3251
02:23:34.621 --> 02:23:35.454
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're from Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't want to go back to Italy </v>

3252
02:23:39.061 --> 02:23:42.150
<v Speaker 3>or Ireland or totally land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call it the homeland.</v>

3253
02:23:42.210 --> 02:23:43.043
<v Speaker 3>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just going onto what are we </v>

3254
02:23:44.721 --> 02:23:47.370
<v Speaker 3>covering?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenya trump certificate.</v>

3255
02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:48.990
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump got involved in all that.</v>

3256
02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:50.910
<v Speaker 3>An old bursar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll go ahead.</v>

3257
02:23:51.180 --> 02:23:51.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3258
02:23:51.630 --> 02:23:52.463
<v Speaker 3>So how did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did someone leak that information </v>

3259
02:23:54.511 --> 02:23:56.940
<v Speaker 3>to him to try to make him look foolish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he chased after it.</v>

3260
02:23:57.030 --> 02:24:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're just researching.</v>

3261
02:24:00.391 --> 02:24:01.560
<v Speaker 3>It's anybody from anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Foolish.</v>

3262
02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:02.453
<v Speaker 3>So do you think they just maybe made an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorrect judge that we found out all </v>

3263
02:24:05.161 --> 02:24:05.490
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

3264
02:24:05.490 --> 02:24:10.490
<v Speaker 3>This is stunning information show people</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to say he's illegitimate.</v>

3265
02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:15.250
<v Speaker 3>They then look at him in the Harvard law</v>
<v Speaker 3>review saying he's in Kenya,</v>

3266
02:24:15.251 --> 02:24:16.084
<v Speaker 3>we look at clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at the fact that he won't </v>

3267
02:24:17.401 --> 02:24:18.630
<v Speaker 3>release his birth certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a name,</v>

3268
02:24:18.631 --> 02:24:23.631
<v Speaker 3>name Barry Satara and Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had all these weird cut out names.</v>

3269
02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:27.840
<v Speaker 3>All he had like five alias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3270
02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:28.853
<v Speaker 3>Why did he wrote that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote dream look it up because he </v>

3271
02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:35.040
<v Speaker 3>wrote dreams of my real father or dreams</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my father.</v>

3272
02:24:35.250 --> 02:24:39.060
<v Speaker 3>My real father is the documentary and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he talks about Frank Marshall Davis,</v>

3273
02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:43.140
<v Speaker 3>the communist famous pornographer that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he spit summers with.</v>

3274
02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:44.550
<v Speaker 3>He looked side by sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same guy,</v>

3275
02:24:44.850 --> 02:24:47.400
<v Speaker 3>so they were worried that it was gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>be Frank Marshall Davis,</v>

3276
02:24:47.970 --> 02:24:52.020
<v Speaker 3>but it had actually been his mom in like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a scam making money off.</v>

3277
02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:52.913
<v Speaker 3>She was CIA bringing back people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>US and sham marriage is to have them </v>

3278
02:24:55.741 --> 02:24:59.370
<v Speaker 3>integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was basically a cover up.</v>

3279
02:24:59.380 --> 02:25:01.290
<v Speaker 3>The fact that his real father was frank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marshall Davis,</v>

3280
02:25:01.291 --> 02:25:02.124
<v Speaker 3>the Communist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's who Obama's real dad was </v>

3281
02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:08.490
<v Speaker 3>and dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My real father breaks it all down.</v>

3282
02:25:08.491 --> 02:25:10.470
<v Speaker 3>It's online and it's pretty powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>info.</v>

3283
02:25:11.370 --> 02:25:12.203
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just is a perfect example of you're </v>

<v Speaker 4>his house.</v>

3294
02:25:47.530 --> 02:25:49.120
<v Speaker 4>And you know this because you've seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>these.</v>

3295
02:25:49.690 --> 02:25:50.380
<v Speaker 4>I've interviewed the people</v>

3296
02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:51.213
<v Speaker 8>will involved.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've read dreams of my father where he </v>

3297
02:25:53.171 --> 02:25:55.420
<v Speaker 8>admits I stayed at Frank Marshall Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 8>his house.</v>

3298
02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:56.433
<v Speaker 8>He was like my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My grandfather had a special unspoken </v>

3299
02:25:58.721 --> 02:26:00.670
<v Speaker 8>relationship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Quotes.</v>

3300
02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:02.350
<v Speaker 8>Look up Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 8>frank,</v>

3301
02:26:02.351 --> 02:26:04.800
<v Speaker 8>Marshall,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Davis or Obama's father.</v>

3302
02:26:05.290 --> 02:26:06.123
<v Speaker 8>What do you think about the conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 8>theory that the Obama was bred by the </v>

3303
02:26:09.911 --> 02:26:12.880
<v Speaker 8>CIA the whole way through all the truths</v>
<v Speaker 8>on a third.</v>

3304
02:26:13.050 --> 02:26:14.430
<v Speaker 8>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you say see I,</v>

3305
02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:15.400
<v Speaker 8>that just means like</v>

3306
02:26:16.610 --> 02:26:17.443
<v Speaker 4>a marketing project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If whoever was in power at the time for </v>

3307
02:26:20.421 --> 02:26:22.100
<v Speaker 4>eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever's in charge of that,</v>

3308
02:26:22.250 --> 02:26:23.083
<v Speaker 4>whoever shows interest can go in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then just basically be involved in </v>

3309
02:26:26.811 --> 02:26:30.770
<v Speaker 4>controlling the levers of the social </v>
<v Speaker 4>engineering of the society.</v>

3310
02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:33.970
<v Speaker 8>So what does that have to do with Obama </v>
<v Speaker 8>growing up?</v>

3311
02:26:33.971 --> 02:26:34.804
<v Speaker 8>Did were those rumors that he was in a </v>
<v Speaker 8>CIA agent and Pakistan while he was </v>

3312
02:26:40.541 --> 02:26:42.040
<v Speaker 8>supposed to be in Columbia?</v>

3313
02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:43.860
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3314
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:45.440
<v Speaker 4>He probably spent six months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3315
02:26:45.450 --> 02:26:46.283
<v Speaker 4>There's the supposed father Barack </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus the second versus frame marshal </v>

3316
02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:53.520
<v Speaker 4>dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you look more like the other.</v>

3317
02:26:53.521 --> 02:26:54.490
<v Speaker 4>Barack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:56.400
<v Speaker 4>Well look up,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Marshall Davis is pornography and it's </v>

3320
02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:03.300
<v Speaker 4>mine and I will do no such than Obama's </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother.</v>

3321
02:27:03.301 --> 02:27:06.570
<v Speaker 4>Clearly in the photos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's his book.</v>

3322
02:27:06.571 --> 02:27:10.260
<v Speaker 4>Dreams of my father admitting that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>stayed with Frank Marshall Davis.</v>

3323
02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:11.401
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3324
02:27:11.401 --> 02:27:12.660
<v Speaker 4>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the issue.</v>

3325
02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:13.770
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would,</v>

3326
02:27:13.771 --> 02:27:14.604
<v Speaker 4>I asked you though to get back to where </v>
<v Speaker 4>we started from was why did trump chase </v>

3327
02:27:19.141 --> 02:27:20.670
<v Speaker 4>after that whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was born in Kenya.</v>

3328
02:27:20.671 --> 02:27:21.504
<v Speaker 4>Shit for so long because he knew it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>super hot with the public and he wanted </v>

3329
02:27:25.111 --> 02:27:25.944
<v Speaker 4>to know the answer to it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And didn't like the things Obama was </v>

3330
02:27:28.981 --> 02:27:30.220
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

3331
02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:34.040
<v Speaker 4>It was a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3332
02:27:34.310 --> 02:27:35.143
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3333
02:27:35.180 --> 02:27:36.013
<v Speaker 4>if you were a guy who was a white guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we wanted to prove that you're born </v>

3334
02:27:39.681 --> 02:27:40.514
<v Speaker 4>in Austria,</v>

3335
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:44.150
<v Speaker 4>but you had some birth certificate that </v>
<v Speaker 4>said you were born in the United States,</v>

3336
02:27:44.151 --> 02:27:47.180
<v Speaker 4>he spoke perfect English but yet a </v>
<v Speaker 4>square jaw and you look like you're from</v>

3337
02:27:47.181 --> 02:27:48.014
<v Speaker 4>the frozen north.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this motherfucker is freeze from </v>

3338
02:27:50.421 --> 02:27:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Austria.</v>

<v Speaker 4>these from fucking Austria.</v>

3340
02:27:53.390 --> 02:27:54.223
<v Speaker 4>And then someone like made a big deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of it gave you like a fake birth </v>

3341
02:27:56.781 --> 02:28:00.550
<v Speaker 4>certificate and people wouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd never hear racism then.</v>

3342
02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you would hear that.</v>

3343
02:28:02.421 --> 02:28:04.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy might have been born in another</v>

3344
02:28:04.221 --> 02:28:07.330
<v Speaker 4>country but it wouldn't be president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

3345
02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:08.293
<v Speaker 4>it's a race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3346
02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:10.850
<v Speaker 4>instantaneously it gets connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>racism.</v>

3347
02:28:10.851 --> 02:28:14.100
<v Speaker 4>There's an assumed racism with almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>any there.</v>

3348
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:15.350
<v Speaker 4>What color?</v>

02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:33.800
<v Speaker 1>My Mom and dad are we talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years ago.</v>

3358
02:28:33.801 --> 02:28:34.634
<v Speaker 1>They thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

3359
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Let us see the film about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They saw it.</v>

3360
02:28:36.501 --> 02:28:38.120
<v Speaker 1>They were blown away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but listen,</v>

3361
02:28:38.121 --> 02:28:38.954
<v Speaker 1>let me give you the big picture please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elite admit that they are studying </v>

3362
02:28:41.961 --> 02:28:43.970
<v Speaker 1>humanity like they're a breakaway </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

3363
02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:45.073
<v Speaker 1>They believe they're taking the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas of humanity and building a </v>

3364
02:28:47.721 --> 02:28:48.554
<v Speaker 1>breakaway civilization of technocracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>show they can transcend us and I want </v>

3365

3367
02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:00.673

02:29:04.071 --> 02:29:07.220
<v Speaker 1>wipe out most of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Atlantic transcendent.</v>

3369
02:29:07.850 --> 02:29:08.930

<v Speaker 1>individual agendas and they're pretty </v>

<v Speaker 1>Group Club of Rome.</v>

3386
02:29:54.501 --> 02:29:57.080
<v Speaker 1>but he's part of a secret eugenics </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

3387
02:29:59.810 --> 02:30:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm a really good progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like killing weak people.</v>

3388
02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to thin the herd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a really good person though.</v>

3389
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3392
02:30:11.980 --> 02:30:14.130
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just deals with it in the news.</v>

3393
02:30:14.810 --> 02:30:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Oprah Winfrey and secret meeting face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks so serious.</v>

3394
02:30:17.640 --> 02:30:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I toilet.</v>

3395
02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:21.230
<v Speaker 1>You think she's in secret meetings with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Bilderberg group or something?</v>

3396
02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:22.393
<v Speaker 1>She admits that to repo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They admit on the news to reduce </v>

3397
02:30:25.161 --> 02:30:25.994
<v Speaker 1>population because we linked at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's play it know when someone </v>

3398
02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:31.553
<v Speaker 1>might hold please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone like her says something </v>

3399
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:35.623
<v Speaker 1>about reducing the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegitimate babies born or the amount </v>

3400
02:30:38.661 --> 02:30:41.060
<v Speaker 1>of babies that are born because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no birth control.</v>

3401
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:45.800
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times those kind of statements </v>
<v Speaker 1>get construed into population control.</v>

3402
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:46.663
<v Speaker 1>She's in the car and beat and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>start saying she's into population </v>

3403
02:30:49.491 --> 02:30:53.690
<v Speaker 1>control and that means she wants in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>secret meetings and she's pushing in and</v>

3404
02:30:53.691 --> 02:30:54.650
<v Speaker 1>she's tax exempt.</v>

3405
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in those secret meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you in those secret meetings?</v>

3406
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:58.023
<v Speaker 1>You go to the failings that we like to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been in one of those </v>

3407
02:31:00.051 --> 02:31:01.450
<v Speaker 1>secret meetings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did check into one.</v>

3408
02:31:01.490 --> 02:31:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you hear what they said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3409
02:31:02.981 --> 02:31:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Did they say they want to kill half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people know what they say.</v>

3410
02:31:05.841 --> 02:31:07.640
<v Speaker 1>That was really shocking to Bohemian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grove.</v>

3411
02:31:07.641 --> 02:31:09.770
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was the real shit.</v>

3413
02:31:12.170 --> 02:31:13.003
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Jim Brown type shit dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is like if you want to go </v>

3414
02:31:15.891 --> 02:31:19.290
<v Speaker 1>back to like conspiracy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel like that,</v>

3415
02:31:19.291 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 1>get excited about</v>

3416
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:20.813
<v Speaker 7>something when you find out that there </v>
<v Speaker 7>really are a bunch of global elites to </v>

3417
02:31:23.371 --> 02:31:28.270
<v Speaker 7>get on this ranch and they got a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>giant stone owl and they burn a,</v>

3418
02:31:28.271 --> 02:31:32.970
<v Speaker 7>a bundle of wood in effigy and they all </v>
<v Speaker 7>were fucking masks and Shit and then you</v>

3419
02:31:32.971 --> 02:31:37.200
<v Speaker 7>actually have video footage of it and </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's weird sort of a ceremony they're</v>

3420
02:31:37.201 --> 02:31:41.670
<v Speaker 7>doing and whether or not they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>pretending you're pretending it is,</v>

3421
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:43.320
<v Speaker 7>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever it is,</v>

3422
02:31:43.321 --> 02:31:47.520
<v Speaker 7>it's crazier and I was there and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>have exactly what it is.</v>

3423
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:49.020
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go into that.</v>

3424
02:31:49.130 --> 02:31:50.850
<v Speaker 7>How did you sneak into the Bohemian </v>
<v Speaker 7>Grove?</v>

3425
02:31:50.851 --> 02:31:51.930
<v Speaker 7>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3426
02:31:51.931 --> 02:31:53.600
<v Speaker 7>people always said it was a Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let me.</v>

3427
02:31:53.610 --> 02:31:54.443
<v Speaker 7>And it wasn't quite like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we had an insider wanted to get me </v>

3428
02:31:56.521 --> 02:31:58.800
<v Speaker 7>in to actually see it and most people </v>
<v Speaker 7>aren't bad that go to it.</v>

3429
02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:01.680
<v Speaker 7>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's kind of a gateway into all of this.</v>

3430
02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:02.853
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this is you at Bohemian Grove and </v>

3431
02:32:04.831 --> 02:32:06.770
<v Speaker 7>you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're on the other side of liquor.</v>

3432
02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:08.010
<v Speaker 7>It looks like a little pond or </v>
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

3433
02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:10.560
<v Speaker 7>Feel free to play it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It goes beyond old care.</v>

3434
02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:13.800
<v Speaker 7>May fire make merriment with your dust </v>
<v Speaker 7>where you go,</v>

3435
02:32:13.820 --> 02:32:16.620
<v Speaker 7>no care.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was so strange.</v>

3436
02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:17.513
<v Speaker 7>It was so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Listening to that guy and the speaker </v>

3437
02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:22.630
<v Speaker 7>blaring out across the cronkite play it </v>
<v Speaker 7>put lit.</v>

3438
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:24.540
<v Speaker 7>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's play of that was Walter cronkite.</v>

3439
02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:31.920
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

3440
02:32:36.690 --> 02:32:38.490
<v Speaker 7>sounds like a play for high school.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>

3441
02:32:38.491 --> 02:32:39.324
<v Speaker 7>It's all play,</v>

3442
02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:44.010
<v Speaker 7>but religion started that way as as,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as entertainment.</v>

3443
02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:44.993
<v Speaker 7>So what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is just some really ancient ritual </v>

3444
02:32:47.251 --> 02:32:48.450
<v Speaker 7>that they're redoing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3445
02:32:48.451 --> 02:32:49.284
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was no big deal till I was </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the crown of old men that were </v>

3446
02:32:51.240 --> 02:32:52.530
<v Speaker 7>lavishing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were like,</v>

3447
02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:53.453
<v Speaker 7>they loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I certainly had jackie lighting and </v>

3448
02:32:54.291 --> 02:32:56.680
<v Speaker 7>their pants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you sure?</v>

3449
02:32:57.810 --> 02:32:59.370
<v Speaker 7>Are you projecting?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3450
02:32:59.371 --> 02:33:00.860
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were like to see.</v>

3451
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:05.340
<v Speaker 7>What is it about people that love those </v>
<v Speaker 7>secret societies?</v>

3452
02:33:05.370 --> 02:33:06.203
<v Speaker 7>Like you remember that jfk speech about </v>
<v Speaker 7>secret societies who will not tolerate </v>

3453
02:33:08.731 --> 02:33:09.271
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3454
02:33:09.271 --> 02:33:11.040
<v Speaker 7>It's a fucking beautiful speech.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3455
02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:12.630
<v Speaker 7>because I'll pull it up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jimmy,</v>

3456
02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:17.750
<v Speaker 7>pull up jfk speech about what power over</v>
<v Speaker 7>others that don't crave secret essence,</v>

3457
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:20.370
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're looking for that secret place.</v>

3458
02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:21.840
<v Speaker 7>The most high.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3459
02:33:21.870 --> 02:33:23.320
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>

3460
02:33:23.350 --> 02:33:24.183
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's just like you were talking </v>

3461
02:33:25.051 --> 02:33:26.940
<v Speaker 7>about pedophiles,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just like you know,</v>

3462
02:33:26.941 --> 02:33:30.440
<v Speaker 7>any other deviant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck yeah.</v>

3463
02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:34.380
<v Speaker 7>I just want to go eat a big pile of </v>
<v Speaker 7>steaks and drink some beer.</v>

3464
02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:36.570
<v Speaker 7>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's crank this up.</v>

3465
02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:38.433
<v Speaker 11>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The very word secrecy is repugnant in a </v>

3466
02:33:42.791 --> 02:33:43.624
<v Speaker 11>free and open society and we are as a </v>
<v Speaker 11>people inherently and historically </v>

3467
02:33:49.630 --> 02:33:52.810
<v Speaker 11>opposed to secret societies to secret </v>
<v Speaker 11>oaths</v>

3468
02:33:53.430 --> 02:33:55.230
<v Speaker 7>and a secret proceeding.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm by myself,</v>

3469
02:33:55.231 --> 02:33:56.064
<v Speaker 7>but case please don't put this on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if you've ever heard this </v>

3470
02:33:58.830 --> 02:34:01.080
<v Speaker 7>excessive and I'm just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 7>secret societies</v>

3471
02:34:01.490 --> 02:34:02.323
<v Speaker 11>of pertinent facts far outweigh the </v>
<v Speaker 11>dangers which are cited to justify it </v>

3472
02:34:08.090 --> 02:34:08.923
<v Speaker 11>even today.</v>
<v Speaker 11>There is little value in opposing the </v>

3473
02:34:11.631 --> 02:34:16.460
<v Speaker 11>threat of a closed society by imitating </v>
<v Speaker 11>its arbitrary restrictions.</v>

3474
02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:18.153
<v Speaker 11>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there is little value in ensuring the </v>

3475
02:34:20.861 --> 02:34:25.861
<v Speaker 11>survival of our nation if our traditions</v>
<v Speaker 11>do not survive with it and there is very</v>

3476
02:34:27.251 --> 02:34:28.084
<v Speaker 11>grave danger that an announced need for </v>
<v Speaker 11>increased security will be seized upon </v>

3477
02:34:33.821 --> 02:34:34.654
<v Speaker 11>by those anxious to expand its meaning </v>
<v Speaker 11>to the very limits of official </v>

3478
02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:39.353
<v Speaker 11>censorship and concealment.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That I do not intend to permit to the </v>

3479
02:34:43.601 --> 02:34:48.220
<v Speaker 11>extent that it's in my control and no </v>
<v Speaker 11>official of my administration,</v>

3480
02:34:48.250 --> 02:34:53.250
<v Speaker 11>whether his rank is high or low,</v>
<v Speaker 11>civilian or military should interpret my</v>

3481
02:34:53.531 --> 02:34:58.531
<v Speaker 11>words here tonight as an excuse to </v>
<v Speaker 11>censor the news to stifle dissent.</v>

3482
02:34:58.840 --> 02:34:59.673
<v Speaker 11>They knew it to cover up our mistakes or</v>
<v Speaker 11>to withhold from the press and the </v>

3483
02:35:03.641 --> 02:35:06.310
<v Speaker 11>public,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the facts they deserve to know,</v>

3484
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:08.423
<v Speaker 11>but we are opposed around the world by a</v>
<v Speaker 11>monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that </v>

3485
02:35:13.991 --> 02:35:14.824
<v Speaker 11>relies primarily on covet means for </v>
<v Speaker 11>expanding its sphere of influence on </v>

3486
02:35:19.961 --> 02:35:20.794
<v Speaker 11>infiltration instead of invasion on </v>
<v Speaker 11>severity instead of elections on </v>

3487
02:35:26.531 --> 02:35:31.531
<v Speaker 11>intimidation instead of free choice on </v>
<v Speaker 11>guerrillas by night instead of armies by</v>

3488
02:35:32.831 --> 02:35:33.664
<v Speaker 11>day.</v>

3489
02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:35.073
<v Speaker 11>It is a system which has conscripted </v>
<v Speaker 11>vast human and material resources into </v>

3490
02:35:40.421 --> 02:35:41.254
<v Speaker 11>the building of a tightly knit,</v>
<v Speaker 11>highly efficient machine that combines </v>

3491
02:35:45.461 --> 02:35:48.790
<v Speaker 11>military,</v>
<v Speaker 11>diplomatic intelligence,</v>

3492
02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.420
<v Speaker 11>economic science comments,</v>
<v Speaker 11>political operations.</v>

3493
02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:56.110
<v Speaker 11>Its preparations are concealed,</v>
<v Speaker 11>not published.</v>

3494
02:35:56.650 --> 02:35:59.290
<v Speaker 11>It's mistakes have buried,</v>
<v Speaker 11>not headlined,</v>

3495
02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:02.800
<v Speaker 11>its dissenters.</v>
<v Speaker 11>A silenced not praised.</v>

3496
02:36:03.430 --> 02:36:06.610
<v Speaker 11>No expenditure is questioned.</v>
<v Speaker 11>No rumor is printed.</v>

3497
02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:12.150
<v Speaker 11>No secret is revealed.</v>
<v Speaker 11>No president should face public scrutiny</v>

3498
02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:13.413
<v Speaker 11>of his program.</v>
<v Speaker 11>For from that scrutiny comes </v>

3499
02:36:15.671 --> 02:36:16.504
<v Speaker 11>understanding and from that </v>
<v Speaker 11>understanding comes support or </v>

3500
02:36:19.601 --> 02:36:20.434
<v Speaker 11>opposition and both unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm not asking your newspapers to </v>

3501
02:36:24.491 --> 02:36:25.324
<v Speaker 11>support an administration,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I am asking your help approach and </v>

3502
02:36:29.471 --> 02:36:30.304
<v Speaker 11>the tremendous task of informing and </v>
<v Speaker 11>alerting the American people for I have </v>

3503
02:36:34.871 --> 02:36:35.770
<v Speaker 11>complete confidence</v>

3504
02:36:38.140 --> 02:36:40.000
<v Speaker 7>kilter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a.</v>

3505
02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:41.203
<v Speaker 7>that's such a crazy speech because it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>him talking about the structures that </v>

3506
02:36:44.541 --> 02:36:45.374
<v Speaker 7>were already in place and about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>dangers of withholding information for </v>

3507
02:36:48.951 --> 02:36:49.784
<v Speaker 7>people and him being forthright as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>president in a way that we've never </v>

3508
02:36:53.781 --> 02:36:56.630
<v Speaker 7>heard before since like he's literally </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking,</v>

3509
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:57.890
<v Speaker 7>Jill trump,</v>
<v Speaker 7>trump,</v>

3510
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:58.641
<v Speaker 7>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 7>spending like that.</v>

3511
02:36:58.641 --> 02:36:59.960
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what a trump tell you.</v>

3512
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:01.160
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we.</v>

3513
02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:01.993
<v Speaker 7>Let's just be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's talking about our own military </v>

3514
02:37:04.041 --> 02:37:06.110
<v Speaker 7>industrial complex that Eisenhower </v>
<v Speaker 7>warned about.</v>

3515
02:37:06.170 --> 02:37:08.960
<v Speaker 7>His outgoing predecessor.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's talking about the Soviets there.</v>

3516
02:37:08.961 --> 02:37:10.850
<v Speaker 7>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was a really smart cookie.</v>

3517
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:13.840
<v Speaker 7>The Eisenhower warning is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>creepiest things in human history.</v>

3518
02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:15.710
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Military,</v>

3519
02:37:15.711 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 7>industrial</v>

<v Speaker 2>a lot of smart people in different </v>
<v Speaker 2>points of their life,</v>

3541
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:27.500
<v Speaker 2>they begin to realize how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many lives they've been told.</v>

3542
02:38:27.501 --> 02:38:29.720
<v Speaker 2>They begin to wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not totally woke up,</v>

3543
02:38:29.721 --> 02:38:33.170
<v Speaker 2>but they begin to wake up and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out about nine slash 11,</v>

3544
02:38:33.171 --> 02:38:35.720
<v Speaker 2>but that don't believe all this other </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and then they find out about this,</v>

3545
02:38:35.721 --> 02:38:36.890
<v Speaker 2>but they don't believe in all that other</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3546
02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:37.843
<v Speaker 2>Then they find out about that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the very high level it's like the </v>

3547
02:38:39.861 --> 02:38:40.730
<v Speaker 2>dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3548
02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this shit is true.</v>

3549
02:38:42.831 --> 02:38:45.380
<v Speaker 2>If you could follow the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably true.</v>

3550
02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:47.630
<v Speaker 2>You might be wrong one or two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

3551
02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:51.710
<v Speaker 2>but generally we're dealing with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally crooked situation.</v>

3552
02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:52.713
<v Speaker 2>That's what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not stealing money from </v>

3553
02:38:54.111 --> 02:38:56.330
<v Speaker 2>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You steal money from a corporation.</v>

3554
02:38:56.331 --> 02:38:57.770
<v Speaker 2>They're going to come after you and kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3555
02:38:58.080 --> 02:38:58.913
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what they're doing is the mastery </v>

3556
02:39:01.161 --> 02:39:01.994
<v Speaker 2>of stealing tax money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what this is all about is just </v>

3557
02:39:05.810 --> 02:39:06.643
<v Speaker 2>stealing tax because nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody's going to go after tax </v>

3558
02:39:12.201 --> 02:39:13.034
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get all these programs and these </v>

3559
02:39:13.911 --> 02:39:17.150
<v Speaker 2>bills pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's play this good Jamie.</v>

3560
02:39:17.330 --> 02:39:21.530
<v Speaker 2>These military contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tax payers are paying for all this.</v>

3561
02:39:21.740 --> 02:39:22.573
<v Speaker 6>Their livelihood are all involved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So is the very structure of our society </v>

3562
02:39:28.170 --> 02:39:29.003
<v Speaker 6>in the councils of government.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to guard against the </v>

3563
02:39:31.671 --> 02:39:32.504
<v Speaker 6>acquisition of unwarranted influence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether sought or unsought by the </v>

3564
02:39:36.441 --> 02:39:41.441
<v Speaker 6>military industrial complex.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The potential for the disastrous rise of</v>

3565
02:39:42.111 --> 02:39:42.944
<v Speaker 6>misplaced power exists and will persist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We must never let the weight of this </v>

3566
02:39:48.111 --> 02:39:51.740
<v Speaker 6>combination in danger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our liberties or democratic processes,</v>

3567
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.903
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just let that out like it was so tight </v>

3568
02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:58.610
<v Speaker 2>because you think about this back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>early days of radio,</v>

3569
02:39:58.611 --> 02:40:03.611
<v Speaker 2>in the early days of moving pictures </v>
<v Speaker 2>only finish.</v>

3570
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Only the elite had access to this </v>

3635
02:42:59.070 --> 02:42:59.903
<v Speaker 1>It's totally compartmentalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you run a drill of the World Trade </v>

3636
02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:05.880

<v Speaker 2>They need a drill going on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a test.</v>

3656
02:43:52.570 --> 02:43:53.403
<v Speaker 2>it's remote controlled dumb thing they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said about the drone jetliners and they </v>

3657
02:43:57.401 --> 02:43:59.830
<v Speaker 2>were going to blow up that jetliner and </v>
<v Speaker 2>blame it on the Cubans.</v>

3658
02:43:59.831 --> 02:44:01.690
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't going to be a jetliner </v>
<v Speaker 2>filled with people.</v>

3659
02:44:01.690 --> 02:44:03.820
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a drone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have the capability.</v>

3660

<v Speaker 2>Bloated with explosives as drones to </v>
<v Speaker 2>crash into Germany.</v>

3669
02:44:37.270 --> 02:44:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Joe Kennedy Junior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

3670
02:44:39.310 --> 02:44:42.240
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing about the Kennedy's is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you know,</v>

3671
02:44:42.241 --> 02:44:43.074
<v Speaker 2>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times you see criminals come </v>

3672
02:44:44.981 --> 02:44:49.930
<v Speaker 2>from like a good family and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>see Robert Kennedy and John F Kennedy.</v>

3673
02:44:50.050 --> 02:44:52.810
<v Speaker 2>They come from gangs to his dad is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gangster,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and then he has two kids.</v>

3675
02:44:56.291 --> 02:44:59.650
<v Speaker 2>They thought they had him under control </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's from a Mafia family.</v>

3676
02:45:00.370 --> 02:45:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the guy's named Joe Kennedy.</v>

3677
02:45:04.061 --> 02:45:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like you're the opposite of</v>

<v Speaker 2>your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you want to go against your </v>

3679
02:45:08.201 --> 02:45:11.860
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Robert Kennedy and John F Kennedy,</v>

3680
02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:12.933
<v Speaker 2>they went against that shit that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only reason they were in there </v>

3681
02:45:18.041 --> 02:45:21.440
<v Speaker 2>because of the mob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mob supported Bob Stole Illinois for</v>

3682
02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:26.080
<v Speaker 2>and the mom supported John F Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was hanging out with Frank Sinatra.</v>

3683
02:45:26.170 --> 02:45:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden he flipped and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what?</v>

3684
02:45:28.300 --> 02:45:30.550
<v Speaker 2>He stopped hanging out with Frank </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sinatra.</v>

3685
02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:34.510
<v Speaker 2>He started changing his ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something flipped.</v>

3686
02:45:34.690 --> 02:45:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Did the did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he have a kid that died or something</v>

<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that something made him flip?</v>

3688
02:45:41.590 --> 02:45:43.720

<v Speaker 2>total bullshit,</v>

3689
02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:46.900
<v Speaker 2>but it could be that he had a son that </v>
<v Speaker 2>died and made them flip.</v>

3690
02:45:48.210 --> 02:45:50.200

<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had pneumonia.</v>

3747
02:48:18.980 --> 02:48:19.813
<v Speaker 3>You know what I haven't done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't ever walked and just fallen </v>

3748
02:48:21.411 --> 02:48:24.680
<v Speaker 3>down while I'm walking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really frayed as the background and then</v>

3749
02:48:24.681 --> 02:48:29.480
<v Speaker 3>comment on it because this is key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's known that in 2012 when she fell on</v>

3750
02:48:29.481 --> 02:48:30.314
<v Speaker 3>her head and she's got a severe </v>
<v Speaker 3>concussion that was worrying for my </v>

3751
02:48:32.781 --> 02:48:33.441
<v Speaker 3>sources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

3752
02:48:33.441 --> 02:48:34.550
<v Speaker 3>she's in the hospital for a year.</v>

3753
02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Then she was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3754
02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:39.610
<v Speaker 3>she was fucked up for six whole months </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to clinton to bill,</v>

3755
02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:42.500
<v Speaker 3>so she looks like hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know where she is.</v>

3756
02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:44.420
<v Speaker 3>And then meanwhile I'm told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3757
02:48:44.421 --> 02:48:47.450
<v Speaker 3>she's falling down all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looks like hell on tv.</v>

3758
02:48:47.900 --> 02:48:49.550
<v Speaker 3>And then secret service says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3759
02:48:49.551 --> 02:48:52.460
<v Speaker 3>you've got the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get up off your ass and follow her.</v>

3760
02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:55.790
<v Speaker 3>So we follow her in like five cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't catch it.</v>

3761
02:48:55.791 --> 02:48:57.890
<v Speaker 3>We were in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sneak her out.</v>

3762
02:48:57.891 --> 02:49:00.560
<v Speaker 3>She falls down having epilepsy every 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes,</v>

3763
02:49:00.561 --> 02:49:03.620
<v Speaker 3>30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The poInt is is my intel was good.</v>

3764
02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:06.680
<v Speaker 3>They gave us good info.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are the elite thinking?</v>

3765
02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:07.980
<v Speaker 3>They're going to put somebody in</v>

3766
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:09.120
<v Speaker 1>with epilepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm saying.</v>

3767
02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:13.050
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that it was just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea was she can hold it together.</v>

3768
02:49:13.051 --> 02:49:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Just anything rather than get as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

3769
02:49:15.350 --> 02:49:17.100
<v Speaker 1>If they just want her to get her </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

3770
02:49:17.130 --> 02:49:19.920
<v Speaker 1>get all those girls like oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is great.</v>

3771
02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:22.410
<v Speaker 1>And then they pass all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucking bills,</v>

3772
02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:23.573
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to me that when all this was </v>

3773
02:49:25.351 --> 02:49:26.184
<v Speaker 1>happening that people so desperately </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to not look at it because the </v>

3774
02:49:29.221 --> 02:49:30.054
<v Speaker 1>alternative was trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that they were taking an </v>

3775
02:49:31.411 --> 02:49:32.730
<v Speaker 1>objective look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3776
02:49:33.090 --> 02:49:33.923
<v Speaker 1>maybe she shouldn't be blacking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you consideR that massive head </v>

3777
02:49:36.841 --> 02:49:38.970
<v Speaker 1>injury that she had in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is real.</v>

3778
02:49:38.971 --> 02:49:41.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like it when you bring that up</v>

3779
02:49:41.311 --> 02:49:43.080
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they think if you bring that up,</v>

3780
02:49:43.230 --> 02:49:45.820
<v Speaker 1>you're going to change people's opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to help trump win.</v>

3781
02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Can I just spend two minutes talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your audience?</v>

3782
02:49:49.351 --> 02:49:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which camera is about trump.</v>

3783
02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:51.653
<v Speaker 1>That one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just auto claim to have all the answers </v>

3784
02:49:55.710 --> 02:49:58.530
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not here to boost Your trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm tied to his wagon.</v>

3785
02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:00.360
<v Speaker 1>If I attack trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd make more money.</v>

3786
02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:02.130
<v Speaker 1>This isn't about money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the truth.</v>

3787
02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Trump really is trying to cut taxes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make people successful and wealthy.</v>

3788
02:50:07.470 --> 02:50:09.340
<v Speaker 1>He really does care about the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

3789
02:50:09.380 --> 02:50:12.870
<v Speaker 1>The elite have set up a plan to slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to make folks poor.</v>

3790
02:50:13.290 --> 02:50:14.123
<v Speaker 1>And all I'm asking you to do is get past</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you're part of the </v>

3791
02:50:17.821 --> 02:50:20.280
<v Speaker 1>establishment or you're smart because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're anti trump.</v>

3792
02:50:20.490 --> 02:50:21.323
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking you to actually look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really been going on and </v>

3793
02:50:24.391 --> 02:50:26.820
<v Speaker 1>understand that democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>republicans come and go.</v>

3794
02:50:26.821 --> 02:50:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Some are good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some are bad.</v>

3795
02:50:28.290 --> 02:50:32.010
<v Speaker 1>The whole power structure has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>against trump for a very serious reason.</v>

3796
02:50:32.490 --> 02:50:33.323
<v Speaker 1>Trump is coming after them and really is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to bring down this whole </v>

3797
02:50:36.571 --> 02:50:37.404
<v Speaker 1>global system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where all hell's breaking </v>

3798
02:50:38.641 --> 02:50:39.474
<v Speaker 1>loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just want your viewers and </v>

3799
02:50:39.781 --> 02:50:42.000
<v Speaker 1>listeners know I'm not some political </v>
<v Speaker 1>hack.</v>

3800
02:50:42.001 --> 02:50:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be against bush.</v>

3801
02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:45.383
<v Speaker 1>I Wish obama would have been real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is they got to obama with </v>

3802
02:50:48.270 --> 02:50:49.890
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a damn.</v>

3803
02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:51.690
<v Speaker 1>They admit they're offering money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

3804
02:50:51.691 --> 02:50:52.524
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think what trump could or excuse </v>

3805
02:50:54.751 --> 02:50:55.584
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what obama could have been his who he </v>

3806
02:50:56.761 --> 02:50:57.594
<v Speaker 1>was when he was running for office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was this radical element of </v>

3807
02:50:59.941 --> 02:51:01.650
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope and change.</v>

3808
02:51:01.860 --> 02:51:04.680
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to close down guantanamo bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's wanting to do all these things.</v>

3809
02:51:04.830 --> 02:51:09.830
<v Speaker 1>But one of the posters in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during his administration,</v>

3810
02:51:10.771 --> 02:51:14.820
<v Speaker 1>the dea decided to not take marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the schedule.</v>

3811
02:51:14.821 --> 02:51:17.460
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows it's not scheduled yet.</v>

3812
02:51:17.480 --> 02:51:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Was the cover for schedule one means no </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical use.</v>

3813
02:51:21.930 --> 02:51:24.970
<v Speaker 1>He's start looking at the time it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it means to be schedule one.</v>

3814
02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:29.070
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that marijuana is schedule </v>
<v Speaker 1>one when it's the most useful out of all</v>

3815
02:51:29.071 --> 02:51:31.320
<v Speaker 1>the different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various illegal smart you are joe.</v>

3816
02:51:31.321 --> 02:51:33.520
<v Speaker 1>You smoke marijuana quite a bit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still smart guys.</v>

3817
02:51:33.540 --> 02:51:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not bad for just smelling it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't even think here.</v>

3818
02:51:36.450 --> 02:51:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get serious.</v>

3819
02:51:39.310 --> 02:51:40.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trump about what are those </v>

3820
02:51:41.941 --> 02:51:43.950
<v Speaker 1>conversations about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the people knoW.</v>

3821
02:51:45.930 --> 02:51:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean trump really wants to make poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>people rich.</v>

3822
02:51:49.320 --> 02:51:51.480
<v Speaker 1>He really wants you to feed </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivism.</v>

3823
02:51:51.990 --> 02:51:52.823
<v Speaker 1>Collectivism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hates all the bashing the family and </v>

3824
02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:57.480
<v Speaker 1>what's collected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the new world order.</v>

3825
02:51:57.540 --> 02:52:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Collectivism is this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like you're not an individual.</v>

3826
02:52:00.541 --> 02:52:03.450
<v Speaker 1>You're like part of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And truMp can't stand that.</v>

3827
02:52:03.451 --> 02:52:05.070
<v Speaker 1>He can't stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing as a businessman,</v>

3828
02:52:05.530 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 1>business</v>

3829
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:10.870
<v Speaker 2>deals where China has like 35 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>currency tariffs on us.</v>

3830
02:52:10.871 --> 02:52:11.704
<v Speaker 2>There's no way he could even compete and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shutting off our power plants </v>

3831
02:52:14.111 --> 02:52:16.810
<v Speaker 2>with regulations but not theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we do that then?</v>

3832
02:52:16.820 --> 02:52:19.810
<v Speaker 2>What is the reason why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because our elites under,</v>

3833
02:52:19.811 --> 02:52:20.561
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite frankly,</v>

<v Speaker 2>under,</v>

02:52:21.310 --> 02:52:22.930
<v Speaker 2>under kissinger and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3836
02:52:22.931 --> 02:52:24.010
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course,</v>

3837
02:52:24.011 --> 02:52:25.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3838
02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:26.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president who was in that </v>

3839
02:52:28.721 --> 02:52:30.760
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nixon,</v>

3840
02:52:31.150 --> 02:52:31.983
<v Speaker 2>dave made a one sided deal for a leech </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go make deals with China and their </v>

3841
02:52:34.421 --> 02:52:37.210
<v Speaker 2>billion plus slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say that condescendingly,</v>

3842
02:52:37.211 --> 02:52:39.670
<v Speaker 2>they're like slaves to leverage out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>west,</v>

3843
02:52:39.671 --> 02:52:42.850
<v Speaker 2>the whole world's industry and trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like those ones side of deals.</v>

3844
02:52:42.851 --> 02:52:43.690
<v Speaker 2>And he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3845
02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:47.200
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to impoverish America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to empower America and we're</v>

3846
02:52:47.201 --> 02:52:50.530
<v Speaker 2>going to actually use american power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>promote freedom worldwide.</v>

3847
02:52:51.010 --> 02:52:53.160
<v Speaker 2>So let me get this straight for guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>like me that,</v>

3848
02:52:53.240 --> 02:52:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all trump's does little promises.</v>

3849
02:52:56.470 --> 02:52:59.680
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in layman's terms,</v>

3850
02:53:01.230 --> 02:53:03.730
<v Speaker 2>the elite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people in power,</v>

3851
02:53:03.820 --> 02:53:07.030
<v Speaker 2>the people that had the green light </v>
<v Speaker 2>power to sign these treaties,</v>

3852
02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:10.890
<v Speaker 2>they were maybe offered a couple meal </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

3853
02:53:10.930 --> 02:53:15.490
<v Speaker 2>couple meal there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sign this to sell the country out so</v>

3854
02:53:15.491 --> 02:53:16.324
<v Speaker 2>that they could make $10,000,005</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion thing like that is something </v>

3855
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:20.343
<v Speaker 2>that you asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got colonized by corporate takeover </v>

3856
02:53:22.061 --> 02:53:22.894
<v Speaker 2>artists and trump at the end said f you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're goIng to take their whole </v>

3857
02:53:25.751 --> 02:53:27.430
<v Speaker 2>global system.</v>

02:58:47.810 --> 02:58:48.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3972
02:58:48.190 --> 02:58:49.023
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>

3973
02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:52.470
<v Speaker 8>Let me ask you something really quickly </v>
<v Speaker 8>is very important.</v>

3974
02:58:52.530 --> 02:58:54.930
<v Speaker 8>Let me ask you a super important.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I feel like I was,</v>

3975
02:58:54.931 --> 02:58:55.764
<v Speaker 8>I was trying to say this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we had to go back and finish up </v>

3976
02:58:57.580 --> 02:58:58.740
<v Speaker 8>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but this is very important.</v>

3977
02:58:59.370 --> 02:59:00.203
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3978
02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:03.060
<v Speaker 8>I teach jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got students all over the world.</v>

3979
02:59:03.061 --> 02:59:05.090
<v Speaker 8>I got schools all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

3980
02:59:05.360 --> 02:59:10.360
<v Speaker 8>I have all my students.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm a west star tool to wake up,</v>

3981
02:59:10.700 --> 02:59:12.360
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's like a metaphor.</v>

3982
02:59:12.600 --> 02:59:15.870
<v Speaker 8>I'm a conspiracy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like at different times.</v>

3983
02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:16.773
<v Speaker 8>Some are just into me for jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they believed the cNn site 100 </v>

3984
02:59:19.351 --> 02:59:20.184
<v Speaker 8>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it takes him three years and they're </v>

3985
02:59:21.121 --> 02:59:21.954
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh shit.</v>

3986
02:59:21.990 --> 02:59:24.240
<v Speaker 8>They started smoking weed and damn there</v>
<v Speaker 8>all,</v>

3987
02:59:24.270 --> 02:59:28.740
<v Speaker 8>all over the conspiracy faCt,</v>
<v Speaker 8>everybody awakens at a different point.</v>

3988
02:59:28.890 --> 02:59:30.470
<v Speaker 8>No matter how smart they are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you cAn,</v>

3989
02:59:30.510 --> 02:59:32.610
<v Speaker 8>you can get your master's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your phd,</v>

3990
02:59:32.730 --> 02:59:33.481
<v Speaker 8>you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

3991
02:59:33.481 --> 02:59:34.314
<v Speaker 8>I'm a scientist or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you're working for the government </v>

3992
02:59:36.330 --> 02:59:38.070
<v Speaker 8>and you ain't thinking about you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But listen,</v>

3993
02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:39.840
<v Speaker 8>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you think donald,</v>

3994
02:59:39.870 --> 02:59:43.620
<v Speaker 8>do you think Donald Trump is in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>middle of an awakening,</v>

3995
02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:47.910
<v Speaker 8>awakening from a hundred percent real?</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's like,</v>

3996
02:59:47.940 --> 02:59:49.710
<v Speaker 8>is he in the middle of an awakening?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

3997
02:59:50.310 --> 02:59:54.870
<v Speaker 8>because he could easily have been a </v>
<v Speaker 8>billionaire tumor two years ago who,</v>

3998
02:59:54.960 --> 02:59:57.570
<v Speaker 8>who bought all the mainstream shit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he was a billionaire.</v>

3999
02:59:57.571 --> 02:59:59.070
<v Speaker 8>He didn't give a fuck about the </v>
<v Speaker 8>mainstream shit.</v>

4000
02:59:59.190 --> 03:00:03.600
<v Speaker 8>He's cutting deals blowing up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but now you know at a certain point,</v>

4001
03:00:03.601 --> 03:00:05.670
<v Speaker 8>no matter where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no matter how smart you are,</v>

4002
03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:08.930
<v Speaker 8>you awaken a little,</v>
<v Speaker 8>little by little trump.</v>

4003
03:00:09.680 --> 03:00:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump knows which way the wind's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

4004
03:00:13.120 --> 03:00:15.380
<v Speaker 1>and as julius caesar in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

4005
03:00:16.250 --> 03:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>in the famous play by william </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare of julius caesar,</v>

4006
03:00:19.940 --> 03:00:22.130
<v Speaker 1>there is a tide in the affairs of malmo </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken at the flood,</v>

4007
03:00:22.131 --> 03:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>leads onto fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as mark twain said,</v>

4008
03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:27.500
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning of patriots have scarce</v>
<v Speaker 1>man hated and feared scorn,</v>

4009
03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>but a time when has caused exceeds it </v>
<v Speaker 1>costs.</v>

4010
03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Nothing has Joined a patriot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what's happening right now.</v>

4011
03:00:35.210 --> 03:00:36.043
<v Speaker 1>There's a major shift happening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump really wants to empower the </v>

4012
03:00:38.691 --> 03:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Globalism is anti human,</v>

4013
03:00:42.020 --> 03:00:42.853
<v Speaker 1>and so all I'm trying to get at is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that some really big things are </v>

4014
03:00:46.191 --> 03:00:47.024
<v Speaker 1>happening in this world and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching shouldn't be conservative or </v>

4015
03:00:50.301 --> 03:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CAn you stop?</v>

4016
03:00:51.561 --> 03:00:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Can I stop you for a moment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>

4017
03:00:52.850 --> 03:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>When you say globalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by that?</v>

4018
03:00:54.891 --> 03:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Please define that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Globalism is like neo colonialism,</v>

4019
03:00:58.761 --> 03:01:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's colonialism over humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

4020
03:01:02.981 --> 03:01:04.840
<v Speaker 1>government states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old world,</v>

4021
03:01:04.841 --> 03:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worldwide.</v>

4022
03:01:06.551 --> 03:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Colonialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rothchild,</v>

4023
03:01:08.090 --> 03:01:08.923
<v Speaker 1>but financially it's monopoly is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant populations and create </v>

4024
03:01:14.530 --> 03:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>centralized systems of monopolies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling wants to innovation.</v>

4025
03:01:18.310 --> 03:01:22.240
<v Speaker 1>It wants to end up where mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalism is.</v>

4026
03:01:22.241 --> 03:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Corporate world government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they want to stop innovation?</v>

4027
03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Because they see it as a bourbon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see it as what they call it,</v>

4028
03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>disruptive technology and humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So powerful.</v>

4029
03:01:33.491 --> 03:01:34.324
<v Speaker 1>You've already got a monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is this a recent consideration after </v>

4030
03:01:36.161 --> 03:01:36.980
<v Speaker 1>the unit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been.</v>

4031
03:01:36.980 --> 03:01:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Internet has been in global is bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

4032
03:01:39.911 --> 03:01:41.710
<v Speaker 1>but yes we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that's true.</v>

4033
03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Since they've already got control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want competition to end.</v>

4034
03:01:44.890 --> 03:01:46.990
<v Speaker 1>They're in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want challengers.</v>

4035
03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:48.850
<v Speaker 1>They've seized control of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche,</v>

4036
03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.550
<v Speaker 1>human development to the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got it all.</v>

4037
03:01:51.551 --> 03:01:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I think they're getting rid of humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and becoming gods.</v>

4038
03:01:53.920 --> 03:01:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Whatever dimension they're tuned into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told them that.</v>

4039
03:01:56.020 --> 03:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>So they want debates to end and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want authoritarianism.</v>

4040
03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:01.450
<v Speaker 1>They want to see what would happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4041
03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is Donald Trump going to stop this?</v>

4042
03:02:06.100 --> 03:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>A bulk came off the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4043
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:08.383
<v Speaker 1>going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cns making bolts come up and hoping it </v>

4044
03:02:10.811 --> 03:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex,</v>

4045
03:02:11.891 --> 03:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>how are you hoping they have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking?</v>

4046
03:02:15.640 --> 03:02:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Chances are energy siphons there </v>
<v Speaker 1>vampiric actions of course,</v>

4047
03:02:19.391 --> 03:02:20.224
<v Speaker 1>so if he actually cuts taxes to poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and middle class and gets rid of </v>

4048
03:02:22.961 --> 03:02:25.690
<v Speaker 1>tax incentives for really rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not coming after the rich,</v>

4049
03:02:25.691 --> 03:02:26.524
<v Speaker 1>but from a conservative perspective that</v>
<v Speaker 1>republicans are cheering and so is that </v>

4050
03:02:29.561 --> 03:02:30.394
<v Speaker 1>what he wants to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to cut taxes for everybody </v>

4051
03:02:32.110 --> 03:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>except the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna.</v>

4052
03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Encourage them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4053
03:02:34.770 --> 03:02:35.603
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like the opposite of what a </v>

4054
03:02:36.401 --> 03:02:37.430
<v Speaker 1>rich guy would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

4055
03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:38.673
<v Speaker 1>but he understands like Henry Ford did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to sell a car where people can </v>

4056
03:02:42.791 --> 03:02:45.160
<v Speaker 1>afford to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to pay your employees where they</v>

4057
03:02:45.161 --> 03:02:47.350
<v Speaker 1>can buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants real prosperity.</v>

4058
03:02:47.351 --> 03:02:49.420
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is trying to get off in his.</v>

4059
03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:52.570
<v Speaker 1>In his limousine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robin by burnout old towns.</v>

4060
03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Does is has been announced this tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

4061
03:02:55.930 --> 03:02:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So jamie,</v>

4062
03:02:57.491 --> 03:02:58.600
<v Speaker 1>see if he could pull up what it says.</v>

4063
03:02:59.140 --> 03:02:59.973
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that will change people's </v>

4064
03:03:01.091 --> 03:03:01.924
<v Speaker 1>opinions if that really does happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can save a significant amount of </v>

4065
03:03:04.331 --> 03:03:05.600
<v Speaker 1>money in taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem,</v>

4066
03:03:06.040 --> 03:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>the globalist admit they want a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>consolidation,</v>

4067
03:03:09.010 --> 03:03:09.843
<v Speaker 1>they want a global downturn to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her buddies will and accept all the new </v>

4068
03:03:12.671 --> 03:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>taxes and regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so trump is racing.</v>

4069
03:03:16.500 --> 03:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Remember they had for eight years he </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented interest,</v>

4070
03:03:19.210 --> 03:03:20.043
<v Speaker 1>but it was only the big banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump said we're going to keep zero </v>

4071
03:03:21.731 --> 03:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>percent for one year even though he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>against it,</v>

4072
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>but for poor people to get zero percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

4073
03:03:26.230 --> 03:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fee out anyways.</v>

4074
03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>The banks lose the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all just write offs.</v>

4075
03:03:30.130 --> 03:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>They're killing it all now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And raising,</v>

4076
03:03:31.811 --> 03:03:32.644
<v Speaker 1>raising taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump tax reform that will make America </v>

4077
03:03:34.811 --> 03:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>great again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goals of Donald Trump,</v>

4078
03:03:36.521 --> 03:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>number one tax relief for middle class </v>
<v Speaker 1>America in order to achieve the american</v>

4079
03:03:39.671 --> 03:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>dream that people keep more money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their pockets and increase the after tax</v>

4080
03:03:44.580 --> 03:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>wages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

4081
03:03:46.050 --> 03:03:46.883
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplify the tax code to reduce </v>

4082
03:03:48.461 --> 03:03:49.294
<v Speaker 1>headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans face in preparing their taxes </v>

4083
03:03:51.641 --> 03:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>and let everYone keep more of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

4084
03:03:54.250 --> 03:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>So he's traveled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plan,</v>

03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:14.473
<v Speaker 7>that removes nearly 75 million </v>
<v Speaker 7>households all over 50 percent of the </v>

4092
03:04:17.871 --> 03:04:19.540
<v Speaker 7>income tax roles.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I win those.</v>

4097

<v Speaker 7>tax will save an average of nearly </v>

4098
03:04:41.001 --> 03:04:42.620
<v Speaker 7>$1,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>each.</v>

4099
03:04:42.980 --> 03:04:43.761
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not that big.</v>

4100
03:04:43.761 --> 03:04:45.740
<v Speaker 7>If you're the lowest bracket that pays </v>
<v Speaker 7>taxes,</v>

4101
03:04:45.980 --> 03:04:49.180
<v Speaker 7>you basically don't pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't want people to pay in.</v>

4102
03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.280
<v Speaker 7>Taxes are for rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Rich,</v>

4103
03:04:52.281 --> 03:04:55.280
<v Speaker 7>you pay big tips.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get it like these people need money.</v>

4104
03:04:55.280 --> 03:04:56.113
<v Speaker 7>But look at this statement.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No business of any size from a fortune </v>

4105
03:04:58.701 --> 03:04:59.534
<v Speaker 7>500 to a mom and pop shop to a </v>
<v Speaker 7>freelancer living job to job will pay </v>

4106
03:05:04.461 --> 03:05:08.380
<v Speaker 7>more than 15 percent of their business </v>
<v Speaker 7>income in taxes.</v>

4107
03:05:08.390 --> 03:05:09.223
<v Speaker 7>That's just plan this lower rate makes </v>
<v Speaker 7>corporate investments inversions </v>

4108
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:16.400
<v Speaker 7>unnecessary by making america's tax rate</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the best in the world.</v>

4109
03:05:16.760 --> 03:05:18.980
<v Speaker 7>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have one of the highest rates,</v>

4110
03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:19.993
<v Speaker 7>so nobody wants to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No family will have To pay the death </v>

4111
03:05:22.611 --> 03:05:24.230
<v Speaker 7>tax.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Holy shit.</v>

4112
03:05:24.740 --> 03:05:29.740
<v Speaker 7>You know about this deliver man that </v>
<v Speaker 7>trump is for real.</v>

4113
03:05:30.020 --> 03:05:32.390
<v Speaker 7>He's totally.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You earned and saved that money for your</v>

4114
03:05:32.391 --> 03:05:36.410
<v Speaker 7>family and not the government.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You paid taxes on it when you earned it.</v>

4115
03:05:36.620 --> 03:05:37.453
<v Speaker 7>That is so buick immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His athletic applicant is a beautiful </v>

4116
03:05:39.980 --> 03:05:42.320
<v Speaker 7>tax plan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That death tax is disgusting.</v>

4117
03:05:42.530 --> 03:05:45.740
<v Speaker 7>So like if you left money for your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they would take half your money.</v>

4118
03:05:46.280 --> 03:05:47.113
<v Speaker 7>They take some dumb giant chunk of it </v>
<v Speaker 7>and he's saying that's not gonna happen </v>

4119
03:05:50.241 --> 03:05:51.470
<v Speaker 7>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That alone,</v>

4120
03:05:51.920 --> 03:05:54.230
<v Speaker 7>that's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a very good thing.</v>

4121
03:05:54.231 --> 03:05:59.231
<v Speaker 7>So trump has painted this painting land </v>
<v Speaker 7>70 of them and like they're like pushing</v>

4122
03:06:02.301 --> 03:06:04.240
<v Speaker 7>by families with kids like carrie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>carrie,</v>

4123
03:06:04.290 --> 03:06:05.600
<v Speaker 7>carrie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like yelling at families.</v>

<v Speaker 7>They like literally pushed by like </v>

4125
03:06:08.330 --> 03:06:12.020
<v Speaker 7>hispanic families and black people </v>
<v Speaker 7>screaming kkk.</v>

4126
03:06:12.370 --> 03:06:15.890
<v Speaker 7>And I looked at him on tape or just </v>
<v Speaker 7>going like what feels good for people to</v>

4127
03:06:15.891 --> 03:06:16.724
<v Speaker 7>have a clear enemy and if they can </v>
<v Speaker 7>justify in their mind you're a white </v>

4128
03:06:19.521 --> 03:06:24.521
<v Speaker 7>supremacist or anybody on the alt right </v>
<v Speaker 7>is a racist or twelfth kkk.</v>

4129
03:06:25.130 --> 03:06:30.130
<v Speaker 7>And I heard he's a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everyone's marching on the streets.</v>

4130
03:06:33.100 --> 03:06:33.890
<v Speaker 7>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4131
03:06:33.890 --> 03:06:34.723
<v Speaker 7>there's also a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>looking for some sort of solidarity </v>

4132
03:06:38.310 --> 03:06:39.770
<v Speaker 7>pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe they were.</v>

4133
03:06:39.771 --> 03:06:43.400
<v Speaker 7>Maybe They thought that hillary was a </v>
<v Speaker 7>better choice and maybe they got excited</v>

4134
03:06:43.401 --> 03:06:47.090
<v Speaker 7>that they could get together and join up</v>
<v Speaker 7>and walk the streets.</v>

4135
03:06:47.840 --> 03:06:52.840
<v Speaker 7>Anytime you can get people to get </v>
<v Speaker 7>together for a common good in their mind</v>

4136
03:06:53.061 --> 03:06:55.220
<v Speaker 7>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And no one gets arrested,</v>

4137
03:06:55.410 --> 03:06:56.243
<v Speaker 7>that's a good thing.</v>

4138
03:06:57.290 --> 03:06:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Probably no traffic for a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and made it annoying.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4169
03:08:18.510 --> 03:08:19.500
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The truth is,</v>

4170
03:08:20.310 --> 03:08:24.690
<v Speaker 4>the headline was Alex Jones kicked out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of inauguration.</v>

4171
03:08:25.970 --> 03:08:29.370
<v Speaker 4>They have people blocking the hindrances</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they had it all fenced off.</v>

4172
03:08:29.371 --> 03:08:30.990
<v Speaker 4>You could get in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is,</v>

4174
03:08:32.210 --> 03:08:33.270
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

4175
03:08:33.271 --> 03:08:35.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole movement is very aggressive.</v>

4176
03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:36.833
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a response to what they think </v>

4177
03:08:38.191 --> 03:08:40.470
<v Speaker 4>is a aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4178
03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:42.720
<v Speaker 4>you're all over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're slick asking questions.</v>

4179
03:08:43.020 --> 03:08:44.310
<v Speaker 4>Mr john,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have heard.</v>

4180
03:08:44.311 --> 03:08:45.144
<v Speaker 4>Let's be serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is your real worldview or the </v>

4181
03:08:47.641 --> 03:08:51.000
<v Speaker 4>nature of consciousness on this planet </v>
<v Speaker 4>and intergalactic space?</v>

4182
03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:54.540
<v Speaker 4>I've been a been a really honest today </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of true answers.</v>

4183
03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:57.180
<v Speaker 4>So metaphysically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the secret of the universe?</v>

4184
03:08:57.210 --> 03:08:58.043
<v Speaker 4>This is what I think there was a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a organism that was just recently </v>

4185
03:09:01.261 --> 03:09:02.010
<v Speaker 4>discussed.</v>

4186
03:09:02.010 --> 03:09:03.390
<v Speaker 7>We did it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think yesterday,</v>

4187
03:09:03.690 --> 03:09:04.523
<v Speaker 7>and they think it was one of the very </v>
<v Speaker 7>first organisms that was the precursor </v>

4188
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:12.390
<v Speaker 7>to what we eventually became.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then all biological life,</v>

4189
03:09:12.391 --> 03:09:13.224
<v Speaker 7>all like living,</v>
<v Speaker 7>walking things came out of this one </v>

4190
03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:17.500
<v Speaker 7>multicell organism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4191
03:09:18.030 --> 03:09:21.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So one thing I think as that happened,</v>

4192
03:09:21.630 --> 03:09:23.400
<v Speaker 7>whatever hundreds of millions of Years </v>
<v Speaker 7>ago,</v>

4193
03:09:23.401 --> 03:09:25.770
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but whatever,</v>

4194
03:09:26.250 --> 03:09:28.860
<v Speaker 7>however long,</v>
<v Speaker 7>billions of years that happened to go,</v>

4195
03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:32.820
<v Speaker 7>if we keep going in that same direction,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever we are now,</v>

4196
03:09:33.080 --> 03:09:33.913
<v Speaker 7>which is going to be totally </v>
<v Speaker 7>unrecognizable just a few hundred years </v>

4197
03:09:36.781 --> 03:09:38.430
<v Speaker 7>from now or a few thousand years from </v>
<v Speaker 7>now,</v>

4198
03:09:38.431 --> 03:09:42.360
<v Speaker 7>or if we just do it biologically a </v>
<v Speaker 7>million years from now,</v>

4199
03:09:42.480 --> 03:09:46.950
<v Speaker 7>but I think that if human beings managed</v>
<v Speaker 7>stay alive for a long period of time and</v>

4200
03:09:46.951 --> 03:09:51.030
<v Speaker 7>not blow each other up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're on the cusp of figuring out how to</v>

4201
03:09:51.031 --> 03:09:55.450
<v Speaker 7>manipulate our very beings like to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>point where we're not going to be people</v>

4202
03:09:55.451 --> 03:09:56.110
<v Speaker 7>anymore.</v>

4203
03:09:56.110 --> 03:09:57.760
<v Speaker 7>It's just going to chAnge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>

4204
03:09:57.810 --> 03:10:00.370
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Humanity is at the crossroads and that's</v>

4205
03:10:00.371 --> 03:10:01.204
<v Speaker 7>my message today.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The elite have decided they think the </v>

4206
03:10:03.701 --> 03:10:06.310
<v Speaker 7>course of our evolutIon,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm here to say,</v>

4207
03:10:07.180 --> 03:10:09.190
<v Speaker 7>shouldn't we decided to have a debate </v>
<v Speaker 7>about it?</v>

4208
03:10:09.220 --> 03:10:09.711
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have.</v>

4209
03:10:09.711 --> 03:10:13.330
<v Speaker 7>Some of the experiences is a great place</v>
<v Speaker 7>for the people have this insatiable need</v>

4210
03:10:13.331 --> 03:10:15.340
<v Speaker 7>for innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're fascinated by it.</v>

4211
03:10:15.341 --> 03:10:17.590
<v Speaker 7>They want the newest phone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even though their phone works perfect.</v>

4212
03:10:17.620 --> 03:10:19.400
<v Speaker 7>Is that they just want it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have this desire.</v>

4213
03:10:19.401 --> 03:10:20.234
<v Speaker 7>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just like we were talking about </v>

4214
03:10:21.551 --> 03:10:23.800
<v Speaker 7>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these things aren't designed to make you</v>

4215
03:10:23.801 --> 03:10:25.370
<v Speaker 7>addicted to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're just addicted to them.</v>

4216
03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:26.233
<v Speaker 7>They're designed well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a weird sort of connection that </v>

4217
03:10:28.271 --> 03:10:29.104
<v Speaker 7>we have to this technology and I think </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's because of what marshall mcluhan </v>

4218
03:10:32.111 --> 03:10:32.944
<v Speaker 7>said before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's because of what marshall </v>

4219
03:10:34.361 --> 03:10:37.540
<v Speaker 7>mcluhan said that human beings are the </v>
<v Speaker 7>sex organs and the machine world.</v>

4220
03:10:37.540 --> 03:10:39.580
<v Speaker 7>I really think that's what they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing.</v>

4221
03:10:39.730 --> 03:10:40.563
<v Speaker 7>I think all of this integration and all </v>
<v Speaker 7>this innovation of all this kind of the </v>

4222
03:10:42.731 --> 03:10:43.564
<v Speaker 7>primary prevailing does compelling focus</v>
<v Speaker 7>on technology is because evolutionarily </v>

4223
03:10:48.521 --> 03:10:49.354
<v Speaker 7>that's where our biology goes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It goes to technology because it can </v>

4224
03:10:52.721 --> 03:10:56.620
<v Speaker 7>manipulate it at a far faster rate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Our evolution,</v>

4225
03:10:56.621 --> 03:10:57.454
<v Speaker 7>and I hear what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>biomechanically genetically through </v>

4226
03:11:01.330 --> 03:11:04.080
<v Speaker 7>round cells,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not square silicon.</v>

4227
03:11:04.090 --> 03:11:07.630
<v Speaker 7>We do it more beautifully and strongly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I agree with what you're saying.</v>

4228
03:11:07.631 --> 03:11:09.490
<v Speaker 7>Overall,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it's an either or.</v>

4229
03:11:09.491 --> 03:11:11.700
<v Speaker 7>Alice shouldn't just expect alex.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it's either.</v>

4230
03:11:11.820 --> 03:11:12.653
<v Speaker 7>Just accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're going to be able to do shit in </v>

4231
03:11:14.711 --> 03:11:15.544
<v Speaker 7>both ways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether it's integrating combinators </v>

4232
03:11:18.350 --> 03:11:19.181
<v Speaker 7>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to do it.</v>

4233
03:11:19.181 --> 03:11:22.660
<v Speaker 7>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The point is going to be screaming for a</v>

4234
03:11:22.660 --> 03:11:24.250
<v Speaker 7>hundred years from the public needs to </v>
<v Speaker 7>know this.</v>

4235
03:11:24.430 --> 03:11:26.800
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I think the larger debate about it,</v>

4236
03:11:26.950 --> 03:11:27.650
<v Speaker 7>well they do.</v>

4237
03:11:27.650 --> 03:11:28.483
<v Speaker 7>They are learning about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just something that you have to </v>

4238
03:11:29.651 --> 03:11:32.770
<v Speaker 7>seek out and it's really all the </v>
<v Speaker 7>information is control.</v>

4239
03:11:32.780 --> 03:11:33.613
<v Speaker 7>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The information about is about </v>

4240
03:11:35.021 --> 03:11:37.820
<v Speaker 7>innovation and and artificial </v>
<v Speaker 7>intelligence to up.</v>

4241
03:11:38.240 --> 03:11:40.510
<v Speaker 7>They're letting a lot out of this </v>
<v Speaker 7>constant study.</v>

4242
03:11:40.511 --> 03:11:43.660
<v Speaker 7>If you were tony fucking Montana running</v>
<v Speaker 7>the planet,</v>

4243
03:11:43.900 --> 03:11:45.870
<v Speaker 7>would you let that shit out of what you </v>
<v Speaker 7>keep it for you,</v>

4244
03:11:46.090 --> 03:11:46.923
<v Speaker 7>but eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's not.</v>

4245
03:11:46.990 --> 03:11:50.470
<v Speaker 7>Tony Montana is not running science.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The thing is these scientists are almost</v>

4246
03:11:50.471 --> 03:11:53.320
<v Speaker 7>all involved in universities and </v>
<v Speaker 7>different studies and they worked on the</v>

4247
03:11:53.321 --> 03:11:54.970
<v Speaker 7>phds and trying to make a name for </v>
<v Speaker 7>themselves.</v>

4248
03:11:55.150 --> 03:11:55.983
<v Speaker 7>They're exploring all these different </v>
<v Speaker 7>possibilities and then big companies </v>

4249
03:11:58.751 --> 03:11:59.584
<v Speaker 7>that can profit off of it and billions </v>
<v Speaker 7>and billions of dollars like sony or </v>

4250
03:12:02.021 --> 03:12:05.480
<v Speaker 7>apple or any of these other companies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these people up and they're fucking.</v>

4251
03:12:05.770 --> 03:12:08.500
<v Speaker 7>Hold on a second there thing is to </v>
<v Speaker 7>innovate and make money.</v>

4252
03:12:08.560 --> 03:12:09.393
<v Speaker 7>That's what they're there for.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what they do in the envelope and </v>

4253
03:12:11.490 --> 03:12:13.270
<v Speaker 7>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they're not.</v>

4254
03:12:13.271 --> 03:12:14.980
<v Speaker 7>Tony Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you understand this?</v>

4255
03:12:14.981 --> 03:12:16.060
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about two different </v>
<v Speaker 7>things.</v>

4256
03:12:16.830 --> 03:12:19.310
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about some utopia?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

4257
03:12:19.330 --> 03:12:20.163
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Talking about what it's trying to to </v>

4258
03:12:22.451 --> 03:12:25.820
<v Speaker 7>benefit the point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Talking about what intel.</v>

4259
03:12:25.850 --> 03:12:28.990
<v Speaker 7>Here's people who makes iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>doesn't matter.</v>

4260
03:12:29.380 --> 03:12:30.213
<v Speaker 7>We're having a real discussion about the</v>
<v Speaker 7>future of the technological system of </v>

4261
03:12:33.641 --> 03:12:35.710
<v Speaker 7>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't want that discussion.</v>

4262
03:12:35.890 --> 03:12:40.300
<v Speaker 7>She'll this things that whether it's joe</v>
<v Speaker 7>or Alex Jones or eddie bravo,</v>

4263
03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:41.313
<v Speaker 7>we're all having on the joe rogan </v>
<v Speaker 7>experience a dIscussion the elite are </v>

4264
03:12:44.261 --> 03:12:48.010
<v Speaker 7>having right now in Hawaii right now </v>
<v Speaker 7>with zuckerberg.</v>

4265
03:12:48.250 --> 03:12:51.010
<v Speaker 7>I know for a fact the elites are meeting</v>
<v Speaker 7>with zuckerberg in</v>

4266
03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:53.113
<v Speaker 3>facebook to alkali,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the whole point is they're having </v>

4267
03:12:55.780 --> 03:12:56.613
<v Speaker 3>this meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He owns facebook now and we should </v>

4268
03:12:57.861 --> 03:13:01.640
<v Speaker 3>discuss what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is facebook part of the illuminati now?</v>

4269
03:13:01.641 --> 03:13:04.250
<v Speaker 3>You know he's a bear shit in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of it.</v>

4270
03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:05.233
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't you?</v>

4271
03:13:05.650 --> 03:13:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Look at alex that that profile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you do.</v>

4272
03:13:13.060 --> 03:13:14.540
<v Speaker 3>I know you folks off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you do.</v>

4273
03:13:14.580 --> 03:13:15.413
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big issues of the world is he never </v>

4274
03:13:16.491 --> 03:13:18.770
<v Speaker 3>asked me about ronald reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know about aliens.</v>

4275
03:13:21.490 --> 03:13:22.323
<v Speaker 3>I keep coming back to that because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to know what do they know about </v>

4276
03:13:25.611 --> 03:13:26.600
<v Speaker 3>aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you wearing?</v>

4277
03:13:26.990 --> 03:13:28.820
<v Speaker 3>What are they real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4278
03:13:28.821 --> 03:13:33.821
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what I say is not political and it's</v>

4279
03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:34.993
<v Speaker 3>not from my particular perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the known knowledge in the </v>

4280
03:13:38.241 --> 03:13:41.930
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We live in a third dimensional plane.</v>

4281
03:13:42.650 --> 03:13:44.630
<v Speaker 3>We can see the planets and the galaxies.</v>

4282
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:47.720
<v Speaker 3>The sun's hundreds of billions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>galaxies,</v>

4283
03:13:47.721 --> 03:13:51.650
<v Speaker 3>photographed universes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We live in an amazing space.</v>

4284
03:13:51.651 --> 03:13:52.484
<v Speaker 3>Time continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The elites believe that it's not in the </v>

4285
03:13:56.421 --> 03:13:59.240
<v Speaker 3>third dimension that we're mainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>receiving transmissions.</v>

4286
03:14:00.050 --> 03:14:00.883
<v Speaker 3>Ships don't arrive from elvis and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tourists or gt prime for wherever </v>

4287
03:14:04.941 --> 03:14:08.090
<v Speaker 3>they're coming from or meal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeez.</v>

4288
03:14:09.290 --> 03:14:10.123
<v Speaker 3>They come here to inter interdimensional</v>
<v Speaker 3>gates that are much closer through fold </v>

4289
03:14:14.031 --> 03:14:14.864
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we have to discuss the different </v>

4290
03:14:18.410 --> 03:14:22.300
<v Speaker 3>influences there in the universe and on </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that we have freewill and we decide</v>

4291
03:14:22.310 --> 03:14:24.530
<v Speaker 3>what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in any of this.</v>

4292
03:14:25.130 --> 03:14:27.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm simply telling you what the elites </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>

4293
03:14:27.380 --> 03:14:28.213
<v Speaker 3>So they believed thAt there's another </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension and these beings are </v>

4294
03:14:30.570 --> 03:14:33.740
<v Speaker 3>mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need baby blood,</v>

4295
03:14:33.741 --> 03:14:34.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need something.</v>

4296
03:14:34.930 --> 03:14:37.790
<v Speaker 3>They need to tune in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you,</v>

4297
03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:39.560
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're really powerful.</v>

4298
03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:41.873
<v Speaker 3>Were made the image of our creator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our brain is able to tune into the </v>

4299
03:14:44.391 --> 03:14:46.120
<v Speaker 3>lowest dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hIghest.</v>

4300
03:14:46.120 --> 03:14:46.953
<v Speaker 3>At mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans are basically really powerful </v>

4301
03:14:48.951 --> 03:14:52.760
<v Speaker 3>creatures that can live right close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sons that are highly radioactive.</v>

4302
03:14:52.770 --> 03:14:53.603
<v Speaker 3>nothing else can live as close with very</v>
<v Speaker 3>short lives because we're like a hive </v>

4303
03:14:57.801 --> 03:15:01.460
<v Speaker 3>organism that actually lives second to </v>
<v Speaker 3>second in the space time continuum.</v>

4304
03:15:01.461 --> 03:15:02.900
<v Speaker 3>She's like 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a second,</v>

4305
03:15:03.170 --> 03:15:04.003
<v Speaker 3>and we transmit our data up to be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to live next to likely stargate jump </v>

4306
03:15:07.441 --> 03:15:08.900
<v Speaker 3>gates that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are sons.</v>

4307
03:15:09.320 --> 03:15:11.720
<v Speaker 3>So because we live so close to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>sons,</v>

4308
03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:12.913
<v Speaker 3>we only have milliseconds to be alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're actually a hive organism that </v>

4309
03:15:16.561 --> 03:15:20.300
<v Speaker 3>keeps transmitting up to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>species in our,</v>

4310
03:15:20.301 --> 03:15:21.920
<v Speaker 3>in our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a hierarchical system,</v>

4311
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.903
<v Speaker 3>and then down below us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're alive right now in this </v>

4312
03:15:25.551 --> 03:15:28.630
<v Speaker 3>continuum and we're trying to progress </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4313
03:15:28.660 --> 03:15:30.260
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make things better.</v>

4314
03:15:30.740 --> 03:15:34.580
<v Speaker 3>And the elites are trying to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we don't doubt into that incredible</v>

4315
03:15:34.581 --> 03:15:35.414
<v Speaker 3>knowledge we've got as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It basically dies a species so that </v>

4316
03:15:39.310 --> 03:15:40.143
<v Speaker 3>we're not competitors on the next level </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the bible says of their dimensional </v>

4317
03:15:44.121 --> 03:15:47.960
<v Speaker 3>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't believe that.</v>

4318
03:15:47.961 --> 03:15:49.890
<v Speaker 3>You're just saying that's what they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

4319
03:15:49.950 --> 03:15:50.430
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

4320
03:15:50.430 --> 03:15:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not calculating anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you believe?</v>

4321
03:15:52.410 --> 03:15:53.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4322
03:15:53.190 --> 03:15:54.023
<v Speaker 2>I believe in research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that I believe in research </v>

4323
03:15:56.011 --> 03:15:56.844
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that there is something </v>

4324
03:15:57.781 --> 03:15:59.940
<v Speaker 2>from other dimensions that can access </v>
<v Speaker 2>us?</v>

4325
03:16:00.490 --> 03:16:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4326
03:16:01.110 --> 03:16:02.880
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are other dimensions.</v>

4327
03:16:03.390 --> 03:16:07.590
<v Speaker 2>The third dimension is only one limited </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane in a larger spectrum.</v>

4328
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Part of that spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4329
03:16:10.171 --> 03:16:12.060
<v Speaker 2>let's just say we're not in Kansas </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

4330
03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:13.830

4332
03:16:16.200 --> 03:16:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to go to every night I go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sleep.</v>

4333
03:16:18.660 --> 03:16:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I believe that he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's on natural dmt.</v>

4334
03:16:22.020 --> 03:16:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Definitely on something man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

4335
03:16:23.930 --> 03:16:25.100
<v Speaker 2>And I got a question for you.</v>

4336
03:16:28.080 --> 03:16:28.913
<v Speaker 2>You know how this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of off the cuff a little </v>

4337
03:16:30.691 --> 03:16:33.510
<v Speaker 2>bit off track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the beaten path,</v>

4338
03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:34.553
<v Speaker 2>but you know how the cia has always been</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in hollywood and make movies </v>

4339
03:16:37.171 --> 03:16:39.150
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like zero dark 30 and you know,</v>

4340
03:16:39.151 --> 03:16:42.570
<v Speaker 2>all of these movies that are clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda movies,</v>

4341
03:16:42.571 --> 03:16:43.670
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

4342
03:16:43.790 --> 03:16:46.020
<v Speaker 2>MosT like even movies you think they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't propaganda,</v>

4343
03:16:46.021 --> 03:16:48.030
<v Speaker 2>but they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like the superhero movies.</v>

4344
03:16:48.031 --> 03:16:49.920
<v Speaker 2>How they're just all the plots and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

4345
03:16:49.980 --> 03:16:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh they're going to build a bomb and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>

4346
03:16:53.190 --> 03:16:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Is there whistleblowers within hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are making movies?</v>

4347
03:16:58.051 --> 03:17:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Just like in Brazil it was a martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts were outlawed.</v>

4348
03:17:01.710 --> 03:17:04.140
<v Speaker 2>So the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that were about the truth,</v>

4349
03:17:04.290 --> 03:17:07.350
<v Speaker 2>they were like doing dance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were disguising them.</v>

4350
03:17:07.351 --> 03:17:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Our clients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a filmmaker?</v>

4351
03:17:10.020 --> 03:17:10.853

4352
03:17:11.821 --> 03:17:12.654
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to help humanity with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the basis of their films or is it all </v>

4353
03:17:16.020 --> 03:17:17.970
<v Speaker 2>perfectly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like anything else.</v>

4354
03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:21.420
<v Speaker 2>There's good people and bad people and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think hollywood overall is bad.</v>

4355
03:17:21.421 --> 03:17:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which movies are the good ones.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The cia was shut up supposedly to defend</v>

<v Speaker 2>really crazy things for the cia.</v>

4379
03:18:46.220 --> 03:18:47.740
<v Speaker 2>The cia does like the fighting</v>

4380
03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:48.933
<v Speaker 1>and they were all pissed off and they </v>

<v Speaker 1>This all comes through exactly as you're</v>

4397
03:19:36.551 --> 03:19:37.384
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really have no idea if you're </v>

<v Speaker 2>and you know what you could play right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

4400
03:19:40.460 --> 03:19:41.293
<v Speaker 2>How about that bill clinton clip that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you played where he's talking about </v>

4401
03:19:44.601 --> 03:19:49.601
<v Speaker 2>vetting immigrants like more hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 2>than trucks and we're going to all that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you pull that?</v>

4403
03:19:51.681 --> 03:19:53.070

<v Speaker 1>Because people do a ladder over.</v>

4406
03:20:00.180 --> 03:20:02.340
<v Speaker 1>It's metaphysical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're a country.</v>

4407
03:20:02.341 --> 03:20:03.870
<v Speaker 1>We're allowed to have this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why can't we?</v>

4409
03:20:06.300 --> 03:20:09.420
<v Speaker 1>The big thing is just deport people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are on welfare.</v>

4410
03:20:09.570 --> 03:20:10.403
<v Speaker 1>We need people from Mexico and Russia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Japan and just to poor people that </v>

4411
03:20:14.791 --> 03:20:16.020

<v Speaker 1>It's the only deport,</v>

4412
03:20:16.021 --> 03:20:16.854
<v Speaker 1>the poorest ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that can't say if you won't do </v>

4413
03:20:19.981 --> 03:20:22.380
<v Speaker 1>anything and you're calm here.</v>

4416
03:20:25.411 --> 03:20:27.630
<v Speaker 1>but then once if they try to stay on </v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but in every place in this country are </v>
<v Speaker 2>rightly disturbed by the large numbers </v>

4422
03:20:42.320 --> 03:20:43.153
<v Speaker 2>of illegal aliens entering our country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The jobs they home might otherwise be </v>

4423
03:20:47.751 --> 03:20:48.584
<v Speaker 2>held by citizeNs or legal immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public service they use impose </v>

4424
03:20:51.741 --> 03:20:52.574
<v Speaker 2>burdens on our taxpayers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why our administration has moved </v>

4425
03:20:55.731 --> 03:20:56.564
<v Speaker 2>aggressively to secure our borders more </v>
<v Speaker 2>by hiring a record number of new border </v>

4426
03:20:59.961 --> 03:21:03.620
<v Speaker 2>guards by deporting twice as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal aliens is ever before.</v>

4427
03:21:04.040 --> 03:21:08.980
<v Speaker 2>By cracking down on illegal hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by borrowing welfare benefits to illegal</v>

4428
03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:09.873
<v Speaker 2>aliens that I will present to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will try to do more to speed the </v>

4429
03:21:13.911 --> 03:21:14.744
<v Speaker 2>deportation of illegal aliens who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested for crimes to better identify </v>

4430
03:21:18.021 --> 03:21:18.854
<v Speaker 2>illegal aliens in the workplace as </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommended by the commission headed by </v>

4431
03:21:21.951 --> 03:21:26.450
<v Speaker 2>former congresswoman Barbara Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are a nation of immigrants,</v>

4432
03:21:26.990 --> 03:21:29.300
<v Speaker 2>but we are also a nation of laws.</v>

4433
03:21:29.750 --> 03:21:30.583
<v Speaker 2>It is wrong and ultimately self </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating for a nation of immigrants to </v>

4434
03:21:34.221 --> 03:21:35.054
<v Speaker 2>permit the kind of abuse of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration laws we have seen in recent </v>

4435
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:39.463
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we must do more to stop it if that </v>

4436
03:21:42.561 --> 03:21:46.080
<v Speaker 2>doesn't vindicate fucking trump on all </v>
<v Speaker 2>fence shit,</v>

4437
03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:49.470
<v Speaker 2>but it also makes you realize what a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker bill clinton was.</v>

4438
03:21:49.471 --> 03:21:53.420
<v Speaker 2>His trump can make a speech that bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinton was a good guy.</v>

4439
03:21:53.840 --> 03:21:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit each other walk.</v>

4440
03:22:01.740 --> 03:22:02.573
<v Speaker 2>If you're a chick out there marching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the wall and you just </v>

4441
03:22:05.811 --> 03:22:08.120
<v Speaker 2>heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was not a real realize.</v>

4442
03:22:08.300 --> 03:22:11.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving you a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Admit you were pumped.</v>

4443
03:22:11.690 --> 03:22:14.180
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody gets powerful power punch.</v>

4444
03:22:14.181 --> 03:22:17.600
<v Speaker 2>But from this point on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up about it will power.</v>

4445
03:22:17.601 --> 03:22:18.230
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4446
03:22:18.230 --> 03:22:18.771
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

4447
03:22:18.771 --> 03:22:19.604
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about it.</v>

4448
03:22:20.330 --> 03:22:23.030
<v Speaker 2>A time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take one dose.</v>

4449
03:22:24.230 --> 03:22:27.820
<v Speaker 2>If I give you full power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be in the hit.</v>

4450
03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:31.370
<v Speaker 2>It's five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to wrap this up.</v>

4451
03:22:31.371 --> 03:22:32.600
<v Speaker 2>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a good job.</v>

4452
03:22:33.190 --> 03:22:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Ask one more question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're not in some blood fests with </v>
<v Speaker 2>reagan,</v>

4483
03:23:47.691 --> 03:23:50.560
<v Speaker 2>but after all the obama globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm astounded.</v>

4484
03:23:50.600 --> 03:23:51.433
<v Speaker 2>Good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reagan ran against george herbert </v>

4485
03:23:53.601 --> 03:23:55.630
<v Speaker 2>walker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush said he was global,</v>

4486
03:23:55.631 --> 03:23:59.150
<v Speaker 2>a cfr world government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they told him at the convention,</v>

4487
03:23:59.151 --> 03:24:00.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won,</v>

4488
03:24:00.350 --> 03:24:02.480
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to not let you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>domination if you don't want to.</v>

4489
03:24:02.481 --> 03:24:05.270
<v Speaker 2>Put a herbert walker bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a year end they shooting.</v>

4490
03:24:05.710 --> 03:24:08.630
<v Speaker 2>They just released that guy and so all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff went.</v>

4491
03:24:08.631 --> 03:24:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

4492
03:24:09.831 --> 03:24:10.664
<v Speaker 2>So reagan didn't get his agenda through </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they tagged on Iran contra all this </v>

4493
03:24:13.941 --> 03:24:16.220
<v Speaker 2>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reagan actually wanted to get rid of the</v>

4494
03:24:16.221 --> 03:24:18.670
<v Speaker 2>irs and a bunch of good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

4495
03:24:18.671 --> 03:24:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I noticed the anticommunist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was running against George Bush.</v>

4496
03:24:22.191 --> 03:24:23.024
<v Speaker 2>He beat him and then when he got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential nomination for the </v>

4497
03:24:25.791 --> 03:24:28.310
<v Speaker 2>republican party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made him.</v>

4498
03:24:28.340 --> 03:24:31.980
<v Speaker 2>They forced him to take the drug store </v>
<v Speaker 2>witH forced way.</v>

4499
03:24:32.050 --> 03:24:35.000
<v Speaker 2>None of the ronald reagan and I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to believe in obama,</v>

4500
03:24:35.001 --> 03:24:39.110
<v Speaker 2>but he's a total level of a new tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things crazy.</v>

4501
03:24:40.030 --> 03:24:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Once you think of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty radical.</v>

4502
03:24:42.140 --> 03:24:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Joe Got mad at us trading punches.</v>

<v Speaker 7>There's people out there that think </v>

4505
03:24:50.911 --> 03:24:51.744
<v Speaker 7>trump is racist and they think he's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>sexist at a whoremonger closer </v>

4506

<v Speaker 7>A lot of people do.</v>

4508
03:25:05.380 --> 03:25:07.200
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you think he's a good guy?</v>

4509
03:25:07.860 --> 03:25:09.680
<v Speaker 7>I know trump's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He at.</v>

4510
03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:12.750
<v Speaker 7>What he's done is he's delivered like no</v>
<v Speaker 7>president ever.</v>

4511
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:13.663
<v Speaker 7>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody.</v>

4512
03:25:13.770 --> 03:25:14.603
<v Speaker 7>So everybody wants to find some reason </v>
<v Speaker 7>to hate him and some reason to figure </v>

4513
03:25:18.781 --> 03:25:21.540
<v Speaker 7>out a way to get him out of office,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we shouldn't.</v>

4514
03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:23.470
<v Speaker 7>We at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean he,</v>

4515
03:25:23.540 --> 03:25:24.840
<v Speaker 7>he won their game,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4516
03:25:24.841 --> 03:25:28.200
<v Speaker 7>There's a popularity contest.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He won the popularity contest and that's</v>

4517
03:25:28.201 --> 03:25:29.034
<v Speaker 7>really what being president is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Figuring out a way to get the most </v>

4518
03:25:31.171 --> 03:25:32.850
<v Speaker 7>amount of people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like you better.</v>

4519
03:25:32.990 --> 03:25:33.823
<v Speaker 7>I mean That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he's the first truly popular person </v>

4520
03:25:36.690 --> 03:25:40.290
<v Speaker 7>who's really good at manipulating the </v>
<v Speaker 7>media to win a popularity contest.</v>

4521
03:25:40.620 --> 03:25:43.140
<v Speaker 7>Everybody before him had just been a </v>
<v Speaker 7>politician.</v>

4522
03:25:43.141 --> 03:25:43.974
<v Speaker 7>He's the first guy that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 7>famous that then became presidents two </v>

4523
03:25:47.191 --> 03:25:47.850
<v Speaker 7>point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

4524
03:25:47.850 --> 03:25:50.780
<v Speaker 7>it's never happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Been a half hours.</v>

4525
03:25:50.820 --> 03:25:55.230
<v Speaker 7>So reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was the California.</v>

4526
03:25:55.231 --> 03:25:56.064
<v Speaker 7>It's 5:00.</v>

4527
03:25:58.180 --> 03:25:59.640
<v Speaker 7>That's the only two and a half hours.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4528
03:25:59.641 --> 03:26:03.170
<v Speaker 7>but the point being that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He wasn't that famous,</v>

4529
03:26:04.010 --> 03:26:04.843
<v Speaker 7>famous like Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think he was famous movie star </v>

4530
03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:09.240
<v Speaker 7>reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are you cutting?</v>

4531
03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:10.133
<v Speaker 7>True,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't think he was a big movie </v>

4532
03:26:11.191 --> 03:26:12.690
<v Speaker 7>star.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think he was Christian Slater.</v>

4533
03:26:12.691 --> 03:26:14.690
<v Speaker 7>She probably doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Trump wasn't a movie star.</v>

4534
03:26:14.691 --> 03:26:16.020

4559
03:27:21.031 --> 03:27:23.940
<v Speaker 7>lifetime situation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Trump isn't perfect.</v>

4560
03:27:23.941 --> 03:27:27.540
<v Speaker 7>He really wants to empower humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All of us have to work hard,</v>

4561
03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:29.610
<v Speaker 7>be involved here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Our views,</v>

4562
03:27:29.910 --> 03:27:30.743
<v Speaker 7>put out our ideas and just move forward </v>
<v Speaker 7>with the airplane to try to assassinate </v>

4563
03:27:33.751 --> 03:27:34.950
<v Speaker 7>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You think so?</v>

4564
03:27:35.010 --> 03:27:35.843
<v Speaker 7>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're demonizing him saying killing </v>

4565
03:27:37.001 --> 03:27:38.250
<v Speaker 7>them all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fascinating.</v>

4566
03:27:38.251 --> 03:27:39.084
<v Speaker 7>For real,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or do you mean assassInated him </v>

4567
03:27:40.430 --> 03:27:42.340
<v Speaker 7>publicly?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like politically</v>

4568
03:27:42.340 --> 03:27:43.173
<v Speaker 1>assassinated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to politically destroy his </v>

4569
03:27:44.441 --> 03:27:48.730
<v Speaker 1>name and they want to politically also </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to kill him.</v>

4570
03:27:49.030 --> 03:27:49.863
<v Speaker 1>All I know is America had half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth of the world 20 years ago and </v>

4571
03:27:55.541 --> 03:27:56.374
<v Speaker 1>five percent of the world population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've lost half that wealth and it's </v>

4572
03:28:00.731 --> 03:28:04.840
<v Speaker 1>that as we get more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get more powerful and the elite had</v>

4573
03:28:04.841 --> 03:28:07.240
<v Speaker 1>been trying to domesticate America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that we're perfect,</v>

4574
03:28:07.450 --> 03:28:08.283
<v Speaker 1>but we've got ideas of industry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and doing things that change </v>

4575
03:28:12.221 --> 03:28:13.054
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so The really this planet want to </v>

4576
03:28:14.681 --> 03:28:17.320
<v Speaker 1>kill competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to consolidate control.</v>

4577
03:28:17.321 --> 03:28:19.540
<v Speaker 1>They want to end the internet of </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>

4578
03:28:19.541 --> 03:28:21.060
<v Speaker 1>That's America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were about,</v>

4579
03:28:21.100 --> 03:28:23.100
<v Speaker 1>if hillary would have won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have censored the.</v>

4580
03:28:23.250 --> 03:28:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are they going to look it up?</v>

4581
03:28:26.070 --> 03:28:26.903
<v Speaker 1>Look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually surprised how fast that's </v>

4582
03:28:29.780 --> 03:28:31.510
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting the pieces together.</v>

4583
03:28:31.511 --> 03:28:32.560
<v Speaker 1>There were about to do it.</v>

4584
03:28:32.820 --> 03:28:33.653
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell them the headline is obama </v>

4585
03:28:35.351 --> 03:28:40.351

<v Speaker 1>weeks before trump takes office one week</v>

4586
03:28:40.431 --> 03:28:41.264
<v Speaker 1>after a trump's elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ministry of truth being something </v>

4587
03:28:44.441 --> 03:28:45.274
<v Speaker 1>that stops fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news the government doesn't agree </v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4589
03:28:49.360 --> 03:28:53.550

<v Speaker 1>how do we decide what's fake science?</v>

<v Speaker 7>Joe wrote about jamie pulled something </v>

4707
03:33:59.581 --> 03:34:00.414
<v Speaker 7>out was he signed this countering </v>
<v Speaker 7>foreign propaganda and disinformation </v>

4708
03:34:04.891 --> 03:34:05.724
<v Speaker 7>act of 2016 to build.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Expresses the sense of this bill </v>

4709
03:34:08.911 --> 03:34:11.970
<v Speaker 7>expresses the sense of congress that </v>
<v Speaker 7>what a weird expression.</v>

4710
03:34:12.000 --> 03:34:12.960
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what are we looking at?</v>

4711
03:34:13.130 --> 03:34:15.420
<v Speaker 7>This is that bill,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that anti propaganda bill,</v>

4712
03:34:15.570 --> 03:34:16.403
<v Speaker 7>foreign governments,</v>
<v Speaker 7>including the government of the russian </v>

4713
03:34:18.061 --> 03:34:20.310
<v Speaker 7>federation in China,</v>
<v Speaker 7>used Him for this information,</v>

4714
03:34:20.340 --> 03:34:21.173
<v Speaker 7>other propaganda tools to undermine the </v>
<v Speaker 7>national security objectives of the </v>

4715
03:34:23.191 --> 03:34:25.680
<v Speaker 7>United States and key allies and </v>
<v Speaker 7>partners.</v>

4716
03:34:25.681 --> 03:34:26.514
<v Speaker 7>The us government should develop a </v>
<v Speaker 7>comprehensive strategy to counter </v>

4717
03:34:29.911 --> 03:34:30.744
<v Speaker 7>foreign disinformation and propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 7>and assert leadership and developing a </v>

4718
03:34:33.691 --> 03:34:34.524
<v Speaker 7>fact base strategic narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and an important element of this </v>

4719
03:34:37.651 --> 03:34:41.910
<v Speaker 7>strategy should be to help promote an </v>
<v Speaker 7>independent press and countries that are</v>

4720
03:34:41.911 --> 03:34:43.830
<v Speaker 7>vulnerable to foreign disinformation.</v>

4721
03:34:44.070 --> 03:34:47.670
<v Speaker 7>Translate that msm is on the ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are panicking.</v>

4722
03:34:48.120 --> 03:34:49.680
<v Speaker 7>They'll want to shut down their </v>
<v Speaker 7>competition.</v>

4723
03:34:49.890 --> 03:34:50.723
<v Speaker 7>What american watching this or listening</v>
<v Speaker 7>doesn't think they should decide what </v>

4724
03:34:53.891 --> 03:34:54.724
<v Speaker 7>they should listen to it not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you think that would be ever </v>

4725
03:34:56.221 --> 03:34:58.110
<v Speaker 7>accepted?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That they would allow people,</v>

4726
03:34:58.740 --> 03:35:02.360
<v Speaker 7>someone that works in the government to </v>
<v Speaker 7>censor websites and podcasts.</v>

4727
03:35:02.410 --> 03:35:04.530
<v Speaker 7>Vamos signed already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4728
03:35:04.531 --> 03:35:05.460
<v Speaker 7>but this one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>China,</v>

4729
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:10.680
<v Speaker 7>they signed a bill to dry it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

4730
03:35:10.681 --> 03:35:13.140
<v Speaker 7>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Notice how I tell you damn bill,</v>

4731
03:35:13.200 --> 03:35:14.033
<v Speaker 7>one of the things about podcasts is that</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're basically just a pure </v>

4732
03:35:15.961 --> 03:35:16.794
<v Speaker 7>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just peopLe sitting down and </v>

4733
03:35:17.671 --> 03:35:22.050
<v Speaker 7>talking and if you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you stop pure conversations,</v>

4734
03:35:22.200 --> 03:35:24.470
<v Speaker 7>I mean that is like one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 7>heinous formed.</v>

4735
03:35:24.490 --> 03:35:25.710
<v Speaker 7>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's too late.</v>

4736
03:35:25.711 --> 03:35:27.810
<v Speaker 7>You can't say you can't make a try.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can try,</v>

4737
03:35:28.200 --> 03:35:29.033
<v Speaker 7>but if they really did get into office </v>
<v Speaker 7>and dave really did try to implement </v>

4738
03:35:32.580 --> 03:35:33.413
<v Speaker 7>some sort of a transition process,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I almost wish hillary would have won </v>

4739
03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:40.230
<v Speaker 7>because that could have been outside the</v>
<v Speaker 7>power.</v>

4740
03:35:40.570 --> 03:35:42.340
<v Speaker 7>I keep trump on the list,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not attacked.</v>

4741
03:35:42.350 --> 03:35:44.040
<v Speaker 7>Trump does something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to find,</v>

4742
03:35:44.041 --> 03:35:47.880
<v Speaker 7>but he makes some mistakes like torture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>iphone codes or whatever,</v>

4743
03:35:47.881 --> 03:35:50.490
<v Speaker 7>but so torture you think is just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't work.</v>

4744
03:35:50.680 --> 03:35:52.950
<v Speaker 7>It's not just at work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It makes us look terrible.</v>

4745
03:35:52.951 --> 03:35:55.020
<v Speaker 7>It's a foreign country lowers us to </v>
<v Speaker 7>their level.</v>

4746
03:35:55.140 --> 03:35:56.010
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

4747
03:35:56.160 --> 03:35:58.260
<v Speaker 7>But trump came out and tortured two days</v>
<v Speaker 7>ago and said,</v>

4748
03:35:58.261 --> 03:35:59.520
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so he changed his mind.</v>

4749
03:35:59.700 --> 03:36:02.170
<v Speaker 7>He's good on stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's very unusual.</v>

4750
03:36:02.180 --> 03:36:04.290
<v Speaker 7>Waking up and when you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you change your mind.</v>

4751
03:36:04.291 --> 03:36:09.240
<v Speaker 7>I was also independently wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's one of the things that's probably</v>

4752
03:36:09.241 --> 03:36:13.230
<v Speaker 7>a huge factor in this scabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's not part of the obama.</v>

4753
03:36:13.250 --> 03:36:14.083
<v Speaker 7>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I'm saying is that there's </v>

4754
03:36:17.190 --> 03:36:18.023
<v Speaker 7>no calculation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just treat you like I want to be </v>

4755
03:36:19.621 --> 03:36:21.560
<v Speaker 7>treated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Big stuff is happening.</v>

4756
03:36:21.570 --> 03:36:23.160
<v Speaker 7>It's a very exciting time to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

4757
03:36:23.161 --> 03:36:24.840
<v Speaker 7>Before we.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Before we wrap this up,</v>

4758
03:36:25.320 --> 03:36:26.153
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if trump is this new stage of politics </v>

4759
03:36:28.561 --> 03:36:29.394
<v Speaker 7>or new type of politician,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what kind of person do you think would </v>

4760
03:36:31.291 --> 03:36:32.124
<v Speaker 7>be like literally the perfect person to </v>
<v Speaker 7>run this country and would the perfect </v>

4761
03:36:35.711 --> 03:36:36.110
<v Speaker 7>person</v>

4762
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:38.440
<v Speaker 4>do ron paul?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ron paul is great,</v>

<v Speaker 4>a sense of success,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who loves America,</v>
