00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 2>It is interesting how the fat patterns</v>
<v Speaker 2>does shrink up.</v>

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 2>There's three major fat distributions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 2>You got your depo fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the love handles are with</v>

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's the saddlebags and the</v>

6
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 2>side of the thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you'll see a women and the</v>

7
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 2>upper back or the tricep area with guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's usually it.</v>

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 2>But la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 2>or the belly or the love handles for</v>
<v Speaker 2>most guys,</v>

10
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have internal fat.</v>

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the dangerous stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They a intra abdominal fat that got fat.</v>

12
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what can kill you.</v>

13
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have subcutaneous fat.</v>

14
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like the smooth fat underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin,</v>

15
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an insulation layer.</v>

16
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 2>And then of course they've identified</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Brown fat also,</v>

17
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like a act of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It produces heat in the body.</v>

18
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like part of the survival</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism.</v>

19
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Back when our ancestors had to tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of extremes in temperatures like</v>

20
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have this brown fat,</v>

21
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like an metabolically active fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

22
00:00:58.381 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kids have it,</v>

23
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 2>but by the time you're like 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost disappears because you know,</v>

24
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 2>we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulated temperatures all the time.</v>

26
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 2>People don't expose themselves to cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always bundling up and the homes</v>

27
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 2>are overheated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

28
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people were saying,</v>

29
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 2>now you can actually get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolically active fat.</v>

30
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 2>The brown fat sal's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which helps keep you mean,</v>

31
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and helps burn the other yellow fat.</v>

32
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 2>So cold showers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold water treatments,</v>

33
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposing yourself to cold,</v>

34
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 2>a real good thing for develop that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 2>the brown fat and build your immune</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and you,</v>

36
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 2>you have a much better tolerance to cold</v>
<v Speaker 2>and much less likely to get a innovated</v>

37
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 2>in cold weather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have a tendency to come</v>

38
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 2>down with colds or flu and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really brown fat,</v>

39
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Brown fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard of that before.</v>

40
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 2>What is it created by?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what it's in your,</v>

41
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:53.671
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

42
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 2>some of it's in the peritoneal cavity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's a up in the neck,</v>

43
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.183
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

44
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

45
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 2>it's just something that nature provided</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help temperature regulation,</v>

46
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 2>helping tolerate cold.</v>

47
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>So is that like more common with inuits</v>
<v Speaker 1>and folks who live in?</v>

48
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

49
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 2>They have well developed brown fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you and I could do it too if we just</v>

50
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 2>expose yourself a little bit more to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold.</v>

51
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>He's a narcissism thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the idea that I should be in charge</v>

52
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>is all presidents are probably crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody should be</v>

53
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think that it should be</v>

54
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the computer,</v>

55
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when we,</v>

56
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably get there in the next 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

57
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>We have a computer we program in all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our laws,</v>

58
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were like,</v>

59
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

60
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the right choice.</v>

61
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's programmed by people and people</v>

62
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>can influence the programming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was one of the big deals</v>

63
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>with electronic voting machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have that computer be built by a</v>

65
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

66
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>well then we're fucked because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer's just going to take over.</v>

67
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like what Elon Musk is worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about George P.</v>

68

<v Speaker 3>thing was numbers,</v>

98
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 3>numbers in Harlem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got to walk around there as a</v>

99
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:20.390
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then as I got older,</v>

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 3>my first arrest wasn't home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got caught smoking weed on 160 first</v>

101
00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 3>street in 1983 the first day after the</v>
<v Speaker 3>superbowl,</v>

00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:39.080
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck they were when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>beat the redskins and I wanted to a</v>

106
00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:41.540
<v Speaker 3>health food store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In those days we'd stores were health</v>

107
00:04:41.541 --> 00:04:45.080
<v Speaker 3>food stores in Harlem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does the health food store can</v>

108
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.100
<v Speaker 3>complain of you who's no protein drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In those days it was crude protein</v>

109
00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:53.000
<v Speaker 3>powder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

110
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.420
<v Speaker 3>vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you knew the right people,</v>

111
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.790
<v Speaker 3>you want to know you're not in the</v>

<v Speaker 3>the corner,</v>

119
00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:12.710
<v Speaker 3>and then you could go outside and smoke</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

120
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 3>I rolled it in the corner and when I lit</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the corner,</v>

121
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.040
<v Speaker 3>because it was windy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was January when I went to put the</v>

122
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.830
<v Speaker 3>light into the joint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking mailman put a gun to my head</v>

123
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:22.880
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get on the floor.</v>

124
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.280
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you got more than 20 singles on you,</v>

125
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:28.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to beat the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got on the floor,</v>

126
00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:33.110
<v Speaker 3>I had 800 I had one 800 probably at</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven 40 and he goes,</v>

127
00:05:33.111 --> 00:05:36.230
<v Speaker 3>what'd you get this money from me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also in cops started pulling up and</v>

128
00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 3>they were looking for people who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling loose joints.</v>

129
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.230
<v Speaker 3>The kids two blocks away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they realized I lived in Jersey</v>

130
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 3>and I had no idea in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't walk with an ID dog.</v>

131
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.080
<v Speaker 3>My word was my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No idea.</v>

132
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 3>In those days I throw away the ID,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking no idea.</v>

133
00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:51.770
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a cop,</v>

134
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 3>figure it out the fuck you're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kadri figure it out.</v>

135
00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 3>And the cop told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me the truth,</v>

136
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 3>your name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told him the truth and they put my</v>

137
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 3>finger on one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the early technology,</v>

138
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 3>New York hat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lake three vans that have that shit on</v>

139
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fingerprint thing,</v>

140
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 3>scanner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it came back,</v>

141
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Jose Diaz and blast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they let me go.</v>

142
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cop took wheat out of my bag,</v>

143
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 3>put it on the floor and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's nine grams.</v>

144
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 3>I you could keep it and I'll give you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>ticket.</v>

145
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 3>And that was my first legitimate arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got arrested for that and Manhattan.</v>

146
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I did six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first sentence and I moved to</v>

147
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and I had to write the guy a</v>
<v Speaker 3>letter on the first and call them on the</v>

148
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 3>fifth and they let me go.</v>

149
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.150
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that white kid with</v>

150
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:36.190
<v Speaker 4>tattoos on his face?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He calls himself stitches.</v>

151
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.630
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

152
00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:39.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to find you your new favorite</v>
<v Speaker 4>song.</v>

153
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.170
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sounds good,</v>

154
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.340
<v Speaker 4>Jay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is breaking your face brick.</v>

155
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.010
<v Speaker 4>It's got 5 million hits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>America is in trouble.</v>

156
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Now what you're going to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you get.</v>

157
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:55.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying it's going to be all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be in your head now.</v>

158
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.550
<v Speaker 4>What's going to do with it now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

159
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.700
<v Speaker 4>You're going to give me my new tagline</v>
<v Speaker 4>after I submit people?</v>

160
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what you're going to do with it.</v>

161
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.350
<v Speaker 4>That's rude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carrie,</v>

162
00:07:04.351 --> 00:07:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Tony and Terry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You first you win and then just stick it</v>

163
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.030
<v Speaker 4>into the white guy was a hell raiser</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

164
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.770
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was him.</v>

165
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 4>I think that was him with a mascot that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was supposed to be him saying,</v>

166
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.190
<v Speaker 4>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my interpretation of the aura,</v>

167
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.570
<v Speaker 4>I think he should have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he should have stayed a hundred percent</v>

168
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:22.300
<v Speaker 4>black shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hell raiser kind of brought it back to</v>

169
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:24.940
<v Speaker 4>white people because black people don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hell raiser and we should've been</v>

170
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:26.190
<v Speaker 4>spawn or starting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

171
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.190
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good point because hell</v>
<v Speaker 4>raiser was a white guy in the movie,</v>

172
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.020
<v Speaker 4>and black people hate scary movies.</v>

173
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.160
<v Speaker 4>Generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure love scary movies generally.</v>

174
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As all stereotypical,</v>

175
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.030
<v Speaker 4>stereotypical generalizations of how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>raise a people,</v>

176
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be able to generalize because</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can't generalize and you can't</v>

177
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:58.060
<v Speaker 4>make any fucking points,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so true.</v>

178
00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.620
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't make any punch.</v>

179
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:01.440
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know one guy that doesn't do that.</v>

180
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.500
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

181
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but generally,</v>

182
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.890
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things before you say</v>

183
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:09.820
<v Speaker 4>what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

184
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.560
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know this might sound a little bit</v>

185
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 4>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
