<v Speaker 1>when I heard that story about how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italians,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Muslims war crime.</v>

49
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Now 100 years ago,</v>

56
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>railroads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the railroads,</v>

57
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>they essentially can play the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger.</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

69
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>because after they built the railroads,</v>

70
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Alicia,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I never really thought about that,</v>

73
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 2>but there was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there.</v>

74
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 2>A place we went to was a vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we went to.</v>

75
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:12.901
<v Speaker 2>We went to some museum that showed like </v>
<v Speaker 2>how all the Chinese immigrants wound up </v>

76
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:17.491
<v Speaker 2>in Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was a railroad or I </v>

77
00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:20.251
<v Speaker 2>forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting when you have like </v>

78
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 2>these pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's pockets of like certain parts of</v>

79
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Chinatown where those people just never </v>
<v Speaker 2>assimilated.</v>

80
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

81
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 2>We just stay right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's in Chinese.</v>

82
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 2>The signs are all in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese were good.</v>

83
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 2>They don't learn English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just stopped.</v>

84
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.840
<v Speaker 2>They decided we'll just make this China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China West right here just for a couple </v>

85
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:42.151
<v Speaker 2>of blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't there like some mayor or </v>

86
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:42.151
<v Speaker 2>something or there was some kind of guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that,</v>

87
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:47.001
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was from China that came over </v>

88
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:47.001
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

89
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 2>They invited everybody over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody were into Vancouver.</v>

90
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

91
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

92
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.710
<v Speaker 2>there was some story about that is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wish I paid attention to the </v>

93
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 2>capitalistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The oldest chinatown was in Cuba up to </v>

94
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to like 61 or [inaudible] 58.</v>

95
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.240
<v Speaker 2>One of the biggest China towns outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the China was Nevada Cube and the </v>

96
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 2>fact that Fidel took over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never fucked with them.</v>

97
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 2>He left those Chinese people alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's still a lot of Chinese people</v>

98
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 2>in Cuba and they speak Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They speak Cuban.</v>

99
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 2>If you go to 79th street and Broadway by</v>
<v Speaker 2>our friends,</v>

100
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 2>we're friends office used to be right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

101
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.740

<v Speaker 2>Cuban Chinese played.</v>

102
00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>pork chop and black beans.</v>

104
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese people speaking Spanish.</v>

105
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was looking for that and they talked </v>

106
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Chinese stopped.</v>

107
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Just to hear what that sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that sound?</v>

108
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.020

<v Speaker 2>Like really fast.</v>

109
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.250

<v Speaker 2>Hold it mellowed out a little for </v>

110
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 2>genome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you would say,</v>

111
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.651
<v Speaker 2>that's how I'd say they'd say that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk really fast track to see a </v>

112

<v Speaker 2>So if you ever have a die even sent,</v>

114
00:04:57.741 --> 00:05:02.741
<v Speaker 2>the opioid opiate ended up going and so </v>

<v Speaker 2>to go into shock and when I was younger </v>

<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

118
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm following Cina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Chinese bell.</v>

119
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.150
<v Speaker 2>That was a couple more like in where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>came from.</v>

120
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Western New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that jersey,</v>

121
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a thing.</v>

122
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see a Chinese guy with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>English accent,</v>

123
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 2>you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

124
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here?</v>

125
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 2>You know like it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't assimilate with that.</v>

126
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 2>That might be the biggest one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest one.</v>

127
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Chinese person with a Cuban accent </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking Spanish and shit.</v>

128
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>

129
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.400
<v Speaker 2>They just always like multitech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

130
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.670
<v Speaker 2>take that as a way of talking to you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rhythm of the Chinese tone,</v>

131
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.260
<v Speaker 2>but they put it into the Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is it that there's so many </v>

132
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 2>different sounds that people make to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

133
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 2>to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you hear those African people to </v>

134
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.480
<v Speaker 2>talking like clicks and they start like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

135
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Like they</v>

136
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 3>just developed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their style.</v>

137
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 3>They figured out their style of making </v>
<v Speaker 3>noise and the each noise means a certain</v>

138
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:08.291
<v Speaker 3>thing and Cubans figured out this kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of flight flowing almost dancing style </v>

139
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.680
<v Speaker 3>and Germans have this fucking hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which cuts,</v>

140
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's Fuck you touch,</v>

141
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the Chinese people that figured</v>

142
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 3>out their own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all totally different.</v>

143
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:21.690
<v Speaker 3>All of them different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Japanese have grunts.</v>

144
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

145
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 3>They have their own thing.</v>

146
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I liked when I hear Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what blows my mind when I watch </v>

147
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.830
<v Speaker 2>a fight and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to the interpreter,</v>

148
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.060
<v Speaker 2>when I watch Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand a few words just from being</v>

149
00:06:39.061 --> 00:06:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand all of them.</v>

150
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna lie to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it was weird.</v>

151
00:06:43.591 --> 00:06:48.591
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have all these countries </v>

152
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:48.870
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like when Sicilians 12 around me,</v>

153
00:06:48.871 --> 00:06:53.871
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't pull the wool over that </v>

154
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 2>island is half fucking Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know when a Sicilian </v>

155
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 2>stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I picked more words up.</v>

156
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.510
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So important.</v>

157
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.580
<v Speaker 2>You say a five word sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pick up one word and then I'll take it</v>

158
00:07:02.581 --> 00:07:03.990
<v Speaker 2>from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My imagination.</v>

159
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.130
<v Speaker 2>But when Sicilians to or I could take </v>
<v Speaker 2>four to five words,</v>

160
00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:10.200
<v Speaker 2>like I understand that it's closer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish.</v>

161
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.100
<v Speaker 2>So somewhere along the line I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out we were connected some way.</v>

162
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.090
<v Speaker 2>There's some French words that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that Spanish.</v>

163
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.090
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's just,</v>

164
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I could explain it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

165
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Well there's like the romance languages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

166
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Like Latin Spanish is a franchise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

167
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.380
<v Speaker 3>There's are like what they call the </v>
<v Speaker 3>romance languages,</v>

168
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:37.381
<v Speaker 3>like old school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>European languages that have that sort </v>

169
00:07:37.381 --> 00:07:41.431
<v Speaker 3>of flair to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a beauty to a lot of those </v>

170
00:07:41.431 --> 00:07:41.560
<v Speaker 3>older languages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

171
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.600
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting just how different </v>

172
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.600
<v Speaker 3>parts of the country developed different</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds for talking,</v>

173
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you listen to people from the South</v>

174
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Pacific or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or another.</v>

175
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Another weird one is Filipinos when here</v>
<v Speaker 3>Filipino.</v>

176
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.030
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

177
00:07:55.031 --> 00:08:00.031
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of a combination of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's just like a combination of </v>

178
00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:01.990
<v Speaker 3>sort of like an Asian but a Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a flow to it.</v>

179
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:03.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

180
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of Filipinos have traditionally </v>

181
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Spanish last names as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was conquered by the Spanish.</v>

182
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:15.661
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like Spanish and Chinese right </v>

183
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.881
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a combination of Spanish and </v>

184
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:17.881
<v Speaker 3>Chinese and they were all Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

185
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:20.010
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

186
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Like manny Pacquiao,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super fucking religious time Catholic.</v>

187
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.290
<v Speaker 4>I read something recently about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>emojis are the,</v>

188
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 4>it's the most advanced language that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been created recently just because you </v>

189
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.810
<v Speaker 4>can pretty much cross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

190
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:38.770
<v Speaker 4>I could talk to a Japanese person by </v>
<v Speaker 4>Emoji to some point and you know,</v>

191
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.960
<v Speaker 4>and if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how cave men started.</v>

192
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:43.960
<v Speaker 4>So they might've been way more advanced </v>
<v Speaker 4>in their language and we would have been</v>

193
00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:45.340
<v Speaker 4>just shitting on them the whole time.</v>

194
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Well cavemen didn't really do it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures mean they made pictures on the </v>

195
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.541
<v Speaker 3>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't think that they were </v>

196
00:08:56.541 --> 00:08:57.771
<v Speaker 3>communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they do that a hieroglyphics were </v>

197
00:08:57.771 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 3>like a super advanced way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating.</v>

198
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 3>We just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't quite get it.</v>

199
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no poop</v>

200
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.720
<v Speaker 4>Emoji type thing for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's more advanced like triangles </v>

201
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.360
<v Speaker 4>and eyeballs and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

202
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Is that what the languages it looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like?</v>

203
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all different symbols,</v>

204
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different than.</v>

205
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't totally understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of uh,</v>

206
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian language was lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of,</v>

207
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the writing was lost in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something called the fire of Alexandria,</v>

208
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.010
<v Speaker 3>like when they burned Alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess they birth like a lot of,</v>

209
00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 3>like really cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They destroyed all the records.</v>

210
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Like it might've been like explanations </v>
<v Speaker 3>really built all that shit.</v>

211
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 3>All of it got destroyed because it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>all on like I guess a paper or piracy,</v>

212
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 3>which I don't think is really a paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like an animal skin thing,</v>

213
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.080
<v Speaker 3>like paper made with animal skins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

214
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:47.220
<v Speaker 3>those fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

215
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:52.221
<v Speaker 3>they drew on their walls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had like their history of their </v>

216
00:09:52.221 --> 00:09:56.211
<v Speaker 3>creation and all this different shit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all just written all these </v>

217
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:56.211
<v Speaker 3>different images.</v>

218
00:09:56.211 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just wrote in images like we think </v>

219
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 3>that you have to write in letters </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's how we write.</v>

220
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:04.380
<v Speaker 3>We write in letters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we'd never wrote in letters,</v>

221
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:09.381
<v Speaker 3>we only wrote an images.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we would just develop a really </v>

222
00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:10.650
<v Speaker 3>advanced system for communicating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>images.</v>

223
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Like when you look at someone's writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't understand it,</v>

224
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:15.960
<v Speaker 3>if you look at Portuguese or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

225
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.640
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can kind of just look at all the </v>

226
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.850
<v Speaker 3>little letters and everything are all </v>
<v Speaker 3>squished in together to try to make it </v>

227
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.850
<v Speaker 3>strange sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

228
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't click and register.</v>

229
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.880
<v Speaker 3>But then when you read something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you absolutely know what it is,</v>

230
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 3>like the thought and the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately enters into your head,</v>

231
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 3>well you would weight be way more </v>
<v Speaker 3>universal if it was like images.</v>

232
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 3>So it does make sense.</v>

233

234
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like look at the old Egyptian,</v>

235
00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:44.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>King type with the hand going up and one</v>

236
00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:49.541
<v Speaker 4>going down and then you look at like our</v>
<v Speaker 4>emoji system where we have like that </v>

237
00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:53.051
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that means.</v>

239
00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:53.150
<v Speaker 4>When a girl sends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's kind of like the same exact shit.</v>

242
00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck did that </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean?</v>

243
00:10:59.961 --> 00:11:02.350
<v Speaker 4>Why did the Egyptians hold their hand?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

244
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.360
<v Speaker 4>Just the walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Egyptian music video that I'm </v>

245
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.360
<v Speaker 4>thinking of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they never did.</v>

246
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.360
<v Speaker 4>They didn't.</v>

247
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 3>What they did was pig Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Break that down for me.</v>

248
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:16.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like you saying nay at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and you take the first letter</v>

249
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:20.280

<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't say Diaz.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You would say uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he as day,</v>

251
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.320

255
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that,</v>

256
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how to say this.</v>

257
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.660
<v Speaker 2>The Spanish one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're Cuban and they have a peg </v>

258
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:38.660
<v Speaker 2>leg and my mom used to talk to them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish.</v>

259
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.650
<v Speaker 2>This form of communication was other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the room.</v>

260
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.350
<v Speaker 2>She didn't want people to know what she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying to me.</v>

261
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like she thought she thought she </v>

262
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 2>thought same fucking thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

263
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:53.570
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what fuck fucking was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuban is a very interesting Spanish </v>

264
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 2>cause it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like drums are playing,</v>

265
00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

266
00:11:59.751 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 2>when to queue and people start going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth and back and forth.</v>

267
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's got a rhythmic quality to</v>

268
00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:09.800
<v Speaker 2>it out loud to a Cuban food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets,</v>

269
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:15.090
<v Speaker 2>the conversation gets louder and louder </v>
<v Speaker 2>and louder and you actually think </v>

270
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.890
<v Speaker 2>there's an argument going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's really not any fun at all.</v>

271
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.260
<v Speaker 2>It's just two people who are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>passionate about this subject.</v>

272
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.910
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about I eat baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

273
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get them going,</v>

274
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 2>don't start that fucking argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

275
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.670
<v Speaker 2>what was the documentary there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saw where they went to Cuba and they </v>

276
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 2>were watching these guys pay to argue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would pay to uh,</v>

277
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:39.840
<v Speaker 2>discuss like sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they'd pay to,</v>

278
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:44.930
<v Speaker 2>to like to argue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would go to this one area and they </v>

279
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.571
<v Speaker 2>would get together with other guys who </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to argue about sports and then </v>

280
00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 2>they're actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had like a ticket and they would go</v>

281
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:55.050
<v Speaker 2>in there and argue about like soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball,</v>

282
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 2>10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

283
00:12:56.201 --> 00:13:01.201
<v Speaker 2>No baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their arguments are a beautiful </v>

284
00:13:01.201 --> 00:13:04.231
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing I used to do years ago where </v>

285
00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:04.231
<v Speaker 2>I'd yell and then walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

286
00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cute.</v>

287
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.570
<v Speaker 2>But that means the conversation's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you got to say.</v>

288
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't meet the head because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

289
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.480
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what that means.</v>

290
00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:15.400
<v Speaker 2>That's at Bali.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let them argue all day about dumb shit.</v>

291
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 2>baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to them,</v>

293
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:24.511
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they detail is so much that you'll </v>

294
00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:24.511
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they suck you in with the conversation.</v>

295
00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:29.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that fucking Yoel Romero dude who </v>

296
00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:32.820
<v Speaker 2>more embodies Cuba and Cuban athletics </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that guy him like,</v>

297
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.460
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I think of like a Cuban athletes </v>

298
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 2>like Cuban super athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think Yoel Romero,</v>

299
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

300
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:45.481
<v Speaker 2>the thing that is the most thing that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>has about being a Cuban is that he's 38 </v>

301
00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:47.160
<v Speaker 2>and you don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

302
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.510
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows.</v>

303
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.880
<v Speaker 2>He's 38.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could be 22 dogs,</v>

304
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 2>could be sucking you in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nobody really knows.</v>

305
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:56.710
<v Speaker 2>We really have those birth certificates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went away.</v>

306
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.310
<v Speaker 2>You just pick the dates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to be done?</v>

307
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:04.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he competed as a wrestler for a long </v>

308
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.710
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they know he's a,</v>

309
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.280
<v Speaker 2>at least a certain age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just teasing,</v>

310
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 2>but I know it's always something with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cuban.</v>

311
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mom died.</v>

312
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I told my auntie she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old was your mom?</v>

313
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:14.100
<v Speaker 2>40 eight flopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's been 48 for 10 fucking years.</v>

314
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's true.</v>

315
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.600
<v Speaker 2>You don't know dog never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These motherfuckers ages.</v>

316
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.790
<v Speaker 2>They won't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that last fight.</v>

317
00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:23.230
<v Speaker 2>He fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking great man.</v>

318
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.190
<v Speaker 2>You see the one before that where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>told people to not.</v>

319
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget Jesus,</v>

320
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't get it because he's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>a thick,</v>

321
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 2>thick Cuban accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thickest.</v>

322
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.410
<v Speaker 2>So he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget Jesus,</v>

323
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.030
<v Speaker 2>don't forget Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people thought he was saying no for </v>

324
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Gay Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no gay Jesus,</v>

325
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.000
<v Speaker 2>like Jesus isn't gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could've been way worse though.</v>

326
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 2>But she was saying was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

327
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.890
<v Speaker 1>saying don't forget Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just saying,</v>

328
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:55.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I one,</v>

329
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.040
<v Speaker 1>don't forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

330
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to the why here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

331
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they didn't go that way?</v>

332
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Why it not go that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I would have gone off on him </v>

333
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.100
<v Speaker 1>that he would have beat up right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Luke and how the one that would be </v>

334
00:15:09.361 --> 00:15:14.361
<v Speaker 1>in that room that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to motivate Cubans or with </v>

335
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that radicals,</v>

336
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 1>you would just start talking about God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just call him about old goon got </v>

337
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.500
<v Speaker 1>metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God of Cuba and he'll wait a minute,</v>

338
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.030
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

339
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.260
<v Speaker 1>and he used the one that he used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the metal worker.</v>

340
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 1>He is the fucking built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go on Youtube,</v>

341
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:32.680
<v Speaker 1>look for a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was always a big black guy.</v>

342
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Lives in the jungle and he only comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to you.</v>

343
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Only comes out when there's a problem.</v>

344
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 1>So if I would've seen y'all remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>that day,</v>

345
00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I would have said the whole Google and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have got his blood gone.</v>

346
00:15:43.271 --> 00:15:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Like blood going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit dog.</v>

347
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:51.641
<v Speaker 1>I started doing that to end this civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first met him and I remember one </v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember.</v>

464
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I remember that day very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

465
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:43.210
<v Speaker 3>People were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were having fun,</v>

466
00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:48.211
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were speaking Spanish with clearly </v>

467
00:21:48.211 --> 00:21:48.211
<v Speaker 3>Cuban accents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were dancing.</v>

468
00:21:48.211 --> 00:21:48.480
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have.</v>

469
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.340
<v Speaker 3>The little girl was dancing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>father was dancing and they were playing</v>

470
00:21:51.341 --> 00:21:52.870
<v Speaker 3>music out of their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

471
00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:55.690
<v Speaker 3>look at these fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't give a fuck who you just,</v>

472
00:21:55.691 --> 00:21:57.860
<v Speaker 3>you're having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just here having a good time.</v>

473
00:21:57.861 --> 00:21:59.500
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

474
00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that I don't know too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>about politics and I don't know too much</v>

475
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 3>about like the embargo and how it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>went down.</v>

476
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I know very little of it honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I do know is there's something </v>

477
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.821
<v Speaker 3>strange about a culture like Cuba that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of existed outside of the influence</v>

478
00:22:18.161 --> 00:22:18.940
<v Speaker 3>of the United States.</v>

479
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Purely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

480
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.090
<v Speaker 3>Obviously we're only 90 miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but since we're.</v>

481
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.100
<v Speaker 3>There was an embargo and there's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this bullshit that was going on back and</v>

482
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:32.101
<v Speaker 3>forth between the two countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kind of existed in their own space </v>

483
00:22:32.101 --> 00:22:34.510
<v Speaker 3>and when you see it like in video and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see like the cars,</v>

484
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.930
<v Speaker 3>all 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars done up beautifully and people are </v>

485
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.871
<v Speaker 3>driving them around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put like diesel engines in some of </v>

486
00:22:42.871 --> 00:22:43.720
<v Speaker 3>them and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all like self sustaining and you</v>

487
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:48.721
<v Speaker 3>look at these people and you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flowing style of their language and </v>

488
00:22:48.721 --> 00:22:52.030
<v Speaker 3>how they live and it's all right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking 90 miles from from Miami.</v>

489
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.060
<v Speaker 3>He just nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

490
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 3>if you could drive than a car will take </v>
<v Speaker 3>you an hour and a half.</v>

491
00:22:56.921 --> 00:23:00.070
<v Speaker 3>It's closer than San Diego and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally different world.</v>

492
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Totally different world that essentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>existed with very little us influence </v>

493
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.810
<v Speaker 3>other than the fact that we're close by </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

494
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 3>they have to deal with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but other than that,</v>

495
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're doing their own thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>down there and they athletes,</v>

496
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many countries that are that small </v>

497
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.060
<v Speaker 3>produce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of athletes that Cuba has.</v>

498
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Just think about how many baseball </v>
<v Speaker 3>players have defected and become like </v>

499
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 3>major league baseball players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many boxers have defected and become</v>

500
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.400
<v Speaker 3>world champions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of like super high </v>

501
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.350
<v Speaker 3>level boxers had come over there from </v>
<v Speaker 3>their judo guys.</v>

502
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Guys like Hector Lombard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

503
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:41.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean that kind of that caliber of </v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete like Jesus Christ.</v>

504
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them come from Juba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did Hector Lombard and Romero</v>

505
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.740
<v Speaker 1>both what you would call what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>

506
00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at both of them,</v>

507

00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:47.171
<v Speaker 1>talking to her just to feel where he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming and he was telling me how you're </v>

00:25:47.451 --> 00:25:52.130
<v Speaker 1>basically poor unless you tell you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to affect them to professionalism.</v>

553
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:56.510
<v Speaker 1>There's a word that you defect in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and now you work for yourself,</v>

554
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 1>so he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was 48 and he was a bicycle guy</v>

555
00:25:59.811 --> 00:26:02.780
<v Speaker 1>that two people sit in the back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive you around town.</v>

<v Speaker 1>making a month.</v>

557
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.870

<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

558
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.080
<v Speaker 1>They let him out of the country because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to claim that first day.</v>

559
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be a professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me all this shit.</v>

560
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:20.410

<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

659
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I went to Cuba and somebody robbed my </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing on the plane,</v>

660
00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.230
<v Speaker 2>and a Cuban family took me in for four </v>
<v Speaker 2>days and fed me.</v>

661
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 2>He goes to that like two pork chops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was telling me,</v>

662
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're fucking beautiful people.</v>

664
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Everything sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people take it to the next step.</v>

665
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that crazy though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what everybody wants.</v>

666
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants a community filled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice people like that.</v>

667
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.480
<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants people to look out for </v>

668
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:57.480
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

669
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Warm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly,</v>

670
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.080
<v Speaker 2>funny people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

671
00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what did.</v>

672
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say this because I don't</v>

673
00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:04.360
<v Speaker 2>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this communism work.</v>

674
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Does it make better people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're in this small </v>

675
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.270
<v Speaker 2>environment like that and you're forced </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work together because the United </v>

676
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.710
<v Speaker 2>States cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cuts your country off and so I mean,</v>

677
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who they do trade with </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly,</v>

678
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 2>but that had to hurt them financially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hurt their quality of life in a big</v>

679
00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:22.670
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

680
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:27.310
<v Speaker 2>But I don't even think they know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>communism is.</v>

681
00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:32.311
<v Speaker 2>Like the conversations I've had face to </v>
<v Speaker 2>face with my cousins at a where we go </v>

682
00:31:32.311 --> 00:31:35.830
<v Speaker 2>for Pastrami sandwiches and we went to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuban place while they were in la.</v>

683
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Communism didn't come up one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the heart to bring it up at</v>

684
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.730
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't,</v>

685
00:31:41.731 --> 00:31:42.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know.</v>

686
00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.560
<v Speaker 2>They know that other people can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want and they know and I </v>

687
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.490
<v Speaker 2>went to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the place we go to?</v>

688
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:50.860
<v Speaker 2>What's the fucking place you go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drama.</v>

689
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.200
<v Speaker 2>And we were at the store on Qantas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Qantas,</v>

690
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Speaker 2>we went to canter's and they started </v>
<v Speaker 2>singing stairway to heaven.</v>

691
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.710
<v Speaker 2>I almost fucking died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had to sneak the album around.</v>

692
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Like they still had albums.</v>

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:16.300
<v Speaker 2>You went back to Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's coming back because he sent me an </v>

<v Speaker 2>email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a blast.</v>

846
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.070
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

847
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.040
<v Speaker 2>we were getting a lot of Australian </v>
<v Speaker 2>people showing up at the store.</v>

848
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australian people at the store and at </v>

849
00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 2>the Ice House too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they go on like these comedy tourist</v>

850
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.550
<v Speaker 2>vacations like Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get like a month off of work,</v>

851
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 2>like they don't like we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get,</v>

852
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a really good company,</v>

853
00:39:34.811 --> 00:39:36.010
<v Speaker 2>you get two weeks off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

854
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:38.230
<v Speaker 2>And they usually encourage you to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>take both those weeks.</v>

855
00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll incentivize you.</v>

856
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that how it works normally?</v>

857
00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 2>But in Australia I think they get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole month off.</v>

858
00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 2>So I think these motherfuckers just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>on vacation.</v>

859
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Just they just go chill places.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you come to La and New York and you </v>

<v Speaker 2>the whatever success you think it is.</v>

866
00:40:04.511 --> 00:40:09.511
<v Speaker 2>Getting on a TV show or movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is becoming a really funny comic </v>

867
00:40:09.511 --> 00:40:09.511
<v Speaker 2>and working.</v>

868
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I never dreamed of what's going on now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I wake up my feet hit the </v>

869
00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:18.730
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thank God for what's going on.</v>

00:40:18.731 --> 00:40:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do movies.</v>

871
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want this movement to keep </v>

872
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.700

<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

875
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Most comics asked for success to be rich</v>
<v Speaker 2>and famous.</v>

876
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:41.050

<v Speaker 2>you're not offensive.</v>

970
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:16.860

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:25.560
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're gonna fuck up.</v>

974
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the first 18 months of my comic </v>

975
00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:30.760
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was clean until I saw lenny Clark's </v>

976
00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:30.760
<v Speaker 2>video and then I started going off a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

977
00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Really 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

978
00:45:31.801 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 2>because everybody put this fear of God </v>
<v Speaker 2>into me,</v>

979
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:39.070
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I used to wear like a nerdy sued and </v>

980
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:39.070
<v Speaker 2>go up there and fucking joke about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

981
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always said that you were the guy </v>

982
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.920
<v Speaker 2>that surprised me the most with how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured comedy out.</v>

983
00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Like almost you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit this point like when I first met</v>

984
00:45:51.121 --> 00:45:56.121
<v Speaker 2>you and you were first doing the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would be the funniest guy in the </v>

985
00:45:56.191 --> 00:46:01.191
<v Speaker 2>world in that parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we would all hang out in the </v>

986
00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:01.740
<v Speaker 2>parking lot and you would just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing everybody in the parking lot.</v>

987
00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:06.741
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you get on stage and you would </v>

988
00:46:06.741 --> 00:46:07.890
<v Speaker 2>stiffen up like you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have.</v>

989
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.780
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the same relaxed way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

990
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't convert when I was doing my </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the stage to the stage.</v>

991
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 2>It's funny how I had this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>

992
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:22.190
<v Speaker 2>but a guy named Charlie Barnett when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched Charlie Barnett,</v>

993
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really got it because he was the first </v>

994
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:27.200
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how people say,</v>

995
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:27.210
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a one trick pony.</v>

996
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least he brings himself to </v>

997
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Barnett was a standup comic at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington square park with Dave </v>

998
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle is his fucking apprentice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

999
00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 2>fucking apprentice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he the DC cab and they ended up</v>

1000
00:46:39.781 --> 00:46:43.410
<v Speaker 2>a couple of serious seasons of Miami </v>
<v Speaker 2>vice will beat up Don Johnson because he</v>

1001
00:46:43.411 --> 00:46:45.660
<v Speaker 2>was just crazy and look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever his name was,</v>

1002
00:46:45.661 --> 00:46:50.661
<v Speaker 2>but he transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wasn't a stage and person to the to </v>

1003
00:46:50.661 --> 00:46:55.491
<v Speaker 2>the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I always looked at that's </v>

1004
00:46:55.491 --> 00:46:55.491
<v Speaker 2>really fucking hard and that's what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always wanted to do.</v>

1005
00:46:55.491 --> 00:46:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Not The screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just the stage,</v>

1006
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.600
<v Speaker 2>how to get Joey Diaz is on the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really want people to see the </v>

1007
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.891
<v Speaker 2>real job ads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always was ashamed of jewelry vs so </v>

1008
00:47:06.891 --> 00:47:08.820
<v Speaker 2>people really want to see Joey Dsr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work clean,</v>

1009
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:14.240
<v Speaker 2>but then I watched that thing again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic Clark because I got on stage </v>

1010
00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.741
<v Speaker 2>because the dice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people will call you don't want to </v>

1011
00:47:18.741 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 2>be dirty because people won't give you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

1012
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.290
<v Speaker 2>So I actually fell for that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all did.</v>

1013
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:24.760
<v Speaker 2>And then I wore a suit like running </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clark because I'm.</v>

1014
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.090
<v Speaker 2>But I couldn't sell a joke in the suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I fucking wanted,</v>

1015
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.800
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't sell them a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where eventually I lost the suit.</v>

1016
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:38.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have to lose things and you're </v>

1017
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:38.400
<v Speaker 2>just learning through a process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1018
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.390
<v Speaker 2>And at the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know where I got it and the belly </v>

1019
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:43.150
<v Speaker 2>room one night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it came to me.</v>

1020
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Wheels was doing a show on a Thursday </v>
<v Speaker 2>night at 11.</v>

1021
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:50.470
<v Speaker 2>There was like 13 people up there and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was bombing anyway.</v>

1022
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:55.471
<v Speaker 2>And I remember I turned to my side and </v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason I took myself back to a </v>

1023
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:59.810
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched that movie without Pachino and</v>

1024
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.220
<v Speaker 2>about football and he has a great speech</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Jamie Foxx.</v>

1025
00:48:03.221 --> 00:48:04.660
<v Speaker 2>One time it brings him to the side and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1026
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.270
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got two minutes on the clock.</v>

1027
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:10.850
<v Speaker 2>We're going back to when you were a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mom just call you in for dental.</v>

1028
00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.860
<v Speaker 2>You've got one play left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember you used to run to the car and </v>

1029
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.751
<v Speaker 2>make a left and do the same fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and they scored a touchdown and </v>

1030
00:48:18.751 --> 00:48:21.991
<v Speaker 2>sometimes we forget about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I did was I twisted my body </v>

1031
00:48:21.991 --> 00:48:25.540
<v Speaker 2>around and I put myself on the corner of</v>
<v Speaker 2>78 and Kennedy Boulevard where I used to</v>

1032
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:30.541
<v Speaker 2>make fun of this guy with the limb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that janitor with the one eye </v>

1033
00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:34.350
<v Speaker 2>and that's when it started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped looking at them and I </v>

1034
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:38.281
<v Speaker 2>remembered who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was letting them judge me with their </v>

1035
00:48:38.281 --> 00:48:38.710
<v Speaker 2>eyes and I turned that and I never </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgot that.</v>

1036
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I remember going home and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm onto something,</v>

1037
00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 2>and then little by little I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>being made more up on stage.</v>

1038
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.530
<v Speaker 2>It was real quick and I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>

1039
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.620
<v Speaker 2>The problem is we listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1040
00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:53.500
<v Speaker 2>they won't do this unless you're clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1041
00:48:53.501 --> 00:48:56.500
<v Speaker 2>If you go for a showcase at the Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do this.</v>

1042
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.160
<v Speaker 2>You have to be yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you got to be yourself,</v>

1043
00:49:00.161 --> 00:49:03.280
<v Speaker 2>you'll never move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll never move forward and comedy.</v>

1044
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.330
<v Speaker 2>You have to tap into this if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1045
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:11.430
<v Speaker 2>and everybody did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody goes up there doing hokey </v>

1046
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.430
<v Speaker 2>jokes in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His snow is shame,</v>

1047
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:12.280
<v Speaker 2>snow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassment.</v>

1048
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:17.520
<v Speaker 2>You do topical material and Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you start comparing that </v>

1049
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 2>topical material with what's going on in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life and you open that up,</v>

1050
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:24.870
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time or it takes some </v>

1051
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 2>people longer than others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the work.</v>

1052
00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:30.130

1057
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 2>because he says he was great even when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was 19.</v>

1058
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:55.170

<v Speaker 3>you're on stage.</v>

1068
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.710
<v Speaker 3>What I was going to say is that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened really quick like you,</v>

1069
00:50:22.711 --> 00:50:27.711
<v Speaker 3>where you went from being a guy who had </v>
<v Speaker 3>a really hard time on stage most of the </v>

1070
00:50:27.711 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 3>time and then all of a sudden you are</v>

1071
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 5>murdering man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>the money now.</v>

1121
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:45.730
<v Speaker 5>Dave Chappelle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I almost fucking died because I should </v>

1122
00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:49.041
<v Speaker 5>have taken them up actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put my two feet down and taking the </v>

1123
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:49.041
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

1124
00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.850
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1125
00:52:52.851 --> 00:52:57.851
<v Speaker 5>isn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because he doesn't really put material </v>

1126
00:52:57.851 --> 00:52:57.851
<v Speaker 5>out anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just killing it,</v>

1129
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:03.080
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if he's thinking about doing a </v>
<v Speaker 5>special.</v>

1130
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:08.860

<v Speaker 5>I wonder if he wants to because he's so.</v>

1132
00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.680
<v Speaker 5>He's so different than any.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like you can't predict that guy like</v>

1134
00:53:14.871 --> 00:53:19.871
<v Speaker 5>It's just so unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they offer them this big money to </v>

1135
00:53:19.871 --> 00:53:19.871
<v Speaker 5>do this thing and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1138
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:25.010

<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a little portable PA system in a </v>

1142
00:53:33.711 --> 00:53:36.591
<v Speaker 3>park in Seattle and he would put this </v>
<v Speaker 3>little PA system down and just start </v>

1143
00:53:36.591 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 3>doing standup in the park in Germany to </v>

<v Speaker 2>I sat down,</v>

1214
00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I started getting high and I watched it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I asked around and said he's here </v>

<v Speaker 2>what he does.</v>

1216
00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:48.980

<v Speaker 2>but he would do that for four or five </v>

1217
00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.011
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would take breaks and Dave </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died from the hip.</v>

1222
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:03.860
<v Speaker 2>He's the real deal that he was an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York icon type.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everybody had to jump into the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and that was the joke.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Edgewater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>

1312
01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Edgewater is cap land where they shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital edge or what it was supposed to </v>

<v Speaker 2>Dinah.</v>

1315
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I used to go down there.</v>

1316
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:25.600
<v Speaker 3>What exactly were they shot that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That bar.</v>

1317
01:02:25.601 --> 01:02:27.460

<v Speaker 3>bottles of blackberry.</v>

1318
01:02:27.461 --> 01:02:28.780
<v Speaker 3>Brandy for us when we were kids.</v>

1319
01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.110
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they redid all that shit down.</v>

1320
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that in New York?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1321
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.600

<v Speaker 2>Fucking now.</v>

1322
01:02:35.601 --> 01:02:36.440
<v Speaker 2>That's where I stay now.</v>

1323
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:39.320
<v Speaker 3>I stayed in edgewater here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take the ferry over.</v>

1324
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:41.780
<v Speaker 3>How long does that take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ferry?</v>

1325
01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Ten minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take the ferry over.</v>

1326
01:02:44.301 --> 01:02:46.490
<v Speaker 3>I jumped in my fucking cab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to 20th street.</v>

1327
01:02:46.491 --> 01:02:48.590
<v Speaker 3>I do Gotham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do the stand.</v>

1328
01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.890
<v Speaker 3>I take a cab back to the ferry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How hard would it be to live in New York</v>

1329
01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.360
<v Speaker 3>and take a boat across from New Jersey?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every day people do with everyday back.</v>

1330
01:02:56.361 --> 01:02:58.080
<v Speaker 3>How many people it matter fact get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

1331
01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.340
<v Speaker 3>I gave the card to a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I gave the car to Ari.</v>

1332
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:03.290
<v Speaker 3>I would think that that would be like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart move.</v>

1333
01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a boat and he could try and then</v>

1334
01:03:08.661 --> 01:03:11.960
<v Speaker 3>go do your thing with Louis does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't he a big guy?</v>

1335
01:03:11.961 --> 01:03:14.180
<v Speaker 3>He has his own boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He definitely has a boat.</v>

1336
01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's what he does or </v>
<v Speaker 3>if he.</v>

1337
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:17.440
<v Speaker 3>I think he lives in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1338
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:22.550
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I feel like it wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hard to get across that water,</v>

1339
01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:25.580
<v Speaker 3>like just water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get across.</v>

1340
01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:30.850
<v Speaker 3>That's way better than a stupid bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could figure out a way to </v>

1341
01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.860
<v Speaker 3>like to live like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just take Uber's on one side,</v>

1342
01:03:33.861 --> 01:03:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Park your car on the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the way to go.</v>

1343
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:41.190
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've taken that city down.</v>

1344
01:03:41.191 --> 01:03:46.191

<v Speaker 2>You don't need to be a genius or a </v>

1353
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.970
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see this.</v>

1354

<v Speaker 2>They're really going after the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my friends were oh genome.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>because they want to take that bridge </v>
<v Speaker 2>outdoor and they want to take that </v>

1358
01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.270

<v Speaker 2>That's going to be a nightmare.</v>

1359
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.830
<v Speaker 2>When I was walking around in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to,</v>

1361
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:40.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big city with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people.</v>

1362
01:04:40.621 --> 01:04:45.621
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to control all those people </v>

1363
01:04:45.621 --> 01:04:45.621
<v Speaker 2>in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1364
01:04:45.621 --> 01:04:47.020
<v Speaker 3>It's so much different than any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>

1365
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.740
<v Speaker 3>To my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1366
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:51.130
<v Speaker 3>you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just see the magnitude of it all.</v>

1367
01:04:51.131 --> 01:04:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of like sets in and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1368
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.420
<v Speaker 3>no wonder why people can't leave this </v>
<v Speaker 3>place if you get used to this.</v>

1369
01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:58.630
<v Speaker 3>There is no place like that place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so bizarre.</v>

1370
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:03.370
<v Speaker 3>It's 7 million plus people smushed into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the smallest little area.</v>

1371
01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:08.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not that big if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at all the buildings that </v>

1372
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:12.031
<v Speaker 3>are tucked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I had a hotel room once and </v>

1373
01:05:12.031 --> 01:05:12.230
<v Speaker 3>it was on a corner and it was in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1374
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:13.780
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's cool to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside,</v>

1375
01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:16.810
<v Speaker 3>like at a friend lived in Brooklyn and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a cool view from the river.</v>

1376
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Like you look from his apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the whole city skyscraper.</v>

1377
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:25.500
<v Speaker 3>The whole skyline is pretty beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's something cool about being </v>

1378
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:25.500
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of it all.</v>

1379
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:25.930
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1380
01:05:25.931 --> 01:05:30.931
<v Speaker 3>this hotel I stayed at was on a corner </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd like to look out the window on </v>

1381
01:05:30.931 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Speaker 3>both sides and just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a science fiction movie.</v>

1382
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Just giant constructed buildings to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left and to the right.</v>

1383
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 3>And you're in the middle of all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds and hundreds of windows.</v>

1384
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Everyone looking out at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's in there watching a little TV</v>

1385
01:05:43.631 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 3>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing their little thing,</v>

1386
01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:48.760
<v Speaker 3>but you're in the middle of all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy Saifai,</v>

1387
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 3>beehive type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know where we live,</v>

1388
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.960
<v Speaker 3>we would drive to each other's houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a yard.</v>

1389
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:57.970
<v Speaker 3>There's a space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're pulling your driveway.</v>

1390
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:59.070
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1393
01:06:02.051 --> 01:06:03.700
<v Speaker 3>like you get out of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1394
01:06:03.701 --> 01:06:08.701
<v Speaker 3>this is your house right over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his house and no it fucking </v>

1395
01:06:08.701 --> 01:06:08.701
<v Speaker 3>stacked.</v>

1396
01:06:08.701 --> 01:06:09.800
<v Speaker 2>stacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stacked on top of,</v>

1397
01:06:09.801 --> 01:06:11.030
<v Speaker 2>stacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of stack,</v>

1398
01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.800
<v Speaker 2>smashed together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stack,</v>

1399

<v Speaker 2>stack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stack.</v>

1400
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:18.280
<v Speaker 3>Everybody jammed into these boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blue Cars,</v>

1401
01:06:18.281 --> 01:06:20.890
<v Speaker 3>little fucking yellow cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Uber's everywhere on the ground.</v>

1402
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 3>No one gets anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When gridlock hits crosstown traffic,</v>

1403
01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:30.020
<v Speaker 3>there is reason why Hendricks wrote that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking song and that was in the </v>

1404
01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:30.580
<v Speaker 3>seventies and the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess he wrote it right.</v>

1405
01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:34.210
<v Speaker 3>That when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were in the Manhattan,</v>

1406
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:36.940
<v Speaker 3>grew up gridlock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crosstown traffic.</v>

1407

<v Speaker 3>I feel like this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why the fuck would anybody live </v>

1434
01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.960
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then yeah,</v>

1435
01:07:49.961 --> 01:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>you've got the view of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Manhattan skyline,</v>

1436
01:07:53.051 --> 01:07:58.051
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're paying for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how much of one of those big</v>

1437
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:03.300
<v Speaker 2>apartment buildings must be worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>because every one of those units is a </v>

1438
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:03.970
<v Speaker 2>million bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a million bucks or more.</v>

1439
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Milan have a much more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw some that were like $5 million.</v>

1440
01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:10.810
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta be kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a normal apartment,</v>

1441
01:08:10.811 --> 01:08:13.270
<v Speaker 2>silver lake and there's like 5 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks,</v>

1442
01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>but this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't live</v>

1443
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:16.970
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you?</v>

1444
01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.950
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't live like that if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I like,</v>

1445
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 3>if I had the experience of living there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it was normal to me,</v>

1446
01:08:25.570 --> 01:08:28.160
<v Speaker 3>like I think the people that do live </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1447
01:08:28.190 --> 01:08:30.560
<v Speaker 3>when you get used to driving around on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the subway,</v>

1448
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:34.970
<v Speaker 3>riding around and calves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get used to where all the clubs are.</v>

1449
01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:36.920
<v Speaker 3>You do your little routine and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1450
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.500
<v Speaker 3>getting the airport to take off two </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities and he worked the road.</v>

1451
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:44.840
<v Speaker 3>You get used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get used to like a tail does it.</v>

1452
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:50.530
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those other guys do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once you get used to space and once </v>

1453
01:08:50.530 --> 01:08:54.761
<v Speaker 3>you get used to like being able to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>dip out and dip back in without that </v>

1454
01:08:54.761 --> 01:08:55.730
<v Speaker 3>much trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's way easier to like live in the</v>

1455
01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:59.390
<v Speaker 3>valley and then drive into the store on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a Friday night.</v>

1456
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Then it would ever be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you live somewhere like that equally </v>

1457
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:05.660
<v Speaker 3>far away from Manhattan and he wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in to do a spot.</v>

1458
01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.320
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a to our proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you've got to be ready.</v>

1459
01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.270
<v Speaker 3>You got to be ready to enter that </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine,</v>

1460
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.600
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're going to do it at </v>

1461
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:16.600
<v Speaker 3>like 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night.</v>

1462
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.090
<v Speaker 3>So what time you leave your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you leave your house at 5:30</v>

1463
01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:18.470
<v Speaker 3>for a 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1464
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Well then you leave your wallet at home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your phone and the driveway.</v>

1465
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:28.970
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense to hit and hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say if you hit and let's say you </v>

1466
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:32.621
<v Speaker 3>live in Brooklyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to take the train into </v>

<v Speaker 3>you do four or five spots.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Have this?</v>

1472
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do a couple of spots and get back on</v>

1473
01:09:43.161 --> 01:09:45.740
<v Speaker 3>your train and go home and 1:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>now with Uber's too,</v>

1474
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:50.741

<v Speaker 3>It's so easy to just use your car shows </v>

1475
01:09:50.741 --> 01:09:54.050

1481
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:09.580
<v Speaker 3>You go walking around looking for one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now you just press a button on your </v>

1482
01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:09.860
<v Speaker 3>phone and they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll be there in three minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>bitch lift.</v>

1487
01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Just lax [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever take Uber?</v>

1488
01:10:23.661 --> 01:10:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take it up one time.</v>

1489
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I took a black one time through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've taken a few times in New York.</v>

1490
01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.530
<v Speaker 3>I use it all the time in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do.</v>

1491
01:10:30.531 --> 01:10:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I think I could do it like he's enjoying</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1492
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.960
<v Speaker 3>He's enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He likes doing it.</v>

1493
01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:39.380
<v Speaker 3>It'd be harder for me because I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids and I just don't think New York </v>

1494
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:39.380
<v Speaker 3>City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best place for kids,</v>

1495
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 3>and maybe I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just seems.</v>

1496
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.640
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that brake dust can't be good for you </v>

1497
01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:45.640
<v Speaker 3>and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's break.</v>

1498
01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:50.240
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you feel like I'm finding out what </v>

1499
01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.980
<v Speaker 3>the fuck you breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go look at your wheels with your cars,</v>

1500
01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 3>wheels and just stick your finger inside</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rim and get that black shit all over</v>

1501
01:10:56.421 --> 01:10:57.140
<v Speaker 3>your finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will.</v>

1502
01:10:57.141 --> 01:11:02.141
<v Speaker 3>That just says it doesn't just go on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your wheel and stick their only know as </v>

1503
01:11:02.141 --> 01:11:06.701
<v Speaker 3>you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See like crazy traffic like on fifth </v>

1504
01:11:06.701 --> 01:11:07.870
<v Speaker 3>avenue or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd see Broadway traffic just paint,</v>

1505
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.690
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>

1506
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're breathing in brake dust.</v>

1507
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That stuff's in the air,</v>

1508
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1509
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.160
<v Speaker 5>it's not just the carbon fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A residue like the exhaust from cars,</v>

1510
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fires are being burned,</v>

1511
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:24.140
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a gas ovens and that.</v>

1512
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:26.430
<v Speaker 5>It's not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's brake dust,</v>

1513
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:31.510
<v Speaker 5>brake dust is everywhere and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting that shit in your lungs 100 </v>

1514
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 5>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not good for you.</v>

1515
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.560
<v Speaker 5>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1516
01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:39.561
<v Speaker 5>and they've shown their studies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that think that living in a high </v>

1517
01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 5>populated city like New York and take as</v>
<v Speaker 5>much as 10 years off your life,</v>

1518
01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:43.350
<v Speaker 5>just living there doing exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

1519
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:48.590
<v Speaker 5>living exact same choices,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but living in a polluted environment </v>

1520
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 5>like downtown La.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was probably a good example of that.</v>

1521
01:11:49.081 --> 01:11:51.000
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Downtown gets Funky,</v>

1522
01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gets fucking polluted,</v>

1523
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:56.100
<v Speaker 5>but it's still more open than say New </v>
<v Speaker 5>York or anything like that.</v>

1524
01:11:56.101 --> 01:12:00.150
<v Speaker 5>You could at least see the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you can,</v>

1525
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:02.220
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but la gets pretty stinky.</v>

1526
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:06.240
<v Speaker 5>Ellie can get pretty bad if we get </v>
<v Speaker 5>stagnant and the winds don't blow,</v>

1527
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:07.200
<v Speaker 5>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1528
01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:10.200
<v Speaker 5>the pollution just sits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know how you crest,</v>

1529
01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:15.230
<v Speaker 5>like if you come over from Encino and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you see the valley and you see that </v>

1530
01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 5>fucking horrible brown cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's real.</v>

1531
01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:20.070
<v Speaker 5>Assign an illusion and you don't see </v>
<v Speaker 5>that in the desert.</v>

1532
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.350
<v Speaker 5>If you go out where there's no people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't exist,</v>

1533
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:26.250
<v Speaker 5>that exist because of people burning </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that you're breathing that in.</v>

1534
01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:31.370
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's breathing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In 93 I lived in New York and I would </v>

1535
01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:33.070
<v Speaker 5>get up at seven and go into the city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I live in cliffside.</v>

1536
01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.290
<v Speaker 5>I worked in New York and going to New </v>
<v Speaker 5>York and bum around and then sometimes I</v>

1537
01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:39.540
<v Speaker 5>take a shower at the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I joined a boxing gym.</v>

1538
01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:43.290
<v Speaker 5>I just go there for the locker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basically I would if the bag a little.</v>

1539
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:48.291
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what I was doing and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>would fuck it and just go out at night </v>

1540
01:12:48.291 --> 01:12:51.540
<v Speaker 5>and I remember sometimes I wouldn't take</v>
<v Speaker 5>a shower at the gym at six.</v>

1541
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:56.750
<v Speaker 5>I was busy and I get home at 11 and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>take a shower and you'd see what will </v>

1542
01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:01.170
<v Speaker 5>come out of my hair and I'd just be </v>
<v Speaker 5>walking around Manhattan guys.</v>

1543
01:13:01.171 --> 01:13:06.171
<v Speaker 5>I didn't go anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd just be walking around Manhattan </v>

1544
01:13:06.171 --> 01:13:06.171
<v Speaker 5>given cabs doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dropping off packages.</v>

1545
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:11.180
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see I didn't do anything </v>

1546
01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:11.180
<v Speaker 5>residue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just this darkness,</v>

1547
01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:15.891
<v Speaker 5>like it was like Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck have I been used to it </v>

1548
01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:19.581
<v Speaker 5>after awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it really stuck with me like just </v>

1549
01:13:19.581 --> 01:13:22.251
<v Speaker 5>walking around Manhattan six or seven </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours with do this to me.</v>

1550
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.870
<v Speaker 5>Like it really will get more blackheads </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1551
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.330
<v Speaker 5>My hair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when you wash it,</v>

1552
01:13:27.331 --> 01:13:29.610
<v Speaker 5>you would see the fucking dirt bike.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just not real.</v>

1553
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:34.700
<v Speaker 5>A lot of dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you see that you have something on </v>

1554
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:34.700
<v Speaker 5>your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you this.</v>

1555
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.490
<v Speaker 5>Does this make sense to you?</v>

1556
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.250
<v Speaker 5>They can make a big giant building like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the empire state building.</v>

1557
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:43.310
<v Speaker 5>They can make a big ass building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why can't they make a big ass air </v>

1558
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:44.200
<v Speaker 5>filter?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1559
01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.010
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to put up that many </v>
<v Speaker 5>buildings and have that many people,</v>

1560
01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 5>not many cars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about your build a giant air filter?</v>

1561
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean like they sell air filters for </v>
<v Speaker 5>your house.</v>

1562
01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:58.010
<v Speaker 5>Like my daughter's allergic to cats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're finding out we have two cats and </v>

1563
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:59.670
<v Speaker 5>so now we have to shave the cats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I've been shaving them.</v>

1564
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:04.730
<v Speaker 5>First of all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's adorable when you see the line </v>

1565
01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:04.730
<v Speaker 5>cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1566
01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:08.181
<v Speaker 5>they get the line cuts and the and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other thing is when you shave him </v>

1567
01:14:08.181 --> 01:14:12.440
<v Speaker 5>it's just almost like skin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's just a little bit of flour and </v>

1568
01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:12.440
<v Speaker 5>it must feel so</v>

1569
01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.470
<v Speaker 3>much better when you pat him because </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I pad,</v>

1570
01:14:14.471 --> 01:14:16.150
<v Speaker 3>especially like the little girl with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>big one,</v>

1571
01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:21.151
<v Speaker 3>that boy the boy too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I pat them they just start </v>

1572
01:14:21.151 --> 01:14:24.001
<v Speaker 3>fucking riving like you're making them </v>
<v Speaker 3>come and they love it.</v>

1573
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:25.990
<v Speaker 3>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love it when you're,</v>

1574
01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:27.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're petting them,</v>

1575
01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:32.251
<v Speaker 3>when you've shaved them all down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we have this air cleaner that we </v>

1576
01:14:32.251 --> 01:14:33.310
<v Speaker 3>have to put in her bedroom because she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she starts sneezing and shit.</v>

1577
01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:36.640
<v Speaker 3>We're finding out that she's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>terribly allergic but allergic enough so</v>

1578
01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:39.640
<v Speaker 3>we have to figure out what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they make these air filters.</v>

1579
01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.200
<v Speaker 3>It makes a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put them in your room,</v>

1580
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:43.630
<v Speaker 3>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the dander and all this stuff out of</v>

1581
01:14:43.631 --> 01:14:48.631
<v Speaker 3>the air cleans it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like if you can make a giant </v>

1582
01:14:48.631 --> 01:14:50.941
<v Speaker 3>ass building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't you make a giant ass air </v>

1583
01:14:50.941 --> 01:14:50.941
<v Speaker 3>filter that sucks?</v>

1584
01:14:50.941 --> 01:14:54.930
<v Speaker 3>All that dirty brown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stinky air out and cleans it like that </v>

1585
01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:56.380
<v Speaker 3>can't be impossible to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just doesn't seem like it should be.</v>

1586
01:14:56.381 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 3>If you can make a big building and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can make a big fan,</v>

1587
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.420
<v Speaker 3>he can make a big fucking air cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't you?</v>

1588
01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.600
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you got to clean it every two </v>

1589
01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.751
<v Speaker 3>minutes or something from the man who </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought you parachutes on commercial </v>

1590
01:15:09.751 --> 01:15:12.220
<v Speaker 3>airplanes that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sucks.</v>

1591
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:14.820
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people get use to the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1592
01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.180
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geez.</v>

1593
01:15:16.181 --> 01:15:19.060
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of ex girlfriends that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would first like,</v>

1594
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:20.620
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm allergic to cats.</v>

1595
01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:25.621
<v Speaker 3>And then after a few years or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would stop being as allergic </v>

1596
01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:25.640
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of India.</v>

1597
01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:27.430
<v Speaker 3>You vaccinated them with your Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1598
01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Slowly but surely you feel anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any non cat allergy DNA into their body </v>

1599
01:15:34.271 --> 01:15:36.550
<v Speaker 3>and they assimilate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at a gas station the other day and</v>

1600
01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:39.540
<v Speaker 3>they were selling poppers and I recently</v>
<v Speaker 3>was at a nitrate,</v>

1601
01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:39.840
<v Speaker 3>you mean?</v>

1602
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:41.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1603
01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.600
<v Speaker 3>it's a popper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It even said like it was like the little</v>

1604
01:15:43.601 --> 01:15:47.020
<v Speaker 3>jar and everything and it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went to a party and I actually saw</v>

1605
01:15:47.021 --> 01:15:50.200
<v Speaker 3>my first person actually using poppers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you.</v>

1606
01:15:50.201 --> 01:15:51.850
<v Speaker 3>But a guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the same thing.</v>

1607
01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:57.060
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you the stuff they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling it at a gas station is not like </v>

1608
01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.070
<v Speaker 3>Emile nitrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's highly illegal,</v>

1609
01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:57.910
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1610
01:15:57.911 --> 01:15:59.150
<v Speaker 3>I think what they're doing is there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1611
01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how those boner pills,</v>

1612
01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:06.090
<v Speaker 3>like you buy boner pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gas station and pretend they're </v>

1613
01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:09.150
<v Speaker 3>herbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really cialis or Viagra or </v>

1614
01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:11.341
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with these things are something </v>

1615
01:16:11.341 --> 01:16:14.041
<v Speaker 3>similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just how like bath salts were never </v>

1616
01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:16.561
<v Speaker 3>really bath salts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could just call it whatever they </v>

1617
01:16:16.561 --> 01:16:16.561
<v Speaker 3>want and call poppers as long as it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not email nitrate.</v>

1618
01:16:16.561 --> 01:16:20.140
<v Speaker 3>But was bachelor that salt was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would call it bath salts.</v>

1619
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.780
<v Speaker 3>So they could sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would say not for human consumption,</v>

1620
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:24.250
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it really is,</v>

1621
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:28.690
<v Speaker 3>was they had done something to meth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they say like,</v>

1622
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:31.180
<v Speaker 3>this is an idiot's way of describing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1623
01:16:31.181 --> 01:16:33.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just let me get that out of the way.</v>

1624
01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:36.850
<v Speaker 3>When you describe something like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>molecule like,</v>

1625
01:16:36.851 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1626
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.450
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chemical that your brain produces,</v>

1627
01:16:40.451 --> 01:16:45.451
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an end dimethyltryptamine that's </v>

1628
01:16:45.451 --> 01:16:49.351
<v Speaker 3>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a thing called five meo </v>

1629
01:16:49.351 --> 01:16:52.450
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine that's legal because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucked up and they didn't,</v>

1630
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:57.480
<v Speaker 3>they didn't list it so you could get </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff and it's like a cousin of </v>

1631
01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.390
<v Speaker 3>DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called five Meo DMT.</v>

1632
01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a similar to what they did with </v>

1633
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:03.870
<v Speaker 3>this math thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would take meth and then they would</v>

1634
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:08.521
<v Speaker 3>just change a little bit of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>add an oxygen molecule and a carbon </v>

1635
01:17:08.521 --> 01:17:12.091
<v Speaker 3>molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever they have they have to do and </v>

1636
01:17:12.091 --> 01:17:12.091
<v Speaker 3>that turns it into something</v>

1637
01:17:12.091 --> 01:17:12.530
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not illegal,</v>

1638
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.650
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll fuck you up,</v>

1639
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.440
<v Speaker 5>fuck face eating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you up.</v>

1640
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:21.680
<v Speaker 5>So then they sell it as bath salts </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

1641
01:17:21.681 --> 01:17:22.640
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>throw this in the bath,</v>

1642
01:17:22.641 --> 01:17:23.690
<v Speaker 5>hop in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wink,</v>

1643
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.970
<v Speaker 5>wink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everybody knows you're just going to</v>

1644
01:17:25.971 --> 01:17:30.971
<v Speaker 5>go smoke it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they smoke this stuff and it blows </v>

1645
01:17:30.971 --> 01:17:31.520
<v Speaker 5>their fucking brains out because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't even know what it is.</v>

1646
01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.660
<v Speaker 5>But you're selling like high potency </v>
<v Speaker 5>meth at truck stops.</v>

1647
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:36.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what they're selling it.</v>

1648
01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.500
<v Speaker 5>They were selling those little </v>
<v Speaker 5>convenient marks was weird.</v>

1649
01:17:39.501 --> 01:17:44.501
<v Speaker 5>Twenty four gas stations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where they were selling it and </v>

1650
01:17:44.501 --> 01:17:46.991
<v Speaker 5>you can just go in and buy meth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but through a loophole and so all these </v>

1651
01:17:46.991 --> 01:17:49.820
<v Speaker 5>people were buying this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am for years.</v>

1652
01:17:49.821 --> 01:17:53.840
<v Speaker 5>You go into a place and the east coast </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he always had a rose in the tube.</v>

1653
01:17:54.230 --> 01:17:55.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a crack pipe.</v>

1654
01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.870
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1655
01:17:57.350 --> 01:18:02.350
<v Speaker 5>it's not really a rose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rose is throw the fucking blows </v>

1656
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.390
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smoke crack out of that thing.</v>

1657
01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:03.780
<v Speaker 5>You didn't know that?</v>

1658
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.820
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew it because my friend Johnny was a</v>

1659
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:09.740
<v Speaker 5>crackhead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you believe that?</v>

1660
01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:10.950
<v Speaker 5>They suck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1661
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.690
<v Speaker 5>How many doors did you go from here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like a rose fucking crackhead.</v>

1662
01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:18.560
<v Speaker 5>Would they had to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>sell those things,</v>

1663
01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:22.640
<v Speaker 5>so they sold like a little tiny glass </v>
<v Speaker 5>face with a rosewood.</v>

1664
01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:27.670
<v Speaker 5>They should've bought some of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was in west Hollywood and </v>

1665
01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:27.670
<v Speaker 5>they were lined up at different logos on</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:27.830
<v Speaker 5>Just like.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's the loophole right there.</v>

1671
01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:37.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it's just a beauty about paying</v>

1672
01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:40.520
<v Speaker 5>a nickel on getting an attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd sit with them and going,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Can you believe Brian fucking 40 when I </v>

1675
01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:50.610
<v Speaker 5>found that I'm supposed to be the king </v>
<v Speaker 5>of swing,</v>

1676
01:18:50.611 --> 01:18:55.220
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking crack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is hilarious that keep on finding out</v>

1677
01:18:55.221 --> 01:18:57.380
<v Speaker 5>these horrible things that I should have</v>
<v Speaker 5>known a long time ago.</v>

1678
01:18:57.381 --> 01:18:58.550
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like on the toaster,</v>

1679
01:18:58.551 --> 01:19:00.740
<v Speaker 5>the one through 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how many minutes.</v>

1680
01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:02.600
<v Speaker 5>It's not like hot and cold.</v>

1681
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:09.140
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1682
01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:10.100
<v Speaker 5>I wonder why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1683
01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:15.101
<v Speaker 5>why does seven take so long?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Such a fucking idiot.</v>

1684
01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm making toast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go Jesus Christ.</v>

1685
01:19:18.081 --> 01:19:19.670
<v Speaker 5>I need a faster toaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1686
01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:24.700
<v Speaker 5>Something that gets you a seven quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea that that little thing </v>

1687
01:19:24.921 --> 01:19:27.380
<v Speaker 5>when you zip up your pants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that little knob thing,</v>

1688
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.370
<v Speaker 5>if you put it down that Luxor zipper </v>
<v Speaker 5>down like you know,</v>

1689
01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:32.780
<v Speaker 5>like when you're zipping it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the handle,</v>

1690
01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:35.870
<v Speaker 5>if you put the handle down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it locks it up.</v>

1691
01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.160
<v Speaker 5>You just kind of like zip up your pants </v>
<v Speaker 5>and not think about it and they later </v>

1692
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:41.160
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is my zipper down?</v>

1693
01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.690
<v Speaker 5>It's because you didn't just do that </v>
<v Speaker 5>extra little.</v>

1694
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:47.090
<v Speaker 5>You didn't have that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>

1695
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:49.310
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this handle thing like this right here.</v>

1696
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:50.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>

1697
01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:51.350
<v Speaker 5>This.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put it down,</v>

1698
01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 5>put it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It locks.</v>

1699
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:57.311
<v Speaker 5>It lets the lock the lock and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole technology unlock until you lift </v>

1700
01:19:59.071 --> 01:19:59.810
<v Speaker 5>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1701
01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.450
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have like five more.</v>

1702
01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:09.460
<v Speaker 5>Just realize what I'm trying to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's bent down that I literally </v>

1703
01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:09.460
<v Speaker 5>can't</v>

1704
01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 3>unzip my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating.</v>

1705
01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea what makes sense,</v>

1706
01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise it just wouldn't work.</v>

1707
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.310
<v Speaker 3>Zippers are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of Zippers.</v>

1708
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Man Hates Zipper is always down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's always like your zipper's </v>

<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it matters where these </v>

1712
01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:29.430
<v Speaker 3>goddamn stretchy pants.</v>

01:25:18.771 --> 01:25:23.771
<v Speaker 3>there really was a rumor and I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rumor just like you would joke </v>

1827
01:25:24.441 --> 01:25:29.441
<v Speaker 3>around about mixing reality and fiction </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would combine the two of them </v>

1828
01:25:29.451 --> 01:25:34.451
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was the only guy that ever did </v>

1829
01:25:34.451 --> 01:25:34.730
<v Speaker 3>that an openly did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you would read it and he would call</v>

1830
01:25:34.731 --> 01:25:37.670
<v Speaker 3>it Gonzo journalism and you would know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like as you were reading it,</v>

1831
01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.460
<v Speaker 3>that this wasn't all real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some of this stuff.</v>

1832
01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:43.020
<v Speaker 3>It was just complete total fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1833
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:45.410
<v Speaker 3>we were right outside of barstow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the bats,</v>

1834
01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:48.140
<v Speaker 3>what is it when the drugs were going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take hold,</v>

1835
01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:54.010
<v Speaker 3>like the stories about like all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>different shit that they had in the </v>

1836
01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:54.320
<v Speaker 3>truck where they were headed to vegas </v>
<v Speaker 3>from barstow.</v>

1837
01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.460
<v Speaker 3>The bats in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking acid trip in the,</v>

1838
01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.650
<v Speaker 3>in the reception area of the Vegas Hotel</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they just like screaming about golf</v>

1839
01:26:03.651 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 3>shoes</v>

1840
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:07.610
<v Speaker 2>and he sees everybody turned into </v>
<v Speaker 2>lizards like this is fucking bizarre,</v>

1841
01:26:07.611 --> 01:26:09.390
<v Speaker 2>bizarre shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1842
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:12.890
<v Speaker 2>He was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unusual guy.</v>

1843
01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.410
<v Speaker 2>He took a high acid brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did,</v>

1844
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.430
<v Speaker 2>but he went a different way with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really fascinating about him,</v>

1845
01:26:19.431 --> 01:26:24.431
<v Speaker 2>he went like guns and fucking living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods and just blowing your brains </v>

1846
01:26:24.431 --> 01:26:29.411
<v Speaker 2>out with cocaine every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he went a totally different way </v>

1847
01:26:29.411 --> 01:26:29.411
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't go like the Kumbaya way,</v>

1848
01:26:30.230 --> 01:26:31.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all these other dudes.</v>

1849
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.390
<v Speaker 2>They got together and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sat Indian style and they,</v>

1850
01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:40.660
<v Speaker 2>they played Indian music and chimes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>burned incense and they went the </v>

1851
01:26:40.761 --> 01:26:43.670
<v Speaker 2>spiritual route and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went to.</v>

1852
01:26:43.710 --> 01:26:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise the total other way he went </v>
<v Speaker 2>get acid and then get a gun and then go </v>

1853
01:26:49.641 --> 01:26:51.680
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was shooting golf balls.</v>

1854
01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to put them in the hole.</v>

1855
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:58.450
<v Speaker 2>He was playing golf with a gun so he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would shoot the balls to put them in a </v>

1856
01:26:58.450 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 2>hole or something like that.</v>

1857
01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Just shit that it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1858
01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.110
<v Speaker 2>I was living in snowmass village and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was hearing different rumblings.</v>

1859
01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I was still 19 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know if I was allowed in that</v>

1860
01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:12.640
<v Speaker 2>bar that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just go in there with Keto Keto,</v>

1861
01:27:12.690 --> 01:27:13.700
<v Speaker 2>get weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

1862
01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:17.720
<v Speaker 2>That was his name was keith corn and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would take me to keith corn.</v>

1863
01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:21.050
<v Speaker 2>His life's mission was to get the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>weed in Colorado.</v>

1864
01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:23.990
<v Speaker 2>I told him from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get bag of weed,</v>

1865
01:27:23.991 --> 01:27:25.910
<v Speaker 2>knock on my door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me the 40 bucks.</v>

1866
01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:28.590
<v Speaker 2>So he would come to me and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his guy.</v>

1867
01:27:28.591 --> 01:27:30.080
<v Speaker 2>And with a click,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this weight.</v>

1868
01:27:30.081 --> 01:27:32.460
<v Speaker 2>It's killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to go down to the tablet.</v>

1869
01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:34.250
<v Speaker 2>It was hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>

1870
01:27:34.251 --> 01:27:39.251
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't until I was selling 100 fresh </v>
<v Speaker 2>washer or something that was selling </v>

1871
01:27:39.251 --> 01:27:39.280
<v Speaker 2>weed there or something.</v>

1872
01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.820
<v Speaker 2>How far was that from when you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>living?</v>

1873
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 10 minutes down.</v>

1874
01:27:44.211 --> 01:27:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Snowmass village hill and then go loop </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1875
01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.440
<v Speaker 2>And then go into woody creek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you lived in boulder and you lived in</v>

1876
01:27:51.441 --> 01:27:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Aspen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in.</v>

1877
01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I lived in a town called basalt first </v>
<v Speaker 2>and right around the corner from Goldie </v>

1878
01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Hawn and motherfucking Kurt Russell </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1879
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:05.890
<v Speaker 2>the river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever river that was the salt is a </v>

1880
01:28:05.890 --> 01:28:08.070
<v Speaker 2>golden pond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No river of the pond.</v>

1881
01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:13.080
<v Speaker 2>You fuck this up a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is route 82,</v>

1882
01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:15.950
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the most dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to map entry.</v>

1883
01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:18.890
<v Speaker 2>So it goes north and south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Aspen,</v>

1884
01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight ahead.</v>

1885
01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.200
<v Speaker 2>You have to go up three miles to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>snowmass village and then you have to go</v>

1886
01:28:24.201 --> 01:28:26.360
<v Speaker 2>over here to go to woody creek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1887
01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:31.420
<v Speaker 2>But the salt was down here about 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes from town and you had to go up </v>

1888
01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:31.760
<v Speaker 2>and up a hill.</v>

1889
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:33.650
<v Speaker 2>And that hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

1890
01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:36.590
<v Speaker 2>it was maybe a gun store and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>

1891
01:28:36.591 --> 01:28:39.860
<v Speaker 2>but there was a place I had never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in New York City fucking kid.</v>

1892
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 2>And when I first saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got addicted to this.</v>

1893
01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Worse than cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would walk from the salt every day and</v>

1894
01:28:47.241 --> 01:28:49.550
<v Speaker 2>walked from Holland hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where where I lived,</v>

1895
01:28:49.551 --> 01:28:54.551
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dean Cain had home that locked up and </v>

1896
01:28:54.551 --> 01:28:55.460
<v Speaker 2>back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go in there and you get to go,</v>

1897
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best idea,</v>

1898
01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:00.800
<v Speaker 2>I'd smoke homegrown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The girl maximum me was growing,</v>

1899
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 2>grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should cut it with a scissor</v>

1900
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:06.060
<v Speaker 1>and it got me more high than the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying fucking 54 now.</v>

1901
01:29:06.061 --> 01:29:11.061
<v Speaker 1>This shit was fucking deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an 18 year old kid and I would </v>

1902
01:29:11.061 --> 01:29:14.631
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd get this guy $7 and he'd give me a </v>

1903
01:29:14.631 --> 01:29:17.841
<v Speaker 1>fishing pole and I throw it into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>roaring creek and after two minutes,</v>

1904
01:29:18.511 --> 01:29:23.511
<v Speaker 1>an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blind moron to catch a trout and he'd </v>

1905
01:29:23.511 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 1>come over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got something and he'd come over and</v>

1906
01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:26.940
<v Speaker 1>he'd help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

1907
01:29:26.941 --> 01:29:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Little trout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd take it off it,</v>

1908
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Cook it and cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll give you a potato salad,</v>

1909
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:36.080
<v Speaker 1>bread and beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have your own fish that he </v>

1910
01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.380
<v Speaker 1>grill up for it really right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 83.</v>

1911
01:29:37.381 --> 01:29:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I was hooked on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even get a job.</v>

1912
01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I took all my savings and I would go </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1913
01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.990
<v Speaker 1>That was my exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to walk down and get a fish and walk,</v>

1914
01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.860
<v Speaker 1>walk down and get a fish.</v>

1915
01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.660
<v Speaker 1>None of the animals that come on when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>squat,</v>

1916
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:52.380
<v Speaker 1>we would squat and do dead lifts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cleans my roommates.</v>

1917
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:54.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're in there shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball,</v>

1918
01:29:55.050 --> 01:29:57.790
<v Speaker 1>shooting back there and eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he vetoed chop up other,</v>

1919
01:29:57.830 --> 01:30:02.830
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I had was I never heard of </v>

1920
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:05.901
<v Speaker 1>that and I'm over here is old snowmass </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they used to have a gas station </v>

1921
01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:10.221
<v Speaker 1>there and the guys from New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was always New York time and that </v>

1922
01:30:10.221 --> 01:30:12.690
<v Speaker 1>was so bizarre and he sold sap brand hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs there in 1982.</v>

1923
01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:15.720
<v Speaker 1>They were that much New Yorkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I saw.</v>

1924
01:30:15.721 --> 01:30:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Goldie Hawn and that little girl for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>

1925
01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:24.080
<v Speaker 1>that little girl was just a little girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I used to see at that gas station </v>

1926
01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:24.840
<v Speaker 1>and what is her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trust,</v>

1927
01:30:24.841 --> 01:30:29.841
<v Speaker 1>the famous actress and old snowmass had </v>
<v Speaker 1>another road that went this way and this</v>

1928
01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:31.080
<v Speaker 1>is a tremendous story.</v>

1929
01:30:31.410 --> 01:30:34.370
<v Speaker 1>It was because all of this at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the eighties with kingpins,</v>

1930
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:37.080
<v Speaker 1>lot of kingpins lived there and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they go.</v>

1931
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.200
<v Speaker 1>They had this cocaine kingpin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a white guy lived there,</v>

1932
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.750
<v Speaker 1>not the gray bar that we discussed early</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your show.</v>

1933
01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:47.751
<v Speaker 1>This other guy and the feds are trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get them so they fucking put cameras </v>

1934
01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:49.740
<v Speaker 1>on all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1935
01:30:49.741 --> 01:30:54.741

<v Speaker 1>They fucked up and they tapped into the </v>

1936
01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:58.641
<v Speaker 1>cable tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his house was being shown to </v>

1937
01:30:58.641 --> 01:30:59.640
<v Speaker 1>everybody on their tvs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>San Francisco?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2066
01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Some fucking moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That moment when you're looking to the </v>

2067
01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:06.600
<v Speaker 2>right of you and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2068
01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:11.350
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're coming back from </v>

2069
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:12.050
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco and you're on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sped up right now.</v>

2070
01:37:12.051 --> 01:37:14.960
<v Speaker 2>This is a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is 82 to aspen.</v>

2071
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:17.870
<v Speaker 2>So I guess you're starting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2072
01:37:17.871 --> 01:37:19.910
<v Speaker 2>It's changed a lot with those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>treats.</v>

2073
01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:21.350
<v Speaker 2>So beautiful though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2074
01:37:21.351 --> 01:37:25.010
<v Speaker 2>There's something about mountain views </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me is the best view.</v>

2075
01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of cool views like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the oceans are really cool.</v>

2076
01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:30.230
<v Speaker 2>View Meadows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really cool view,</v>

2077
01:37:30.231 --> 01:37:33.940
<v Speaker 2>but to me mountains and trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that too,</v>

2078
01:37:33.941 --> 01:37:37.820
<v Speaker 2>just like I don't even know how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe it.</v>

2079
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:43.060
<v Speaker 2>It's so natural and powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of all these plants growing out</v>

2080
01:37:44.601 --> 01:37:49.370
<v Speaker 2>of the ground and reaching up to the sky</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're thick and dense everywhere.</v>

2081
01:37:49.371 --> 01:37:54.371
<v Speaker 2>You're just surrounded by plant life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you look up in this spectacular </v>

2082
01:37:54.371 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 2>snow cap mountains</v>

2083
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 3>and blue sky and floating clouds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trees and you know,</v>

2084
01:37:59.671 --> 01:38:04.671
<v Speaker 3>out there as all just wild life man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking girls is where it gets </v>

2085
01:38:04.671 --> 01:38:08.990
<v Speaker 3>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where it gets good right there </v>

2086
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:10.890
<v Speaker 3>and it gets even fitter at parts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2087
01:38:10.891 --> 01:38:15.891
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to trust the other people in </v>

2088
01:38:15.891 --> 01:38:15.891
<v Speaker 3>their side of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

2089
01:38:15.891 --> 01:38:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with the pch and it was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild and here I am.</v>

2090
01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Then I lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2091
01:38:21.010 --> 01:38:26.010
<v Speaker 3>83 and then I left back to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I went back in [inaudible] 85 and </v>

2092
01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:26.010
<v Speaker 3>that's when I really got into trouble up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2093
01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:30.851
<v Speaker 3>but it was so weird amongst all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>beauty that was just fucking cocaine </v>

2094
01:38:30.851 --> 01:38:32.010

<v Speaker 3>It seems like it'd be more.</v>

2100
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:47.010
<v Speaker 3>I love Denver.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Every time I go there and feel like I'm </v>

2103
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.510

<v Speaker 3>Last time I was there,</v>

2104

<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

2185
01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.100
<v Speaker 2>as like if you have a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they used to let you smoke those.</v>

2189
01:42:58.790 --> 01:43:01.030
<v Speaker 2>They had to come up with laws for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For e-cigarettes.</v>

2190
01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:06.120
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna have to come up with logs </v>
<v Speaker 2>for those fucking hovercrafts because </v>

2191
01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:06.820
<v Speaker 2>hoverboards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're blowing up now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We have a good version of them.</v>

2196
01:43:19.481 --> 01:43:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Or you see the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is straight out of China.</v>

2197
01:43:21.810 --> 01:43:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what's the good version?</v>

2198
01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:28.800
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good versions are the ones that I </v>

2199
01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 2>actually have like a brand name and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff where most of these generic ones </v>

2200
01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 2>or like just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2201
01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:33.730
<v Speaker 2>they're like just generic batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generic.</v>

2202
01:43:33.731 --> 01:43:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I just bought it from Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should I throw them out?</v>

2203
01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Get new ones to donate them to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>risky kids.</v>

2204
01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:43.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll take him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2205
01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:45.490
<v Speaker 2>no kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are fun.</v>

2206
01:43:45.491 --> 01:43:49.780
<v Speaker 2>But you're taking a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some crazy videos that I've been</v>

2207
01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 2>seeing lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Them blowing up just</v>

2208
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.660
<v Speaker 1>because of the generic batteries and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2209
01:43:54.710 --> 01:43:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's probably some of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are better than others,</v>

2210
01:43:56.841 --> 01:43:58.580
<v Speaker 1>but if you think about how many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

2211
01:43:58.581 --> 01:44:02.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably like a very,</v>

2212
01:44:02.211 --> 01:44:04.040
<v Speaker 1>very small percentage of blowing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2213
01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2214
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:06.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

2215
01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:11.720
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to regulate them at the airport because </v>

2216
01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:11.720
<v Speaker 1>people just ride around and I'm in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>airport.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He was doing his residency in Boston.</v>

2305
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:12.950
<v Speaker 3>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never met anybody that worked </v>

2306
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:14.781
<v Speaker 3>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few people in my life that </v>

2307
01:48:14.781 --> 01:48:14.910
<v Speaker 3>when I was young that let me know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard work really was.</v>

2308
01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I thought I worked hard and then I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch these guys and I just got fuck.</v>

2309
01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:20.940
<v Speaker 3>One of 'em was Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve was a,</v>

2310
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:23.280
<v Speaker 3>he was an ophthalmologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doing his residency.</v>

2311
01:48:24.930 --> 01:48:29.930
<v Speaker 3>He was sitting on the toilet eating food</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of a tray and he fell asleep as </v>

2312
01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:31.830
<v Speaker 3>buzzer went off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's shitting,</v>

2313
01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:36.980
<v Speaker 3>eating and sleeping at the same time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>as buzzer goes off to tell them to go </v>

2314
01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:39.330
<v Speaker 3>back to work because he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in your residency,</v>

2315
01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:41.730
<v Speaker 3>you do these insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane hours,</v>

2316
01:48:41.731 --> 01:48:44.920
<v Speaker 3>like they're just mindblowing and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're studying and you just,</v>

2317
01:48:45.250 --> 01:48:48.120
<v Speaker 3>it's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The amount of sleep that they get versus</v>

2318
01:48:48.121 --> 01:48:52.800
<v Speaker 3>the amount of work that they have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how nobody just that people</v>

2319
01:48:52.801 --> 01:48:55.920
<v Speaker 3>don't constantly accidentally kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because they're all so tired.</v>

2320
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:58.890
<v Speaker 3>Like it's the weirdest thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctors and I don't know how they still,</v>

2321
01:48:58.891 --> 01:49:01.350
<v Speaker 3>if they still do it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way they used to do it,</v>

2322
01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:02.100
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

2323
01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:05.820
<v Speaker 3>They would make them work these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ungodly hours and you would.</v>

2324
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:10.830
<v Speaker 3>You would always be exhausted and so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would think you'd want to be wide awake </v>

2325
01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:11.670
<v Speaker 3>and thinking clearly to make medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions,</v>

2326
01:49:11.671 --> 01:49:13.560
<v Speaker 3>especially about people's vision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2327
01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.420
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have these fucking guys.</v>

2328
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:20.600
<v Speaker 3>They make them work insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane hours and the other one was my </v>

2329
01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:20.970
<v Speaker 3>friend jumped ship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>junk Chang.</v>

2330
01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:26.180
<v Speaker 3>He was a US national taekwondo champion </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he came from my same gym and he was </v>

2331
01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:28.890
<v Speaker 3>the guy who won the championships while </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in medical school.</v>

2332
01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:31.050
<v Speaker 3>This fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to talk about?</v>

2333
01:49:31.051 --> 01:49:34.530
<v Speaker 3>A guy who worked hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never met anybody who worked harder,</v>

2334
01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:37.050
<v Speaker 3>complained less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got so little sleep.</v>

2335
01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:42.080
<v Speaker 3>If he slept like four hours a night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was planning and he's training for </v>

2336
01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:44.580
<v Speaker 3>the national taekwondo team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fucking guy used to do studying and</v>

2337
01:49:44.581 --> 01:49:49.581
<v Speaker 3>in between studying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would sprint up the stairs and his </v>

2338
01:49:49.581 --> 01:49:51.270
<v Speaker 3>university and come back down and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>sprint and they would do that like image</v>

2339
01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:54.940
<v Speaker 3>who we'd like read or do his work for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of hours and then he would sprint</v>

2340
01:49:54.941 --> 01:49:57.220
<v Speaker 3>upstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put his backpack through all his books,</v>

2341
01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:02.240
<v Speaker 3>his back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put his backpack on sprint up the </v>

2342
01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:02.240
<v Speaker 3>stairs.</v>

2343
01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just did every waking moment dedicated </v>

2344
01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:07.000
<v Speaker 3>to all the shit that he had to get done </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he came from a Korean background</v>

2345
01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:11.340
<v Speaker 3>and Korean parents are super.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them super strict about their,</v>

2346
01:50:11.341 --> 01:50:16.341
<v Speaker 3>their children succeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His father just put all this incredible </v>

2347
01:50:16.341 --> 01:50:16.430
<v Speaker 3>pressure on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I would think like people say,</v>

2348
01:50:16.431 --> 01:50:17.250
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you work so hard.</v>

2349
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I barely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sleep eight hours a night.</v>

2350
01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Like these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve and junk to guys incidentally that</v>

<v Speaker 3>I never saw anybody work harder.</v>

2354
01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything in my life like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2355
01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.160
<v Speaker 3>There would be exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like jumped ship would come in.</v>

2356
01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Who come in and training and his mouth </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be open like this.</v>

2357
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:40.600
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2358
01:50:40.601 --> 01:50:45.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm so fucking tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so fucking tired within training </v>

2359
01:50:45.601 --> 01:50:45.601
<v Speaker 3>with star at this fucking guy.</v>

2360
01:50:46.190 --> 01:50:49.180
<v Speaker 3>He would fire up and get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2361
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:54.390
<v Speaker 3>He would fire up and just start kicking </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit out of people and he wasn't </v>

2362
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:56.750
<v Speaker 3>even like a talented guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't like physically talented.</v>

2363
01:50:56.751 --> 01:51:01.751
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't like some Lebron James,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some unusual freak specimen of </v>

2364
01:51:01.751 --> 01:51:03.850
<v Speaker 3>athleticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just working five foot five,</v>

2365
01:51:03.851 --> 01:51:08.260
<v Speaker 3>five foot six Korean kid who just didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>take no for an answer,</v>

2366
01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:13.320
<v Speaker 3>just didn't fucking take no for an </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer and figured out how to win the </v>

2367
01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.050
<v Speaker 3>national title while he was in fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>medical school.</v>

2368
01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:16.330
<v Speaker 3>So whenever I was around people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

2369
01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:17.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would say,</v>

2370
01:51:17.801 --> 01:51:18.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work hard.</v>

2371
01:51:18.761 --> 01:51:19.900
<v Speaker 3>I work too fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2372
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that you should work the </v>

2373
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.350
<v Speaker 3>way those guys did because I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should.</v>

2374
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:26.500
<v Speaker 3>I think that's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a point of like,</v>

2375
01:51:26.530 --> 01:51:29.620
<v Speaker 3>you can overtrain and fighters </v>
<v Speaker 3>overtraining and workout too hard.</v>

2376
01:51:29.621 --> 01:51:31.300
<v Speaker 3>They come into the fight and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhausted.</v>

2377
01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.860
<v Speaker 3>They just never recovered from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>

2378
01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:35.260
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2379
01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:38.230
<v Speaker 3>there's something admirable about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to do what they did.</v>

2380
01:51:38.231 --> 01:51:43.231
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't think you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should work that hard </v>

2381
01:51:43.231 --> 01:51:43.231
<v Speaker 3>because I think you could kill yourself.</v>

2382
01:51:43.231 --> 01:51:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody should get a taste of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>

2383
01:51:43.981 --> 01:51:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Just know that Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fucking soft.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We were talking about this before,</v>

2386
01:51:51.691 --> 01:51:56.691

<v Speaker 1>took it to a park when that Taulia and </v>

<v Speaker 1>why he was when I got locked up at 27.</v>

2425
01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Before that I was asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleep three hours here on a couch in </v>

2426
01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:40.120
<v Speaker 1>between coke rocks and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there was no sleep apnea machine.</v>

2428
01:53:43.101 --> 01:53:44.090
<v Speaker 1>You just roughed it out.</v>

2429
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now people are wanting to do this </v>

2430
01:53:49.090 --> 01:53:49.090
<v Speaker 1>shit my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to put in the fucking hours.</v>

2431
01:53:49.090 --> 01:53:53.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read the rolling stone article and </v>

2432
01:53:53.650 --> 01:53:54.890
<v Speaker 1>then showed you put in the hours Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan and showed a lot.</v>

2433
01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:56.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read that article and I'm like,</v>

2434
01:53:56.301 --> 01:53:59.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a beautiful article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was many ways.</v>

2435
01:53:59.241 --> 01:54:04.241
<v Speaker 1>It didn't show the reasons why I loved </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and that's because of your work </v>

2436
01:54:04.241 --> 01:54:04.241
<v Speaker 1>ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2437
01:54:04.241 --> 01:54:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I thought that when you moved to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>

2438
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:07.130
<v Speaker 1>because when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I got here,</v>

2439
01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:08.990
<v Speaker 1>when you moved to this town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a TV show,</v>

2440
01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:12.200
<v Speaker 1>you stopped going to the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the impression I got.</v>

2441
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:15.500
<v Speaker 1>He started working harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started working on it,</v>

2442
01:54:15.501 --> 01:54:17.690
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I got it from.</v>

2443
01:54:17.691 --> 01:54:19.100
<v Speaker 1>I finally realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2444
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:22.100
<v Speaker 1>When you call down to the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to call him coast to coast.</v>

2445
01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:25.940
<v Speaker 1>You got to call him Sunday to Sunday and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to see what end.</v>

2446
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:28.670
<v Speaker 1>If it's five nights a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make times we leave the store at three</v>

2447
01:54:28.671 --> 01:54:29.450
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:31.600
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's</v>

2449
01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:36.600
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be willing to do those </v>

2450
01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.221
<v Speaker 3>nonpaid regular spots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys don't want to do is </v>

2451
01:54:38.221 --> 01:54:41.221
<v Speaker 3>nonpaid regular spots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to show up and wait and that's </v>

2452
01:54:41.221 --> 01:54:44.341
<v Speaker 3>how I got passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the main reasons why Mitzi </v>

2453
01:54:44.341 --> 01:54:44.341
<v Speaker 3>pass me two main reasons.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to help you.</v>

2459
01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:56.230
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2460
01:54:56.530 --> 01:55:01.530

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't have $15.</v>

2621
02:01:49.791 --> 02:01:54.791
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about doing something with these </v>

2622
02:01:54.791 --> 02:01:57.821
<v Speaker 1>young guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these young guys looking at you </v>

2623
02:01:57.821 --> 02:01:57.821
<v Speaker 1>differently and letting them know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2624
02:01:57.821 --> 02:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I ain't no better than you and someday </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be way better than me.</v>

2625
02:02:00.801 --> 02:02:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I just watched this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you're a writer,</v>

2626

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a bad motherfucker.</v>

2627
02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>That has made me a way better comic than</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing open mics and throw him because </v>

2628
02:02:10.881 --> 02:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>now I see it from a different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love comedy.</v>

2629
02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:18.640
<v Speaker 1>I love watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like watching the young guys at </v>

2630
02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:21.521
<v Speaker 1>the store at some fucking goofy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole attitude at that place feels </v>

2631
02:02:22.791 --> 02:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2632

<v Speaker 1>I think that's the Internet.</v>

2634
02:02:27.230 --> 02:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the crop of guys that were coming </v>

2635
02:02:32.230 --> 02:02:35.381
<v Speaker 1>in the new crop over the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're coming in for the right reasons.</v>

2636

<v Speaker 1>I love you with all my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're making it sound too good.</v>

2637

<v Speaker 1>They got rid of the shit heads up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2640
02:02:46.190 --> 02:02:48.980
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got rid of the pure shit up there.</v>

2641
02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Your shit take came into that store and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then no longer there.</v>

<v Speaker 5>tricks.</v>

2765
02:08:26.290 --> 02:08:31.290

<v Speaker 5>I did a little show on fisherman's </v>

2766
02:08:31.290 --> 02:08:31.290
<v Speaker 5>wharf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did it a couple of times.</v>

2767
02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:36.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would just set up a box and then </v>

2768
02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:36.620
<v Speaker 5>people give me money and I'd go buy a </v>
<v Speaker 5>comic books.</v>

2769
02:08:36.890 --> 02:08:40.360
<v Speaker 5>But I did it one time and he's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>older kids fucked with me.</v>

2770
02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:44.650
<v Speaker 5>They of like gave me a hard time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got scared.</v>

2771
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:49.890
<v Speaker 5>So I stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just mocked me and were goofing on </v>

2772
02:08:49.890 --> 02:08:49.890
<v Speaker 5>me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2773
02:08:49.890 --> 02:08:51.940
<v Speaker 5>well I can do here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like,</v>

2774
02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:52.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight,</v>

2775
02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:55.720
<v Speaker 5>they're probably like young teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 13 or something like that.</v>

2776
02:08:55.721 --> 02:08:57.520
<v Speaker 5>And they were mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was like,</v>

2777
02:08:57.550 --> 02:09:00.250
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got scared and stopped doing it.</v>

2778
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:03.240
<v Speaker 5>But it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a weird thing too.</v>

2779
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:05.530
<v Speaker 5>If nobody tells you that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>perform,</v>

2780
02:09:05.710 --> 02:09:07.930
<v Speaker 5>I would go there and I've watched these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people put on shows.</v>

2781
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:13.310
<v Speaker 5>They had all kinds of different shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People just like do like street </v>

2782
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.420
<v Speaker 5>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

2783
02:09:13.421 --> 02:09:14.380
<v Speaker 5>I'll try this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

2784
02:09:14.381 --> 02:09:16.390
<v Speaker 5>I got my magic trick thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a hat,</v>

2785
02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:19.600
<v Speaker 5>little magic hat I a cape by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight.</v>

2786
02:09:19.770 --> 02:09:21.970
<v Speaker 5>That's a ridiculous set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this fucking thing.</v>

2787
02:09:22.330 --> 02:09:27.330
<v Speaker 5>So terrible magic tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>awful at it.</v>

2788
02:09:27.730 --> 02:09:32.730
<v Speaker 5>But just banking on the fact that I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>cute helping people getting to with the </v>

2789
02:09:32.730 --> 02:09:33.430
<v Speaker 5>bowl and you put it in a little while </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I got,</v>

2790
02:09:33.930 --> 02:09:36.580
<v Speaker 5>I gave up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't do that shit.</v>

2791
02:09:36.610 --> 02:09:37.420
<v Speaker 5>It was tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>

2792
02:09:37.421 --> 02:09:41.800
<v Speaker 5>I appreciate magic if it's his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his Schubert's magic.</v>

2793
02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:45.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was bomb ass wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like I,</v>

2794
02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:48.820
<v Speaker 5>you could tell he was a little sloppy </v>
<v Speaker 5>but his magic was legit.</v>

2795
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:53.830
<v Speaker 5>Like it was to the point where he had </v>
<v Speaker 5>four cards down there and we saw just </v>

2796
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:58.561
<v Speaker 5>saw like one second ago what cards they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were and then he would turn them over </v>

2797
02:09:58.561 --> 02:09:58.561
<v Speaker 5>like in front of us going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

2798
02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:00.520
<v Speaker 5>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How'd you do that?</v>

2799
02:10:00.570 --> 02:10:02.140
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's magic was legit.</v>

2800
02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:04.810
<v Speaker 5>Gabriel's Christmas party yet magician </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2801
02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:07.450

<v Speaker 5>Those baby backwards was strongest.</v>

2804

<v Speaker 5>Magician came and he showed me and Steve</v>
<v Speaker 5>Simone on the card.</v>

2805
02:10:19.210 --> 02:10:24.210
<v Speaker 5>You got to get up on that microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He showed me and Steve Simone the card </v>

2806
02:10:24.210 --> 02:10:25.390
<v Speaker 5>and then he went like this and he did </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

2807
02:10:25.930 --> 02:10:28.510
<v Speaker 5>He told the lady over there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take out your sleeve,</v>

2808
02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:30.870
<v Speaker 5>the car who was in a fucking sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2809
02:10:30.871 --> 02:10:33.040
<v Speaker 5>I can't figure out what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck this.</v>

<v Speaker 5>She worked for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just know that some fucking manager or </v>

02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:38.740
<v Speaker 5>something stupid.</v>

2812
02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:40.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how the hell they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how they do it.</v>

2813
02:10:40.521 --> 02:10:43.640
<v Speaker 5>There's some craziness going on with </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of these magicians.</v>

2814
02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:47.390
<v Speaker 5>The sleight of hand and the way they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They figured out how to set things up.</v>

2815
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:48.890
<v Speaker 5>It's an art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an art.</v>

2816
02:10:48.891 --> 02:10:50.690
<v Speaker 5>They don't tell you either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to tell you.</v>

2817
02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:53.090
<v Speaker 5>We had a guy out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He bend a spoon in front of us.</v>

2818
02:10:53.091 --> 02:10:53.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2819
02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:56.040
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck is this guy doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's bending a spoon with like,</v>

2820
02:10:56.090 --> 02:11:01.090
<v Speaker 5>the air is like moving his finger around</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and the spoon starts to bend and </v>

2821
02:11:01.090 --> 02:11:01.880
<v Speaker 5>twist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know how the fuck he's doing.</v>

2822
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:04.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how he's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

2823
02:11:04.770 --> 02:11:06.710
<v Speaker 5>he's letting you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's a trick to it.</v>

2824
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:11.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to tell you how I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just a trick and they've </v>

2825
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:13.730
<v Speaker 5>figured out how to do it in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 5>your eyes don't catch.</v>

2826
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:19.000
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of the movements they</v>
<v Speaker 5>do when they're shuffling the deck and </v>

2827
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.150
<v Speaker 5>moving cards around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like your eyes just are not catching the</v>

2828
02:11:20.151 --> 02:11:21.130
<v Speaker 5>fluidity of their movement.</v>

2829
02:11:21.130 --> 02:11:26.130
<v Speaker 5>They get so good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can just hide the cards and you </v>

2830
02:11:26.130 --> 02:11:26.130
<v Speaker 5>don't even see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2831
02:11:26.130 --> 02:11:26.130
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

2832
02:11:26.130 --> 02:11:26.990

<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden the cars on top</v>

2833
02:11:26.991 --> 02:11:28.670
<v Speaker 5>of his hat and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You didn't see it.</v>

2835

<v Speaker 5>You ever see a good pick pocket though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2836
02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:35.230

<v Speaker 5>It's not impersonal.</v>

2837
02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:40.330
<v Speaker 5>When you play pool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you ever see people pick pocket of </v>

2838
02:11:40.330 --> 02:11:40.330

<v Speaker 5>They bump into you.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2940
02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.140
<v Speaker 4>but there's a transgender they use so</v>

02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:35.020
<v Speaker 5>they don't have to look at it like they </v>
<v Speaker 5>might've had the operation or they might</v>

2942
02:16:35.201 --> 02:16:40.201
<v Speaker 5>never get the operation.</v>

02:17:12.610 --> 02:17:13.900
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how does that work?</v>

2955
02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:15.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2956
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:17.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure what's going on here.</v>

2957
02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:19.300
<v Speaker 5>You say she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2958
02:17:19.301 --> 02:17:21.460
<v Speaker 5>you have a Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're allowed to.</v>

2959
02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:23.410
<v Speaker 5>You're just allowed to be whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>

2960
02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:26.530
<v Speaker 5>If you're a girl that Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then that's that.</v>

2961
02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:32.260
<v Speaker 5>It's just confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy for me to even comprehend </v>

2962
02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:35.560
<v Speaker 5>like I don't fucking know what they even</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking whatever what everybody wants to</v>

2963
02:17:35.561 --> 02:17:36.400
<v Speaker 5>do yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2964
02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:38.350
<v Speaker 5>it was very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was trying.</v>

2965
02:17:38.410 --> 02:17:40.180
<v Speaker 5>She did the whole operation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was a comic.</v>

2966
02:17:40.570 --> 02:17:42.730
<v Speaker 5>I told you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem was I head was too big.</v>

2967
02:17:42.910 --> 02:17:46.750
<v Speaker 5>So that's what you fuck up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That if you make the transgender,</v>

2968
02:17:46.751 --> 02:17:51.751
<v Speaker 5>they cut your Dick and they do all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other things and that your feelings </v>

2969
02:17:51.751 --> 02:17:51.751
<v Speaker 5>changed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but your head remains the same.</v>

2970
02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:55.510
<v Speaker 5>So her balance was off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not kidding you.</v>

2971
02:17:55.540 --> 02:18:00.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm not lying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I named was something that was too big </v>

2972
02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:00.540
<v Speaker 5>for her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was happy.</v>

2973
02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:02.330
<v Speaker 5>She was half Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have some Rita,</v>

2974
02:18:02.331 --> 02:18:03.850
<v Speaker 5>Rita.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Rita.</v>

2975
02:18:03.851 --> 02:18:04.690
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2976
02:18:04.691 --> 02:18:08.230
<v Speaker 5>She was reading the whole whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she ended up dying because she would</v>

2977
02:18:08.231 --> 02:18:13.231
<v Speaker 5>fall back because the head was too </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking big.</v>

2978
02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:19.090
<v Speaker 5>I remember that story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only one I really had,</v>

2979
02:18:19.091 --> 02:18:20.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>remember the one we met in Vegas?</v>

2980
02:18:21.250 --> 02:18:26.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one we met in Vegas where she kept </v>

2981
02:18:26.250 --> 02:18:26.250
<v Speaker 5>showing it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2982
02:18:26.250 --> 02:18:26.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We didn't even know.</v>

2983
02:18:26.650 --> 02:18:28.720
<v Speaker 5>She was so tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was so tiny.</v>

2984
02:18:28.721 --> 02:18:30.430
<v Speaker 5>You would never suspect that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She used to be a dude.</v>

2985
02:18:32.090 --> 02:18:35.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how old women are always at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

2986
02:18:35.710 --> 02:18:40.710
<v Speaker 5>On the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting a picture with Santa Claus was </v>

2987
02:18:40.710 --> 02:18:41.450
<v Speaker 5>these young girls with tight pants on </v>
<v Speaker 5>and heels and I'm like,</v>

2988
02:18:41.530 --> 02:18:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Terry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why these women taking pictures of Santa</v>

2989
02:18:44.050 --> 02:18:45.550
<v Speaker 5>Claus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tyrese women.</v>

2990
02:18:45.551 --> 02:18:49.420
<v Speaker 5>Those are 15 year old fucking girls that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were women and I don't know.</v>

2991
02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:51.370
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't fucking tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't tell man.</v>

2992
02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:56.880
<v Speaker 5>Jared said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who Do you think that?</v>

2993
02:18:57.630 --> 02:19:00.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do we just not remember it right?</v>

2994
02:19:00.550 --> 02:19:03.200
<v Speaker 5>Or do girls look different now when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're 15 and they didn't?</v>

2995
02:19:03.210 --> 02:19:05.340
<v Speaker 5>We're 15.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you sure though?</v>

2996
02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:08.260
<v Speaker 5>Because they're now showing site boob </v>
<v Speaker 5>and like,</v>

2997
02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:10.660
<v Speaker 5>like at young ages they didn't see that </v>
<v Speaker 5>girl.</v>

2998
02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:13.660
<v Speaker 5>Some girls had bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even back then,</v>

2999
02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.570
<v Speaker 5>like you remember in high school girls </v>
<v Speaker 5>had boobs.</v>

3000
02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:17.770
<v Speaker 5>Girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there was,</v>

3001
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:20.380
<v Speaker 5>there was girls that were 15 that had </v>
<v Speaker 5>boobs for sure,</v>

3002
02:19:20.410 --> 02:19:25.410
<v Speaker 5>but they were also wearing underwear and</v>
<v Speaker 5>using a Hitachi's and looking at porn,</v>

3003
02:19:25.661 --> 02:19:27.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were like art.</v>

3004
02:19:27.710 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 5>When we</v>

3005
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:29.960
<v Speaker 1>grew up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls were like,</v>

3006
02:19:30.170 --> 02:19:33.260
<v Speaker 1>if they just look different physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3007
02:19:33.470 --> 02:19:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Like do the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they,</v>

3008
02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:37.370
<v Speaker 1>are they more mature early?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they look like women earlier?</v>

3009
02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it just the way they're dressing </v>

3010
02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:42.400
<v Speaker 1>confused?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't lie to you,</v>

3011
02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:42.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

3012
02:19:42.861 --> 02:19:45.050
<v Speaker 1>when I was 18 I didn't dig 18 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

3013
02:19:45.470 --> 02:19:47.840
<v Speaker 1>so when I was 27 I didn't think young </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

3014
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:50.270
<v Speaker 1>they just make me nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make me physically now.</v>

3015
02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I just started getting comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why I go on the back of the </v>

3016
02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:57.230
<v Speaker 1>ship by the waitresses is because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always feel embarrassed.</v>

3017
02:19:57.231 --> 02:20:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I want everybody's eyes on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want no misunderstandings.</v>

3018
02:20:00.531 --> 02:20:01.970
<v Speaker 1>That fucking I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3019
02:20:02.130 --> 02:20:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate when I always listened when I was</v>

3020
02:20:04.671 --> 02:20:08.150
<v Speaker 1>20 and I go to a bar and I was slowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having a good time.</v>

3021
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd see a 30 year old want the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get fucking pissed.</v>

3022
02:20:11.310 --> 02:20:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Like little punk ass bitch at a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too old guy gone,</v>

3023
02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nevermind a 40 or 50 year old.</v>

3024
02:20:17.451 --> 02:20:20.070
<v Speaker 1>My blood pressure really goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was like fucking 20th.</v>

3025
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:23.960
<v Speaker 1>I saw a 50 year old dancing on a disco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my fucking.</v>

3026
02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Why is he here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3027
02:20:25.641 --> 02:20:30.641
<v Speaker 1>Why I couldn't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stayed with me for the rest of my </v>

3028
02:20:30.641 --> 02:20:32.030
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I got to be 27,</v>

3029
02:20:32.390 --> 02:20:34.460
<v Speaker 1>I already felt out of place in most </v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

3030
02:20:34.461 --> 02:20:39.461
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people looking at me like I made </v>

3031
02:20:39.461 --> 02:20:39.461
<v Speaker 1>to do something bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind now.</v>

3032
02:20:39.461 --> 02:20:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And you've got these young comics like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey and they'd come and hug you and I'm</v>

3033
02:20:41.631 --> 02:20:42.830
<v Speaker 1>fucking lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3034
02:20:43.130 --> 02:20:44.120
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

3035
02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I just feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel too old at the store.</v>

3036
02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I feel old at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>

3037
02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Like a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just go,</v>

3038
02:20:51.350 --> 02:20:53.420
<v Speaker 1>that's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit on the freezer.</v>

3039
02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't bother nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you feel like that?</v>

3040
02:20:55.970 --> 02:20:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

3041
02:20:57.621 --> 02:21:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Because I was about to sit that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 20.</v>

3042
02:21:00.890 --> 02:21:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different thing now.</v>

3043
02:21:02.271 --> 02:21:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like when you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a nice group of people that we</v>

3044
02:21:06.261 --> 02:21:09.090
<v Speaker 1>all know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all love waitstaff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I comics those people at all my home.</v>

3046
02:21:14.660 --> 02:21:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Why would you feel like you're too old </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hang around with?</v>

3047
02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes I'm driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The waitresses will come out and go,</v>

3048
02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:23.330
<v Speaker 1>can you give me a ride up the hill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they make the witches puddle the</v>

<v Speaker 1>way park all the way up and help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>crest hill all the way up.</v>

3050

<v Speaker 1>they walked down and I'll drive the </v>

3051
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:33.220

<v Speaker 1>Like when they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give you a ride home,</v>

3055
02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:47.300

<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I get leaving.</v>

3056

02:22:09.050 --> 02:22:10.880
<v Speaker 1>with Eddie when we went down at his </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's just so weird.</v>

3088
02:23:03.151 --> 02:23:05.670
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know what a 14 year old looks</v>
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

3089
02:23:05.671 --> 02:23:06.720
<v Speaker 5>We're supposed to look like.</v>

3090
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:08.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>

3091
02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:12.450
<v Speaker 5>Don't accurately remember what it looked</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when I was 14 compared to what they</v>

3092
02:23:12.451 --> 02:23:17.451
<v Speaker 5>look like today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure their bodies were </v>

3093
02:23:17.451 --> 02:23:19.611
<v Speaker 5>exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're just seeing more of it because </v>

3094
02:23:19.611 --> 02:23:19.950
<v Speaker 5>we're seeing sluts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look like porn stars nowadays.</v>

3095
02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:24.980
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at 14 where that wasn't the case back </v>

3096
02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:24.980
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3098
02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:29.390

<v Speaker 5>influence where they're like the pop </v>

3099
02:23:29.390 --> 02:23:30.150
<v Speaker 5>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the Nicki Minaj.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's all the whole thing.</v>

3107
02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:54.000
<v Speaker 5>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a gang of them.</v>

3113
02:24:05.730 --> 02:24:07.950
<v Speaker 5>I read the article by her fucking hot </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other day.</v>

3114
02:24:08.430 --> 02:24:10.800
<v Speaker 5>She was making a million dollars an hour</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>

3115
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:13.650
<v Speaker 5>I can't be mad at her man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She'd made it.</v>

3116
02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:16.470
<v Speaker 5>That's the American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How can I be mad at that?</v>

3117
02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:19.290
<v Speaker 5>How can I be mad at that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She found her niche.</v>

3118
02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:22.400
<v Speaker 5>She showed her pussy one time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She hasn't showed us anymore.</v>

3119
02:24:22.410 --> 02:24:24.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like she shows up once every three </v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks.</v>

3120
02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:29.720
<v Speaker 5>She made a tape and she found a window.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A little fucking window though.</v>

3121
02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:32.250
<v Speaker 5>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do I want to hang out with her and Kanye</v>

<v Speaker 5>I with those people.</v>

3124
02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:37.770
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's give credit where credit is due,</v>

3125
02:24:37.771 --> 02:24:38.640
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3126
02:24:38.641 --> 02:24:43.580
<v Speaker 5>she's the best ever at reality TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That family is the best ever.</v>

3127
02:24:43.581 --> 02:24:48.581
<v Speaker 5>At reality TV,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they figured out how to corner the </v>

3128
02:24:48.581 --> 02:24:49.560
<v Speaker 5>market to lock it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every scandal makes the show better.</v>

3129
02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:54.800
<v Speaker 5>Like just some people that did reality </v>
<v Speaker 5>TV and they got pretty famous like John </v>

3130
02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:54.800
<v Speaker 5>and kate plus eight.</v>

3131
02:24:56.470 --> 02:25:00.550
<v Speaker 5>Justin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about one chick test?</v>

3132
02:25:00.570 --> 02:25:04.650
<v Speaker 5>A black boyfriend and he fucked the </v>
<v Speaker 5>transvestite and they got back together.</v>

3133
02:25:04.651 --> 02:25:06.330
<v Speaker 5>She's one of the girls or something like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3134
02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:08.850
<v Speaker 5>but there's a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the John and kate plus eight,</v>

3135
02:25:08.851 --> 02:25:10.690
<v Speaker 5>they were giant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a giant show.</v>

3136
02:25:10.691 --> 02:25:13.080
<v Speaker 5>It was like all over the news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a Christian magazines.</v>

3137
02:25:13.090 --> 02:25:15.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had artificial intimidation and she</v>

3138
02:25:15.661 --> 02:25:18.990
<v Speaker 5>had fucking six babies inside of her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was insane.</v>

3139
02:25:19.350 --> 02:25:20.920
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they broke up and they.</v>

3140
02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:24.040
<v Speaker 5>They didn't survive the scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but these people,</v>

3141
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.280
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter who they married,</v>

3142
02:25:27.410 --> 02:25:32.410
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter who gets divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter who decides they're a </v>

3143
02:25:32.410 --> 02:25:35.191
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter who decides there a man </v>

3144
02:25:35.191 --> 02:25:35.320
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the show keeps going.</v>

3145
02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:39.550
<v Speaker 3>They figured out a way that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right frequency of editing,</v>

3146
02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:44.760
<v Speaker 3>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like real relatable drama and people </v>

3147
02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:44.760
<v Speaker 3>that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3148
02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:49.261
<v Speaker 3>they look good and they squeeze it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>together in this crazy semi fake show or</v>

3149
02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:53.740
<v Speaker 3>it's not really a reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can call it a reality show,</v>

3150
02:25:53.890 --> 02:25:55.930
<v Speaker 3>but they set up every scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obvious.</v>

3151
02:25:55.931 --> 02:26:00.931
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like semi scripted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is weird show and these people,</v>

3152
02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:06.720
<v Speaker 3>they're just famous for being famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wakes up in the morning and she </v>

3153
02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:10.190
<v Speaker 3>looks sort of thing and she'll ask like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's trending on what?</v>

3154
02:26:10.570 --> 02:26:13.060
<v Speaker 3>Who's trending?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronda Rousey watch this,</v>

3155
02:26:13.330 --> 02:26:16.150

<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>

3156
02:26:16.151 --> 02:26:19.990
<v Speaker 3>she goes to trend number one on google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're trending number one on Google,</v>

3157
02:26:19.991 --> 02:26:24.991
<v Speaker 3>you're selling shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's selling blouses and had dudes and </v>

<v Speaker 3>with a double edged razor and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm the fucking it up and it's funny.</v>

3165
02:26:55.710 --> 02:26:57.590
<v Speaker 3>You don't think there's anything that </v>

<v Speaker 3>kill.</v>

3171
02:27:10.361 --> 02:27:12.080
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to think.</v>

3172

<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>

3179
02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:31.770
<v Speaker 3>So as most shit that's on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never watched it.</v>

3180
02:27:33.090 --> 02:27:38.090
<v Speaker 3>I think they set up tomorrow and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>said that they sent the bad plus that he</v>

3181
02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:40.530
<v Speaker 3>went in there.</v>

3182
02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:43.700
<v Speaker 3>I think he couldn't handle the pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hola ma?</v>

3183
02:27:43.870 --> 02:27:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they freak out.</v>

3184
02:27:46.210 --> 02:27:47.770
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went after a photographer,</v>

3185
02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:52.600
<v Speaker 3>mother-in-law cutting his deal and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>got laker tickets.</v>

3186
02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Season tickets for the rest of her life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

3187
02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:58.060
<v Speaker 3>That's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She cut though.</v>

3188
02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:00.100
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3189
02:28:00.101 --> 02:28:02.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it ain't a good show,</v>

3190
02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:07.780
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not something I want to spend my </v>

3191
02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:07.780
<v Speaker 3>time watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why?</v>

3192
02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Why you so mad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked it 10 times on the road.</v>

3193
02:28:08.330 --> 02:28:12.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not entertaining and she doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>amuse.</v>

3194
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:17.590
<v Speaker 3>But here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it like more offensive when </v>

3195
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:20.290
<v Speaker 3>something's not entertaining and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote reality,</v>

3196
02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:23.510
<v Speaker 3>like semi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does that bother us?</v>

3197
02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a show where you're making shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>up entirely,</v>

3198
02:28:26.390 --> 02:28:30.140
<v Speaker 3>it's totally scripted and it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't bother you that there's a lot of</v>

3199
02:28:30.141 --> 02:28:31.640
<v Speaker 3>shows that suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of like,</v>

3200
02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:34.760
<v Speaker 3>our dramas are fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried to watch and be like,</v>

3201
02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:36.410
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this shit?</v>

3202
02:28:36.890 --> 02:28:39.350
<v Speaker 3>But he doesn't offend you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't get you angry.</v>

3203
02:28:39.650 --> 02:28:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Like he will see that show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the reality air quotes about </v>

3204
02:28:44.650 --> 02:28:46.280
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although the nonsense and you're like,</v>

3205
02:28:46.281 --> 02:28:48.230
<v Speaker 3>why isn't anybody watching this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

3206
02:28:48.290 --> 02:28:51.410
<v Speaker 3>So they get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get mad at that show,</v>

3207
02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:53.060
<v Speaker 3>but they don't get mad at scripted </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>

3208
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:56.090
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange just because those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are being themselves.</v>

3209
02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:57.380
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>

3210
02:28:57.500 --> 02:28:59.870
<v Speaker 3>And said they're real people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Sorta,</v>

3211
02:28:59.871 --> 02:29:01.340
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3212
02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:04.940
<v Speaker 3>it's all characatures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real people doing fake shit.</v>

3213
02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>

3214
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:08.960
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why do we care?</v>

3215
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:13.990
<v Speaker 3>But we do get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get upset because they're not doing </v>

3216
02:29:13.990 --> 02:29:13.990
<v Speaker 3>anything special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>

3217
02:29:13.990 --> 02:29:17.951
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should go see Cirque du Soleil and </v>

3218
02:29:17.951 --> 02:29:19.991
<v Speaker 3>they're doing handstands with one hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there got someone standing on their </v>

3219
02:29:19.991 --> 02:29:23.861
<v Speaker 3>feet doing a handstand on this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like three people and they're </v>

3220
02:29:23.861 --> 02:29:25.070
<v Speaker 3>stacked and they all look shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like superheroes,</v>

3221
02:29:25.071 --> 02:29:27.770
<v Speaker 3>like Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He watched them flip through the air and</v>

3222
02:29:27.771 --> 02:29:29.690
<v Speaker 3>catch each other and do all that crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

3223
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:34.460
<v Speaker 3>It's undeniable that they put a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of work into achieving this.</v>

3224
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:39.970
<v Speaker 3>When you watch these people just be </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and make more money than </v>

3225
02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:41.120
<v Speaker 3>anybody who's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't see</v>

3226
02:29:41.290 --> 02:29:43.830
<v Speaker 4>seem to care anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I mean look at the.</v>

3227
02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:45.560
<v Speaker 4>You have all the youtube stars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

3228
02:29:45.561 --> 02:29:50.561
<v Speaker 4>they're just mindless people talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>that half of the time they don't have </v>

3229
02:29:50.561 --> 02:29:51.310
<v Speaker 4>any talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just like pretty much rehab,</v>

3230
02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:56.520
<v Speaker 4>hashing people's jokes or ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts and making tons of money and </v>

3231
02:29:56.801 --> 02:29:59.770
<v Speaker 4>youtube branding them as their youtube </v>
<v Speaker 4>stars,</v>

3232
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:05.070
<v Speaker 4>but like that's really popular and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of like a Kurdish </v>

3233
02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:05.070
<v Speaker 4>Kardashian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it's,</v>

3234
02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:05.980
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fake shit.</v>

3235
02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:07.510
<v Speaker 4>People doing fake shit.</v>

3236
02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:09.830
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long has that show been on TV?</v>

3237
02:30:09.831 --> 02:30:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm on going on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been around forever.</v>

3238
02:30:12.940 --> 02:30:17.940
<v Speaker 3>They're going to go back to the history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to find out that it was </v>

3239
02:30:17.940 --> 02:30:18.320
<v Speaker 3>never not on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is actually like they used to do it</v>

3240
02:30:18.321 --> 02:30:23.321
<v Speaker 3>by fire and what is shadow shows back in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking 16 hundreds to make a year.</v>

3241
02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds of millions of dollars </v>

3242
02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:29.020
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie knows for sure,</v>

3243
02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:33.730
<v Speaker 3>but what my point is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a demonic show and it's </v>

3244
02:30:33.730 --> 02:30:37.031
<v Speaker 3>probably been here since the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 3>of time and we just pretend we get </v>

3245
02:30:37.031 --> 02:30:38.000
<v Speaker 3>sucked into a trance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just started like a few years ago.</v>

3246
02:30:38.001 --> 02:30:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't remember.</v>

3247
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:42.110
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like twilight zone episodes will realize</v>

3248
02:30:42.111 --> 02:30:43.910
<v Speaker 3>one day it's always been here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

3249
02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:49.540
<v Speaker 3>that show's always been here and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>start remembering yourself as a child,</v>

3250
02:30:49.941 --> 02:30:51.950
<v Speaker 3>waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at your crib and keeping up with</v>

3251
02:30:51.951 --> 02:30:56.951
<v Speaker 3>the Kardashians on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even make any sense because </v>

3252
02:30:56.951 --> 02:30:59.620
<v Speaker 3>from a totally different era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you remember it throw your whole </v>

3253
02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:02.591
<v Speaker 3>life when no one was around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keeping up with the Kardashians was on </v>

3254
02:31:02.591 --> 02:31:02.870
<v Speaker 3>some fucking strange phantom channel out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3255
02:31:02.871 --> 02:31:04.370
<v Speaker 3>You just had to figure out how to tune </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in.</v>

3256
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:07.180
<v Speaker 3>It's always been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey always been.</v>

3257
02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:09.680
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>

3258
02:31:10.380 --> 02:31:11.600
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3259
02:31:11.601 --> 02:31:13.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm high as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that.</v>

3260
02:31:13.641 --> 02:31:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Even the guy with the $52 million.</v>

3261
02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ has a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looks odd.</v>

3262
02:31:27.080 --> 02:31:32.080
<v Speaker 3>That is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look different.</v>

3263
02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she still looks beautiful.</v>

3264
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Still Beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gorgeous woman.</v>

3265

<v Speaker 3>No doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got damn beautiful.</v>

3269
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:52.670
<v Speaker 3>Let's just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need to stare at this poor </v>

3270
02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.670
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What's to love her,</v>

3273
02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:56.640
<v Speaker 3>but she doesn't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3274
02:31:56.670 --> 02:31:57.870

<v Speaker 3>That guy's driven like he's.</v>

3282
02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:16.620
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain types of driven,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's got that superstar type drive.</v>

3285

<v Speaker 3>Those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always have problems with.</v>

3286
02:32:24.241 --> 02:32:26.940
<v Speaker 3>People are always mad at someone always </v>
<v Speaker 3>math oppressed,</v>

3287
02:32:27.050 --> 02:32:32.050
<v Speaker 3>mad at this guy or that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just these bundles of fury and </v>

3288
02:32:32.050 --> 02:32:36.110
<v Speaker 3>inspiration and ideas and they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't always manage it correctly and </v>

3289
02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:38.680
<v Speaker 3>that's why he came out with that song </v>
<v Speaker 3>about assholes and douchebags.</v>

3290
02:32:38.730 --> 02:32:41.430

<v Speaker 3>after he did the Taylor swift thing?</v>

3291

<v Speaker 3>Let's hear it for the assholes.</v>

3521
02:42:52.881 --> 02:42:53.830
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was there,</v>

3522
02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:58.960
<v Speaker 5>the lifestyle choice for the men who </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't go for the married with kids </v>

3523
02:42:58.960 --> 02:42:59.050
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't go for the marriage,</v>

3524
02:42:59.051 --> 02:43:04.051
<v Speaker 5>but there's like these people that felt </v>
<v Speaker 5>like they were on the outside and they </v>

3525
02:43:04.051 --> 02:43:06.771
<v Speaker 5>will all get together in these pool </v>
<v Speaker 5>halls and they would just do what men </v>

3526
02:43:06.771 --> 02:43:07.170
<v Speaker 5>wanted to really do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want to hang out late and drink and</v>

3527
02:43:07.171 --> 02:43:12.171
<v Speaker 5>gamble and do drugs and play cards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what these places always </v>

3528
02:43:12.171 --> 02:43:12.171
<v Speaker 5>worked for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These guys,</v>

3529
02:43:12.171 --> 02:43:14.380
<v Speaker 3>it's like a refuge from the regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3530
02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Like you can exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not be as profitable.</v>

3531
02:43:17.771 --> 02:43:19.420
<v Speaker 3>You might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least it will be fun.</v>

3532
02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:24.870
<v Speaker 3>So they all just get together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was like the bachelor </v>

3533
02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:26.830
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle of the early 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

3534
02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:28.680
<v Speaker 3>I gotta ask you something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you covering next week?</v>

3535
02:43:28.690 --> 02:43:30.790
<v Speaker 3>Fight or know which one's next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Degas.</v>

3536
02:43:31.090 --> 02:43:31.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3537
02:43:31.841 --> 02:43:34.230
<v Speaker 3>The one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second Robbie lawler versus fuck.</v>

3538
02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:37.000
<v Speaker 3>He was getting the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you were like,</v>

3539
02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:37.980
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing a show.</v>

3540
02:43:37.981 --> 02:43:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not doing a comedy show.</v>

3541
02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I T I can't do the caught theater that </v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

3542
02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:43.450
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3543
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:47.800
<v Speaker 3>we just sold it out like two weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't to take time off.</v>

3544
02:43:47.830 --> 02:43:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No I didn't.</v>

3545
02:43:48.540 --> 02:43:53.540
<v Speaker 3>That's why I asked you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never even mentioned they want to do </v>

3546
02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:53.540
<v Speaker 3>it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think I need.</v>

3547
02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:57.450
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the people are transient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of these people are the same </v>

3548
02:43:57.450 --> 02:43:57.450
<v Speaker 3>people that keep coming over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

3549
02:43:57.450 --> 02:44:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Like Vegas is a such a hotspot now for </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup and for,</v>

3550
02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:01.790
<v Speaker 3>for fights rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3551
02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:06.840
<v Speaker 3>people coming from everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I feel like I gotta come up with at </v>

3552
02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:09.760
<v Speaker 3>least some new material I would even go </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when they asked you to sound too</v>

3553
02:44:09.761 --> 02:44:14.761
<v Speaker 3>enthusiastic about something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe he's not even going into the </v>

3554
02:44:14.761 --> 02:44:14.761
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3555
02:44:14.761 --> 02:44:14.761
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

3556
02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:17.170
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't talk to me about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

3557
02:44:17.171 --> 02:44:20.500
<v Speaker 3>if he didn't think I was a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you right now.</v>

3558
02:44:20.501 --> 02:44:21.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a good card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3559
02:44:22.170 --> 02:44:25.330
<v Speaker 3>the big fight of course is Carlos condit</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus Robbie lawler.</v>

3560
02:44:25.331 --> 02:44:27.760
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes that flight so interesting is that</v>

3561
02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Robbie lawler is not known to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>people down.</v>

3562
02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:33.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's taken out so few people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in his life.</v>

3563
02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:38.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of a single submission </v>

3564
02:44:38.460 --> 02:44:38.460
<v Speaker 3>that he's attempted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3565
02:44:38.460 --> 02:44:42.871
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he has attempted to submission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't recall one because all </v>

3566
02:44:42.871 --> 02:44:46.500
<v Speaker 3>Robbie lawler's fight Robbie lawler </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to knock you into another </v>

3567
02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:47.680
<v Speaker 3>dimension until the fights go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fights go ding.</v>

3568
02:44:47.681 --> 02:44:49.420
<v Speaker 3>Here he comes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck,</v>

3569
02:44:49.690 --> 02:44:54.690
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the difference between Robbie and </v>

3570
02:44:54.690 --> 02:44:57.961
<v Speaker 3>all the guys that Carlos has had </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with in the past is that those </v>

3571
02:44:57.961 --> 02:45:01.351
<v Speaker 3>guys kept taking Carlos down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't know if Robbie will </v>

3572
02:45:01.351 --> 02:45:04.081
<v Speaker 3>incorporate that kind of strategy just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he knows it's been effective in </v>

3573
02:45:04.081 --> 02:45:05.530
<v Speaker 3>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>GSP had good effect with Johny Hendricks</v>

3574
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:10.830
<v Speaker 3>had a good result with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guys who managed to take Carlos </v>

3575
02:45:10.830 --> 02:45:12.610
<v Speaker 3>down and smother him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are guys who have some pretty good</v>

3576
02:45:12.611 --> 02:45:14.770
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robbie lawler has good.</v>

3577
02:45:14.771 --> 02:45:19.771
<v Speaker 3>Success is just smashing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just a fucking awesome striking </v>

3578
02:45:19.771 --> 02:45:19.771
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

3579
02:45:19.771 --> 02:45:20.860
<v Speaker 3>And such a tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

3580
02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:24.400
<v Speaker 3>his mentality like the bulldog in him as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 100 percent,</v>

3581
02:45:24.430 --> 02:45:27.040
<v Speaker 3>that guy has zero quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but neither does conduct.</v>

3582
02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:32.280
<v Speaker 3>We conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a little bit more sneaky ways to </v>

3583
02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:32.280
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's really good at submission.</v>

3584
02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:34.900
<v Speaker 3>It's very good off of his back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good at capitalizing on moments.</v>

3585
02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:37.150
<v Speaker 3>And he also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can kick box too.</v>

3586
02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:39.880
<v Speaker 3>And he's real slick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throws all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

3587
02:45:39.990 --> 02:45:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Step in elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of shit that you don't </v>

3588
02:45:44.990 --> 02:45:45.300
<v Speaker 3>predict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking flying knees last time.</v>

3589
02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:47.230
<v Speaker 3>Think about it like he's a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

3590
02:45:47.310 --> 02:45:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that college.</v>

3591
02:45:49.380 --> 02:45:54.380
<v Speaker 3>And so I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I tell you what I liked the most </v>

3592
02:45:54.380 --> 02:45:54.380
<v Speaker 3>about Carlos condit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This corner,</v>

3593
02:45:54.380 --> 02:45:56.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know who rob is trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>is our data att,</v>

3594
02:45:56.890 --> 02:46:01.650
<v Speaker 3>but they have an excellent game plan </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you fight for winkle,</v>

3595
02:46:01.651 --> 02:46:02.800
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3596
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:08.190
<v Speaker 3>You go in there with such a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't see it till the Holly Holm </v>

3597
02:46:08.190 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I learned with game is to</v>

3598
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:10.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holly Holm fight.</v>

3599
02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:15.880
<v Speaker 5>Then I put together Jim John Jones </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights and I basically thought the most </v>

3600
02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:19.751
<v Speaker 5>about him against Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how he fought the as they always have a </v>

3601
02:46:19.751 --> 02:46:23.771
<v Speaker 5>great game plan winkle John Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's how good you stick to it and </v>

3602
02:46:23.841 --> 02:46:25.790
<v Speaker 5>against Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This motherfucker stuck through it.</v>

3603
02:46:25.791 --> 02:46:28.130
<v Speaker 5>That's why you snuck out that victory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3604
02:46:28.131 --> 02:46:29.750
<v Speaker 5>if he sticks to the game plan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

3605
02:46:29.751 --> 02:46:34.751
<v Speaker 5>They always have a great game and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>review it and review it and review it </v>

3606
02:46:34.751 --> 02:46:37.220
<v Speaker 5>and review it and review it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why Holly Holm did what she did.</v>

3607
02:46:37.490 --> 02:46:40.700
<v Speaker 5>Even when Rhonda went to Shit on her </v>
<v Speaker 5>that she would usually get.</v>

3608
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:43.430
<v Speaker 5>They knew her instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They knew what A.</v>

3609
02:46:43.431 --> 02:46:48.431
<v Speaker 5>I forget what that word is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They knew what she was going to do and </v>

3610
02:46:48.431 --> 02:46:48.431
<v Speaker 5>they worked at and drilled and drilled </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3611
02:46:48.431 --> 02:46:50.570
<v Speaker 5>She kept her hips low.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those little things.</v>

3612
02:46:50.571 --> 02:46:51.440
<v Speaker 5>I really don't know.</v>

3613
02:46:51.650 --> 02:46:55.770
<v Speaker 5>I just saw a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy from George St Pierre Camp break</v>

3614
02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:59.840
<v Speaker 5>down the video and I thought about it as</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hobby and I go,</v>

3615
02:46:59.841 --> 02:47:02.660
<v Speaker 5>you know why she did that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they went over it and they had a</v>

3616
02:47:02.661 --> 02:47:06.620
<v Speaker 5>game plan and they knew what her </v>
<v Speaker 5>tendency was going to be and they worked</v>

3617
02:47:06.621 --> 02:47:11.621
<v Speaker 5>on the anti tendency and I thought back </v>
<v Speaker 5>to his fight and I thought back to like </v>

3618
02:47:11.621 --> 02:47:13.640
<v Speaker 5>maybe three or fucking John,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jim,</v>

3619
02:47:13.650 --> 02:47:14.870
<v Speaker 5>John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jim Jones,</v>

3620
02:47:15.140 --> 02:47:19.070
<v Speaker 5>John Jones fights and I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I like about that camp.</v>

3621
02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:24.130
<v Speaker 5>I've always liked that they really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I'm not saying I like </v>

3622
02:47:24.130 --> 02:47:25.730
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying in this particular file,</v>

3623
02:47:25.731 --> 02:47:27.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying it's a very competitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

3624
02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:28.150
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3625
02:47:28.151 --> 02:47:28.370
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3626
02:47:28.371 --> 02:47:30.230
<v Speaker 5>It's a great competitive fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would think.</v>

3627
02:47:30.231 --> 02:47:33.500
<v Speaker 5>The real questions are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is Robbie gonna follow that game plan or</v>

3628
02:47:33.501 --> 02:47:37.760
<v Speaker 5>is he going to try to take Carlos down </v>
<v Speaker 5>if he decides to try to take Carlos down</v>

3629
02:47:37.761 --> 02:47:39.500
<v Speaker 5>just to fuck with them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to mix it up.</v>

3630
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:42.260
<v Speaker 5>It could be very interesting if they </v>
<v Speaker 5>both just stand up.</v>

3631
02:47:42.261 --> 02:47:44.930
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will be a crazy war I lost.</v>

3632
02:47:44.931 --> 02:47:45.500
<v Speaker 5>Give me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3633
02:47:45.501 --> 02:47:48.440
<v Speaker 5>check this guy's fucking cry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys have crazy power,</v>

3634
02:47:48.441 --> 02:47:49.030
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm.</v>

3635
02:47:49.180 --> 02:47:52.470
<v Speaker 5>I wonder who's going to try to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something sneaky because Robbie,</v>

3636
02:47:52.471 --> 02:47:55.220
<v Speaker 5>he's like not a sneaky fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's super skillful,</v>

3637
02:47:55.250 --> 02:47:56.990
<v Speaker 5>very tough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just aggressive,</v>

3638
02:47:56.991 --> 02:48:01.991
<v Speaker 5>but you know what's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas guys will mix things up and do </v>

3639
02:48:01.991 --> 02:48:04.100
<v Speaker 5>things different and George St Pierre is</v>
<v Speaker 5>a perfect example.</v>

3640
02:48:04.310 --> 02:48:09.310
<v Speaker 5>He always had like a game plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was always real sneaky mixing things </v>

3641
02:48:09.310 --> 02:48:10.040
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was one of the most effective aspects</v>

3642
02:48:10.041 --> 02:48:11.600
<v Speaker 5>of his game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't know if it's going to take you</v>

3643
02:48:11.601 --> 02:48:16.601
<v Speaker 5>down or stand with you so you're always </v>
<v Speaker 5>tense and always worried about what's </v>

3644
02:48:16.601 --> 02:48:16.601
<v Speaker 5>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he would shoot and be.</v>

3645
02:48:16.601 --> 02:48:18.530
<v Speaker 5>You'd be on your back and you've eaten </v>
<v Speaker 5>elbow sandwiches.</v>

3646
02:48:18.830 --> 02:48:23.830
<v Speaker 5>So Robert is not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Robbie is like a straightforward come </v>

3647
02:48:23.830 --> 02:48:23.830
<v Speaker 5>towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smart.</v>

3648
02:48:23.830 --> 02:48:26.960
<v Speaker 5>Smart with his movement and his angles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very hard to take down but determined to</v>

3649
02:48:26.961 --> 02:48:30.200
<v Speaker 5>stand and smash it so Carlos won't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>to worry.</v>

3650
02:48:30.201 --> 02:48:33.690
<v Speaker 5>Fucking hits hard though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking truck dogs.</v>

3651
02:48:34.260 --> 02:48:35.450
<v Speaker 5>That's a big part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3652
02:48:35.451 --> 02:48:37.250
<v Speaker 5>he's got so much confidence in his </v>
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>

3653
02:48:37.450 --> 02:48:42.450
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you watched that fight with Melvin </v>

3654
02:48:42.450 --> 02:48:42.450
<v Speaker 5>manhoef,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's getting his ass kicked.</v>

3655
02:48:42.450 --> 02:48:45.551
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Melvin manhoef is kicking the shit out </v>

3656
02:48:45.551 --> 02:48:47.501
<v Speaker 5>of his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Robbie lawler uncorked with all </v>

3657
02:48:47.501 --> 02:48:48.500
<v Speaker 5>fucking bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one punch,</v>

3658
02:48:48.501 --> 02:48:52.280
<v Speaker 5>one haymaker on the jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Melvin's whole body stiffens up like</v>

3659
02:48:52.281 --> 02:48:57.281
<v Speaker 5>he got tasered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He falls to the ground and Robbie </v>

3660
02:48:57.281 --> 02:49:01.091
<v Speaker 5>smashes him again when he's down and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just one of the most brutal one </v>

3661
02:49:01.091 --> 02:49:01.520
<v Speaker 5>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>knockout power,</v>

3662
02:49:01.850 --> 02:49:04.820
<v Speaker 5>not power punches in all of MMA and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's.</v>

3663
02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:07.040
<v Speaker 5>He's always trying to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every punch is trying to do.</v>

3664
02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:08.010
<v Speaker 5>It's just trying to just</v>

3665
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:10.890
<v Speaker 3>knock you in another dimension and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows he can do it.</v>

3666
02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:13.800
<v Speaker 3>He's just got to hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just write and conduct can do it too.</v>

3667
02:49:13.801 --> 02:49:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conduct knocks.</v>

3668
02:49:14.731 --> 02:49:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Dude's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to have the Dan Hardee fight.</v>

3669
02:49:18.001 --> 02:49:23.001
<v Speaker 3>When he caught damn nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left hook or the stun gun fight that </v>

3670
02:49:23.001 --> 02:49:24.810
<v Speaker 3>flying knee to the face or the Tiago </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alvarez fight,</v>

3671
02:49:24.811 --> 02:49:27.750
<v Speaker 3>he smashed in with that step in elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's real tricky.</v>

3672
02:49:27.870 --> 02:49:29.340
<v Speaker 3>He's got a bunch of different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>

3673
02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:34.670
<v Speaker 3>He's tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's long and it's real good off of his </v>

3674
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.670
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real sneaky off of his back.</v>

3675
02:49:34.830 --> 02:49:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Real good at attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he goes to the ground,</v>

3676
02:49:36.811 --> 02:49:38.850
<v Speaker 3>he's caught guys and arm bars and </v>
<v Speaker 3>triangles.</v>

3677
02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:40.320
<v Speaker 3>There's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3678
02:49:40.410 --> 02:49:42.420
<v Speaker 3>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting fight.</v>

3679
02:49:43.170 --> 02:49:48.170
<v Speaker 3>It's real interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Robbie decides to just only stand </v>

3680
02:49:48.170 --> 02:49:50.541
<v Speaker 3>with them because of Cabo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have to worry about the take </v>

3681
02:49:50.541 --> 02:49:51.170
<v Speaker 3>down as much you get to see a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 3>looseness to is,</v>

3682
02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:52.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>striking game.</v>

3683
02:49:52.990 --> 02:49:54.300
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be an easy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3684
02:49:54.390 --> 02:49:56.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask you something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to go see this movie?</v>

3685
02:49:56.911 --> 02:49:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Concussion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

3686
02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:01.410
<v Speaker 3>You really want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to want to say that.</v>

3687
02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:03.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the big fight on that card is.</v>

3688
02:50:03.091 --> 02:50:08.091
<v Speaker 3>Here's the fact that no one's talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Lorenz Larkin versus Albert to </v>

3689
02:50:08.091 --> 02:50:08.430
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

3690
02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:12.240
<v Speaker 3>are you fucking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That these guys are killers.</v>

3691
02:50:12.241 --> 02:50:17.241
<v Speaker 3>This is probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>underrated fights in the 170 pound </v>

3692
02:50:17.371 --> 02:50:19.710
<v Speaker 3>division right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a fight that everybody should be</v>

3693
02:50:19.711 --> 02:50:24.711
<v Speaker 3>talking about and if these guys had had </v>
<v Speaker 3>like more like a on air fights,</v>

3694
02:50:25.201 --> 02:50:27.650
<v Speaker 3>like especially Larkin at one 70 and two</v>
<v Speaker 3>minute off,</v>

3695
02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:31.680
<v Speaker 3>just fought our bore Allen Joe Ban and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just starched him.</v>

3696
02:50:32.010 --> 02:50:37.010
<v Speaker 3>He is nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His fucking striking is so fluid and </v>

3697
02:50:37.201 --> 02:50:42.201
<v Speaker 3>loose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His boxing his hands and Larkin is a </v>

3698
02:50:42.201 --> 02:50:42.201
<v Speaker 3>beast to.</v>

3699
02:50:42.201 --> 02:50:44.040
<v Speaker 3>That's a sick fight to really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

3700
02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:46.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a fight that people should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

3701
02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of people should be talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this right now and for whatever </v>

3702
02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:52.080
<v Speaker 3>reason it's just flown totally under the</v>
<v Speaker 3>radar.</v>

3703
02:50:52.350 --> 02:50:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Like I almost forgot it was even on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

3704
02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:58.230
<v Speaker 3>This car is just a good car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great card,</v>

3705
02:50:58.290 --> 02:51:01.260
<v Speaker 3>but nobody's really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the holidays,</v>

3706
02:51:01.261 --> 02:51:03.150
<v Speaker 3>they're confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

3707
02:51:03.810 --> 02:51:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's really saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is the,</v>

3708
02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:11.540
<v Speaker 3>here's another good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brand down or take a or take us Gracie </v>

3709
02:51:11.540 --> 02:51:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black belt and uh,</v>

3710
02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:15.410
<v Speaker 3>he's coming off a suspension for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ped.</v>

3711
02:51:15.930 --> 02:51:20.930
<v Speaker 3>He to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what these usually to juice you had </v>

3712
02:51:20.930 --> 02:51:23.070
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of the steroids and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

3713
02:51:23.310 --> 02:51:26.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this gave him a little suspension.</v>

3714
02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:29.110
<v Speaker 3>This Donald is Rory Macdonald.</v>

3715
02:51:31.310 --> 02:51:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3716
02:51:33.090 --> 02:51:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Michael Mcdonald returns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exciting.</v>

3717
02:51:35.580 --> 02:51:38.640
<v Speaker 3>He's been off for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A kid's been on for more than a year.</v>

3718
02:51:38.641 --> 02:51:41.970
<v Speaker 3>I believe he's fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kid's good.</v>

3719
02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:45.570
<v Speaker 3>He's got nasty power in his hands too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he looks like a small,</v>

3720
02:51:45.571 --> 02:51:47.910
<v Speaker 3>slightly built guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Mike,</v>

3721
02:51:47.970 --> 02:51:48.510
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

3722
02:51:48.511 --> 02:51:52.030
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that Diego Brandao and um,</v>

3723
02:51:52.140 --> 02:51:53.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Ortega fight.</v>

3724
02:51:53.431 --> 02:51:55.500
<v Speaker 3>That's a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I split real good fight.</v>

3725
02:51:55.950 --> 02:52:00.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why Ortega was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything when you might have had an </v>

3726
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:01.080
<v Speaker 3>injury is trying to recover from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of these guys,</v>

3727
02:52:01.081 --> 02:52:04.140
<v Speaker 3>they get caught with steroids and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is is um,</v>

3728
02:52:05.020 --> 02:52:06.970
<v Speaker 3>well a lot of these guys are just doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>

3729
02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:12.330
<v Speaker 3>but some of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get injured and they try to get </v>

3730
02:52:12.330 --> 02:52:12.330
<v Speaker 3>back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they take a chance to,</v>

3731
02:52:12.330 --> 02:52:12.820
<v Speaker 3>just a hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get tested.</v>

3732
02:52:12.850 --> 02:52:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try this for six weeks.</v>

3733
02:52:14.460 --> 02:52:19.460
<v Speaker 3>It'll be out of my system in six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but will ramp up my recovery by 30 </v>

3734
02:52:19.460 --> 02:52:19.870
<v Speaker 3>percent or more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they take,</v>

3735
02:52:19.871 --> 02:52:22.150
<v Speaker 3>they take the chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not giving them any excuses.</v>

3736
02:52:22.570 --> 02:52:23.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that was the case with </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

3737
02:52:23.861 --> 02:52:26.530
<v Speaker 3>but I just want to say with some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is definitely the case.</v>

3738
02:52:26.890 --> 02:52:29.530
<v Speaker 3>Steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steroids are real tricky man because for</v>

3739
02:52:29.531 --> 02:52:32.680
<v Speaker 3>the longest time they just been able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use them whenever anything was injured,</v>

3740
02:52:33.010 --> 02:52:35.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either you used it all the time,</v>

3741
02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:38.680
<v Speaker 3>like some guys certainly did or you used</v>
<v Speaker 3>it when you had injuries,</v>

3742
02:52:38.740 --> 02:52:40.570
<v Speaker 3>which is like a very reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach,</v>

3743
02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:43.840
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just fine,</v>

3744
02:52:43.841 --> 02:52:46.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>glace and Tbl just failed to tests.</v>

3745
02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One for.</v>

3746

3750
02:53:04.330 --> 02:53:09.330

<v Speaker 3>banned substances.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They've been doing it for a long time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the UFC hired,</v>

<v Speaker 3>couple times.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Show up whenever they want.</v>

3761
02:53:33.731 --> 02:53:35.770

<v Speaker 3>Novitsky,</v>

3762
02:53:35.771 --> 02:53:37.630
<v Speaker 3>sus suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something's wrong.</v>

3763
02:53:38.050 --> 02:53:41.290
<v Speaker 3>He thinks you're cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll just be up your ass with scope.</v>

3764
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Are they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they testing you in competition mode</v>

3765
02:53:46.870 --> 02:53:48.720
<v Speaker 3>or off season?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They doing everything.</v>

3766
02:53:48.780 --> 02:53:50.120
<v Speaker 3>They do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>October.</v>

3767
02:53:50.130 --> 02:53:52.130
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might show up.</v>

3768
02:53:53.050 --> 02:53:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what happened with vandelay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vandelay did not have a fight scheduled </v>

3769
02:53:58.050 --> 02:53:58.050
<v Speaker 3>and they just showed up to test him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

3770
02:53:58.050 --> 02:53:58.210
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3771
02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:04.080
<v Speaker 3>And he just ran out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but come trump vandelay has become </v>

3772
02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:08.251
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump of Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just says who's he going to smack in </v>

3773
02:54:08.251 --> 02:54:08.251
<v Speaker 3>the face yesterday?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3774
02:54:08.251 --> 02:54:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda sad what Jesus is asked every</v>

3775
02:54:16.450 --> 02:54:18.730
<v Speaker 3>fucking month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says terrible for vandelay.</v>

3776
02:54:19.150 --> 02:54:24.150
<v Speaker 3>I have a very conflicted about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel terrible for vandelay because I </v>

3777
02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:28.621
<v Speaker 3>was a vandelay Silva fan my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if I had to pick one fighter </v>

3778
02:54:28.621 --> 02:54:30.240
<v Speaker 3>that I'm like my most favorite guy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch fight,</v>

3779
02:54:30.241 --> 02:54:34.600
<v Speaker 3>it might be vandelay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's he's real close in his pride days,</v>

3780
02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:39.780
<v Speaker 3>he was just a fucking awesome spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was amazing and when they banned him </v>

3781
02:54:41.081 --> 02:54:46.081
<v Speaker 3>for life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that broke his heart and when </v>

3782
02:54:46.081 --> 02:54:48.271
<v Speaker 3>the UFC couldn't do anything about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's the Nevada state athletic </v>

3783
02:54:48.271 --> 02:54:49.030
<v Speaker 3>commission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to fight in court so he feels</v>

3784
02:54:49.031 --> 02:54:54.031
<v Speaker 3>abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the position is when </v>

3785
02:54:54.031 --> 02:54:55.480
<v Speaker 3>everybody's position that I know as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as like trainers,</v>

3786
02:54:56.260 --> 02:54:58.120
<v Speaker 3>commentators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters,</v>

3787
02:54:58.210 --> 02:55:00.670
<v Speaker 3>everyone across the board was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's outrageous.</v>

3788
02:55:00.710 --> 02:55:03.630
<v Speaker 3>But the guy didn't even fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even fail drug tests.</v>

3789
02:55:03.631 --> 02:55:06.020
<v Speaker 3>You get a banned him for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>

3790
02:55:06.350 --> 02:55:09.560
<v Speaker 3>And by all accounts vandelays one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nicest guys ever.</v>

3791
02:55:09.690 --> 02:55:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Like every time I met him he was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>super friendly.</v>

3792
02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know if the guy was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

3793
02:55:14.121 --> 02:55:17.180
<v Speaker 3>but I do know is there's a penalty if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got caught that penalty.</v>

3794
02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:18.680
<v Speaker 3>At the time it was only like nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

3795
02:55:19.010 --> 02:55:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Like how are you going to take a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if he did get caught,</v>

3796
02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:23.530
<v Speaker 3>you get a nine month penalty and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

3797
02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:25.850
<v Speaker 3>you're saying forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't ever make money.</v>

3798
02:55:26.030 --> 02:55:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Like that's cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a cruel way of conducting </v>

3799
02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:31.820
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't care about this guy,</v>

3800
02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:34.160
<v Speaker 3>this guy's a legend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sport,</v>

3801
02:55:34.340 --> 02:55:39.340
<v Speaker 3>like the reason why people come and pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that money and go to see fights and </v>

3802
02:55:39.340 --> 02:55:39.340
<v Speaker 3>use them.</v>

3803
02:55:39.340 --> 02:55:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Use their credit cards and buy beer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole revenue of the town.</v>

3804
02:55:42.890 --> 02:55:47.890
<v Speaker 3>It's because of the product and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>product is fighting and out of those </v>

3805
02:55:47.890 --> 02:55:52.181
<v Speaker 3>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vandelay was one of the most loved and </v>

3806
02:55:52.181 --> 02:55:53.760
<v Speaker 3>one of the most respected and revered </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter.</v>

3807
02:55:53.761 --> 02:55:58.761
<v Speaker 3>So people would come to see him like his</v>
<v Speaker 3>very presence with generate income and </v>

3808
02:55:58.791 --> 02:56:03.791
<v Speaker 3>for them to just not even take into </v>
<v Speaker 3>account that this guy was a legend and </v>

3809
02:56:03.951 --> 02:56:06.890
<v Speaker 3>just never failed before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ever.</v>

3810
02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Never failed a single drug test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden they cut his </v>

3811
02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:12.710
<v Speaker 3>career out from under him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lost his mind,</v>

3812
02:56:12.711 --> 02:56:12.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3813
02:56:12.820 --> 02:56:15.880
<v Speaker 1>He made them nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made people nervous.</v>

3814
02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:18.880
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just making people nervous,</v>

3815
02:56:18.881 --> 02:56:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

3816
02:56:20.810 --> 02:56:22.730
<v Speaker 3>he didn't do that until after he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>band.</v>

3817
02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:24.920
<v Speaker 3>He was a company man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

3818
02:56:24.921 --> 02:56:26.990
<v Speaker 3>but wasn't the handling vandelay was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>

3819
02:56:26.991 --> 02:56:27.290
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3820
02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that something happened during </v>

3821
02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:34.540
<v Speaker 1>the taping of that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3822
02:56:34.650 --> 02:56:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It didn't need to do something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coach somebody.</v>

3823
02:56:37.511 --> 02:56:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it all during that.</v>

3824
02:56:39.881 --> 02:56:44.881
<v Speaker 1>He was a little bit about what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't he do like the ultimate </v>

3825
02:56:44.881 --> 02:56:49.711
<v Speaker 1>fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so he coached somebody in doing </v>

3826
02:56:49.711 --> 02:56:50.940
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was having moments and I'm like him,</v>

3827
02:56:51.030 --> 02:56:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I think he's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3828
02:56:53.021 --> 02:56:58.021
<v Speaker 1>I watched all of the old footage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight he was involved in with </v>
