00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:10.704
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

51
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It's Goggins is the guy with their black shoes.</v>

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>The guy on the bottom.</v>

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Dustin Ortiz,</v>

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Justin Scoggins and Dustin Ortiz.</v>

56
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Dustin came out,</v>

57
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>pressure map,</v>

59
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.540

60
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 1>If you never heard this podcast before,</v>

61
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>this is what we call fight companion podcast.</v>

62
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:32.180
<v Speaker 1>What we do is we watched the fights live.</v>

63
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>We're watching the fights lights four 15 on the clock right now.</v>

64
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.211
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want to,</v>

65
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:36.044
<v Speaker 1>if you want to sync up.</v>

66
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

67
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.493
<v Speaker 1>we um,</v>

68
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I like how he scooted his hips up there.</v>

69
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>That was some expert shit.</v>

70
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

71
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:46.494
<v Speaker 1>it's sneaky.</v>

72
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 1>We do these podcasts while the fights are going live and we talk while the</v>

73
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>fights are happening and that's what we're doing right now.</v>

74
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Dustin Ortiz's on top.</v>

75
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Justin Scoggins is on the bottom.</v>

76
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Who came out with fight companion who let me know.</v>

77
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

78
00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Just happened.</v>

79
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.740
<v Speaker 1>It just kind of happened,</v>

80
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good way to call it.</v>

81
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of people,</v>

83
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>what they do is they watch this and they watch the fights at the same time.</v>

84
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.921
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing that,</v>

85
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>look at these kind of,</v>

86
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.530

87
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.110
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of a sneaky thing you can do,</v>

88
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

89
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Can you do?</v>

90
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.660

95
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.950

97
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.671
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>

98
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>He has put his foot on there.</v>

99
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.143
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty slick.</v>

100
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.391
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

101
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>that's slick.</v>

102
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.221
<v Speaker 1>Slick,</v>

103
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:26.140

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

116
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

117
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>He got out of that,</v>

118
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.670
<v Speaker 1>but keep an eye on that arm.</v>

119
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>That arm might be Jack Modified for sure.</v>

120
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.073
<v Speaker 1>Another word.</v>

121
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.933
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

124
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.800
<v Speaker 1>That arm for sure.</v>

125
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.410
<v Speaker 1>It's going to suck jerking off of that thing for the next couple of weeks.</v>

126
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.790
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to play the mystery,</v>

127
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

128
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>You have to use the left arm.</v>

129
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Doug.</v>

130
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get really weird.</v>

131
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>It was his left arm,</v>

132
00:02:58.551 --> 00:02:59.384
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

133
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

134
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh they hell.</v>

135
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.661
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

136
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>well wasn't it?</v>

137
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.191
<v Speaker 2>If he's left handed.</v>

138
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:03.381
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

139
00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>And then we'd have to go back over it again.</v>

140
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it was his left arm that he was attacking.</v>

141
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

142
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:08.061

143
00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:08.894
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Good role by Dustin.</v>

169
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Dustin looks like more of a wrestler and Scoggins does it has a lot more</v>

170
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.810
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] shoes yet.</v>

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.850
<v Speaker 2>So we're looking at is Dustin is not giving up man.</v>

172
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Motherfuckers on his back right now.</v>

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 2>So we just got back from Vegas to fights,</v>

176
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:04.674
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Look at this or teases getting Scoggins back.</v>

178
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Scoggins fighting off those hooks.</v>

179
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:13.031
<v Speaker 2>He's going to spin it.</v>

180
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 2>We'll get that.</v>

181
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.210
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

182
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 2>This is going to spin trying to hit that switch the cages in the way cage fucks</v>

183
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 2>you up a lot of times,</v>

184
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

185
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Cage really limits a lot of stuff.</v>

186
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 2>It can help you sometimes wait,</v>

187
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a ground and pound guy wrestler grounded pound.</v>

188
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a dream for you.</v>

189
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 2>But as a Jujitsu guy makes things tougher.</v>

190
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:34.291
<v Speaker 2>I think power Dustin or is a Duke Roufus has guy.</v>

307
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going for a crucifix here.</v>

308
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Someone almost got a crucifix this weekend.</v>

309
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it was.</v>

310
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Someone rolled into a crucifix.</v>

311
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Did the same thing.</v>

312
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Tied up one arm when my faves raw Drysdale got a rear naked choke.</v>

313
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>First round.</v>

314
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Did he really?</v>

315
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

316
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>First fight of the night.</v>

317
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Not Surprising.</v>

318
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Drysdales a monster.</v>

319
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.170
<v Speaker 1>All I know is I got to hang out with Dan Severn.</v>

320
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.303
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

321
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 1>the beast.</v>

322
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

323
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 1>He looks at his skin's better than anyone's in the bedroom.</v>

324
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Sat 56 years old.</v>

325
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't look better.</v>

326
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

327
00:08:05.111 --> 00:08:05.631
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

328
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:05.811
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

329
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Was he drinking fucking raw milk all day?</v>

330
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

331
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.123
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

332
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.423
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhere.</v>

333
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a muscular Freddie Mercury.</v>

334
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy too.</v>

335
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>He's got some great stories about the old wrestling days,</v>

336
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>international wrestling.</v>

337
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Louie this or tease roles,</v>

338
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Dustin over right in front of Rufus.</v>

339
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.430
<v Speaker 1>The other thing about having a coach like to crew is,</v>

340
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 1>is he's such a great guy that like he motivates you so much.</v>

341
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:31.290
<v Speaker 1>You want to fight well,</v>

342
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.500
<v Speaker 1>want to win for me.</v>

343
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

344
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>that's real man.</v>

345
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 1>You know guys talking about their relationships that they have with their</v>

346
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>trainers like that.</v>

347
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Me and Dwayne or time I had breakfast with Dwayne and and Vegas retirement that</v>

348
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.501
<v Speaker 1>him and Tj,</v>

349
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:43.350
<v Speaker 1>how close they are and oh,</v>

350
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 1>you're seen.</v>

351
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 1>For him it's cool because it's like he's living through Tj.</v>

352
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Like he wished he had himself as a coach when he's coming up.</v>

353
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>So for Tj it's cool that is dead is interesting.</v>

354
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Like it takes a lifetime to knowledge</v>

355
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of times by the time guys did their,</v>

356
00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 2>their bodies are worn out.</v>

357
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

358
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.110
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that a teacher had no time to bask in the championship.</v>

359
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.750
<v Speaker 2>He just got back right back into camp.</v>

360
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.613
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that.</v>

361
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Like after I was talking to Tj battle,</v>

362
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.290
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

363
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm right back in the canvas already,</v>

364
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:10.201
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

365
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 2>You just won the belt is yeah,</v>

366
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:12.781
<v Speaker 2>that's what they want,</v>

367
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:12.941
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

368
00:09:12.941 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

369
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.530
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

370
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:13.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

371
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:14.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

372
00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

373
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 2>it was supposed to be in Vegas.</v>

374
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be,</v>

375
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:17.911
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

376
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:18.481
<v Speaker 2>August.</v>

377
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 2>The late August show was supposed to be in Vegas and something happened.</v>

378
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 2>They decide to move it to a Sacramento because it's t J's hometown.</v>

379
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Good for Tj.</v>

380
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

381
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.491
<v Speaker 2>Great for Tj.</v>

382
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:34.491
<v Speaker 2>Terrible for brow because of the quick turnaround after a k o that's the only</v>

383
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:35.850
<v Speaker 2>thing that concerns me.</v>

384
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 2>But why rush it like this?</v>

385
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.311
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

386
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Browse camp wanted it.</v>

387
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 2>They wanted it right away.</v>

388
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:42.060
<v Speaker 2>They think it was a fluke.</v>

389
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

390
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.471
<v Speaker 2>no homie.</v>

391
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 2>A fluke is if you get hit right,</v>

392
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 2>like in the first round,</v>

393
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:46.291
<v Speaker 2>get knocked out.</v>

394
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:47.124
<v Speaker 2>That's a fluke.</v>

395
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

396
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't live rounds of a pure ass.</v>

397
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Wilbon is not a fluke.</v>

398
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 2>They think the five rounds came about because of the first round.</v>

399
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:54.201
<v Speaker 2>Cause he clipped him.</v>

400
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 2>He got dropped in the first round.</v>

401
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know where the fuck you was for the rest of the fight.</v>

402
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

403
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Like he went into the fifth round apparently,</v>

404
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 2>and he thought it was the third round.</v>

405
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:03.020
<v Speaker 2>He had no idea what was going on.</v>

406
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

407
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.261
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

408
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:04.791
<v Speaker 2>How that that,</v>

409
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:05.001
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

410
00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 2>that speaks to your point about having them fight that early though he needs</v>

411
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:09.294
<v Speaker 2>more time off.</v>

412
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:09.841
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

413
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:11.200
<v Speaker 2>That's a head trauma man.</v>

414
00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:11.641
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

415
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:11.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

416
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 2>those Brazilians are tough as nails,</v>

417
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:13.801
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

418
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 2>They want,</v>

419
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.143
<v Speaker 2>they want to kill them.</v>

420
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Falter,</v>

421
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.220
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

422
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

423
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Justin Ortiz is strong as fuck dude,</v>

424
00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:19.614
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

425
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile his pressures Coggins unbelievable.</v>

426
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Scoggins is like this kid that has a lot of hype behind him and justifiably,</v>

427
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 2>but I am blown away by Dustin Ortiz.</v>

428
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

429
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just the fact that he got out of that arm bar man.</v>

430
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Then our bar was fucking,</v>

431
00:10:34.731 --> 00:10:35.610
<v Speaker 2>it was his left arm.</v>

432
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 2>You're writing this on the replay was his left,</v>

433
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:37.600
<v Speaker 2>was it?</v>

434
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

435
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.813
<v Speaker 2>you're correct.</v>

436
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 2>So maybe jerks off lefty.</v>

437
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.210
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

438
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:43.930
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

439
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it makes it up.</v>

440
00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Could be ambidextrous.</v>

441
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just gets a cortisone shot so he could keep eating off.</v>

442
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:49.931

00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:53.524
<v Speaker 1>barnacles on it.</v>

592
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.311
<v Speaker 1>Just sitting there.</v>

593
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:54.861

00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:56.351
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

597
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:57.184
<v Speaker 1>He just looked like,</v>

598
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.833
<v Speaker 1>come back on us there.</v>

599
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Are we still recording?</v>

600
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

601
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.870
<v Speaker 1>We had a little computer issue.</v>

602
00:14:14.871 --> 00:14:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Lays in jail is,</v>

603
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.480
<v Speaker 1>are we still on Ustream?</v>

604
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

605
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

606
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

607
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:19.520
<v Speaker 1>We had a little issue.</v>

608
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:19.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

609
00:14:19.881 --> 00:14:20.211
<v Speaker 1>Dustin.</v>

610
00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Archie's with nice to left.</v>

611
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.330
<v Speaker 1>This is a great fucking fight.</v>

612
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:23.820
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

613
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.180
<v Speaker 1>this isn't.</v>

614
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

615
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.860
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about all sorts of shit from the past and Scoggins and Ortiz who</v>

616
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.390
<v Speaker 1>won a war on a crazy fight.</v>

617
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:29.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

618
00:14:29.721 --> 00:14:30.554
<v Speaker 1>back here.</v>

619
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 4>This is a great fight.</v>

620
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Scoggins takes him down again.</v>

621
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.121
<v Speaker 1>Hey Brendan.</v>

622
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for making me do a wheel kick in my genes this morning at 10 in the</v>

623
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:43.331
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

624
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:44.110
<v Speaker 1>That was a lot of fun.</v>

625
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.943
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a bunch of people,</v>

626
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 1>that was good for the man.</v>

627
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.400
<v Speaker 1>That was someone else's idea though.</v>

628
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.250
<v Speaker 1>That's real good.</v>

629
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I have to hold the thing we talked about.</v>

630
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.410
<v Speaker 1>What was good about it?</v>

631
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.573
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

632
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought Kendell Xian blows Asil out though.</v>

633
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

634
00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:58.364
<v Speaker 1>Zachary's jeans.</v>

635
00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Jeans are super.</v>

636
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.060
<v Speaker 1>How do you strike a,</v>

637
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>how often you throw kicks?</v>

638
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Like once a year.</v>

639
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I would say since I've been boxing,</v>

640
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I kicked the bag now,</v>

641
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:06.550
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

642
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 1>nothing like that.</v>

643
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't throw wheel kicks.</v>

644
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I had no business doing that.</v>

645
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.533
<v Speaker 1>Norm had norm.</v>

646
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

647
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Had An artichoke boy</v>

648
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 1>stuck in half guard though.</v>

649
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Very hard to finish from half card.</v>

650
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Do it for me.</v>

651
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 1>This Dustin rolls over.</v>

652
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

653
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Scoggins stays on him.</v>

654
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable fight.</v>

655
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 1>This is why I love little guys,</v>

656
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:25.731
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

657
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:26.070
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

658
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the transitions.</v>

659
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:27.611
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

660
00:15:27.611 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 1>You don't see heavyweights moving like this,</v>

661
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 1>which I was little.</v>

662
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to on the way here.</v>

663
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.071
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

664
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:34.730
<v Speaker 1>no you don't.</v>

665
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>It's good to be the king of the beach,</v>

666
00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

667
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I would care about the beach.</v>

668
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>The beach you say?</v>

669
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

670
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 1>He say that.</v>

671
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

672
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.740
<v Speaker 1>sitting next to you are wedged in,</v>

673
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 1>in those little seats on southwest.</v>

674
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I wish you were a smaller,</v>

675
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 1>have you ever thought about trying to go to two oh five yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

677
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:52.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

678
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about it before the end.</v>

679
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Towards the end of my career,</v>

680
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

681
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll do one cut to it.</v>

682
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

683
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:56.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

684
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.570
<v Speaker 1>like everyone seems to do that.</v>

685
00:15:58.571 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like the older phase of the guys,</v>

686
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 1>they didn't make the cut,</v>

687
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:01.970
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

688
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

689
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.493
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

690
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.740
<v Speaker 1>as right now I'm 250 pounds,</v>

691
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.480
<v Speaker 1>so that's a really tough cut.</v>

692
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Everyone always asks me that though.</v>

693
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>You're about to 30 fight week though,</v>

<v Speaker 1>A two 35.</v>

696
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So when you think about that,</v>

697
00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you're not watching your diet at all.</v>

698
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

699

<v Speaker 1>but you're not like,</v>

701

<v Speaker 1>think about some of the shit that some of these guys do.</v>

702
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.001
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well this is the difference.</v>

712
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those guys get crazy out of shape in between fights like crazy out of</v>

713
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:38.511
<v Speaker 1>shape.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't put on tons of weight.</v>

719
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Who puts on the most weight in between fights?</v>

<v Speaker 1>This fight is awesome.</v>

734
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.410
<v Speaker 1>We should really pay attention to this.</v>

735
00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

736

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 2>like while we're doing commentary,</v>

887
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 1>like I talked about it with Jimmy Smith,</v>

888
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.060
<v Speaker 1>last stuff.</v>

889
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I companion when you mother fuckers weren't around.</v>

890
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.933
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

891
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:59.990
<v Speaker 5>Doug Smith.</v>

892
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.781
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

893
00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

894
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Ian Mccall was,</v>

895
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.881
<v Speaker 1>I was on it too.</v>

896
00:21:02.881 --> 00:21:03.714
<v Speaker 1>It was really fun.</v>

897
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.020
<v Speaker 1>But Jimmy was talking about they make him score it Bella toward,</v>

898
00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:08.190
<v Speaker 1>they make them score the rounds.</v>

899
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:08.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

900
00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:09.000
<v Speaker 1>that's dope.</v>

901
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

902
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.710
<v Speaker 1>But they make them score the rounds.</v>

903
00:21:10.711 --> 00:21:10.821
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

904
00:21:10.821 --> 00:21:12.240
<v Speaker 1>He's doing commentary and I'm like,</v>

905
00:21:12.241 --> 00:21:12.481
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

906
00:21:12.481 --> 00:21:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

907
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.083
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it.</v>

908
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.373
<v Speaker 1>Me Personally,</v>

909
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I could do it,</v>

910
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to do it.</v>

911
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I say it during the pot during a broadcast,</v>

912
00:21:21.931 --> 00:21:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

913
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:22.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

914
00:21:22.891 --> 00:21:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I think this guy won the fight or one the rounds.</v>

915
00:21:25.261 --> 00:21:29.190
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is if you want to really call the fight correctly,</v>

916
00:21:29.191 --> 00:21:30.120
<v Speaker 1>you have to shut your mouth.</v>

917
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.240
<v Speaker 1>You're still scoring at boxing lives,</v>

918
00:21:32.241 --> 00:21:32.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

919
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean well it's a 10 point must system but it's,</v>

920
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:35.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

921
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.520
<v Speaker 1>it's really dumb because you're working within a flawed system.</v>

923
00:21:38.521 --> 00:21:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

924
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.680
<v Speaker 1>But the real problem with that flawed system is like a boxing wrap around in</v>

925
00:21:43.681 --> 00:21:45.810
<v Speaker 1>boxing it's three minutes and there's a bunch of them.</v>

926
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

927
00:21:46.141 --> 00:21:48.030
<v Speaker 1>regular fight is 10 rounds,</v>

928
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.200
<v Speaker 1>non title fights,</v>

929
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.921
<v Speaker 1>10 fuck around.</v>

930
00:21:49.921 --> 00:21:51.480
<v Speaker 1>It's tied to fight is 12 rounds.</v>

931
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:52.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

932
00:21:52.171 --> 00:21:53.160
<v Speaker 1>an MMA fight.</v>

933
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Big Difference.</v>

934
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Three rounds,</v>

935
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.640
<v Speaker 1>only three rounds.</v>

936
00:21:56.641 --> 00:22:00.990
<v Speaker 1>And there could be a ten nine round where one guy just beats the shit out of a</v>

937
00:22:00.991 --> 00:22:04.300
<v Speaker 1>guy and then another ten nine round where it's like a toss up.</v>

938
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.050
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense cause it sucks.</v>

939
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is a sports so new too well stole a system.</v>

940
00:22:11.071 --> 00:22:14.190
<v Speaker 1>We stole a of a judging system from boxing</v>

941
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.350
<v Speaker 1>because there just isn't a criteria for if somebody's keeping pressure on</v>

942
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.000
<v Speaker 1>holding position on somebody</v>

943
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.740
<v Speaker 5>take down,</v>

944
00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.551
<v Speaker 5>take down defense.</v>

945
00:22:22.551 --> 00:22:23.720
<v Speaker 5>How about takedown defense?</v>

946
00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.381
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

947
00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:25.910
<v Speaker 5>That should go along with how about submission?</v>

948
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.920
<v Speaker 5>Attempting temps.</v>

949
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

950
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.330
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff and there should be like us</v>

951
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.550
<v Speaker 1>gale of like one to 10 of how close to submission is like the,</v>

952
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:34.831
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

953
00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:37.080
<v Speaker 1>like look Scoggins and our perfect example.</v>

954
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.540
<v Speaker 1>That was a fucking nine that Armando was nine nine,</v>

955
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.101
<v Speaker 1>nine and a half.</v>

956
00:22:41.101 --> 00:22:43.770
<v Speaker 1>That was about as close as you can get to not getting tab.</v>

957
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.410
<v Speaker 5>You have to take that in consideration.</v>

958
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:45.591
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

959
00:22:45.591 --> 00:22:46.424

966
00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:58.080

00:24:00.411 --> 00:24:00.711
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1033
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:00.841
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1034
00:24:00.841 --> 00:24:03.500
<v Speaker 6>it's that sports guy radio bullshit.</v>

1035
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:08.060
<v Speaker 6>There's a certain amount of sports guy radio bullshit that's leaked into MMA.</v>

1036
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:08.781
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1037
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

1038
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 6>They think that they can be cool.</v>

1039
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.871
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1040
00:24:11.871 --> 00:24:13.800
<v Speaker 6>there's no repercussions there.</v>

1041
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.110
<v Speaker 6>You can talk to me however you want.</v>

1042
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:15.831
<v Speaker 6>I can't do anything.</v>

1043
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:16.664
<v Speaker 6>I'll get in trouble.</v>

1044
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 6>Obviously I'm not going to snap your neck.</v>

1045
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 6>I'd love to.</v>

1046
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:19.551
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to,</v>

1047
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 6>I can't do anything.</v>

1048
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:21.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1049
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.990
<v Speaker 6>Well even nine that it's just like,</v>

1050
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.430
<v Speaker 6>can't you talk about a fight without being disrespectful to the guy that was</v>

1051
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:29.150
<v Speaker 6>fighting?</v>

1052
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.360
<v Speaker 6>Like it seemed like you guys knew each other.</v>

1053
00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:34.010
<v Speaker 6>You were both very tentative.</v>

1054
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.440
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>

1055
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.410
<v Speaker 6>There was a lot on the line for both of you are lost.</v>

1056
00:24:36.411 --> 00:24:37.790
<v Speaker 6>You look particularly nervous.</v>

1057
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:38.420
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1058
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.350
<v Speaker 6>like what was,</v>

1059
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.840
<v Speaker 6>what was frustrating about the fight?</v>

1060
00:24:40.841 --> 00:24:42.650
<v Speaker 6>Do you could talk about a fight for sure.</v>

1061
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.250
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

1062
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.170
<v Speaker 6>anybody whose ever competed before,</v>

1063
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.870
<v Speaker 6>if you've had more than a few fights,</v>

1064
00:24:47.871 --> 00:24:50.240
<v Speaker 6>there's going to be some that are just go off.</v>

1065
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.500
<v Speaker 6>You might be sick,</v>

1066
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.670
<v Speaker 6>you might be injured,</v>

1067
00:24:52.671 --> 00:24:53.260
<v Speaker 6>you might,</v>

1068
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:53.630
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1069
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1070
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:54.510
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1071
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.770
<v Speaker 6>you can't think that every fight is going to be great.</v>

1072
00:24:57.771 --> 00:24:58.820
<v Speaker 6>They're just not going to be,</v>

1073
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.170
<v Speaker 6>you're going to have shitty ones.</v>

1074
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.010
<v Speaker 6>Things happened in like,</v>

1075
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 6>but the thing is when I talked to him,</v>

1076
00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:04.041
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1077
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:08.330
<v Speaker 6>Gabby on the AIO did that fight suck 100% should I have one?</v>

1078
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:08.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1079
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 6>Do I need to do things different?</v>

1080
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.850
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

1081
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:11.330
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>

1082
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 6>I was banking on just like I'm used to when I used to train with them an</v>

1083
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:16.640
<v Speaker 6>aggressive or Lassi,</v>

1084
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:17.040
<v Speaker 6>which I,</v>

1085
00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 6>I hate that we're talking about again,</v>

1086
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.831
<v Speaker 6>ally were just,</v>

1087
00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:19.460
<v Speaker 6>shit happens,</v>

1088
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.350
<v Speaker 6>but our last scheme would come forward,</v>

1089
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.220
<v Speaker 6>aggressive,</v>

1090
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.380
<v Speaker 6>so worked on and I'm a back foot counter fighter.</v>

1091
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.260
<v Speaker 6>It's how I get my takedown.</v>

1092
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.230
<v Speaker 6>It's my big combination stuff like that.</v>

1093
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.170
<v Speaker 6>So when he's not being aggressive and approaching,</v>

1094
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.160
<v Speaker 6>I should've adapt and I didn't.</v>

1095
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.920
<v Speaker 6>So you get a shitty fight and that's what happened.</v>

1096
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:35.530
<v Speaker 6>Straight up fight sucked.</v>

1097
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:36.201
<v Speaker 6>However,</v>

1098
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:36.920
<v Speaker 6>I won the fight.</v>

1099
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.671
<v Speaker 6>So this guy,</v>

1100
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:39.410
<v Speaker 6>when you were doing this interview,</v>

1101
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 6>was he like mocking you?</v>

1102
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:41.601
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1103
00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:43.550
<v Speaker 6>what was he doing that was pissing you off so much?</v>

1104
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:44.181
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1105
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:44.870
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

1106
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.231
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1107
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:45.590
<v Speaker 6>officer,</v>

1108
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.240
<v Speaker 6>I could take his job if I wanted to on,</v>

1109
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:47.401
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1110
00:25:47.401 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 6>I just destroyed him on air w with everything,</v>

1111
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:50.271
<v Speaker 6>fight,</v>

1112
00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:50.511
<v Speaker 6>talk,</v>

1113
00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:51.140
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

1114
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.350
<v Speaker 6>So he was a little defensive already and I'm like,</v>

1115
00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:54.501
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1116
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:55.261
<v Speaker 6>minute fight suck.</v>

1117
00:25:55.261 --> 00:25:56.990
<v Speaker 6>So it gave him a chance to jump in.</v>

1118
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.000
<v Speaker 6>A fight was terrible.</v>

1119
00:25:59.130 --> 00:25:59.280
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1120
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 6>so before that,</v>

1121
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:00.471
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1122
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:05.300
<v Speaker 6>so there was like a build up already where he was like kind of a like a little</v>

1123
00:26:05.301 --> 00:26:07.130
<v Speaker 6>bit and then I've been told him and then he was like,</v>

1124
00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:07.251
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1125
00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:07.770
<v Speaker 6>what's next for?</v>

1126
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.001
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

1127
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:08.201
<v Speaker 6>I haven't,</v>

1128
00:26:08.201 --> 00:26:10.430
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea man with this is a weird fight.</v>

1129
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.230
<v Speaker 6>You know what they're going to do with me?</v>

1130
00:26:12.231 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't know because technically I really,</v>

1131
00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:15.254
<v Speaker 6>I won the fight.</v>

1132
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:16.270
<v Speaker 6>They gave our last game,</v>

1133
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 6>main event against big foot.</v>

1134
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 6>So obviously they're not too mad at him.</v>

1135
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:20.391
<v Speaker 6>So with me,</v>

1136
00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:20.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>

1137
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:21.440
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

1138
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 6>who do you think I should fight?</v>

1139
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.583
<v Speaker 6>And he had,</v>

1140
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.250
<v Speaker 6>he had,</v>

1141
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.420
<v Speaker 6>he couldn't come up with anything.</v>

1142
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.283
<v Speaker 6>He had nothing.</v>

1143
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.960
<v Speaker 6>What did you think about this truth situation,</v>

1144
00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:30.111
<v Speaker 6>man?</v>

1145
00:26:30.111 --> 00:26:30.980
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of crazy.</v>

1146
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.310
<v Speaker 6>Math heartbroken.</v>

1147
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.530
<v Speaker 6>I was looking forward to that fight and honestly I think it was almost a,</v>

1148
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.480
<v Speaker 6>I don't say a blessing in disguise,</v>

1149
00:26:38.481 --> 00:26:40.700
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think she would have won that fight.</v>

1150
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.451
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

1151
00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:41.601
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

1152
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:42.081
<v Speaker 6>you're off.</v>

1153
00:26:42.081 --> 00:26:43.220
<v Speaker 6>I don't why?</v>

1154
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.063
<v Speaker 6>I don't at all.</v>

1155
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 5>And I think that the time away they wanted to give him more of a,</v>

1156
00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:49.440
<v Speaker 5>an easier fight.</v>

1157
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.330
<v Speaker 5>A guy where he could get his bearings back,</v>

1158
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 5>get used to the octagon and the lights.</v>

1159
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:54.001
<v Speaker 5>It's a different animal.</v>

1160
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:57.120
<v Speaker 5>And when you don't fight in while for those at your own calls him out</v>

1161
00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.340
<v Speaker 2>clean would have happened if you want to.</v>

1162
00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:00.551
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1163
00:27:00.551 --> 00:27:00.881
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

1164
00:27:00.881 --> 00:27:03.010
<v Speaker 2>You got this done for folks who don't know what happened.</v>

1165
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1166
00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Stephan struve is a really tall fighters foot</v>

1167
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.521
<v Speaker 2>skyscraper.</v>

1168
00:27:09.521 --> 00:27:10.960
<v Speaker 2>They call it jet seven feet.</v>

1169
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.710
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1170
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.100
<v Speaker 2>doing well in the UFC has some pretty big wins and then all of a sudden he has a</v>

1171
00:27:15.101 --> 00:27:15.911
<v Speaker 2>heart condition,</v>

1172
00:27:15.911 --> 00:27:16.840
<v Speaker 2>like a serious,</v>

1173
00:27:16.841 --> 00:27:18.070
<v Speaker 2>legit heart condition.</v>

1174
00:27:18.071 --> 00:27:19.900

<v Speaker 5>different.</v>

<v Speaker 5>A good question.</v>

1349
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.900
<v Speaker 5>It's a very good question.</v>

1350
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.280
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1351
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.680
<v Speaker 5>there's a dude is like the best pool player in the world who's deaf and when he</v>

1352
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:36.580
<v Speaker 5>plays pool with turns,</v>

1353

1355
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.120
<v Speaker 5>It goes into a zone and just fires.</v>

1356
00:31:42.121 --> 00:31:42.201
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

1357
00:31:42.201 --> 00:31:43.090
<v Speaker 5>that's an advantage</v>

1358
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.833
<v Speaker 5>to me.</v>

1359
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 5>So was saying with wrestlers at least like they can't hear themselves breathe,</v>

1360
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.270
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

1361
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.840
<v Speaker 5>which has deaf wrestlers because I never thought about it has good or bad</v>

1362
00:31:55.841 --> 00:31:58.700
<v Speaker 5>effects I guess a good effect in the terms of it's not,</v>

1363
00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.670
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't get freaked out.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1365
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.521
<v Speaker 5>Don't freak out.</v>

1366
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:04.780
<v Speaker 5>You don't know your fatigue on to something because when I listen to music and I</v>

1367
00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:05.614
<v Speaker 5>do conditioning,</v>

1368
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.060
<v Speaker 5>I'll just going to say the music,</v>

1369
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:07.991
<v Speaker 5>I take it off.</v>

1370
00:32:07.991 --> 00:32:08.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm all,</v>

1371
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:09.131
<v Speaker 5>Dang,</v>

00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:09.661
<v Speaker 5>I'm dry.</v>

1373
00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:10.361
<v Speaker 5>Even son,</v>

1374
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm about to pass out,</v>

1375
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 5>put the music back on.</v>

1376
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:12.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1377
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:12.781

00:32:12.781 --> 00:32:13.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm straight.</v>

1379
00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:14.590
<v Speaker 5>But when you're running,</v>

1380
00:32:14.591 --> 00:32:15.161
<v Speaker 5>listen to music,</v>

1381
00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:16.590
<v Speaker 5>you don't realize how tired you are.</v>

1382
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.830
<v Speaker 5>You just sweat and you feel good.</v>

1385
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:22.050
<v Speaker 5>when you have the music change.</v>

1386

<v Speaker 5>I've seen the clinical study where music does help your endurance,</v>

1392
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:31.643

1901
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:54.763
<v Speaker 2>Mercenaries.</v>

1902
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Who is the guy?</v>

1903
00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Where did we brought the girl up and she had her phone,</v>

1904
00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.351
<v Speaker 2>her iPhone.</v>

1905
00:44:58.351 --> 00:44:59.380
<v Speaker 2>She recorded the halls.</v>

1906
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:00.240
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1907
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.073
<v Speaker 2>What's the guy's name?</v>

1908
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:01.831
<v Speaker 2>Recorded?</v>

1909
00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:02.664
<v Speaker 2>Everything he was saying.</v>

1910
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Who's that shakes.</v>

1911
00:45:03.911 --> 00:45:04.920
<v Speaker 2>She kept it in her purse.</v>

1912
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.821
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

1913
00:45:05.821 --> 00:45:06.720
<v Speaker 2>He had a TV show.</v>

1914
00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.330
<v Speaker 2>What did he say about Jerry Springer?</v>

1915
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Let's all kinds of nasty stuff when he was having sex with her.</v>

1916
00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:13.143
<v Speaker 2>Hello man.</v>

1917
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:13.760

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.593
<v Speaker 2>This kid's good.</v>

1919
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Super Cool.</v>

1920
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

1921
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:17.880
<v Speaker 2>That Austin trout fight.</v>

1922
00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Look at God sad that fight with the kid.</v>

1923
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Can we get your boxing boots?</v>

1924
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 2>The Austin Trout fight?</v>

1925
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you won that one.</v>

1926
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.841
<v Speaker 2>That was tough,</v>

1927
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:28.140
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1928
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:28.973
<v Speaker 2>The trout fight.</v>

1929
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.390
<v Speaker 2>That one right there that you just saw him.</v>

1930
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Did you see him drop him?</v>

1931
00:45:32.071 --> 00:45:33.600
<v Speaker 2>But that was a close fight,</v>

1932
00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:34.080
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1933
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 2>And then all you do is see the highlights because he's fighting Floyd Mayweather</v>

1934
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Knicks.</v>

1935
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.690
<v Speaker 2>They made it seem like you just destroyed trout.</v>

1936
00:45:39.691 --> 00:45:40.620
<v Speaker 2>He definitely did not.</v>

1937
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I would have to go back and watch that again.</v>

1938
00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.201
<v Speaker 2>I don't really want to see it.</v>

1939
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1940
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 2>And then Floyd Mayweather split a clinic on him.</v>

1941
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:46.501
<v Speaker 2>It's too much.</v>

1942
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I think too much.</v>

1943
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:48.853
<v Speaker 2>He's too big.</v>

1944
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.610
<v Speaker 2>He's too big for that weight class.</v>

1945
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:51.733
<v Speaker 2>Canelo as you think.</v>

1946
00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Well to fight Floyd Mayweather at the weight they fought in.</v>

1947
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.070
<v Speaker 2>He didn't because he cuts too much.</v>

1948
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.090
<v Speaker 2>He's not fast enough.</v>

1949
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:58.530
<v Speaker 2>He's not fancy enough for Floyd.</v>

1950
00:45:59.040 --> 00:45:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1951
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.330
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting man.</v>

1952
00:46:00.331 --> 00:46:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Floyd is fast as fuck.</v>

1953
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.480
<v Speaker 2>He's also just so smart.</v>

1954
00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.800
<v Speaker 2>This is so smart.</v>

1955
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Intelligence defense is the best in the world.</v>

1956
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:08.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1957
00:46:08.001 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing like it.</v>

1958
00:46:09.091 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I've only seen him hit once.</v>

1959
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 2>The only time I've ever seen him hurt was Shane Mosley.</v>

1960
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.930
<v Speaker 2>Those the only time he got a little,</v>

1961
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1962
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:16.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1963
00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:16.930
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1964
00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.260
<v Speaker 2>My tag them a little bit by Donna tag them.</v>

1965
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 2>They're rematching.</v>

1966
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about that rematch.</v>

1967
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:22.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to them.</v>

1968
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:22.891
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it.</v>

1969
00:46:22.891 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Every match their rematch.</v>

1970
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:24.840
<v Speaker 2>You want to see it really?</v>

1971
00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:25.973
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into it.</v>

1972
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:26.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1973
00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I definitely want to see the Floyd Mayweather sugar,</v>

1974
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Shane Mosley rematched.</v>

1975
00:46:29.631 --> 00:46:30.464
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1976
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:31.450
<v Speaker 2>That's all I meant.</v>

1977
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Sugar Shane Stk.</v>

1978
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Little Punchy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>punchy,</v>

1980
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 2>and that's what happens.</v>

1981
00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:39.390
<v Speaker 2>What happens if a few years back,</v>

1982
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 2>I ranted at Terry Norris at a boxing event and it was super depressing.</v>

1983
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't seen him in forever and all of a sudden I see what is,</v>

1984
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here with this guy?</v>

1985
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:50.971
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is a show.</v>

1991
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:04.470
<v Speaker 2>It's all just strength and conditioning.</v>

1992
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has to have astro turf now.</v>

1993
00:47:06.511 --> 00:47:07.500
<v Speaker 2>American muscle,</v>

1994
00:47:07.501 --> 00:47:08.161
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you there are some girls out there that are young and dumb who would</v>

2042
00:48:10.601 --> 00:48:12.630
<v Speaker 1>get pregnant to be on TV for sure.</v>

2043
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:14.141
<v Speaker 1>MTV,</v>

2044
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:16.600
<v Speaker 1>if you think that made people not want to have babies,</v>

2045
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 1>it did the exact opposite these years like,</v>

2046
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:18.700
<v Speaker 1>hold up,</v>

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I get more Instagram followers by getting pregnant and on MTV 100% blow your</v>

2048
00:48:22.961 --> 00:48:23.500
<v Speaker 1>load in me.</v>

2049
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:23.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2050
00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:27.100

2051
00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean that I hate when they were just trying to let everyone.</v>

2052
00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Pixie is a serious problem this day and age.</v>

2053
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Derrick Lewis and Gudo suntay.</v>

2054
00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 1>How do you say in so slow?</v>

2055
00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking at Daniel core man,</v>

2056
00:48:40.461 --> 00:48:43.240
<v Speaker 1>his suit and there's no reason that you should be as tough as he as he just</v>

2057
00:48:43.241 --> 00:48:44.800
<v Speaker 1>looks like the ups guy.</v>

2058
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

2059
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Cormier does not look like the killer.</v>

2060
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:49.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean please shut your mouth.</v>

2061
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:49.910
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

2062
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 1>He's wide as a house.</v>

2063
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.591
<v Speaker 1>He's not a,</v>

2064
00:48:52.591 --> 00:48:53.650
<v Speaker 1>he's actually in a suit.</v>

2065
00:48:53.651 --> 00:48:55.300
<v Speaker 1>He looks kind of like a thick guy.</v>

2066
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Just small.</v>

2067
00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.160
<v Speaker 1>You're saying he's kind of small,</v>

2068
00:48:57.161 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look like so amazing and such a killer and it has been so dominant.</v>

2069
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:02.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just not what you,</v>

2070
00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 1>when you look at them in a suit you're like,</v>

2071
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.610
<v Speaker 1>well it looks like a thick guy.</v>

2072
00:49:05.611 --> 00:49:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of guys like that.</v>

2073
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.040

2075
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:10.323
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>

2076
00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I still see a little Jiu Jitsu guy.</v>

2077
00:49:12.251 --> 00:49:16.070
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like would rip your Dick Conan Conan.</v>

2078

2092
00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.340
<v Speaker 1>He's in the mind of a world class wrestler.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's going to buy milk.</v>

2095
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.390
<v Speaker 1>The only time I saw him nervous,</v>

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.880
<v Speaker 1>He admitted he had UFC jitters.</v>

2102
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:55.714
<v Speaker 1>When you flat man,</v>

2105
00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:59.110
<v Speaker 1>He actually talked about that to UFC jitters.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I thought it was an episode of bully beat down.</v>

2113
00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:09.491
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:12.660
<v Speaker 1>UFC preview preview.</v>

2120
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Why did he pick him up and body slammed him like that?</v>

2121
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Because he to Dan Henderson,</v>

2125
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Dan was all tan and shit and choke them unconscious.</v>

2126
00:50:27.861 --> 00:50:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Dan didn't even tap like a man.</v>

2127
00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't like Brad said,</v>

2129
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:36.530
<v Speaker 1>It was just so as tight as he got.</v>

2130
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I looked,</v>

2131
00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:37.581
<v Speaker 1>I was grabbing his arms.</v>

2132
00:50:37.581 --> 00:50:37.851

2137
00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:43.280
<v Speaker 1>When guys wear three piece suits on TV,</v>

2145
00:50:55.131 --> 00:50:56.870
<v Speaker 1>and all that shit and the jacket.</v>

2146
00:50:56.871 --> 00:50:58.160

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to put your jacket on for this interview.</v>

2152
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Put your jacket on for this part.</v>

2153
00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:04.860

<v Speaker 1>it's going to make it better if I have a jacket on.</v>

2155
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

2156
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not the three piece suits to formal man.</v>

2157
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 1>It's too much from behind me.</v>

2158
00:51:12.741 --> 00:51:15.230
<v Speaker 1>People in their underwear about to Shin kick each other.</v>

2165
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:23.924
<v Speaker 1>It's too weird.</v>

2166
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.881
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>

2167
00:51:25.881 --> 00:51:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Our cultural desires to all have the same fucking outfits on.</v>

2168
00:51:30.381 --> 00:51:33.610
<v Speaker 1>If we're being serious or classy or doing formality,</v>

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Clearly I'm prepared for no nonsense.</v>

2173
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.531
<v Speaker 1>Nearly fell.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson most be bored as shit he's doing.</v>

2183
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:53.570
<v Speaker 1>It's Wednesday and Thursday.</v>

2184
00:51:53.571 --> 00:51:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2185
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.400

2186
00:51:55.401 --> 00:51:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Interesting man.</v>

2187
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Interested.</v>

2188
00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:58.790
<v Speaker 1>You see a show and he was doing Broadway stuff.</v>

2189
00:51:58.810 --> 00:51:59.091
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2190
00:51:59.091 --> 00:51:59.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2191
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 1>it was good.</v>

2192
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I heard it was awesome.</v>

2193
00:52:00.741 --> 00:52:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It was all done with it.</v>

2194
00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:02.373
<v Speaker 1>They stopped doing it.</v>

2195
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.901
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2196
00:52:02.901 --> 00:52:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's doing that bullshit promotion thing though.</v>

2197
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.031
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2198
00:52:05.031 --> 00:52:05.864
<v Speaker 1>the fights.</v>

2199
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.250
<v Speaker 1>But he's done well.</v>

2200
00:52:07.251 --> 00:52:09.650
<v Speaker 1>He's only got so many stories I guess,</v>

2201
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:10.281
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2202
00:52:10.281 --> 00:52:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's one of those things like,</v>

2203
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:12.640
<v Speaker 1>did you guys remember um,</v>

2204
00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:17.970
<v Speaker 1>the defending the caveman who was essentially like a hot stand up comedy act?</v>

2205
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:20.570
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

2206
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I never know if he's made so much money on that.</v>

2207
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Not only did he make so much money out of Michael Chiklis,</v>

2208
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:26.600
<v Speaker 1>that guy from the shield,</v>

2209
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 1>he actually performed it for awhile.</v>

2210
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:32.300
<v Speaker 1>He was selling it so other guys can perform it.</v>

2211
00:52:32.301 --> 00:52:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Like he had this act and guys would do it.</v>

2212
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:39.500
<v Speaker 1>It was like he would selling it as a theater show and it was essentially like</v>

2213
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:41.450
<v Speaker 1>kind of a hacky standup comedy.</v>

2214
00:52:41.451 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 1>It's still performed everywhere.</v>

2215
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Still making a fortune.</v>

2216
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.201
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

2217
00:52:45.201 --> 00:52:46.280
<v Speaker 1>It's the difference in men and women.</v>

2218
00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.373
<v Speaker 1>It's definitive,</v>

2219
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:50.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's nothing groundbreaking.</v>

2220
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2221
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:51.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2222
00:52:51.831 --> 00:52:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2223
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's probably well done if people enjoy it.</v>

2224
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I saw it on Broadway actually think about it.</v>

2225
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought that it was,</v>

2226
00:52:57.351 --> 00:52:58.310
<v Speaker 1>it was well written.</v>

2227
00:52:58.311 --> 00:52:58.541
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2228
00:52:58.541 --> 00:53:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think he was a performer.</v>

2229
00:53:00.081 --> 00:53:01.200
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't the,</v>

2230
00:53:01.201 --> 00:53:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I saw the original guy who wrote it,</v>

2231
00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:03.321
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

2232
00:53:03.321 --> 00:53:03.741
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2233
00:53:03.741 --> 00:53:04.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2234
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.800
<v Speaker 1>and so then now he's just licensed it licensed licenses out to,</v>

2235
00:53:06.801 --> 00:53:07.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2236
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.480
<v Speaker 1>to other actors to scrubs.</v>

2237
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2238
00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:09.370
<v Speaker 1>But it's actually,</v>

2239
00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:10.203
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2240
00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:13.940
<v Speaker 1>they have to have it from adjacently draws the distinction being hunters and</v>

2241
00:53:13.941 --> 00:53:15.900
<v Speaker 1>gatherers and when the differences,</v>

2242
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.000
<v Speaker 1>when men go to shop,</v>

2243
00:53:17.001 --> 00:53:17.490
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2244
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:17.770
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2245
00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:18.291
<v Speaker 1>their linear,</v>

2246
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:19.400
<v Speaker 1>they want to go get their genes.</v>

2247
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.010
<v Speaker 1>They're going to find it and kill it and take the genes and leave women when</v>

2248
00:53:22.011 --> 00:53:22.461
<v Speaker 1>they go shop,</v>

2249
00:53:22.461 --> 00:53:23.330
<v Speaker 1>they want to touch things,</v>

2250
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:23.811
<v Speaker 1>smell it,</v>

2251
00:53:23.811 --> 00:53:24.720
<v Speaker 1>that they'd go through it.</v>

2252
00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:25.741
<v Speaker 1>They're gathering.</v>

2253
00:53:25.741 --> 00:53:26.574
<v Speaker 1>Well then Alma chain,</v>

2254

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:09.610
<v Speaker 1>it was a core.</v>

2324
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:10.740
<v Speaker 1>You just keep snoring.</v>

2325
00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:11.970
<v Speaker 1>You go on with life.</v>

2326
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.360
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2327
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:12.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2328
00:55:12.631 --> 00:55:13.171
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

2329
00:55:13.171 --> 00:55:14.670
<v Speaker 1>dude say that as long recovery.</v>

2330
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 1>They also say that about the fucking nose thing.</v>

2331
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I that the deviated Septum kept me from doing it for a long time.</v>

2332
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:20.581
<v Speaker 1>I had it done.</v>

2333
00:55:20.581 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 1>It was easy.</v>

2334
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2335
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:22.440
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>

2336
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean my nose is a little sensitive,</v>

2337
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:27.490
<v Speaker 1>but I was rolling six weeks later and I was breathing gray up.</v>

2338
00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:28.231
<v Speaker 1>Do you still breathe?</v>

2339
00:55:28.231 --> 00:55:28.431
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2340
00:55:28.431 --> 00:55:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause my,</v>

2341
00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:31.530
<v Speaker 1>my surgeon are pretty good.</v>

2342
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.690
<v Speaker 1>So good to my whole life.</v>

2343
00:55:33.691 --> 00:55:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I had a whack,</v>

2344
00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.910
<v Speaker 1>knows I fell off.</v>

2345
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:38.070
<v Speaker 1>My surgeon was unsuccessful.</v>

2346
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Well you probably went back to the gym like a week later and started getting</v>

2347
00:55:40.831 --> 00:55:41.381
<v Speaker 1>punched in the face.</v>

2348
00:55:41.381 --> 00:55:41.671
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2349
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 1>you went back a week later.</v>

2350
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:43.853
<v Speaker 1>I was rolling.</v>

2351
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 1>No punches.</v>

2352
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.060
<v Speaker 1>You fell down the stairs and broke her nose.</v>

2353
00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:46.923
<v Speaker 1>That's five.</v>

2354
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:47.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2355
00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:48.331
<v Speaker 1>When I was five years old,</v>

2356
00:55:48.331 --> 00:55:49.200
<v Speaker 1>smashed my nose,</v>

2357
00:55:49.201 --> 00:55:53.280
<v Speaker 1>shattered it cement stare and from then on it was useless.</v>

2358
00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And then my whole life was wrestling,</v>

2359
00:55:55.531 --> 00:55:56.310
<v Speaker 1>martial arts.</v>

2360
00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:57.210
<v Speaker 1>I got hit in the face.</v>

2361
00:55:57.211 --> 00:55:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how many times I know I broke my nose.</v>

2362
00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:02.700
<v Speaker 1>It least probably 10 to a dozen times at least.</v>

2363
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all this scar tissue build up and they take your turbinates,</v>

2364
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:07.130
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2365
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.700
<v Speaker 1>they trim your turbinates down.</v>

2366
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:09.260
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2367
00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:13.200
<v Speaker 1>my nose actually got wider after the surgery because when he,</v>

2368
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.310
<v Speaker 1>when he cut me open,</v>

2369
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 1>this guy was a real wizard,</v>

2370
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:21.440
<v Speaker 1>he retired doctor Feinstein and in Encino and he put these like these uh,</v>

2371
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:24.221
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

2372
00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:25.570
<v Speaker 1>they'd be saw these things,</v>

2373
00:56:25.571 --> 00:56:27.850
<v Speaker 1>these plastic splints and shoved that.</v>

2374
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:28.330
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2375
00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 1>what is your main concern?</v>

2376
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:30.431
<v Speaker 1>And I explained,</v>

2377
00:56:30.431 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2378
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:31.080
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2379
00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I do martial arts and stuff and I can't breathe out of my nose,</v>

2380
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 1>all this different jazz.</v>

2381
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.041
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2382
00:56:36.041 --> 00:56:36.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2383
00:56:36.221 --> 00:56:37.750
<v Speaker 1>we're going to open it wide.</v>

2384
00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 1>We're going to really get in there.</v>

2385
00:56:39.101 --> 00:56:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And we got trimmed down at what's called a turban.</v>

2386
00:56:40.881 --> 00:56:41.830
<v Speaker 1>And so the system for things,</v>

2387
00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:42.664
<v Speaker 1>we're going to spread it out.</v>

2388
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 1>So he like cut me open and,</v>

2389
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 1>and took out all this scar tissue.</v>

2390
00:56:47.381 --> 00:56:50.800
<v Speaker 1>And I mean he showed it to me at like a plate of all the shit they pulled out of</v>

2391
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:51.550
<v Speaker 1>my nose.</v>

2392
00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:51.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2393
00:56:51.851 --> 00:56:52.684
<v Speaker 1>it was incredible.</v>

2394
00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:57.160
<v Speaker 1>And then he stuffs these plastic things in that sort of wedged my nose open.</v>

2395
00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:58.240
<v Speaker 1>And then stuff,</v>

2396
00:56:58.241 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 1>these foam inserts,</v>

2397
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:04.160
<v Speaker 5>I had the same thing but minus collapsed and he had to take a piece of cartilage</v>

2398
00:57:04.161 --> 00:57:05.240
<v Speaker 5>and put it under my nose.</v>

2399
00:57:05.241 --> 00:57:05.540
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2400
00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:06.373
<v Speaker 5>and this is,</v>

2401
00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 5>I have garbage with a cut it out.</v>

2402
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:08.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2403
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:11.180
<v Speaker 5>He had to put an extra piece and I'm telling you,</v>

2404
00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.220
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean you don't have to be for two weeks?</v>

2405
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:13.941
<v Speaker 5>My nose.</v>

2406
00:57:13.941 --> 00:57:14.780
<v Speaker 5>Look my nose.</v>

2407
00:57:14.781 --> 00:57:15.770
<v Speaker 5>I looked like a pig.</v>

2408
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:16.610
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

2409
00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:17.840
<v Speaker 5>I know Brian had a nose job,</v>

2410
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.353
<v Speaker 5>those dry Brian.</v>

2411
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.220
<v Speaker 5>But they don't take Cartlidge from other people's body and put it in [inaudible]</v>

2412
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:25.160
<v Speaker 5>from Mike from must taking it from my nose.</v>

2413
00:57:25.161 --> 00:57:25.461
<v Speaker 5>But he said,</v>

2414
00:57:25.461 --> 00:57:27.960
<v Speaker 5>I didn't take up these cartilage and put it under your nose cause it,</v>

2415
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:30.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't take cartilage from your nose and put it in your nose.</v>

2416
00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.760
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't make sense.</v>

2417
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.580
<v Speaker 5>So they just showed the,</v>

2418
00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:37.400
<v Speaker 5>so they just showed the ultimate fighter where the hometown,</v>

2419
00:57:37.401 --> 00:57:38.660
<v Speaker 5>where they go to their hometown show.</v>

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.220
<v Speaker 5>it's a great operation though if you get it done correctly and it takes,</v>

2451
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.300
<v Speaker 5>God mind didn't take,</v>

2452

<v Speaker 5>if I really go home town,</v>

2455
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:24.950

01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 5>All that work kind of true.</v>

2901
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:21.141
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2902
01:09:21.141 --> 01:09:21.940
<v Speaker 5>it is kind of true.</v>

2903
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.210
<v Speaker 5>There's that won the UFC is,</v>

2904
01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:23.421
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2905
01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:24.254
<v Speaker 5>we're good man.</v>

2906
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.530
<v Speaker 5>Has anybody ever gone from the UFC?</v>

2907
01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:28.311
<v Speaker 5>Gotten cut,</v>

2908
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:29.690
<v Speaker 5>came from ultimate fighter?</v>

2909
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2910
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 5>Came back and like made a run at the title</v>

2911
01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:37.023
<v Speaker 5>so far.</v>

2912
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.421
<v Speaker 5>Nobody,</v>

2913
01:09:37.421 --> 01:09:37.750
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2914
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:42.260
<v Speaker 5>I can't think of anyone know who's like the best guy that's been cut and look</v>

2915
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.031
<v Speaker 5>sensational.</v>

2916
01:09:43.031 --> 01:09:44.500
<v Speaker 5>And other organizations,</v>

2917
01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.810
<v Speaker 5>probably Anthony Johnson.</v>

2918
01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:47.381
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2919
01:09:47.381 --> 01:09:51.370
<v Speaker 5>at one point named Mark Hart who Could Strike Force One and beat Tyron Woodley.</v>

2920
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:52.121
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2921
01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:53.280
<v Speaker 5>But he was in strike force.</v>

2922
01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.161
<v Speaker 5>It's still like in the,</v>

2923
01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:55.210
<v Speaker 5>the zoom for banner.</v>

2924
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

2925
01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.021
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2926
01:09:56.021 --> 01:09:59.170
<v Speaker 5>Cause they owned them at the time I end game the title shot.</v>

2927
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.060
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2928
01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.740
<v Speaker 5>and the second question Anthony Johnson got caught.</v>

2929
01:10:02.741 --> 01:10:04.350
<v Speaker 5>But that was mostly a weight issue thing.</v>

2930
01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:05.860
<v Speaker 5>Lloyd issue man,</v>

2931
01:10:05.861 --> 01:10:08.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't East but God damn did he look good?</v>

2932
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.831
<v Speaker 5>Think about it.</v>

2933
01:10:08.831 --> 01:10:11.230
<v Speaker 5>When you get cut from the UFC and you move on,</v>

2934
01:10:11.231 --> 01:10:11.951
<v Speaker 5>especially a young guy,</v>

2935
01:10:11.951 --> 01:10:12.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to think who does.</v>

2936
01:10:12.821 --> 01:10:13.654
<v Speaker 5>Well</v>

2937
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.800
<v Speaker 5>Melvin Gallard just one.</v>

2938
01:10:16.801 --> 01:10:18.510
<v Speaker 5>But that's really his first one.</v>

2939
01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.070
<v Speaker 5>Did Gallard when he did win,</v>

2940
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:21.690
<v Speaker 5>he missed weight though again.</v>

2941
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:22.740
<v Speaker 5>We did again.</v>

2942
01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:23.603
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2943
01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.551
<v Speaker 5>It's frustrating.</v>

2944
01:10:24.551 --> 01:10:24.650
<v Speaker 5>It.</v>

2945
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:25.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2946
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:27.450
<v Speaker 5>Does that do not get any person when that happens.</v>

2947
01:10:27.451 --> 01:10:28.980
<v Speaker 5>So you lose 20% of it.</v>

2948
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh the other guy gets 20% good.</v>

2949
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:33.533
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2950
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:38.100
<v Speaker 5>so interesting to see different guys and the different weight cutting strategies</v>

2951
01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:38.880
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2952
01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:42.720
<v Speaker 5>some guys believe in drinking distilled water and some guys say you shouldn't</v>

2953
01:10:42.721 --> 01:10:46.290
<v Speaker 5>drink distilled water like to trying to like read their body of electrolytes.</v>

2954
01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:47.970
<v Speaker 5>So it's easy to look at this.</v>

2955
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:53.260
<v Speaker 5>Boom Gordon with the big right hand and power the um,</v>

2956
01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:58.870
<v Speaker 5>the idea behind it is that you rid your body of all these electrolytes,</v>

2957
01:10:58.871 --> 01:11:03.090
<v Speaker 5>keep pumping it with fluids and then the fluids just flushed out of your system</v>

2958
01:11:03.091 --> 01:11:04.710
<v Speaker 5>quicker and then you can replenish them quicker.</v>

2959
01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:06.421
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2960
01:11:06.421 --> 01:11:10.050
<v Speaker 5>I've got to have a dolce on and talked to him about that shit would say whatever</v>

2961
01:11:10.051 --> 01:11:10.860
<v Speaker 5>adultery is doing,</v>

2962
01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.500
<v Speaker 5>probably stick to that everybody.</v>

2963
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.853
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2964
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2965
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Tiago Alvarez never looked better in his last fight.</v>

2966
01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:17.371
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>

2967
01:11:17.371 --> 01:11:20.370
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys are coming in to like real light,</v>

2968
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:25.790
<v Speaker 1>like the week of like Mochida well Machita walked around that 203 pounds when we</v>

2969
01:11:27.471 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>just champ.</v>

2970
01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>When he's competing at two fives,</v>

2971
01:11:29.461 --> 01:11:30.570
<v Speaker 1>203 pounds.</v>

2972
01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:31.563
<v Speaker 1>It's tough for him.</v>

2973
01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:33.110
<v Speaker 1>That's his natural weight.</v>

2974
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2975
01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:34.100
<v Speaker 1>What's your sweat?</v>

2976
01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:34.561
<v Speaker 1>He does,</v>

2977
01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 1>you know he's thinking to go into one 70 no.</v>

2978
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2979
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said in an interview.</v>

2980
01:11:38.401 --> 01:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>The way the week of the fight,</v>

2981
01:11:39.691 --> 01:11:40.930
<v Speaker 1>they said he could go to one 70.</v>

2982
01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I was asking them,</v>

2983
01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I was in the locker room.</v>

2984
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:44.063
<v Speaker 1>The training room.</v>

2985
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2986
01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.513
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

2987
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.121
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

2988
01:11:46.121 --> 01:11:48.570
<v Speaker 1>and people ask me about cutting a two o two oh five all time.</v>

2989
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:50.190
<v Speaker 1>When you go down a weight class,</v>

2990
01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:51.700
<v Speaker 1>everyone's skills get better.</v>

2991
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's way faster.</v>

2992
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:54.680
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes it like,</v>

2993
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:57.060
<v Speaker 1>so my advantage at heavyweight is cardio speed,</v>

2994
01:11:57.061 --> 01:11:57.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2995
01:11:57.370 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 1>We are going to in two or five now you're now you're,</v>

2996
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:00.781
<v Speaker 1>it's almost even,</v>

2997
01:12:00.781 --> 01:12:02.160
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't become your advantage really.</v>

2998
01:12:02.161 --> 01:12:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's comes a point of diminishing returns,</v>

2999
01:12:04.891 --> 01:12:05.650
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3000
01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Hits the,</v>

3001
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:06.361
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

3002
01:12:06.361 --> 01:12:07.194
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

3003
01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:08.500
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3004
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.333
<v Speaker 1>v</v>

3005
01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Talk.</v>

3006
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.840
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's wearing them.</v>

3007
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:13.341
<v Speaker 1>I honor him,</v>

3008
01:12:13.341 --> 01:12:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but he's just got that natural sort of dark,</v>

3009
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:16.680
<v Speaker 1>just a black eye all the time.</v>

3010
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:20.190
<v Speaker 1>The pure smoldering just smoldering is right.</v>

3011
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Concentrate smoldering little cutie on UFC.</v>

3012
01:12:22.531 --> 01:12:23.161
<v Speaker 1>Now here it is.</v>

3013
01:12:23.161 --> 01:12:23.994
<v Speaker 1>Here's your show again.</v>

3014
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Look at me picking up weights and I'm doing it on some fake grass.</v>

3015
01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:33.661
<v Speaker 1>Fake.</v>

3016
01:12:33.661 --> 01:12:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has to have fake grass.</v>

3017
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 1>He builds champions from the inside out.</v>

3018
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Dun,</v>

3019
01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Dun,</v>

3020
01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.551
<v Speaker 1>Dun Dun.</v>

3021
01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:41.310
<v Speaker 1>It looked like that was Rashad Evans,</v>

3022
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:47.580
<v Speaker 1>these guys to running your strength coach was having me,</v>

3023
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Loren Landow invited me to run,</v>

3024
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.540
<v Speaker 1>come run with the NFL.</v>

3025
01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Some of the NFL.</v>

3026
01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:53.641
<v Speaker 1>No I did not.</v>

3027
01:12:53.641 --> 01:12:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It was I had to get on a plane to go to Mexico.</v>

3028
01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get to humiliate it.</v>

3029
01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to get humiliated?</v>

3030
01:12:58.981 --> 01:12:59.251
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

3031
01:12:59.251 --> 01:12:59.891
<v Speaker 1>would it come up in this?</v>

3032
01:12:59.891 --> 01:13:01.470
<v Speaker 1>She was to any way because guess what?</v>

3033
01:13:01.471 --> 01:13:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to try to run against the Denver Broncos.</v>

3034
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:06.090
<v Speaker 1>You're not running against them.</v>

3035
01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.030
<v Speaker 1>You're jumping in working.</v>

3036
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:09.221
<v Speaker 1>Yes I am.</v>

3037
01:13:09.221 --> 01:13:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my mind.</v>

3038
01:13:10.531 --> 01:13:11.820
<v Speaker 1>The mind of Brian Cowen.</v>

3039
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3040
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.903
<v Speaker 1>he's running.</v>

3041
01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Definitely don't show up or you not going to be all you want,</v>

3054
01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.600
<v Speaker 1>You talk a lot about working at twice a day.</v>

3055
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3059
01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3060
01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:37.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3061
01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:41.340

3063
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:44.583
<v Speaker 1>I didn't make</v>

3064
01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.660
<v Speaker 1>a weird thing to make up one.</v>

3065
01:13:48.661 --> 01:13:49.220
<v Speaker 1>It why?</v>

3066
01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Nobody definitely made up the part about them taking cartilage out of your nose.</v>

3067
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.721
<v Speaker 1>Here's what they did.</v>

3068
01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:58.950
<v Speaker 1>What Dr Dr Doctor Cartilage and they put it under it right here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>

3071
01:14:02.301 --> 01:14:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're a doctor,</v>

3072
01:14:03.361 --> 01:14:08.361
<v Speaker 1>please write in about how they take a plastic splint and they do put it right</v>

3073
01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:08.581
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3074
01:14:08.581 --> 01:14:10.740
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about sort of keep that thing up.</v>

3075
01:14:10.741 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>They did to me too.</v>

3076
01:14:11.711 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 1>They'd make,</v>

3077
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.120
<v Speaker 5>but it's plastic.</v>

3078
01:14:13.121 --> 01:14:13.790
<v Speaker 5>It's not hard.</v>

3079
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:15.010
<v Speaker 5>This is exactly what he said.</v>

3080
01:14:15.011 --> 01:14:16.330
<v Speaker 5>He said when you were under,</v>

3081
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.310
<v Speaker 5>you're under for a long time.</v>

3082
01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.193
<v Speaker 5>Your nose,</v>

3083
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.250
<v Speaker 5>tons days,</v>

3086
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:35.040
<v Speaker 5>knows they have to probably found inside of the spare car.</v>

3087
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.680
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

3088
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.250
<v Speaker 5>there's no spirit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like to wrestle with people and Steve Carell's playing dupont.</v>

3331
01:20:50.621 --> 01:20:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he knocks him out of a fucking park.</v>

3332
01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3333

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3334
01:20:53.681 --> 01:20:54.131
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

3335
01:20:54.131 --> 01:20:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Chan rounds the Channing Tatum dime piece.</v>

3336
01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.500
<v Speaker 1>You need to make your body look way better.</v>

3337
01:20:59.501 --> 01:21:00.790
<v Speaker 1>If you went on to play Mark Schultz,</v>

3338
01:21:00.791 --> 01:21:01.360
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

3339
01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.360
<v Speaker 1>how about he's a little chunky and a 22 jump street and Chubby Joe.</v>

3340
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.020
<v Speaker 1>What's name Jonah Hill?</v>

3341
01:21:08.050 --> 01:21:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Jonah Hill's valid.</v>

3342
01:21:08.981 --> 01:21:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3343
01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.233
<v Speaker 1>Compared to join it.</v>

3344
01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:10.550
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3345
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.781
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3346
01:21:10.781 --> 01:21:11.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3347
01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:12.133
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have it,</v>

3348
01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:15.580
<v Speaker 1>but if you notice in 22 jump street and this kind of stuff I know is cause I'm</v>

3349
01:21:15.581 --> 01:21:16.240
<v Speaker 1>super vain.</v>

3350
01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.130
<v Speaker 1>He had his shirt on the entire time.</v>

3351
01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.710
<v Speaker 1>The other one that you'd take your shirt off and from what I saw in that</v>

3352
01:21:20.711 --> 01:21:21.041
<v Speaker 1>preview,</v>

3353
01:21:21.041 --> 01:21:21.874
<v Speaker 1>he looked all right.</v>

3354
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:22.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3355
01:21:22.091 --> 01:21:22.420
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3356
01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean in my opinion that's like offensive to me because if you've ever seen</v>

3357
01:21:25.961 --> 01:21:27.250
<v Speaker 1>what Mark Schultz looks like,</v>

3358
01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.031
<v Speaker 1>Mark Schultz,</v>

3359
01:21:28.031 --> 01:21:30.970
<v Speaker 1>the wrestler is a fucking animal beast.</v>

3360
01:21:31.690 --> 01:21:34.750
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like the rock plain Hercules and it's like a smooth build.</v>

3361
01:21:34.751 --> 01:21:36.990
<v Speaker 1>That full is jack to play Herculean.</v>

3362
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:37.460
<v Speaker 1>She got,</v>

3363
01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:38.340
<v Speaker 1>he's jacked.</v>

3364
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.131
<v Speaker 1>Well Schultz,</v>

3365
01:21:39.131 --> 01:21:42.820
<v Speaker 1>when he was in his prime to grab guys,</v>

3366
01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:45.160
<v Speaker 1>he used to get guys in in illegal moves.</v>

3367
01:21:45.161 --> 01:21:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Like he'd,</v>

3368
01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:50.260
<v Speaker 1>he'd use cameras and he would hit a Komora and just rip guy shoulders off while</v>

3369
01:21:50.261 --> 01:21:51.190
<v Speaker 1>I was taking them down.</v>

3370
01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Mangled guys.</v>

3371
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3372
01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a fucking,</v>

3373
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.990
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know the story of that movie,</v>

3374
01:21:55.991 --> 01:21:58.180
<v Speaker 1>but I'll for sure buy a ticket to that.</v>

3375
01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:03.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating story because these guys were all broke and dupont would pay</v>

3376
01:22:03.581 --> 01:22:05.830
<v Speaker 1>these guys to come to his compound,</v>

3377
01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:09.580
<v Speaker 1>built this wrestling thing and wrestle with them and like roll around with them</v>

3378
01:22:09.581 --> 01:22:10.990
<v Speaker 1>and get all sweaty and gay with them.</v>

3379
01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.450
<v Speaker 1>And then you get game.</v>

3380
01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3381
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:15.230
<v Speaker 1>is gay.</v>

3382
01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Was He being funny or no?</v>

3383
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:17.291

3386
01:22:18.970 --> 01:22:19.691

<v Speaker 5>Because you've got to put them in perspective.</v>

3474
01:24:01.421 --> 01:24:04.540
<v Speaker 5>Like it might've been great down then you watch it now.</v>

3475
01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:06.400
<v Speaker 5>You're bored is fun watching it now you're bored.</v>

3476
01:24:06.730 --> 01:24:07.541
<v Speaker 5>Watching recently,</v>

3477
01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:10.260
<v Speaker 5>about four years ago and I was pretty damn scared in the middle.</v>

3478
01:24:10.261 --> 01:24:10.961
<v Speaker 5>You'd washing it.</v>

3479
01:24:10.961 --> 01:24:13.400
<v Speaker 5>You were tweeting and checking your back.</v>

3480
01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.510
<v Speaker 5>Then I barely see.</v>

3481
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.281
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>

3482
01:24:15.281 --> 01:24:15.520
<v Speaker 5>When I,</v>

3483
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.470
<v Speaker 5>when I saw it delivers from evil,</v>

3484
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:17.731
<v Speaker 5>when it,</v>

3485
01:24:17.731 --> 01:24:18.580
<v Speaker 5>when I saw that movie,</v>

3486
01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:21.880
<v Speaker 5>I saw it at the marina theaters where there's that dining experience,</v>

3487
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:25.330
<v Speaker 5>this fuck next to me's chewing on popcorn.</v>

3488
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:27.070
<v Speaker 5>He has like a Margarita.</v>

3489
01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:28.630
<v Speaker 5>It fucks up the whole experience.</v>

3490
01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:30.970
<v Speaker 5>I will be terrified.</v>

3491
01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:36.420
<v Speaker 5>Chompy choppers over here is on Twizzlers and sour patch kids balls deep in his</v>

3492
01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:36.940
<v Speaker 5>girl.</v>

3493
01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:37.451
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3494
01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:37.661
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3495
01:24:37.661 --> 01:24:38.140
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3496
01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.760
<v Speaker 5>reclining back and shit.</v>

3497
01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:40.630
<v Speaker 5>It's not as scary.</v>

3498
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:43.310
<v Speaker 5>The shiny things,</v>

3499
01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 5>good one that's shining is a,</v>

3500
01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.630
<v Speaker 5>it was scary as shit.</v>

3501
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:50.630
<v Speaker 5>That might be that my scary that filmed in Colorado might jump.</v>

3502
01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.810
<v Speaker 5>I might jump ship and say I might,</v>

3503
01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:53.440
<v Speaker 5>I might.</v>

3504
01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any characters too.</v>

3505
01:24:54.301 --> 01:24:55.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't usually stick to my original,</v>

3506
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.400
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

3507
01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.100
<v Speaker 5>I'd say the shining is a,</v>

3508
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:59.500
<v Speaker 5>with the conjuring,</v>

3509
01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:02.780
<v Speaker 5>the Texas chainsaw massacre was pretty fucking scary too because never really</v>

3510
01:25:02.781 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 5>pictured the original one or the one who Jessica Biel original.</v>

3511
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:05.771
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3512
01:25:05.771 --> 01:25:06.221
<v Speaker 5>I liked the one.</v>

3513
01:25:06.221 --> 01:25:06.950
<v Speaker 5>Just go Beal.</v>

3514
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:07.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3515
01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.220
<v Speaker 5>Well I loved it because of Jessica Biel.</v>

3516
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:10.240
<v Speaker 5>Me Too.</v>

3517
01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.320
<v Speaker 5>I'll take it because of that.</v>

3518
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:13.030
<v Speaker 5>That was a scary goddamn movie.</v>

3519
01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:14.140
<v Speaker 5>You know what else was scary,</v>

3520
01:25:14.141 --> 01:25:14.560
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3521
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.393
<v Speaker 5>jaws.</v>

3522
01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.200
<v Speaker 5>Jaws was fun.</v>

3523
01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.290
<v Speaker 5>I then ruined me for the ocean to song.</v>

3524
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Got attacked by a great white off the Manhattan beach.</v>

3525
01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:21.460
<v Speaker 5>But I think,</v>

3526
01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.060
<v Speaker 5>I think the guy,</v>

3527
01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:23.560
<v Speaker 5>they were long distance swimmers right?</v>

3528
01:25:23.561 --> 01:25:24.080
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>

3529
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.320
<v Speaker 5>they had hooked the great white as a seven footer.</v>

3530
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:26.531
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

3533
01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:30.550
<v Speaker 5>He got attacked by a great white,</v>

3534
01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:32.920
<v Speaker 5>but they did say he was fishing and,</v>

3535
01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.570
<v Speaker 5>and the guy caught a great white.</v>

3536
01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:35.020

3541
01:25:38.311 --> 01:25:39.071
<v Speaker 5>in 40 minutes later,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The first one.</v>

3573
01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:16.410
<v Speaker 1>The first one is real.</v>

3574
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I saw the Blair witch project.</v>

3575
01:26:18.441 --> 01:26:19.070
<v Speaker 1>You see that?</v>

3576
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3577
01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.061
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was real.</v>

3578
01:26:20.061 --> 01:26:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I was super skinny.</v>

3579
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:22.450
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was real.</v>

3580
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.110
<v Speaker 1>It was a home camera man.</v>

3581
01:26:24.111 --> 01:26:24.761
<v Speaker 1>The way they filmed it,</v>

3582
01:26:24.761 --> 01:26:26.030
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty genius in that sense.</v>

3583
01:26:26.031 --> 01:26:26.750
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't,</v>

3584
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:27.583
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really,</v>

3585
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:30.500
<v Speaker 1>but a Blair witch project scared me a little bit.</v>

3586
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:32.090
<v Speaker 1>And so did the second one,</v>

3587
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Blair,</v>

3588
01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.410
<v Speaker 1>which scared me.</v>

3589
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I saw Blair witch with my buddy Chris Mcguire.</v>

3590
01:26:35.661 --> 01:26:36.710
<v Speaker 1>We went to a,</v>

3591
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:38.390
<v Speaker 1>we were working in Houston.</v>

3592
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.260
<v Speaker 1>It was doing the laugh,</v>

3593
01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:39.870
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>

3594
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:40.250
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

3595
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:41.450
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't exist anymore.</v>

3596
01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:46.220
<v Speaker 1>And these kids that worked at the movie theater across the street came to the</v>

3597
01:26:46.221 --> 01:26:47.300
<v Speaker 1>show and they said,</v>

3598

3605
01:26:56.721 --> 01:26:58.250

01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:52.620
<v Speaker 1>tack on it then yeah,</v>

3761
01:30:52.621 --> 01:30:54.750
<v Speaker 1>he uses it like a lot of old school training methods.</v>

3762
01:30:54.751 --> 01:30:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Like you put like caught up hand weights and throw punches kind of caught up.</v>

3763
01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Well you know where it caught up with him.</v>

3764
01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

3765
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:02.670
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because I was watching some old fade or fights.</v>

3766
01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Huge fade or fan and who's not.</v>

3767
01:31:05.371 --> 01:31:05.851
<v Speaker 1>If you're not,</v>

3768
01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:06.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not an MMA fan.</v>

3769
01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Him and Sakuraba.</v>

3770
01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:08.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3771
01:31:08.491 --> 01:31:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Well was just a different thing than,</v>

3772
01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:11.490
<v Speaker 1>he was a totally different thing.</v>

3773
01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:14.040
<v Speaker 1>But I used to go back and watch his fight.</v>

3774
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I was watching his fights recently and he was much bigger back in the day.</v>

3775
01:31:18.361 --> 01:31:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Physically bigger,</v>

3776
01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.760
<v Speaker 1>stronger about two 30 you mean bigger than watch other guys you mean or what do</v>

3777
01:31:23.761 --> 01:31:23.821
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3778
01:31:23.821 --> 01:31:26.520
<v Speaker 1>more muscle than he did at the end of his career and his crew.</v>

3779
01:31:26.521 --> 01:31:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Stop lifting weights done with the weights.</v>

3780
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:30.300
<v Speaker 1>It was just doing fight training.</v>

3781
01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:33.870
<v Speaker 1>But if you go back to like the Fujita fight being be thick traps,</v>

3782
01:31:33.871 --> 01:31:38.520
<v Speaker 1>big shoulders was fucking strongly shit and somewhere along the line they just</v>

3783
01:31:38.521 --> 01:31:39.630
<v Speaker 1>get tired of lifting weights.</v>

3784
01:31:39.630 --> 01:31:40.021
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3785
01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:40.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

3786
01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was.</v>

3787
01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.950
<v Speaker 1>What led him to the side or older.</v>

3788
01:31:43.951 --> 01:31:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Right and started losing muscle mass maybe?</v>

3789
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:46.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3790
01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:46.710
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3791
01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:48.660
<v Speaker 1>He stopped lifting weights like he talked about it.</v>

3792
01:31:48.661 --> 01:31:51.360
<v Speaker 1>He just did fight training only later on in his career.</v>

3793
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I think he thought the technique was more important than physical strength,</v>

3794
01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:57.060
<v Speaker 1>which is true for the most part.</v>

3795
01:31:57.061 --> 01:31:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I've gone towards that route toward personally.</v>

3796
01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:00.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3797
01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

3798
01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go in the gym and spend an hour lifting weights,</v>

3799
01:32:04.261 --> 01:32:06.970
<v Speaker 1>don't out weights or I can be on the mat,</v>

3800
01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 1>work on my boxing technique or Jujitsu and wrestling.</v>

3801
01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go do Jujitsu to know what Steve Maxwell's thought on that is.</v>

3802
01:32:13.810 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 1>It was a really interesting cause.</v>

3803
01:32:14.981 --> 01:32:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Maxwell spent a lifetime with strength and conditioning working with athletes.</v>

3804
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.700
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that if you're going to lift weights for sports,</v>

3805
01:32:21.701 --> 01:32:23.800
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't lift weights like strength and conditioning style.</v>

3806
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:26.770
<v Speaker 1>He thinks if you're doing like Mike Martial arts,</v>

3807
01:32:26.771 --> 01:32:29.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the middle of like training technique,</v>

3808
01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:29.951
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3809
01:32:29.951 --> 01:32:31.420
<v Speaker 1>you should do like sets,</v>

3810
01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:33.580
<v Speaker 1>like do sets of dead lifts,</v>

3811
01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:35.290
<v Speaker 1>do sets of bench two sets.</v>

3812
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.470
<v Speaker 1>She likes to incorporate lights at the rounds now just to get stronger.</v>

3813
01:32:38.610 --> 01:32:38.861
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3814
01:32:38.861 --> 01:32:40.360
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't work on your endurance.</v>

3815
01:32:40.361 --> 01:32:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you shouldn't be like doing these fucking crazy strength and conditioning</v>

3816
01:32:43.151 --> 01:32:45.310
<v Speaker 1>workouts while you're in camp working out for fights.</v>

3817
01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:45.971
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3818
01:32:45.971 --> 01:32:46.804
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

3819
01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:47.321
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3820
01:32:47.321 --> 01:32:50.410
<v Speaker 1>you should lift weights to keep your muscle mass and to keep your strength,</v>

3821
01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:53.110
<v Speaker 1>but all your conditioning should come from your kickboxing,</v>

3822
01:32:53.111 --> 01:32:54.170
<v Speaker 1>should come from your wrestling.</v>

3823
01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.480
<v Speaker 1>That should come from Egypt.</v>

3824
01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

3825
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually going to Arizona on Thursday and meet with this new,</v>

3826
01:32:59.411 --> 01:32:59.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3827
01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:02.260
<v Speaker 1>this new strength conditioning coach who Tim Teebo works with.</v>

3828
01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:03.363
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3829
01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:03.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3830
01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going out there with Tim and he said the exact same thing and this guy works</v>

3831
01:33:07.721 --> 01:33:08.380
<v Speaker 1>with everyone.</v>

3832
01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:09.191
<v Speaker 1>He said that he's like,</v>

3833
01:33:09.191 --> 01:33:11.800
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have a session where you're working,</v>

3834
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:12.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3835
01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:13.450
<v Speaker 1>reps and stuff like that.</v>

3836
01:33:13.451 --> 01:33:14.970
<v Speaker 1>He's said exactly what you just told me.</v>

3837
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:18.370
<v Speaker 1>These guys are saying that your skills are the most important thing and your</v>

3838
01:33:18.371 --> 01:33:22.480
<v Speaker 1>strength and you all your your physical strength like the mass it's size that</v>

3839
01:33:22.481 --> 01:33:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you could put on and maintain.</v>

3840
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:25.330
<v Speaker 1>He's like you should maintain that,</v>

3841
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you should get strong,</v>

3842
01:33:26.381 --> 01:33:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you should do all that but don't do like strength and conditioning like while</v>

3843
01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:31.050
<v Speaker 1>you were in a fight,</v>

3844
01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:32.480
<v Speaker 1>like the crossfit stuff afterwards.</v>

3845
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that because you're not going to have the same energy to do your</v>

3846
01:33:35.471 --> 01:33:36.304
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu work.</v>

3847
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was doing Jujitsu all the time,</v>

3848
01:33:38.711 --> 01:33:41.260
<v Speaker 1>if I would lift weights I could lift weights in the morning.</v>

3849
01:33:41.261 --> 01:33:42.190
<v Speaker 1>And did you do to at night?</v>

3850
01:33:42.191 --> 01:33:42.880
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

3851
01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Because I would do like a set of bench and then I would sit around me and I,</v>

3852
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Bravo would talk shit for fire,</v>

3853
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.330
<v Speaker 1>laugh and goof off and then we'd do another set so we would get all the strength</v>

3854
01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:55.150
<v Speaker 1>workout in but I still had energy to train at night.</v>

3855
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like if I do my kettle bell routine than I do if I do that shit,</v>

3856
01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a wrap.</v>

3857
01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:00.640
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>

3858
01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

3859
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting man.</v>

3860
01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:03.760
<v Speaker 1>That when you do strength training,</v>

3861
01:34:03.761 --> 01:34:05.830
<v Speaker 1>do you do it twice a week when you're in camp and camp?</v>

3862
01:34:05.831 --> 01:34:06.191
<v Speaker 1>I do it.</v>

3863
01:34:06.191 --> 01:34:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I do it twice a week.</v>

3864
01:34:07.031 --> 01:34:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3865
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:08.230
<v Speaker 1>But how to camp,</v>

3866
01:34:08.231 --> 01:34:09.760
<v Speaker 1>like now I lift four or five times.</v>

3867
01:34:10.150 --> 01:34:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I kept trying to get bigger,</v>

3868
01:34:11.561 --> 01:34:11.950
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

3869
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:12.850
<v Speaker 1>So when I go and camp,</v>

3870
01:34:12.851 --> 01:34:14.740
<v Speaker 1>my body's going to break down and we lose some size.</v>

3871
01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I just try to keep it,</v>

3872
01:34:15.671 --> 01:34:16.504
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3873
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:19.990
<v Speaker 1>But like people asked me like,</v>

3874
01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:20.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3875
01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:22.360
<v Speaker 1>even younger fighters at rain or Grace Academy,</v>

3876
01:34:22.361 --> 01:34:22.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3877
01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.141
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3878
01:34:23.141 --> 01:34:23.750
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

3879
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:25.260
<v Speaker 1>what should I be doing in the weight room?</v>

3880
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.751
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that.</v>

3881
01:34:25.751 --> 01:34:27.250
<v Speaker 1>So if you're younger fighter,</v>

3882
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:29.320
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't really waste your time in the weight room.</v>

3883
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:32.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't get paid to bench and squat and power clean.</v>

3884
01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3885
01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Paid to submit bitches and knock them out.</v>

3886
01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:34.811
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3887
01:34:34.811 --> 01:34:36.580
<v Speaker 1>So work on summit and knocking bitches out.</v>

3888
01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Here's the finals.</v>

3889
01:34:38.230 --> 01:34:39.820
<v Speaker 1>This is the light heavyweight finals,</v>

3890
01:34:39.821 --> 01:34:40.320

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:40.491

<v Speaker 1>What happened on that?</v>

4054
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:10.260
<v Speaker 1>He decided not to get his ass kicked.</v>

4055
01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:11.240
<v Speaker 1>It was that,</v>

4056
01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:12.900
<v Speaker 1>what's the story is actually going to go down.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4058
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:13.801

01:38:13.801 --> 01:38:15.240
<v Speaker 1>We had lawyers involved and everything.</v>

4060
01:38:15.330 --> 01:38:15.901
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

4061
01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Contract.</v>

4062
01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:17.423
<v Speaker 1>He changed his mind.</v>

4063
01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.530
<v Speaker 1>He called you out.</v>

4064
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:21.780
<v Speaker 1>How did you stars Campbell Mclaren,</v>

4065
01:38:21.781 --> 01:38:25.530
<v Speaker 1>who was the guy who was the original producer for the ultimate fighter?</v>

4066
01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Calls me up out of nowhere and says,</v>

4067
01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.610
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna sound crazy,</v>

4068
01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:33.270
<v Speaker 1>but would you be interested in fighting Wesley's times?</v>

4069
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I want it.</v>

4070
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:34.740
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

4071
01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:37.710
<v Speaker 1>And so then they start explaining what's going on and I was training,</v>

4072
01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:38.930
<v Speaker 1>how long ago was this?</v>

4073
01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.610
<v Speaker 1>2006 so blade was,</v>

4074
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:43.283
<v Speaker 1>he did make blade.</v>

4075
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.780
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4076
01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:44.870
<v Speaker 1>that would scare me out of the fight,</v>

4077
01:38:44.871 --> 01:38:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

4078
01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.193
<v Speaker 1>What was going on?</v>

4079
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I think what was going on was that he,</v>

4080
01:38:49.291 --> 01:38:52.410
<v Speaker 1>the IRS was coming down on them hard and he's looking for cash.</v>

4081
01:38:52.411 --> 01:38:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4082
01:38:52.770 --> 01:38:54.880
<v Speaker 1>he was looking at trialing unathletic by the,</v>

4083
01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:55.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4084
01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:59.520
<v Speaker 1>he knows martial arts but never competed and no Jujitsu.</v>

4085
01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:04.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think he just thought it was just a wrapper and then somewhere along the</v>

4086
01:39:04.261 --> 01:39:04.890
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

4087
01:39:04.890 --> 01:39:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened,</v>

4088
01:39:05.761 --> 01:39:07.290
<v Speaker 1>but he just decided not to do it.</v>

4089
01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:08.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4090
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I think if you've never competed your whole life and you have these ideas,</v>

4091
01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:14.490
<v Speaker 1>plus I think he's probably hanging around with a bunch of dudes who are taking</v>

4092
01:39:14.491 --> 01:39:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Bolivian marching powder and like,</v>

4093
01:39:16.141 --> 01:39:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

4094
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:20.580
<v Speaker 1>he's going to have fucking time to make your money money.</v>

4095
01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:24.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of motherfuckers out there doing that karate,</v>

4096
01:39:24.841 --> 01:39:26.160
<v Speaker 1>doing all kinds of martial arts,</v>

4097
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:27.121
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what,</v>

4098
01:39:27.121 --> 01:39:27.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4099
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you got something special inside you broke,</v>

4100
01:39:29.411 --> 01:39:30.780
<v Speaker 1>this is your time to shine.</v>

4101
01:39:30.781 --> 01:39:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Heart of a lion and trunk from blade and doing all these stunts was like,</v>

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Well if you talked to pat and Oswald Patton Oswald did blade with him and</v>

4105
01:39:39.961 --> 01:39:44.660
<v Speaker 1>apparently there was just bags of cocaine involved making of that.</v>

4106
01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4108
01:39:46.521 --> 01:39:47.220

4120
01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.950
<v Speaker 1>hired a double to do all the scenes.</v>

4121
01:40:01.951 --> 01:40:03.060
<v Speaker 1>There was another guy,</v>

4122

<v Speaker 1>so he did nothing movie.</v>

4123

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened,</v>

4125
01:40:05.881 --> 01:40:09.300
<v Speaker 1>but half that movie like Patton Oswald has a whole bit about how they brought in</v>

01:41:53.081 --> 01:41:53.914
<v Speaker 1>I like eating it,</v>

4188
01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.510
<v Speaker 1>eating it and enrolling.</v>

4189
01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes me more sensitive.</v>

4190
01:41:58.091 --> 01:41:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It makes me more aware of what's going on.</v>

4191
01:41:59.891 --> 01:42:00.681
<v Speaker 1>Makes some more focused.</v>

4192
01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:01.810
<v Speaker 1>I completely zone in.</v>

4193
01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.310
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys do Jujitsu.</v>

4194
01:42:03.311 --> 01:42:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lot of guys.</v>

4195
01:42:04.810 --> 01:42:05.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4196
01:42:05.161 --> 01:42:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4197
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:06.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware.</v>

4198
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:07.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just what your,</v>

4199
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I've never right.</v>

4200
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Remember Bro,</v>

4201
01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you if you did it,</v>

4202
01:42:10.751 --> 01:42:11.290
<v Speaker 1>you might not.</v>

4203
01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

4204
01:42:11.890 --> 01:42:15.160
<v Speaker 1>If you have some time off and you're do Jujitsu,</v>

4205
01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:15.760
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

4206
01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And so you know you're not going to get tested.</v>

4207
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:20.710
<v Speaker 1>You're not really going to smoke pot and it was all just joking around.</v>

4208
01:42:20.711 --> 01:42:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4209
01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Kind of joking around on the five cats.</v>

4210
01:42:22.661 --> 01:42:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Try once.</v>

4211
01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:24.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you you'd love it.</v>

4212
01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:25.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4213
01:42:25.391 --> 01:42:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you'd love it,</v>

4214
01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:27.760
<v Speaker 1>but I would assume you'd love it.</v>

4215
01:42:27.810 --> 01:42:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4216
01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo.</v>

4217
01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Those that every goddamn time.</v>

4218
01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn and it was a little high and last night</v>

4219
01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:37.240
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about the Shitty dad stories,</v>

4220
01:42:37.241 --> 01:42:39.770
<v Speaker 1>which I had nothing to contribute to homeboys.</v>

4221
01:42:39.810 --> 01:42:40.241
<v Speaker 1>One story.</v>

4222
01:42:40.241 --> 01:42:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It was awful.</v>

4223
01:42:41.530 --> 01:42:42.820
<v Speaker 1>He had a great damn long hair.</v>

4224
01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.220
<v Speaker 1>He kept trying to bring a story into it.</v>

4225
01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:45.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4226
01:42:45.491 --> 01:42:46.001
<v Speaker 1>that dude.</v>

4227
01:42:46.001 --> 01:42:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4228
01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:47.070
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible story.</v>

4229
01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I kept looking at it.</v>

4230
01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:48.401
<v Speaker 1>I kept looking for it.</v>

4231
01:42:48.401 --> 01:42:50.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like how often you talk to your dad and he goes every day.</v>

4232
01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:51.430
<v Speaker 1>But then I was like,</v>

4233
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.701
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4234
01:42:51.701 --> 01:42:53.530
<v Speaker 1>well your dad's very much in your life.</v>

4235
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:53.861
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4236
01:42:53.861 --> 01:42:54.071
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4237
01:42:54.071 --> 01:42:56.030
<v Speaker 1>but my dad's all success when he calls me.</v>

4238
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:58.030
<v Speaker 1>He tries to give me tips and shit as a nice guy.</v>

4239
01:42:58.031 --> 01:42:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So let's not talk too much about giving names.</v>

4240
01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:00.410
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

4241
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:01.960
<v Speaker 1>there was a little horrible story.</v>

4242
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.291
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

4243
01:43:02.291 --> 01:43:02.890
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

4244
01:43:02.890 --> 01:43:03.221
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4245
01:43:03.221 --> 01:43:04.930
<v Speaker 1>There's sometimes dudes get around,</v>

4246
01:43:04.931 --> 01:43:08.770
<v Speaker 1>guys like you guys to tell great stories and they try to throw their own story</v>

4247
01:43:08.771 --> 01:43:10.410
<v Speaker 1>in it and they don't realize their stories.</v>

4248
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4249

<v Speaker 1>Justin's story.</v>

4253
01:43:15.921 --> 01:43:17.770
<v Speaker 1>It was depressing as fuck my buddy Justin.</v>

01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:18.743
<v Speaker 1>It got dark,</v>

4255
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:19.271
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

4256
01:43:19.271 --> 01:43:19.571
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>

4257
01:43:19.571 --> 01:43:19.781

<v Speaker 1>my story is not as bad as his story is pretty dark.</v>

4260
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:23.260
<v Speaker 1>It's bad.</v>

4261
01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:24.340
<v Speaker 1>It's bad that,</v>

01:43:26.430 --> 01:43:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk your frickin air off.</v>

4266
01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say a word last night.</v>

4267
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't contribute.</v>

4268
01:43:31.691 --> 01:43:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4269
01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Can't contribute to the story.</v>

4270
01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.060
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not doing,</v>

4271
01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:37.030
<v Speaker 1>nothing's worse when then someone doesn't know what they're talking about and</v>

4272
01:43:37.031 --> 01:43:37.301
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

4273
01:43:37.301 --> 01:43:39.100
<v Speaker 1>especially with experiences like that,</v>

4274
01:43:39.101 --> 01:43:39.521
<v Speaker 1>my parents,</v>

4275
01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:41.740
<v Speaker 1>my dad loved the shit out of me straight up.</v>

4276
01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:44.230
<v Speaker 1>So when you guys talk about these shitty childhoods,</v>

4277
01:43:44.410 --> 01:43:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't really jump in.</v>

4278
01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4279
01:43:45.850 --> 01:43:46.930
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing worse when we got it.</v>

4280
01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:47.261
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4281
01:43:47.261 --> 01:43:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I hear that Bro.</v>

4282
01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I hear that.</v>

4283
01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:50.590
<v Speaker 1>One time I went to Mcdonald's.</v>

4284
01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:50.670
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4285
01:43:50.670 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 1>my dad buy me a fucking</v>

01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:53.720
<v Speaker 5>I feel you bro.</v>

4288
01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.490
<v Speaker 5>I always presents at Christmas.</v>

4289
01:43:55.491 --> 01:43:55.850
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4290
01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:56.230
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4291
01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:57.000
<v Speaker 5>There was no,</v>

4292
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:57.231
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4293
01:43:57.231 --> 01:43:58.220
<v Speaker 5>this is too much.</v>

4294
01:43:58.710 --> 01:43:59.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4295
01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.130
<v Speaker 5>Depressing childhood stories are rough.</v>

4296
01:44:01.190 --> 01:44:02.001
<v Speaker 5>They're hard to deal with.</v>

4297
01:44:02.001 --> 01:44:02.241
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

4298
01:44:02.241 --> 01:44:02.931
<v Speaker 5>the one dude's story,</v>

4299
01:44:02.931 --> 01:44:03.830
<v Speaker 5>it was not so good.</v>

4300
01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:05.050
<v Speaker 5>They compare it to me.</v>

4301
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:06.200
<v Speaker 5>Justice was horrible.</v>

4302
01:44:06.201 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 5>Mine wasn't the best,</v>

4303
01:44:07.371 --> 01:44:08.290
<v Speaker 5>and he's just horrible.</v>

4304
01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:09.153
<v Speaker 5>Trying not to laugh.</v>

4305
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.340
<v Speaker 5>I can't hide when I'm,</v>

4306
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:11.390
<v Speaker 5>when I think something's funny.</v>

4307
01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:14.660
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to not laugh at his story and he kept bringing it back in,</v>

4308
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:16.143
<v Speaker 5>even as frank,</v>

4309
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:17.910
<v Speaker 5>hey bro,</v>

4312
01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:19.041
<v Speaker 5>maybe pipe down.</v>

4313
01:44:19.041 --> 01:44:19.350
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

4314
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.700
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Fuck that.</v>

4317
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:23.240
<v Speaker 5>It sucks when Your Dad's disappointed in you.</v>

4318
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:28.160
<v Speaker 5>Sober up spilled spilled half a drink on my change.</v>

4319
01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:31.310
<v Speaker 5>As the day went on,</v>

4320
01:44:31.311 --> 01:44:32.270
<v Speaker 5>he got even more drunk.</v>

4321
01:44:32.530 --> 01:44:35.810
<v Speaker 5>Really trying to explain something to me later on that night.</v>

4322
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:36.980
<v Speaker 5>And it was tough.</v>

4323
01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:37.431
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

4324
01:44:37.431 --> 01:44:39.560
<v Speaker 5>he was like waking up from anesthesia</v>

4325
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:42.183
<v Speaker 5>something to me.</v>

01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.520
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4329
01:44:45.231 --> 01:44:45.651
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

4330
01:44:45.651 --> 01:44:46.011
<v Speaker 5>I get it.</v>

4331

4476
01:47:52.371 --> 01:47:53.420
<v Speaker 5>We started killing bitches.</v>

4477
01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:55.760
<v Speaker 5>There's no stuttering when you're ordering Stan.</v>

4478
01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:56.900
<v Speaker 5>Stan is very direct,</v>

4479
01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.240
<v Speaker 5>I guess that going over the final,</v>

4480
01:47:59.241 --> 01:48:01.670
<v Speaker 5>they're going to show Eddie Gordon and Diego Lima again.</v>

4481
01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:02.331
<v Speaker 5>Why are they showing that?</v>

4482
01:48:02.331 --> 01:48:03.330
<v Speaker 5>We did and they just showed us the,</v>

4483
01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:04.351
<v Speaker 5>they're killing a little.</v>

4484
01:48:04.351 --> 01:48:06.230
<v Speaker 5>I just solid why you be showing this?</v>

4485
01:48:06.231 --> 01:48:08.240
<v Speaker 5>Because the last fight was a one round knockout too.</v>

4486
01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:10.400
<v Speaker 5>You know there's a lot of knockouts on this guy,</v>

4487
01:48:10.401 --> 01:48:10.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4488
01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:11.241
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

4489
01:48:11.241 --> 01:48:12.310
<v Speaker 5>Gordon cracks</v>

4490
01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:15.320
<v Speaker 5>and tell you what man,</v>

4491
01:48:15.321 --> 01:48:16.910
<v Speaker 5>Diego Lima is tough as shit.</v>

4492
01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.360
<v Speaker 5>You know the the kind of punishment to watch your head containing going to be</v>

4493
01:48:20.361 --> 01:48:20.810
<v Speaker 5>fun,</v>

4494
01:48:20.810 --> 01:48:21.291
<v Speaker 5>angry.</v>

4495
01:48:21.291 --> 01:48:22.820
<v Speaker 5>This is where it should have stopped right there.</v>

4496
01:48:22.821 --> 01:48:24.290
<v Speaker 5>I think Gordon looks so angry.</v>

4497
01:48:24.291 --> 01:48:25.210
<v Speaker 5>This is like a,</v>

4498
01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:28.700
<v Speaker 5>if you wanted to like talk about how evil cage fighting is.</v>

4505
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:40.790
<v Speaker 5>when they will start looking back in the future about when society crumbled and</v>

4506
01:48:40.791 --> 01:48:45.170
<v Speaker 5>when this is like the first steps they were talking about rolling return to the</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4584
01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:48.221
<v Speaker 1>Ian Mccall,</v>

4585
01:50:48.221 --> 01:50:48.521
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

4586
01:50:48.521 --> 01:50:49.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4587
01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:49.541
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

4588
01:50:49.541 --> 01:50:49.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4589
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:52.600
<v Speaker 1>he went with Bj down to down to,</v>

4590
01:50:52.601 --> 01:50:52.721
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4591
01:50:52.721 --> 01:50:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Hilo to train with them.</v>

4592
01:50:53.831 --> 01:50:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Does it train?</v>

4593
01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:56.080
<v Speaker 1>He said Bj's in incredible shape.</v>

4594
01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:00.400
<v Speaker 1>He said Ian has fantastic endurance.</v>

4595
01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And he said Bj was,</v>

4596
01:51:01.961 --> 01:51:02.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4597
01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:03.130
<v Speaker 1>was out working at me.</v>

4598
01:51:03.131 --> 01:51:05.470
<v Speaker 1>He said he was blown away by how good a shape Bj's in.</v>

4599
01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:05.861
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

4600
01:51:05.861 --> 01:51:07.410
<v Speaker 1>I've heard this a million fucking times.</v>

4601
01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.220
<v Speaker 1>We find out here this literally every fight,</v>

4602
01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:10.300
<v Speaker 1>every time.</v>

4603
01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:13.420
<v Speaker 1>But what blew me away about this is that first of all,</v>

4604
01:51:13.421 --> 01:51:14.650
<v Speaker 1>they're going to fight at one 45.</v>

4605
01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:15.820
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a disaster.</v>

4606
01:51:15.821 --> 01:51:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Bj Soria Zombie was making one 55 but whatever he did,</v>

4607
01:51:20.051 --> 01:51:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he adjusted.</v>

4608
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I would love to talk to him about how he changed his body.</v>

4609
01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:28.780
<v Speaker 1>But he got down where he was walking around like under one 60 I got a regular</v>

4610
01:51:28.781 --> 01:51:33.781
<v Speaker 1>basis and then the fight week he was one 49 fight week without any cutting.</v>

4611
01:51:34.690 --> 01:51:34.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4612
01:51:34.931 --> 01:51:39.931
<v Speaker 1>And then he easily made one 45 Frankie weighed one 45.5 BJ weighed one 45 on the</v>

4613
01:51:40.421 --> 01:51:40.751
<v Speaker 1>nugget.</v>

4614
01:51:40.751 --> 01:51:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Look good at the weigh ins and chase.</v>

4615
01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:43.280
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

4616
01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It look skinny,</v>

4617
01:51:44.110 --> 01:51:47.110
<v Speaker 1>but he had trouble making 55 beats and then I didn't know that.</v>

4618
01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4619
01:51:48.110 --> 01:51:49.320
<v Speaker 1>He's not taught well.</v>

4620
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:51.040
<v Speaker 1>That's why I fought one 70 all the time.</v>

4621
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:52.390
<v Speaker 1>He fought Nick Diaz,</v>

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.033
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn,</v>

4629
01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:00.731
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn,</v>

4630
01:52:00.731 --> 01:52:01.564
<v Speaker 1>as far as,</v>

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.370
<v Speaker 1>he's a super star,</v>

4632
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:07.060
<v Speaker 1>he is up as big as they get superstar the most down to earth.</v>

4633
01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Nicest Guy I've ever met in the UFC.</v>

4634
01:52:09.341 --> 01:52:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Hands Down Bj.</v>

4635
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:13.540
<v Speaker 1>He's assaulted the earth and these are real warrior,</v>

4636
01:52:13.541 --> 01:52:14.374
<v Speaker 1>but you know what man,</v>

4637
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:18.660
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy that has an incredible amount of pride and you know he,</v>

4638
01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:19.523
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4639
01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:21.100
<v Speaker 1>he's got a lot of ego.</v>

4640
01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:22.120
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of pride.</v>

4641
01:52:22.121 --> 01:52:22.970
<v Speaker 1>He loves he,</v>

4642
01:52:22.971 --> 01:52:23.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4643
01:52:23.231 --> 01:52:26.290
<v Speaker 1>he wants to get in there and be the Bj that he used to be.</v>

4644
01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why.</v>

4645
01:52:27.010 --> 01:52:28.000
<v Speaker 1>That's why he is who he is.</v>

4646
01:52:28.001 --> 01:52:29.470
<v Speaker 1>He don't get to that point where they'll have an ego.</v>

4647
01:52:29.471 --> 01:52:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

4648
01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 1>everyone who fights in the EOC has an ego.</v>

4649
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:36.430
<v Speaker 1>But if he could use that and motivate himself to get back in and kind of shape</v>

4650
01:52:36.431 --> 01:52:36.521
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4651
01:52:36.521 --> 01:52:38.750
<v Speaker 1>He was back when he fought Diego Sanchez back.</v>

4652
01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:42.910
<v Speaker 1>We fought Sean Sherk and he was in insane condition back.</v>

4653
01:52:42.911 --> 01:52:43.780
<v Speaker 1>How old is he now?</v>

4654
01:52:44.130 --> 01:52:44.531
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to,</v>

4655
01:52:44.531 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 1>35 six how</v>

4656
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.300
<v Speaker 2>old do you think he's 42 he's Dwayne.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Brian Thinks Bj Penn's 21 years old.</v>

4658

<v Speaker 2>He's the rock scene.</v>

4659
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:55.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he was 36 right?</v>

4660
01:52:55.690 --> 01:52:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I would say 30 thirties for sure.</v>

4749
01:54:53.661 --> 01:54:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Mark Henry I worked with,</v>

4750
01:54:54.631 --> 01:54:55.520
<v Speaker 2>before I fought cro cop,</v>

4751
01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I flew up to New Jersey with his camp.</v>

4757
01:55:05.121 --> 01:55:06.560
<v Speaker 2>If you watch Mark Henry in the corner,</v>

4758
01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.380
<v Speaker 2>he's drenched in sweat by the end of the fight.</v>

4759
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:14.240
<v Speaker 2>It's literally like he has a control stick and he's doing this with Frankie.</v>

4760
01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:15.890
<v Speaker 2>He just shouting out Frankie.</v>

4761
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:18.110
<v Speaker 2>They have a whole system and code.</v>

4762
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:19.220
<v Speaker 2>He'll go one three,</v>

4763
01:55:19.221 --> 01:55:19.401
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

4764
01:55:19.401 --> 01:55:19.731
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

4767
01:55:20.271 --> 01:55:23.150
<v Speaker 2>five and it changes every fight so he can't pick up on it.</v>

4768
01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:28.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like his coach is Peyton manning and is running the offense and he's so</v>

4769
01:55:28.101 --> 01:55:31.790
<v Speaker 2>nervous before the fight because he feels like it's banking on him because he</v>

4770
01:55:31.791 --> 01:55:33.470
<v Speaker 2>calls every combination.</v>

4771
01:55:33.471 --> 01:55:34.060
<v Speaker 2>You see.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Jersey shore came out and was like heat.</v>

01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:07.230
<v Speaker 5>I was working his basement.</v>

4802
01:56:07.231 --> 01:56:08.280
<v Speaker 5>I worked with them so much.</v>

4803
01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:09.293
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4804
01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:12.680
<v Speaker 5>the calluses on my feet were ripping off because I'd worked in his basement</v>

4805
01:56:12.690 --> 01:56:13.590
<v Speaker 5>nonstop at night.</v>

4806
01:56:13.591 --> 01:56:15.900
<v Speaker 5>I only did the guy's work ethic is insane.</v>

4807
01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:19.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's another coach in the world who works hard in the Markin.</v>

4808
01:56:19.290 --> 01:56:20.101
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4809
01:56:20.101 --> 01:56:20.820
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>

4810
01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:21.151
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4811
01:56:21.151 --> 01:56:22.440
<v Speaker 5>so you really get enough credit.</v>

4812
01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:23.160
<v Speaker 5>No kidding.</v>

4813
01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:23.850
<v Speaker 5>You don't get enough credit.</v>

4814
01:56:23.850 --> 01:56:24.690
<v Speaker 5>I was getting it from you.</v>

4815
01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:26.760
<v Speaker 5>Did you think about moving down that you really did?</v>

4816
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:27.540
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

4817
01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:28.260
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

4818
01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:29.460
<v Speaker 5>but there wasn't big guys.</v>

4819
01:56:29.530 --> 01:56:31.500
<v Speaker 5>There was no big guys around anyone.</v>

4820
01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:32.040
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

4821
01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:32.821
<v Speaker 5>that's a big thing.</v>

4822
01:56:32.821 --> 01:56:33.654
<v Speaker 5>And that's a bummer.</v>

4823
01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:34.613
<v Speaker 5>A super bummer.</v>

4824
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:37.770
<v Speaker 5>Do you base where you trained by the size of the guys?</v>

4825
01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:39.000
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4826
01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.650
<v Speaker 5>I base on it on,</v>

4827
01:56:40.651 --> 01:56:41.070
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

4828
01:56:41.070 --> 01:56:41.903
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4829
01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:46.440
<v Speaker 5>the coaches first I find the coaches and then I always think that at least if</v>

4830
01:56:46.441 --> 01:56:47.670
<v Speaker 5>there's big guys in the area,</v>

4831
01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:47.990
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

4832
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:49.770
<v Speaker 5>I'll at least get to him somehow.</v>

4833
01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:53.340
<v Speaker 5>And honestly I thought me and for doing would work together more.</v>

4834
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.990
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

4835
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4836
01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:56.910
<v Speaker 5>when I first came out to give it like a trial run,</v>

4837
01:56:57.150 --> 01:56:58.900
<v Speaker 5>there was word that means we're doing,</v>

4838
01:56:58.901 --> 01:56:59.581
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna fight each other.</v>

4839
01:56:59.581 --> 01:57:01.830
<v Speaker 5>And me and him started talking shit to each other on Twitter and got out of</v>

4840
01:57:01.831 --> 01:57:02.070
<v Speaker 5>hand.</v>

4841
01:57:02.070 --> 01:57:03.180
<v Speaker 5>He texts me or tweeting me,</v>

4842
01:57:03.181 --> 01:57:03.600
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4843
01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.010

4844
01:57:05.210 --> 01:57:06.150
<v Speaker 5>And I put okay,</v>

4845
01:57:06.151 --> 01:57:07.650
<v Speaker 5>or we can just do in Las Vegas.</v>

4846
01:57:07.651 --> 01:57:08.700
<v Speaker 5>September 21st,</v>

4847

4848
01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:10.373
<v Speaker 5>Save your money.</v>

4849
01:57:10.530 --> 01:57:11.070
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4850
01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:13.140
<v Speaker 5>like rockets are expensive.</v>

4851
01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:13.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

01:57:14.191 --> 01:57:14.421
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

4854
01:57:14.421 --> 01:57:15.100
<v Speaker 5>rocket fuel,</v>

4855
01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:16.070
<v Speaker 5>super expensive.</v>

4856
01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:17.610
<v Speaker 5>You can't just do it in Las Vegas,</v>

4857
01:57:17.611 --> 01:57:18.444
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

4858
01:57:19.710 --> 01:57:20.880
<v Speaker 5>Definitely won that battle.</v>

4859
01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:21.973
<v Speaker 5>Awkward.</v>

4860
01:57:22.290 --> 01:57:22.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4861
01:57:22.471 --> 01:57:23.580

4862
01:57:23.581 --> 01:57:24.241

4865
01:57:26.341 --> 01:57:27.390
<v Speaker 5>So he doesn't want to work together.</v>

4866
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.673
<v Speaker 5>Great guy though.</v>

4867
01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:30.121

4873
01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:35.550
<v Speaker 5>Are you paying attention?</v>

4874
01:57:35.970 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 5>But you hear the train with him?</v>

4875

4883
01:57:47.091 --> 01:57:49.230
<v Speaker 5>He gets so emotional sometimes he cries when he walks out.</v>

4884
01:57:49.231 --> 01:57:50.064

4887
01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:55.470
<v Speaker 5>Looking at them just looking at his face gets me fired up.</v>

4888
01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:56.040
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

4889

4976
01:59:46.670 --> 01:59:49.660
<v Speaker 2>I would have paid double for my air ticket today to get home.</v>

4977
01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:50.650
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But are all the fighters that I wish I'd seen live?</v>

<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's way thinner and they're finding it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There was on the rock.</v>

5020
02:00:57.191 --> 02:00:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Straight up.</v>

5021
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:59.200
<v Speaker 2>He is a living legend.</v>

5022
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5023
02:00:59.951 --> 02:01:00.701
<v Speaker 2>you like Bruce Lee.</v>

5024
02:01:00.701 --> 02:01:00.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5025
02:01:00.821 --> 02:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>we got Bj Penn fight right now.</v>

5026
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5027
02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:03.670
<v Speaker 2>he's actually competing.</v>

5028
02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:05.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of Bruce Lee too,</v>

5029
02:01:05.711 --> 02:01:08.260
<v Speaker 2>but I think all this Bruce Lee talks getting out of hand.</v>

5030
02:01:08.290 --> 02:01:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I agree with my song in the octagon.</v>

5031
02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:10.991
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

5032
02:01:10.991 --> 02:01:12.430
<v Speaker 2>people were saying he's greatest,</v>

5033
02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:12.641
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

5034
02:01:12.641 --> 02:01:12.921
<v Speaker 2>the gray.</v>

5035
02:01:12.921 --> 02:01:16.210
<v Speaker 2>So He's a very good actor at some really good ideas that marsh did some great</v>

5036
02:01:16.211 --> 02:01:16.660
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

5037
02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:18.250
<v Speaker 2>did some great stuff with g Condo,</v>

5038
02:01:18.251 --> 02:01:19.084
<v Speaker 2>but however,</v>

5039
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:21.190
<v Speaker 2>he never officially competed.</v>

5040
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:22.570
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing on record.</v>

5041
02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:23.873
<v Speaker 2>Last I said,</v>

5042
02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I think I said this on my podcast,</v>

5043
02:01:25.461 --> 02:01:26.590
<v Speaker 2>the fight fighting the kid or in yours,</v>

5044
02:01:26.591 --> 02:01:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>

5045
02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:28.480
<v Speaker 2>People bombard me with tweets,</v>

5046
02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:28.601
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5047
02:01:28.601 --> 02:01:29.434
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>

5048
02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:30.041
<v Speaker 2>No Man,</v>

5049
02:01:30.041 --> 02:01:31.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm stating the facts.</v>

5055
02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:38.490

<v Speaker 2>talk about Heman and Bj Penn.</v>

02:01:41.261 --> 02:01:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Keep it.</v>

5060
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:42.930
<v Speaker 2>One's a warrior.</v>

5061
02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:43.731
<v Speaker 2>One's an actor.</v>

5062
02:01:43.731 --> 02:01:44.564
<v Speaker 2>One's a warrior.</v>

5063
02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5064
02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

5065
02:01:45.150 --> 02:01:46.220
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

5066
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:47.720
<v Speaker 2>he was hugely important.</v>

5067
02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Lee's hugely important.</v>

5068
02:01:49.281 --> 02:01:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge Bruce Lee fan.</v>

5069
02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:53.510
<v Speaker 2>He was the original mixed martial artists.</v>

5070
02:01:53.511 --> 02:01:58.511
<v Speaker 2>He was the first guy and when I came along in the 1980s when I was doing martial</v>

5071
02:01:58.851 --> 02:01:59.061
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>

5072
02:01:59.061 --> 02:01:59.894
<v Speaker 2>when I first started,</v>

5073
02:02:00.170 --> 02:02:03.590
<v Speaker 2>they still had this issue where people were loyal to their style,</v>

5074
02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:05.150
<v Speaker 2>who still got a lot of that man.</v>

5075
02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:09.050
<v Speaker 2>And Bruce Lee was the very first guy and it was even before I was started</v>

5076
02:02:09.051 --> 02:02:09.620
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

5077
02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:11.480
<v Speaker 2>The very first guy who came along and said,</v>

5078
02:02:11.481 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>that's all nonsense,</v>

5079
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:14.300
<v Speaker 2>like you should use what's useful.</v>

5080
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:18.260
<v Speaker 2>And he built his own style that was based on incorporating all these different</v>

5081
02:02:18.261 --> 02:02:20.780
<v Speaker 2>martial turn martial arts into a business.</v>

5082
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:22.760
<v Speaker 2>And then the dragon,</v>

5083
02:02:22.761 --> 02:02:24.140
<v Speaker 2>he actually does an arm bar too.</v>

5084
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:24.681
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

5085
02:02:24.681 --> 02:02:25.101
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

5086
02:02:25.101 --> 02:02:25.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5087
02:02:25.251 --> 02:02:26.630
<v Speaker 2>he worked out a lot with gene,</v>

5088
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:30.770
<v Speaker 2>a gene Lebell Gene Lebell labelle's on the podcast told me some great stories.</v>

5089
02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:31.911
<v Speaker 2>That's classic.</v>

5090
02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5093
02:02:33.291 --> 02:02:38.291
<v Speaker 2>And he was like 530530557 35 they still really don't know how he died,</v>

5094
02:02:39.141 --> 02:02:39.351
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5095
02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:41.360
<v Speaker 2>They say mixed like hamstring with painkillers.</v>

5096
02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:42.740

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He had a headache.</v>

5107
02:02:57.441 --> 02:02:58.850
<v Speaker 2>He took aspirin and then we went home.</v>

5108
02:02:58.851 --> 02:03:00.410
<v Speaker 2>He took a painkiller and it killed him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5131
02:03:40.841 --> 02:03:42.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this fight's about to go down.</v>

5132
02:03:42.521 --> 02:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>This is so exciting.</v>

5133
02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:44.051
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that.</v>

5134
02:03:44.051 --> 02:03:44.884
<v Speaker 2>Fighting it again.</v>

5135

<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

5136
02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Death League collapsed in Golden Harvest Studios and Hong Kong while doing</v>

<v Speaker 2>dubbing work for enter the dragon suffering from seizures and headaches.</v>

5138
02:03:54.371 --> 02:03:58.120
<v Speaker 2>He was immediately rushed to Hong Kong Baptist hospitals where doctors treated</v>

5139
02:03:58.121 --> 02:04:00.100
<v Speaker 2>him with chicken bones and Voodoo.</v>

5140
02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:00.400

5145
02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5146
02:04:10.030 --> 02:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>he had a cerebral edema.</v>

5147
02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:13.570
<v Speaker 2>They were able to reduce the swelling.</v>

5148
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5149
02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:15.371
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

5150
02:04:15.371 --> 02:04:17.260
<v Speaker 2>So he had bleeding in the brain,</v>

5151
02:04:17.261 --> 02:04:18.094
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5152
02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:19.241
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5154
02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:21.110
<v Speaker 2>And then when they reduced the,</v>

5155
02:04:21.111 --> 02:04:22.240
<v Speaker 2>so that was in May,</v>

5156
02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:23.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5157
02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:28.260
<v Speaker 2>the same symptoms that occurred in his first collapse where a repeated on the</v>

5158
02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>day of his death in 1973,</v>

5159
02:04:30.581 --> 02:04:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Lee was in Hong Kong to have dinner with James Bond Start,</v>

5160
02:04:33.071 --> 02:04:34.240
<v Speaker 2>George Lazenby,</v>

5161
02:04:34.630 --> 02:04:36.190
<v Speaker 2>whom he intended to make a film.</v>

5162
02:04:36.190 --> 02:04:37.060
<v Speaker 2>According to Lee's wife,</v>

5163
02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:39.270
<v Speaker 2>he met with producer Raymond Chow at 2:00 PM,</v>

5164
02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:40.620
<v Speaker 2>discussed the making of the film.</v>

5165
02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:42.340
<v Speaker 2>They worked until 4:00 PM,</v>

5166
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:44.970
<v Speaker 2>drove together at home to the home of Lee's,</v>

5167
02:04:44.971 --> 02:04:46.020
<v Speaker 2>a colleague,</v>

5168
02:04:46.021 --> 02:04:46.431
<v Speaker 2>Blah Bubba,</v>

5169
02:04:46.431 --> 02:04:46.541
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

5170
02:04:46.541 --> 02:04:46.620
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

5171
02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:47.400
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

5172
02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Three went over the script and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.</v>

5173
02:04:50.821 --> 02:04:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Lead complained of a headache.</v>

5174
02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Teen gave him a,</v>

5175
02:04:54.091 --> 02:04:59.091
<v Speaker 2>an analgesic painkiller which contained aspirin and a monk's muscle relaxing</v>

5176
02:04:59.610 --> 02:05:01.500
<v Speaker 2>around seven 30 went to lie down for a nap.</v>

5177
02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:03.000
<v Speaker 2>He did not turn out for dinner.</v>

5178
02:05:03.001 --> 02:05:06.180
<v Speaker 2>She came to the apartment but could not wake him up at doctor was summoned,</v>

5179
02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:10.260
<v Speaker 2>spent 10 minutes attempting to revive him before sending him to an ambulance.</v>

5180
02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:12.480
<v Speaker 2>He was dead at the time we reached the hospital.</v>

5181
02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:14.310
<v Speaker 2>There's no visible external injury.</v>

5182
02:05:14.311 --> 02:05:14.641
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

5183
02:05:14.641 --> 02:05:16.140
<v Speaker 2>according to autopsy reports,</v>

5184
02:05:16.141 --> 02:05:18.210
<v Speaker 2>his brain had swollen considerably.</v>

5185
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:20.880
<v Speaker 2>So it was probably from fucking brain injuries from,</v>

5186
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:24.930
<v Speaker 2>from getting a beating like concussion style could Bei man,</v>

5187
02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:25.973
<v Speaker 2>hey.</v>

5188
02:05:26.610 --> 02:05:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5189
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:27.893
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5190
02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:32.240
<v Speaker 2>The doctor stated that he had died from an allergic reaction to the muscle relax</v>

5191
02:05:32.241 --> 02:05:37.241
<v Speaker 2>and which he described as a common ingredient in painkillers.</v>

5192
02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:40.170

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.093
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>

5340
02:08:56.780 --> 02:08:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

02:08:57.600 --> 02:08:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Why else would you be I tippy toes?</v>

5342
02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Inviting a take down.</v>

5343
02:09:00.750 --> 02:09:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's it.</v>

5344
02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:02.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat,</v>

5345
02:09:02.150 --> 02:09:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

5346
02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:04.500
<v Speaker 2>And he's not kicking the get up either.</v>

5347
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Izzy?</v>

5348
02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:06.493
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5349
02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Did you notice that work when he was throwing punches?</v>

5350
02:09:08.311 --> 02:09:09.091
<v Speaker 2>When he's hitting the,</v>

5351
02:09:09.091 --> 02:09:09.171
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5352
02:09:09.171 --> 02:09:11.070
<v Speaker 2>the pads in the preview?</v>

5353
02:09:11.250 --> 02:09:13.380
<v Speaker 2>He was like standing straight up to it was weird.</v>

5354
02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5355
02:09:13.490 --> 02:09:15.660
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it was because it was just fucking around,</v>

5356
02:09:15.661 --> 02:09:15.841
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5357
02:09:15.841 --> 02:09:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5358
02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5359
02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:17.341
<v Speaker 2>I thought so too.</v>

5360
02:09:17.341 --> 02:09:20.150
<v Speaker 2>But it's almost like he's changed his style a little bit.</v>

5361
02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:22.200
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he brought in someone new to work with it.</v>

5362
02:09:22.201 --> 02:09:23.520
<v Speaker 2>He's got a philosophy behind it.</v>

5363
02:09:23.521 --> 02:09:24.570
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to write.</v>

5364
02:09:24.571 --> 02:09:26.370
<v Speaker 2>You can't just switch it up for no reason.</v>

5365
02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:26.761
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5366
02:09:26.761 --> 02:09:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he had a vision.</v>

5367
02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:29.240
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

5368

<v Speaker 2>I was in the ocean.</v>

5372
02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:33.373
<v Speaker 2>I had a vision.</v>

5373
02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:40.940
<v Speaker 2>I took our rock and went under the water then that now your sound.</v>

02:09:48.530 --> 02:09:50.210
<v Speaker 2>But Frankie's not trying to let them up either.</v>

5384
02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:53.390
<v Speaker 2>It's weird friends to try to turn that corner back in.</v>

5385
02:09:53.391 --> 02:09:56.330
<v Speaker 2>The guard is trying to pass this butterfly and Jay has good luck with that.</v>

02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:06.860
<v Speaker 2>usually gets people's morale of the icon.</v>

5393
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:10.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of room to move while he's sweeps guys and takes their back.</v>

5394
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5395
02:10:10.671 --> 02:10:11.540
<v Speaker 2>he always gets their back.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And locking guys up with one arm trapped.</v>

5401
02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:19.460
<v Speaker 2>He's a master at that one arm trapped.</v>

5402
02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

<v Speaker 2>He could literally get up right then.</v>

5408
02:10:26.570 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 2>It seems like he doesn't want,</v>

02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:13.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5485
02:12:13.111 --> 02:12:15.780
<v Speaker 2>but Bj's got its feet practically touching each other.</v>

5486
02:12:15.810 --> 02:12:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Bj,</v>

5487
02:12:16.210 --> 02:12:18.120
<v Speaker 2>its feet are touching you and he's tippy toes.</v>

5488
02:12:18.450 --> 02:12:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5489
02:12:18.750 --> 02:12:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

5490
02:12:19.110 --> 02:12:20.370
<v Speaker 2>nice left hook by Frankie.</v>

5491
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Good combination.</v>

5492
02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Just what's going to happen tomorrow.</v>

5493
02:12:22.321 --> 02:12:22.531
<v Speaker 2>Kids.</v>

5494
02:12:22.531 --> 02:12:23.880
<v Speaker 2>He me in the gym on their tippy toes.</v>

5495
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Probably Guaranteeing Copycat League,</v>

5496
02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:27.360
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5497
02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:27.840
<v Speaker 2>pee break.</v>

5498
02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Really interested to see how this plays out.</v>

5499
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:33.060
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to get that first round of Frankie.</v>

5500
02:12:33.061 --> 02:12:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Frankie took them down 100% Frankie definitely landed more shots.</v>

5501
02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Bj was able to stifle him in the guard,</v>

5502
02:12:40.021 --> 02:12:41.730
<v Speaker 2>but Frankie kick the shit out of his legs.</v>

5503
02:12:41.731 --> 02:12:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I Frankie's landed more kicks take down,</v>

5504
02:12:44.431 --> 02:12:45.510
<v Speaker 2>controlled him on the ground.</v>

5505
02:12:45.511 --> 02:12:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Although he's trying to pass.</v>

5506
02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:47.313
<v Speaker 2>Didn't happen.</v>

5507
02:12:47.490 --> 02:12:48.323
<v Speaker 2>See how did,</v>

5508
02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:51.900
<v Speaker 2>let's see how if you're a judge when it goes to the ground,</v>

5509
02:12:51.901 --> 02:12:53.730
<v Speaker 2>you can't pass and no damage.</v>

5510
02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5511
02:12:55.170 --> 02:12:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Bj gets no recognition for that.</v>

5512
02:12:57.271 --> 02:12:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Zero as a judge.</v>

5513
02:12:58.800 --> 02:12:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5514
02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:00.030
<v Speaker 2>totally true.</v>

5515
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5516
02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5517
02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:02.331
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean any,</v>

5518
02:13:02.331 --> 02:13:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5519
02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:04.320
<v Speaker 2>but defense nothing in a fight.</v>

5520
02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5521
02:13:04.890 --> 02:13:05.251
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

5522
02:13:05.251 --> 02:13:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

5523
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:06.390
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5524
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:07.223
<v Speaker 2>I know you're saying,</v>

5525
02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:07.531
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5526
02:13:07.531 --> 02:13:08.520
<v Speaker 2>you know what it really is,</v>

5527
02:13:08.521 --> 02:13:08.851
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5528
02:13:08.851 --> 02:13:11.250
<v Speaker 2>the system should be 30 points.</v>

5529
02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:12.480
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be a 10 point system.</v>

5530
02:13:12.490 --> 02:13:16.080
<v Speaker 2>You should really write a 30 point system and they should take into account</v>

5531
02:13:16.081 --> 02:13:19.290
<v Speaker 2>striking grappling submissions.</v>

5532
02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:19.471
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5533
02:13:19.471 --> 02:13:24.060
<v Speaker 2>all those three things should be taken into account and that,</v>

5534
02:13:24.330 --> 02:13:24.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5535
02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:26.790
<v Speaker 2>in the maybe 10 points each side,</v>

5536
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:30.450
<v Speaker 2>like maybe one guy gets 10 points for grappling,</v>

5537
02:13:30.451 --> 02:13:32.460
<v Speaker 2>the other guy gets it's 10 points.</v>

5538
02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:33.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5539
02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:34.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5540
02:13:35.070 --> 02:13:37.350
<v Speaker 2>At what point are they going to make the change?</v>

5541
02:13:37.590 --> 02:13:37.891
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5542
02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't think in my life then.</v>

5543
02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

5544
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5545
02:13:40.681 --> 02:13:41.514
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

5546
02:13:41.630 --> 02:13:45.510
<v Speaker 2>They're actually looking at some alternative scoring methods now they've,</v>

5547
02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:46.380
<v Speaker 2>they've discussed it.</v>

5548
02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean the UFC is very aware of it.</v>

5549
02:13:47.971 --> 02:13:49.020
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see them do something.</v>

5550
02:13:49.070 --> 02:13:51.450
<v Speaker 2>It can you see Mark Henry in the back yelling?</v>

5551
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.751
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5552
02:13:51.751 --> 02:13:52.584
<v Speaker 2>I can't see.</v>

5553
02:13:52.650 --> 02:13:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5554
02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:52.991
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5555
02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:53.221
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5556
02:13:53.221 --> 02:13:54.180
<v Speaker 2>He's calling nonstop.</v>

5557
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:55.950
<v Speaker 2>He wants like cakes.</v>

5558
02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Interesting fight man.</v>

5559
02:13:59.011 --> 02:13:59.581
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

5560
02:13:59.581 --> 02:14:00.414
<v Speaker 2>So far.</v>

5561
02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Let me see if Bj gets it.</v>

5562
02:14:02.221 --> 02:14:02.641
<v Speaker 2>His groove.</v>

5563
02:14:02.641 --> 02:14:03.391
<v Speaker 2>He's in good shape.</v>

5564
02:14:03.391 --> 02:14:05.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that man in this second round.</v>

5565
02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:05.913
<v Speaker 2>Still looking good.</v>

5566
02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Good overhand right with Frankie.</v>

5567
02:14:07.410 --> 02:14:07.801
<v Speaker 2>I like our,</v>

5568
02:14:07.801 --> 02:14:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Frankie does that goes to the single makes look,</v>

5569
02:14:10.061 --> 02:14:10.950
<v Speaker 2>he's going to struggle for it.</v>

5570
02:14:10.951 --> 02:14:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Disengages and Mark Henry's thing and they did it the first time BJ fought.</v>

5571
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:15.151
<v Speaker 2>What would they do?</v>

5572
02:14:15.151 --> 02:14:16.830
<v Speaker 2>He's so good at defend that single leg.</v>

5573
02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:20.250
<v Speaker 2>They're just attempting it so Bj reacts so they can land a left hook.</v>

5574
02:14:20.850 --> 02:14:21.121
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5575
02:14:21.121 --> 02:14:22.050
<v Speaker 2>we tagged them in the right.</v>

5576
02:14:23.970 --> 02:14:24.661
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

5577
02:14:24.661 --> 02:14:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>

5578
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:28.410
<v Speaker 2>If you're Bj though,</v>

5579
02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:29.273
<v Speaker 2>what are you telling them?</v>

5580
02:14:29.330 --> 02:14:30.410
<v Speaker 2>What's your corners?</v>

5581
02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Just like he just,</v>

5582
02:14:32.010 --> 02:14:33.000
<v Speaker 2>just walking them down.</v>

5583
02:14:33.001 --> 02:14:34.770
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting he's putting the pressure on,</v>

5584
02:14:34.771 --> 02:14:36.390
<v Speaker 2>but if I say interesting one more time,</v>

5585
02:14:36.391 --> 02:14:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I hit myself fucking mad at myself.</v>

5586
02:14:39.181 --> 02:14:40.140
<v Speaker 2>This fight is interesting.</v>

5587
02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:45.420
<v Speaker 2>It is the best way to put it is upright and just kind of walk in for kind of,</v>

5588
02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

5589
02:14:46.810 --> 02:14:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Eaton leg kicks and it's very odd.</v>

5590
02:14:49.231 --> 02:14:50.700
<v Speaker 2>Well he's checked a lot of them too though,</v>

5591
02:14:50.701 --> 02:14:50.950
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5592
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Doing a great job.</v>

5593
02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I just don't care about that.</v>

5594
02:14:53.170 --> 02:14:53.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5595
02:14:53.550 --> 02:14:54.170
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5596
02:14:54.170 --> 02:14:55.770
<v Speaker 2>There's that right hand again by Frankie.</v>

5597
02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:57.180
<v Speaker 2>But BJ's walking them down,</v>

5598
02:14:57.181 --> 02:14:57.451
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5599
02:14:57.451 --> 02:14:58.201
<v Speaker 2>Walking him down,</v>

5600
02:14:58.201 --> 02:14:59.010
<v Speaker 2>walking them down.</v>

5601
02:14:59.010 --> 02:15:00.090
<v Speaker 2>You ready for my prediction?</v>

5602
02:15:01.410 --> 02:15:02.011
<v Speaker 2>Fourth Round.</v>

5603
02:15:02.011 --> 02:15:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Tko Frankie Edgar,</v>

5604
02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:04.350
<v Speaker 2>another take down right hand.</v>

5605
02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:05.633
<v Speaker 2>Right hand.</v>

5606
02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:07.380
<v Speaker 2>What makes you say that?</v>

5607
02:15:07.590 --> 02:15:08.670
<v Speaker 2>I just see some stuff.</v>

5608
02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:09.451
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

5609
02:15:09.451 --> 02:15:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5610
02:15:09.870 --> 02:15:11.480
<v Speaker 2>What do I know that's a big prediction.</v>

5611
02:15:11.490 --> 02:15:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Doing it is the old tasks are,</v>

5612
02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:17.400
<v Speaker 2>you are bold of Brendan Schaub if you're anything your bowl like that.</v>

5613
02:15:17.401 --> 02:15:21.000
<v Speaker 2>A one sauce but Doug spicy</v>

5614
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:23.821
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

5615
02:15:23.821 --> 02:15:24.750
<v Speaker 2>the feed on the hips.</v>

5616
02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:26.340
<v Speaker 2>See I see this and I'm like,</v>

5617
02:15:26.341 --> 02:15:26.610
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

5618
02:15:26.610 --> 02:15:27.421
<v Speaker 2>that's so dope.</v>

5619
02:15:27.421 --> 02:15:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Bj can control in there and he can't pass everyone else.</v>

5620
02:15:30.181 --> 02:15:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Like damn be just getting his ass whooped.</v>

5621
02:15:32.370 --> 02:15:33.330
<v Speaker 2>The problem that weird.</v>

5622
02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:35.970
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do anything offensive from his guard.</v>

5623
02:15:35.971 --> 02:15:36.721
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare.</v>

5624
02:15:36.721 --> 02:15:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he has a single arm bar victory from the guard in his career.</v>

5625
02:15:41.190 --> 02:15:42.720
<v Speaker 2>What he does is control guys,</v>

5626
02:15:42.721 --> 02:15:43.351
<v Speaker 2>stifled them,</v>

5627
02:15:43.351 --> 02:15:47.820
<v Speaker 2>sweeps them and then takes their back and choke something like [inaudible] all</v>

5628
02:15:47.821 --> 02:15:48.660
<v Speaker 2>his submissions.</v>

5629
02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:49.201
<v Speaker 2>What are they?</v>

5630
02:15:49.201 --> 02:15:51.290
<v Speaker 2>They're almost all rear naked choke.</v>

5631
02:15:51.291 --> 02:15:52.110
<v Speaker 2>You get your back.</v>

5632
02:15:52.110 --> 02:15:52.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5633
02:15:54.490 --> 02:15:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Frankie landed a nice right hand.</v>

5634
02:15:55.981 --> 02:15:58.660
<v Speaker 2>They're in that weird Bj.</v>

5635
02:15:58.661 --> 02:15:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Such a BJJ</v>

5636
02:16:01.470 --> 02:16:05.340
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous skills and he really ruined nakeds guys like you're not seeing</v>

5637
02:16:05.370 --> 02:16:06.540
<v Speaker 2>armbars leg attacks.</v>

5638
02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:09.480
<v Speaker 2>He knows them 100% he knows all of them,</v>

5639
02:16:09.690 --> 02:16:10.560
<v Speaker 2>but you have your,</v>

5640
02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:14.340
<v Speaker 2>your kind of your niche that you do and you get comfortable with doing it and</v>

5641
02:16:14.341 --> 02:16:14.880
<v Speaker 2>then weird.</v>

5642
02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:17.340
<v Speaker 2>This is also weird for him to be sitting on his back like this.</v>

5643
02:16:17.341 --> 02:16:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5644
02:16:18.030 --> 02:16:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Some guys just do that.</v>

5645
02:16:19.441 --> 02:16:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Like Marcella Garcia known for rear nakeds and gay teens.</v>

5646
02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Very rarely do you see Marcelo attempt an Armbar are though he did leg lock Rico</v>

5647
02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Rodriguez and the absolute crazy crazy.</v>

5648
02:16:31.150 --> 02:16:32.560
<v Speaker 2>We're ricoh is terrified of him.</v>

5649
02:16:32.810 --> 02:16:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Remember when he had Rico's back and Rico threw himself back on top of Marcello</v>

5650
02:16:37.391 --> 02:16:37.680
<v Speaker 2>tried.</v>

5651
02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5652
02:16:38.050 --> 02:16:39.520
<v Speaker 2>250 pounds of Rico.</v>

5653
02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5654
02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Slammed him.</v>

5655
02:16:40.930 --> 02:16:41.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5656
02:16:41.201 --> 02:16:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of fucked.</v>

5657
02:16:42.490 --> 02:16:43.323
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5658
02:16:43.450 --> 02:16:43.601
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5659
02:16:43.601 --> 02:16:44.311
<v Speaker 2>I think it's weird,</v>

5660
02:16:44.311 --> 02:16:44.490
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5661
02:16:44.490 --> 02:16:45.323
<v Speaker 2>It just is.</v>

5662
02:16:45.490 --> 02:16:46.630
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange.</v>

5663
02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

5664
02:16:47.350 --> 02:16:47.950
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

5665
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:48.783
<v Speaker 2>you get good.</v>

5666
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:52.420
<v Speaker 2>You probably have two moves in your back pocket that are your go tos.</v>

5667
02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:53.560
<v Speaker 2>You know the rest,</v>

5668
02:16:53.561 --> 02:16:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you know how to defend them,</v>

5669
02:16:54.730 --> 02:16:56.020
<v Speaker 2>but they're not your go tos.</v>

5670
02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:56.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5671
02:16:56.261 --> 02:16:58.480
<v Speaker 2>There are certain guys that do that over and over.</v>

5672
02:16:58.481 --> 02:16:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Well they'll get Rhonda and our armbars.</v>

5673
02:16:59.950 --> 02:17:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda is arm bars are fucking ridiculous.</v>

5674
02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Like when she fought me ship Tate,</v>

5675
02:17:04.001 --> 02:17:05.580
<v Speaker 2>when they did the ultimate fighter together and said,</v>

5676
02:17:05.770 --> 02:17:07.050
<v Speaker 2>better get used to wiping your ass.</v>

5677
02:17:07.051 --> 02:17:07.750
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

5678
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:08.740
<v Speaker 2>she's telling her,</v>

5679
02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to arm bar you and what does she do?</v>

5680
02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:11.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5681
02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Armbars are incredible.</v>

5682
02:17:13.850 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] it's crazy,</v>

5683
02:17:15.551 --> 02:17:16.150
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5684
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5685
02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:16.841
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

5686
02:17:16.841 --> 02:17:18.020
<v Speaker 2>when someone has it like you,</v>

5687
02:17:18.090 --> 02:17:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you remember Paul Sas?</v>

5688
02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5689
02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Really good triangles.</v>

5690
02:17:21.311 --> 02:17:21.431
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5691
02:17:21.431 --> 02:17:21.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5692
02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:22.433
<v Speaker 2>great triangles.</v>

5693
02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:24.730
<v Speaker 2>He had something like nine triangle victories in a row.</v>

5694
02:17:25.550 --> 02:17:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Look at chocolate though.</v>

5695
02:17:26.350 --> 02:17:28.540
<v Speaker 2>My arms crossed just not into it.</v>

5696
02:17:28.590 --> 02:17:29.423
<v Speaker 2>Just like</v>

5697
02:17:30.610 --> 02:17:33.640
<v Speaker 2>it's probably not out and we sees chuck not out in the background.</v>

5698
02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:34.673
<v Speaker 2>If you fucked,</v>

5699
02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:38.591
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

5700
02:17:38.591 --> 02:17:40.270
<v Speaker 2>this is not the most exciting.</v>

5701
02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5702
02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Bj's gotta be thinking he's two rounds in the hole here though.</v>

5703
02:17:42.911 --> 02:17:43.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5704
02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean Frankie on top of them two rounds in the hall.</v>

5705
02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5706
02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:48.311
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna sweep him.</v>

5707
02:17:48.311 --> 02:17:48.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5708
02:17:48.491 --> 02:17:49.750
<v Speaker 2>we got blasted right there.</v>

5709
02:17:49.930 --> 02:17:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Lasted,</v>

5710
02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:51.880
<v Speaker 2>took some serious shots.</v>

5711
02:17:51.881 --> 02:17:56.350
<v Speaker 2>You see some ground and pound dexterity of his legs were ridiculous.</v>

5712
02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:59.890
<v Speaker 2>So few people can move around like that off their back with their legs.</v>

5713
02:17:59.891 --> 02:18:03.250
<v Speaker 2>But the bottom line is he's taking a beating man.</v>

5714
02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Frankie's on top of them elbow and the shit out of him here.</v>

5715
02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:06.760

5716
02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh Damn.</v>

5717
02:18:07.810 --> 02:18:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Frankie's relentless.</v>

5718
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:10.063
<v Speaker 2>Frankie.</v>

5719
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.990
<v Speaker 2>I hate seeing this.</v>

5720
02:18:10.991 --> 02:18:11.621
<v Speaker 2>Look at the hate.</v>

5721
02:18:11.621 --> 02:18:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Seen Bj Penn get beat up.</v>

5722

5723
02:18:15.671 --> 02:18:16.000

<v Speaker 2>Two rounds.</v>

5725
02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:18.490
<v Speaker 2>BJ's got to come on strong.</v>

5726
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

5727
02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

5728
02:18:20.441 --> 02:18:22.750
<v Speaker 2>BJ's getting rocked here with these elbows.</v>

5729
02:18:23.470 --> 02:18:24.940
<v Speaker 2>He's staying calm and everything.</v>

5730
02:18:27.210 --> 02:18:28.560
<v Speaker 2>See like here did you can,</v>

<v Speaker 2>your options there.</v>

5735
02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:35.453
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do it.</v>

5736
02:18:36.710 --> 02:18:37.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5737

02:18:38.761 --> 02:18:38.971
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

5772
02:19:31.281 --> 02:19:32.150
<v Speaker 2>What can you say?</v>

5773
02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5774
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:33.170
<v Speaker 2>hey bro,</v>

5775
02:19:33.170 --> 02:19:35.150
<v Speaker 2>you are completely getting your ass kicked.</v>

5776
02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Let's try and revamp everything.</v>

5777
02:19:37.671 --> 02:19:39.410
<v Speaker 2>You can't just took a big deep breath too.</v>

5778
02:19:39.411 --> 02:19:39.591
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5779
02:19:39.591 --> 02:19:43.120
<v Speaker 2>you know what he's got to do is he's got to keep the fight standing or he's got</v>

5780
02:19:43.121 --> 02:19:44.750
<v Speaker 2>to take Frankie down and get on top of him.</v>

5781
02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5782
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:46.100
<v Speaker 2>if Bj gets on top,</v>

5783
02:19:46.101 --> 02:19:47.480
<v Speaker 2>his top game is nasty,</v>

5784
02:19:47.810 --> 02:19:51.160
<v Speaker 2>but he just can't hold him in his guard and put his feet on the hips like that.</v>

5785
02:19:51.161 --> 02:19:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5786
02:19:51.350 --> 02:19:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Hand's going to do nothing.</v>

5787
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Right hand is going to drop Bj and they seem to get t code</v>

5788
02:19:58.970 --> 02:20:00.110
<v Speaker 2>is getting,</v>

5789
02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:04.250
<v Speaker 2>this isn't as cool as it's changing now.</v>

5790
02:20:04.251 --> 02:20:05.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm super depressed.</v>

5791
02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:05.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5792
02:20:05.421 --> 02:20:06.141
<v Speaker 2>that was a beating.</v>

5793
02:20:06.141 --> 02:20:06.974
<v Speaker 2>He was all,</v>

5794
02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:09.650
<v Speaker 2>oh right hand by Frankie.</v>

5795
02:20:10.390 --> 02:20:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Frankie's just more active,</v>

5796
02:20:11.841 --> 02:20:12.950
<v Speaker 2>more accurate,</v>

5797
02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:16.490
<v Speaker 2>more unpredictable and more successful.</v>

5798
02:20:16.491 --> 02:20:17.000
<v Speaker 2>So far.</v>

5799
02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

5800
02:20:17.450 --> 02:20:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Nice kick on the transition.</v>

5801
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Looks like he's pulling away.</v>

5802
02:20:20.271 --> 02:20:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Boom lands that kick.</v>

5803
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:23.150
<v Speaker 2>He does things like,</v>

5804
02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:23.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5805
02:20:23.421 --> 02:20:23.870
<v Speaker 2>like he'll,</v>

5806
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:27.110
<v Speaker 2>he'll shuffle in for the punches and then the second time he shuffles out,</v>

5807
02:20:27.290 --> 02:20:28.550
<v Speaker 2>he's throws a hard kick,</v>

5808
02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:29.211
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5809
02:20:29.211 --> 02:20:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Or he looks like he's going to do what he just did and he goes for a takedown</v>

5810
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:33.171
<v Speaker 2>mix.</v>

5811
02:20:33.171 --> 02:20:35.120
<v Speaker 2>That shit up so well it mixing it up.</v>

5812
02:20:36.490 --> 02:20:36.990
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

5813
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:38.280
<v Speaker 2>And you think that's all his coach,</v>

5814
02:20:38.290 --> 02:20:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

5815
02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:39.661
<v Speaker 2>A big part of it,</v>

5816
02:20:39.661 --> 02:20:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

5817
02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:40.680
<v Speaker 2>Huge part of it.</v>

5818
02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting now because when they hit myth,</v>

5819
02:20:43.050 --> 02:20:43.770
<v Speaker 2>they do it.</v>

5820
02:20:43.770 --> 02:20:46.230
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to watch those guys train to see.</v>

5821
02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:49.170
<v Speaker 2>I loved his fight with Allavara.</v>

5822
02:20:49.260 --> 02:20:49.561
<v Speaker 2>Charles,</v>

5823
02:20:49.561 --> 02:20:51.240
<v Speaker 2>all of your great fight.</v>

5824
02:20:52.370 --> 02:20:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Oliveira very underrated guy dude.</v>

5825
02:20:54.481 --> 02:20:55.081
<v Speaker 2>What happened in gray?</v>

5826
02:20:55.081 --> 02:20:55.914
<v Speaker 2>Maynard?</v>

5827
02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5828
02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:56.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5829
02:20:56.980 --> 02:21:00.660
<v Speaker 2>he got knocked out by a couple different guys.</v>

5830
02:21:01.350 --> 02:21:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz knocked him out.</v>

5831
02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5832
02:21:04.050 --> 02:21:05.070
<v Speaker 2>but you don't hear from him,</v>

5833
02:21:05.071 --> 02:21:05.371
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5834
02:21:05.371 --> 02:21:07.770
<v Speaker 2>You don't really hear that much lately.</v>

5835
02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:09.133
<v Speaker 2>What's a grid?</v>

5836
02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:10.890
<v Speaker 2>It's name that was going to fight for the title.</v>

5837
02:21:12.370 --> 02:21:13.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm just watching this.</v>

5838
02:21:13.231 --> 02:21:16.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to pay attention while I'm watching this man.</v>

5839
02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Tj grant teacher grant knocked them out to them.</v>

5840
02:21:19.230 --> 02:21:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Their elbow standing elbow.</v>

5841
02:21:22.450 --> 02:21:25.350
<v Speaker 2>He's a few chaos and that was after frank and knocked him out.</v>

5842
02:21:25.620 --> 02:21:28.230
<v Speaker 2>So it was like finding a home man.</v>

5843
02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful combinations by Frankie.</v>

5844
02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:32.370
<v Speaker 2>The movement was just so good.</v>

5845
02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:33.940
<v Speaker 2>He's not there for a recoil.</v>

5846
02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Just ragdoll Bj to the ground there.</v>

5847
02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

5848
02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:40.860
<v Speaker 2>We just got to do something,</v>

5849
02:21:40.861 --> 02:21:41.161
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5850
02:21:41.161 --> 02:21:45.630
<v Speaker 2>He can't just lay here with him in his guard like he's been doing</v>

5851
02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:48.573
<v Speaker 10>okay.</v>

5852
02:21:48.770 --> 02:21:49.101
<v Speaker 2>Frankie.</v>

5853
02:21:49.101 --> 02:21:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Trying to pass again,</v>

5854
02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:52.580
<v Speaker 2>like Bj so comfortable in this position,</v>

5855
02:21:52.581 --> 02:21:54.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's a terrible position for him.</v>

5856
02:21:54.201 --> 02:21:57.470
<v Speaker 2>It's almost bad that he's that comfortable here because you're just losing the</v>

5857
02:21:57.471 --> 02:21:58.370
<v Speaker 2>fight can beat up.</v>

5858
02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:02.090
<v Speaker 2>But it's so weird cause you know he doesn't have an offensive guard.</v>

5859
02:22:02.091 --> 02:22:04.520
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a guard where he's attacks off his back,</v>

5860
02:22:04.521 --> 02:22:05.990
<v Speaker 2>tries to lock up triangles.</v>

5861
02:22:07.130 --> 02:22:10.600
<v Speaker 2>He's just impossible to pass until Frankie's half past here.</v>

5862
02:22:10.610 --> 02:22:11.151
<v Speaker 2>He's about to,</v>

5863
02:22:11.151 --> 02:22:12.470
<v Speaker 2>if he can clear that other foot,</v>

5864
02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:13.010
<v Speaker 2>we'll look.</v>

5865
02:22:13.010 --> 02:22:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

5866
02:22:13.650 --> 02:22:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Awesome dexterity is and credit recovery.</v>

5867
02:22:16.310 --> 02:22:16.941
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

5868
02:22:16.941 --> 02:22:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I love seeing it.</v>

5869
02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:18.381
<v Speaker 2>It is impressive.</v>

5870
02:22:18.381 --> 02:22:21.140
<v Speaker 2>But everyone else lives in this like this is the most bullshit.</v>

5871
02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:24.140
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] smashing on more elbows,</v>

5872
02:22:24.141 --> 02:22:24.771
<v Speaker 2>more elbows,</v>

5873
02:22:24.771 --> 02:22:25.170
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

5874
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:25.471
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

5875
02:22:25.471 --> 02:22:26.304
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

5876
02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:28.530
<v Speaker 2>How's Bj ob just cut bowed now.</v>

5877
02:22:29.310 --> 02:22:30.240
<v Speaker 2>How's Bj gonna go?</v>

5878
02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Always.</v>

5879
02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:31.830
<v Speaker 2>He's lightened him up.</v>

5880
02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:32.290
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

5881
02:22:32.290 --> 02:22:32.610
<v Speaker 2>no mom.</v>

5882
02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:33.091
<v Speaker 2>That's what you get.</v>

5883
02:22:33.091 --> 02:22:33.750
<v Speaker 2>That's nasty.</v>

5884
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:34.583
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

5885
02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:35.880
<v Speaker 2>It's going into his eye now.</v>

5886
02:22:35.940 --> 02:22:37.390
<v Speaker 2>I would be surprised if he hears corner.</v>

5887
02:22:37.391 --> 02:22:38.224
<v Speaker 2>You throw in the towel.</v>

5888
02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:39.930
<v Speaker 2>You already dealing with a legend like this.</v>

5889
02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:41.670
<v Speaker 2>We'll get that blood.</v>

5890
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:42.503
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez.</v>

5891
02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:44.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the bloodiest who've ever seen Bj.</v>

5892
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.863
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5893
02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:48.420
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really cut a lot when he's cutting a lot now.</v>

5894
02:22:48.421 --> 02:22:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Frankie keeps targeting that same spot with elbows and beaches.</v>

5895
02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Got Two more minutes of this to deal with.</v>

5896
02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:54.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5897
02:22:54.361 --> 02:22:55.650
<v Speaker 2>another one on the same spot.</v>

5898
02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:57.090
<v Speaker 2>All my goodness.</v>

5899
02:22:57.091 --> 02:22:58.320
<v Speaker 2>BJ's getting fucked up,</v>

5900
02:22:58.321 --> 02:22:58.501
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

5901
02:22:58.501 --> 02:22:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Herb Dean might stop.</v>

5902
02:22:59.371 --> 02:23:01.650
<v Speaker 2>This fight is to get to look at the cup.</v>

5903
02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:03.353
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5904
02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh Damn man.</v>

5905
02:23:06.290 --> 02:23:07.860
<v Speaker 2>But he just doesn't have an answer.</v>

5906
02:23:07.890 --> 02:23:09.000
<v Speaker 2>It does not have an answer.</v>

5907
02:23:10.900 --> 02:23:12.000
<v Speaker 2>And Frankie's been saying,</v>

5908
02:23:12.030 --> 02:23:12.661
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

5909

5910
02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:15.660
<v Speaker 2>He's going to mountain view.</v>

5911
02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:18.990
<v Speaker 2>He's got a crucifix or that fix and Bj and finished and like that.</v>

5912
02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:20.430
<v Speaker 2>They're just not going to happen.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

5940
02:23:58.471 --> 02:23:59.071
<v Speaker 2>Bj Penn.</v>

5941
02:23:59.071 --> 02:23:59.904
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:09.421
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5948
02:24:09.421 --> 02:24:13.800
<v Speaker 2>That was a route that it was a three route was great for Frankie.</v>

5949
02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Amazing performance.</v>

5950
02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:16.470
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's a 10 to one favorite.</v>

5951
02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I would guess ten one favorite.</v>

5952
02:24:19.220 --> 02:24:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5953
02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Well the opening line,</v>

5954
02:24:20.701 --> 02:24:20.851
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5955
02:24:20.851 --> 02:24:23.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was when the actual fight went down,</v>

5956
02:24:23.341 --> 02:24:23.701
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

5957
02:24:23.701 --> 02:24:26.190
<v Speaker 2>that's hard to watch our to watch.</v>

5958
02:24:26.850 --> 02:24:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Hard to watch.</v>

5959
02:24:28.470 --> 02:24:28.981
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

5960
02:24:28.981 --> 02:24:29.640
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5961
02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:31.020
<v Speaker 2>They all go down,</v>

5962
02:24:31.021 --> 02:24:31.441
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5963
02:24:31.441 --> 02:24:32.340
<v Speaker 2>They all go to one.</v>

5964
02:24:32.341 --> 02:24:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Does hate to tell you your favorite fighter that's going to happen to him one</v>

5965
02:24:35.371 --> 02:24:37.620
<v Speaker 2>day unless he gets out before that happens.</v>

5966
02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:38.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5967
02:24:38.281 --> 02:24:38.630
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5968
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I hope that we've seen the last of certain guys like GSP.</v>

5969
02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:44.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see him go down.</v>

5970
02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't see Emerson go down like this.</v>

5971
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

5972
02:24:47.250 --> 02:24:48.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5973
02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:48.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's going to,</v>

5974
02:24:48.930 --> 02:24:50.280
<v Speaker 2>he's going to go down like this again.</v>

5975
02:24:50.310 --> 02:24:52.620
<v Speaker 2>You think Anderson's gonna wind up fighting again?</v>

5976
02:24:52.621 --> 02:24:53.490
<v Speaker 2>If I need someone else,</v>

5977
02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:54.660
<v Speaker 2>look at this boom,</v>

5978
02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:55.793
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

5979
02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Cause they're going to give him a fight.</v>

5980
02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Probably be in his favor.</v>

5981
02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:03.300
<v Speaker 2>He'll win that one and then you get some demon who is not going to be down like</v>

5982
02:25:03.301 --> 02:25:03.541
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

5983
02:25:03.541 --> 02:25:03.930
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5984
02:25:03.930 --> 02:25:04.061
<v Speaker 2>Would,</v>

5985
02:25:04.061 --> 02:25:05.880
<v Speaker 2>do you remember when he was coming out for the Wyman fight?</v>

5986
02:25:05.881 --> 02:25:08.220
<v Speaker 2>The second fight and he paused during his walk.</v>

5987
02:25:08.230 --> 02:25:08.761
<v Speaker 2>He was weird.</v>

5988
02:25:08.761 --> 02:25:09.780
<v Speaker 2>He got down on his knees.</v>

5989
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:11.040
<v Speaker 2>He squatted.</v>

5990
02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:13.680
<v Speaker 2>It was just like sat there like almost like he's having a hard time breathing.</v>

5991
02:25:14.010 --> 02:25:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Trying to keep it together.</v>

5992
02:25:15.390 --> 02:25:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Collect himself.</v>

5993
02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5994
02:25:17.130 --> 02:25:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Well just to fucking nerves man.</v>

5995
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Knowing that you're about to go in there and against this dude is made out of</v>

5996
02:25:21.841 --> 02:25:22.674
<v Speaker 2>concrete.</v>

5997
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.470
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5998
02:25:23.470 --> 02:25:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about</v>

5999
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.460
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

6000
02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:25.360
<v Speaker 6>Especially at heavyweight.</v>

6001
02:25:25.361 --> 02:25:28.630
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I'm not saying it but it is.</v>

6002
02:25:28.631 --> 02:25:30.130
<v Speaker 6>I am saying it's different heavyweights.</v>

6003
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:33.060
<v Speaker 6>Different cause they can crack it with one shot because you're going in,</v>

6004
02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:33.461
<v Speaker 6>you just like,</v>

6005
02:25:33.461 --> 02:25:33.701
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

6006
02:25:33.701 --> 02:25:35.560
<v Speaker 6>well this guy is 265 pounds.</v>

6007
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:36.460
<v Speaker 6>I literally,</v>

6008
02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:39.040
<v Speaker 6>if I make an error it's over and I'm going to get really,</v>

6009
02:25:39.041 --> 02:25:39.760
<v Speaker 6>really hurt.</v>

6010
02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:40.241
<v Speaker 6>So what have you.</v>

6011
02:25:40.241 --> 02:25:41.400
<v Speaker 6>It's just different man.</v>

6012
02:25:41.410 --> 02:25:42.430
<v Speaker 6>Like the nerves are different.</v>

6013
02:25:42.431 --> 02:25:43.264
<v Speaker 6>You're dealing with,</v>

6014
02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:44.523
<v Speaker 6>that's scary.</v>

6015
02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:48.100
<v Speaker 6>What's the guy that hit you the hardest you think hardest in my life.</v>

6016
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:49.240
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6017
02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:49.931
<v Speaker 6>everyone says you know,</v>

6018
02:25:49.931 --> 02:25:52.570
<v Speaker 6>like Roy Nelson who I got knocked out by hit me behind the ear.</v>

6019
02:25:52.571 --> 02:25:53.620
<v Speaker 6>So it wasn't that hard.</v>

6020
02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:55.120
<v Speaker 6>A same with Nogueira.</v>

6021
02:25:55.121 --> 02:25:56.200
<v Speaker 6>I would say</v>

6022
02:25:58.770 --> 02:25:59.510
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

6023
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.860
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

6024
02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:01.180
<v Speaker 6>that's the lightest I've ever been hidden.</v>

6025
02:26:01.210 --> 02:26:01.630
<v Speaker 6>Went out.</v>

6026
02:26:01.630 --> 02:26:04.450
<v Speaker 6>And the reason was I was sparring with Shane Carmen the week before and got</v>

6027
02:26:04.510 --> 02:26:08.650
<v Speaker 6>wobbled with a left hook or almost knocked out basically and then fought.</v>

6028
02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:10.120
<v Speaker 6>That's why that shut.</v>

6029
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.983
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

6030
02:26:11.010 --> 02:26:13.450
<v Speaker 6>Cause if you look Rothwell really doesn't hit me that hard.</v>

6031
02:26:13.451 --> 02:26:13.720
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>

6032
02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:17.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm like flailing trying to put them away and he just like clips me in the back</v>

6033
02:26:17.501 --> 02:26:18.610
<v Speaker 6>of the air and I'd fall down.</v>

6034
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:20.410
<v Speaker 6>I was rocked before that fight.</v>

6035
02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:21.250
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

6036
02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:22.300
<v Speaker 6>That happens all the time.</v>

6037
02:26:22.301 --> 02:26:22.511
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

6038
02:26:22.511 --> 02:26:23.140
<v Speaker 6>All the time.</v>

6039
02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:24.520
<v Speaker 6>And at heavyweight to different bird.</v>

6040
02:26:24.790 --> 02:26:25.031
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

6041
02:26:25.031 --> 02:26:26.080
<v Speaker 6>I would say who rocked me,</v>

6042
02:26:26.081 --> 02:26:30.220
<v Speaker 6>where I kept going would be probably Lavar Jonathan hit me with the upper cut</v>

6043
02:26:30.370 --> 02:26:32.320
<v Speaker 6>and it literally almost ripped my lips off.</v>

6044
02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:34.570
<v Speaker 6>Good Lord.</v>

6045
02:26:34.810 --> 02:26:35.680
<v Speaker 6>Who's a Banger,</v>

6046
02:26:35.681 --> 02:26:36.240
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>

6047
02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:36.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6048
02:26:36.530 --> 02:26:37.260
<v Speaker 6>Bang.</v>

6049
02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:38.093
<v Speaker 6>Hit.</v>

6050
02:26:38.370 --> 02:26:40.150
<v Speaker 6>He was like put on this earth to knock bitches out.</v>

6051
02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:41.380
<v Speaker 6>He's a strong motherfucker.</v>

6052
02:26:41.470 --> 02:26:42.550
<v Speaker 6>Might have been a boring fight,</v>

6053
02:26:42.551 --> 02:26:44.980
<v Speaker 6>but it put a rustling clinic on his big ass.</v>

6054
02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:47.020
<v Speaker 6>Positive for steroids.</v>

6055
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.311
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6056
02:26:48.311 --> 02:26:49.144
<v Speaker 6>he did.</v>

6057
02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:50.591

6067
02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Was it cool to watch?</v>

6068
02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I was on a high note.</v>

6069
02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:07.590
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping it would be a competitive fight that don't want to see that man.</v>

6070
02:27:07.591 --> 02:27:08.790
<v Speaker 1>That shit sucks.</v>

6074
02:27:11.671 --> 02:27:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn Law got his ass whooped.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got this.</v>

6079
02:27:15.810 --> 02:27:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I got to sleep tonight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

6086
02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:25.230
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to watch.</v>

6087
02:27:26.250 --> 02:27:27.180
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

6088
02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:27.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6089
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

6090
02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:29.580
<v Speaker 1>watched Donald Curry,</v>

6091
02:27:29.581 --> 02:27:31.770
<v Speaker 1>who's a big fan of mine fight Mike Mccallum.</v>

6092
02:27:31.771 --> 02:27:32.670
<v Speaker 1>You remember Mike Mccallum,</v>

6093
02:27:32.671 --> 02:27:33.540
<v Speaker 1>the body snatcher?</v>

6094
02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:34.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6095
02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't remember him?</v>

6096
02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:35.610
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6097
02:27:35.610 --> 02:27:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Middleweight champion bad mother fucker.</v>

6098
02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:38.071
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

6099
02:27:38.071 --> 02:27:43.071
<v Speaker 1>Mike Mccallum hit Donald Curry with a left hook to the body and then a left hook</v>

6100
02:27:43.351 --> 02:27:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and knock Donald Curry the fuck out.</v>

6101
02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Donald Curry went out flat on his back and I was so depressed.</v>

6102
02:27:50.011 --> 02:27:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I just put on my fucking shoes and went running.</v>

6103
02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:53.551
<v Speaker 1>It was cold.</v>

6104
02:27:53.551 --> 02:27:54.001
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

6105
02:27:54.001 --> 02:27:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I was living in Boston and ran down the street.</v>

6106
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:57.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just running,</v>

6107
02:27:57.931 --> 02:27:58.231
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

6108
02:27:58.231 --> 02:27:58.981
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't take it.</v>

6109
02:27:58.981 --> 02:28:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I was just so depressed.</v>

6110
02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:03.030
<v Speaker 1>And then I remembered the deciding at that moment,</v>

6111
02:28:03.090 --> 02:28:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to get depressed when a fighter loses ever again.</v>

6112
02:28:05.911 --> 02:28:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to invest in.</v>

6113
02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Let it affect you that way.</v>

6114
02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:09.000
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>

6115
02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

6116
02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I can't let it affect me like that.</v>

6117
02:28:10.921 --> 02:28:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I remember deciding that because I was so bombed out.</v>

6118
02:28:13.471 --> 02:28:13.831
<v Speaker 1>I took it.</v>

6119
02:28:13.831 --> 02:28:14.670
<v Speaker 1>So personally,</v>

6120
02:28:15.150 --> 02:28:16.500
<v Speaker 1>that happens to a lot of people.</v>

6121
02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:17.910
<v Speaker 1>It happens to me like when,</v>

6122
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:18.870
<v Speaker 1>when I found out,</v>

6123
02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:19.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6124
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:21.470
<v Speaker 1>or loss to get the main event against foot,</v>

6125
02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't run</v>

6126
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:23.120
<v Speaker 6>probably six miles.</v>

6127
02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:27.200
<v Speaker 6>I get super stressed out and sad about it because w that should have been me.</v>

6128
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:28.370
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know what to do,</v>

6129
02:28:28.371 --> 02:28:29.690
<v Speaker 6>so I just went hit the gym running.</v>

6130
02:28:29.810 --> 02:28:32.840
<v Speaker 6>Let's talk about that because big foot's a weird situation man.</v>

6131
02:28:32.841 --> 02:28:36.020
<v Speaker 6>Cause big foot has a real issue.</v>

6132
02:28:36.350 --> 02:28:39.050
<v Speaker 6>Like he's got a tumor on his pituitary gland.</v>

6133
02:28:39.051 --> 02:28:43.890
<v Speaker 6>He has giantism gigantism I guess which made him um,</v>

6134
02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:47.680
<v Speaker 6>I mean they had to give him one point in time in his career is over 300 pounds</v>

6135
02:28:47.690 --> 02:28:49.160
<v Speaker 6>and you've cut the 65.</v>

6136
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.341
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6137
02:28:49.341 --> 02:28:50.870
<v Speaker 6>we used to cut down to 65.</v>

6138
02:28:50.871 --> 02:28:53.110
<v Speaker 6>It was fucking enormous when shredded.</v>

6139
02:28:53.450 --> 02:28:56.900
<v Speaker 6>Shredded when he fought our Lawsky when he fought fade or month.</v>

6140
02:28:57.220 --> 02:28:57.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6141
02:28:57.680 --> 02:28:58.271
<v Speaker 6>Shred.</v>

6142
02:28:58.271 --> 02:28:58.990
<v Speaker 6>It was huge.</v>

6143
02:28:58.990 --> 02:29:00.890
<v Speaker 6>It was absolutely gigantic.</v>

6144
02:29:01.130 --> 02:29:02.240
<v Speaker 6>When he fought Arlovski,</v>

6145
02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:03.200
<v Speaker 6>he fought last game.</v>

6146
02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:03.860
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

6147
02:29:03.860 --> 02:29:04.391
<v Speaker 6>When they,</v>

6148
02:29:04.391 --> 02:29:04.481
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

6149
02:29:04.481 --> 02:29:07.360
<v Speaker 6>They fought in Strikeforce or it might've been the lead XC.</v>

6150
02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:08.270
<v Speaker 6>It was a lead XC.</v>

6151
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:09.163
<v Speaker 6>How did he do?</v>

6152
02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:10.520
<v Speaker 6>He won in a,</v>

6153
02:29:10.521 --> 02:29:12.140
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a controversial decision,</v>

6154
02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:13.940
<v Speaker 6>but it was a good fight really.</v>

6155
02:29:14.390 --> 02:29:15.130
<v Speaker 6>And he won.</v>

6156
02:29:15.130 --> 02:29:17.630
<v Speaker 6>It might've been decisioned but he won for sure.</v>

6157
02:29:17.790 --> 02:29:18.320
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

6158
02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:19.153
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

6159
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:21.560
<v Speaker 6>so big get that cut.</v>

6160
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:22.490
<v Speaker 6>My God,</v>

6161
02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:23.330
<v Speaker 6>it was pretty bad.</v>

6162
02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:24.410
<v Speaker 6>Crazy big foot.</v>

6163
02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:26.210
<v Speaker 6>Big Foot on those stuff though.</v>

6164
02:29:26.211 --> 02:29:26.660
<v Speaker 6>It does.</v>

6165
02:29:26.660 --> 02:29:28.280
<v Speaker 6>Just because he has an issue,</v>

6166
02:29:28.281 --> 02:29:31.070
<v Speaker 6>doesn't make it okay that he takes stuff because this,</v>

6167
02:29:31.071 --> 02:29:32.660
<v Speaker 6>this is why you want to make it fair.</v>

6168
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.981
<v Speaker 6>Say,</v>

6169
02:29:32.981 --> 02:29:33.530
<v Speaker 6>all right.</v>

6170
02:29:33.530 --> 02:29:35.540
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] you can take whatever he's taken.</v>

6171
02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:36.810
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>

6172
02:29:36.810 --> 02:29:39.860
<v Speaker 6>that would be fair to my problem with that of course,</v>

6173
02:29:39.861 --> 02:29:40.880
<v Speaker 6>is that when you,</v>

6174
02:29:40.881 --> 02:29:41.500
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

6175
02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:41.900
<v Speaker 6>so you know,</v>

6176
02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:44.540
<v Speaker 6>ways to tell a guy and they can take hormones,</v>

6177
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:46.520
<v Speaker 6>especially if you don't really need them.</v>

6178
02:29:46.521 --> 02:29:47.091
<v Speaker 6>Naturally.</v>

6179
02:29:47.091 --> 02:29:47.300
<v Speaker 6>If you,</v>

6180
02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:48.230
<v Speaker 6>your body's healthy,</v>

6181
02:29:48.231 --> 02:29:51.200
<v Speaker 6>you know you're going to fuck your whole endocrine system of your systems,</v>

6182
02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:52.210
<v Speaker 6>what's going on,</v>

6183
02:29:52.210 --> 02:29:53.043
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

6184
02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:54.013
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

6185
02:29:54.220 --> 02:29:55.490
<v Speaker 6>It's a responsible,</v>

6186
02:29:55.491 --> 02:30:00.410
<v Speaker 6>at the same time you're fighting a guy who was on different supplements to</v>

6187
02:30:00.411 --> 02:30:01.640
<v Speaker 6>enhance his fighting career,</v>

6188
02:30:01.790 --> 02:30:02.331
<v Speaker 6>then you are,</v>

6189
02:30:02.331 --> 02:30:03.560
<v Speaker 6>and you can't do anything about it.</v>

6190
02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:04.100
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

6191
02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:05.660
<v Speaker 6>And she has a path to do this.</v>

6192
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.411
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

6193
02:30:06.411 --> 02:30:08.120
<v Speaker 6>and they're fighting in Brazil.</v>

6194
02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:12.290
<v Speaker 6>Weird in Brazil,</v>

6195
02:30:12.291 --> 02:30:14.180
<v Speaker 6>bigfoot in Brazil or lossy.</v>

6196
02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:15.170
<v Speaker 6>This is not a gift.</v>

6197
02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:16.340
<v Speaker 6>This is a punishment.</v>

6198
02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that when he gets down there that,</v>

6199
02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:19.701
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

6200
02:30:19.701 --> 02:30:22.700
<v Speaker 6>is it possible for big foot to fight clean?</v>

6201
02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:23.660
<v Speaker 6>That's the real question.</v>

6202
02:30:23.690 --> 02:30:24.050
<v Speaker 6>Nope,</v>

6203
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:24.830
<v Speaker 6>not possible.</v>

6204
02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:25.660
<v Speaker 6>Not Possible.</v>

6205
02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:26.690
<v Speaker 6>But with his condition,</v>

6206
02:30:26.691 --> 02:30:27.081
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that.</v>

6207
02:30:27.081 --> 02:30:27.914
<v Speaker 6>Not Possible.</v>

6208
02:30:27.980 --> 02:30:30.950
<v Speaker 6>And he's been on his entire career and they want to get them off your ranking in</v>

6209
02:30:30.951 --> 02:30:31.790
<v Speaker 6>the top five.</v>

6210
02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:32.713
<v Speaker 6>Good luck.</v>

6211
02:30:33.020 --> 02:30:33.853
<v Speaker 6>Good luck.</v>

6212
02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:35.420
<v Speaker 6>So what is the reason to fight in Brazil?</v>

6213
02:30:35.670 --> 02:30:36.710
<v Speaker 6>So you think he's going to juice up?</v>

6214
02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:37.400
<v Speaker 6>I think so.</v>

6215
02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:37.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm wow.</v>

6216
02:30:37.970 --> 02:30:38.480
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.</v>

6217
02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:39.220
<v Speaker 6>I think so.</v>

6218
02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:40.040
<v Speaker 6>I Ellison if,</v>

6219
02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:41.810
<v Speaker 6>and this is what I would done if the UFC is said,</v>

6220
02:30:41.811 --> 02:30:42.130
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

6221
02:30:42.130 --> 02:30:43.580
<v Speaker 6>why don't you fight big foot in Brazil?</v>

6222
02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:45.050
<v Speaker 6>Say Listen,</v>

6223
02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:45.981
<v Speaker 6>I'll fight big foot.</v>

6224
02:30:45.981 --> 02:30:46.520
<v Speaker 6>No problem.</v>

6225
02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:47.440
<v Speaker 6>I want to fight him in Vegas,</v>

6226
02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:50.000
<v Speaker 6>California with the drug testing strict were all right.</v>

6227
02:30:50.001 --> 02:30:51.050
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't need this stuff.</v>

6228
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.651
<v Speaker 6>That's fine.</v>

6229
02:30:51.651 --> 02:30:52.400
<v Speaker 6>That's fair game.</v>

6230
02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:53.520
<v Speaker 6>However I want it regulated.</v>

6231
02:30:53.540 --> 02:30:56.600
<v Speaker 6>I went random test to make sure he's not overdoing it because that's what guys</v>

6232
02:30:56.601 --> 02:30:57.260
<v Speaker 6>are doing.</v>

6233
02:30:57.260 --> 02:30:58.370
<v Speaker 6>Let's be real here man.</v>

6234
02:30:58.700 --> 02:30:59.540
<v Speaker 6>Fuck that noise.</v>

6235
02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:00.081
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6236
02:31:00.081 --> 02:31:01.680
<v Speaker 6>Well what do you think about v torn now?</v>

6237
02:31:01.681 --> 02:31:04.030
<v Speaker 6>Cause vittores going to and he's gonna get a tight shot.</v>

6238
02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:05.750
<v Speaker 6>Weidman that ain't no picnic,</v>

6239
02:31:05.751 --> 02:31:06.330
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>

02:31:06.330 --> 02:31:08.030
<v Speaker 6>Whole him fighting Weidman.</v>

6241
02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:08.631
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

6242
02:31:08.631 --> 02:31:10.610
<v Speaker 6>Coming off the sauce and fighting Weidman.</v>

6243
02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:12.460
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen the photos of Itar?</v>

6244
02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:14.300
<v Speaker 6>I've seen video of him lately.</v>

6245
02:31:14.390 --> 02:31:14.631
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

6246
02:31:14.631 --> 02:31:15.410
<v Speaker 6>it does not look the same.</v>

6247
02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:15.950
<v Speaker 6>He does it.</v>

6248
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:16.820
<v Speaker 6>He does not look the same.</v>

6249
02:31:16.821 --> 02:31:17.654
<v Speaker 6>It looks much smaller.</v>

6250
02:31:17.850 --> 02:31:18.683
<v Speaker 6>He's again,</v>

6251
02:31:18.770 --> 02:31:19.591
<v Speaker 6>probably get destroyed,</v>

6252
02:31:19.591 --> 02:31:20.280
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

6253
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:20.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6254
02:31:20.491 --> 02:31:22.010
<v Speaker 2>It looks like you almost can make welterweight.</v>

6255
02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Dang.</v>

6256
02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6257
02:31:23.310 --> 02:31:24.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6258
02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:25.440
<v Speaker 2>It takes a size nine shoe.</v>

6259
02:31:25.441 --> 02:31:26.610
<v Speaker 2>He's got small hands and feet.</v>

6260
02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6261
02:31:27.090 --> 02:31:28.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not the biggest guy in the world.</v>

6262
02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:31.180
<v Speaker 2>He said a lot of broken hands because of that and his wife is at time.</v>

6263
02:31:33.210 --> 02:31:33.631
<v Speaker 2>Look at you.</v>

6264
02:31:33.631 --> 02:31:34.464
<v Speaker 2>Sorry man.</v>

6265
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.943
<v Speaker 2>Flow.</v>

6266
02:31:36.410 --> 02:31:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6267
02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:37.201
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

6268
02:31:37.201 --> 02:31:37.961
<v Speaker 2>the big foot stuff it.</v>

6269
02:31:37.961 --> 02:31:38.521
<v Speaker 2>It's tough,</v>

6270
02:31:38.521 --> 02:31:38.820
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6271
02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:39.300
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>

6272
02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:39.841
<v Speaker 2>It's almost,</v>

6273
02:31:39.841 --> 02:31:40.740
<v Speaker 2>you almost want to say,</v>

6274
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.341
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

6275
02:31:41.341 --> 02:31:42.900
<v Speaker 2>if you can't fight without taking this stuff,</v>

6276
02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:44.100
<v Speaker 2>she'll probably stop fighting.</v>

6277
02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:45.353
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6278
02:31:45.390 --> 02:31:46.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair either.</v>

6279
02:31:46.531 --> 02:31:48.030
<v Speaker 2>We paint it even if he needs to stuff,</v>

6280
02:31:48.031 --> 02:31:50.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair because the other guys aren't on it.</v>

6281
02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:51.080
<v Speaker 2>That mean,</v>

6282
02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:53.520
<v Speaker 2>and that is the true not if you can't fight without it,</v>

6283
02:31:53.521 --> 02:31:57.750
<v Speaker 2>you really should stop fighting because a lot of the reasons why these people</v>

6284
02:31:57.751 --> 02:32:02.751
<v Speaker 2>need that stuff is because I had injuries or cheating or he used to do steroids.</v>

6285
02:32:03.210 --> 02:32:04.330
<v Speaker 2>He used to cheat whatever's.</v>

6286
02:32:04.331 --> 02:32:08.910
<v Speaker 2>The reason is if I fight bigfoot Silva and he's all juiced up on ever cocktail</v>

6287
02:32:08.911 --> 02:32:10.650
<v Speaker 2>he has in Brazil that I'm not on,</v>

6288
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:15.300
<v Speaker 2>you punch me in the face and I suffered horrible brain trauma because you were</v>

6289
02:32:15.301 --> 02:32:18.690
<v Speaker 2>sauced up or how about I punched him as hard as I can.</v>

6290
02:32:19.570 --> 02:32:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

6291
02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:23.970
<v Speaker 2>there's about two guys in this world who can take a Mark Hunt punch to the face.</v>

6292
02:32:24.240 --> 02:32:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Roy Nelson,</v>

6293
02:32:25.020 --> 02:32:27.870
<v Speaker 2>who he's fighting September and big foot Silva juiced up,</v>

6294
02:32:28.650 --> 02:32:32.130
<v Speaker 2>only juiced up and he's not taking his mate where his head is enormous.</v>

6295
02:32:32.131 --> 02:32:33.660
<v Speaker 2>So it probably helps them Howard juiced up.</v>

6296
02:32:33.661 --> 02:32:34.440
<v Speaker 2>It's helping him.</v>

6297
02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:36.030
<v Speaker 2>What's his kiss in the pocket with market?</v>

6298
02:32:36.060 --> 02:32:36.331
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>

6299
02:32:36.331 --> 02:32:36.710
<v Speaker 2>this world.</v>

6300
02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:37.530
<v Speaker 2>So for those two guys,</v>

6301
02:32:37.530 --> 02:32:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it did help them,</v>

6302
02:32:39.211 --> 02:32:40.200
<v Speaker 2>because if you,</v>

6303
02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:41.430
<v Speaker 2>if you know the whole story,</v>

6304
02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:45.090
<v Speaker 2>hunt fought big foot and they had this incredible war,</v>

6305
02:32:45.180 --> 02:32:48.120
<v Speaker 2>but then it turns out they tested big foot after the fight.</v>

6306
02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:49.400
<v Speaker 2>He was on testosterone replacement,</v>

6307
02:32:49.410 --> 02:32:50.340
<v Speaker 2>tested him before the fight.</v>

6308
02:32:50.341 --> 02:32:51.480
<v Speaker 2>He was at normal levels,</v>

6309
02:32:51.630 --> 02:32:54.150
<v Speaker 2>tested them after the fight Jack to the roof.</v>

6310
02:32:54.420 --> 02:32:56.100
<v Speaker 2>So put some stuff in their locker room,</v>

6311
02:32:56.101 --> 02:32:56.950
<v Speaker 2>maybe allege,</v>

6312
02:32:57.010 --> 02:32:58.200
<v Speaker 2>and he blamed his most.</v>

6313
02:32:58.310 --> 02:32:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Doctor blamed his doctor,</v>

6314
02:32:59.850 --> 02:33:00.630
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy.</v>

6315
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:01.860
<v Speaker 2>It's doctor's gonna sue him.</v>

6316
02:33:01.870 --> 02:33:02.790
<v Speaker 2>We said he was gonna sue them.</v>

6317
02:33:02.791 --> 02:33:04.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who knows what the fuck happened,</v>

6318
02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:05.081
<v Speaker 2>but either way,</v>

6319
02:33:05.081 --> 02:33:06.780
<v Speaker 2>the point is illegally took stuff.</v>

6320
02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:11.840
<v Speaker 2>He definitely too much elevated testosterone and he definitely had a tremendous</v>

6321
02:33:11.981 --> 02:33:14.360
<v Speaker 2>ability to absorb punishment that he didn't have.</v>

6322
02:33:14.490 --> 02:33:17.660
<v Speaker 2>It didn't show in the Cormier fight or can we put them white cane,</v>

6323
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:18.503
<v Speaker 2>put them away.</v>

6324
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Like Cain lit him up and dropped him and put them away quick and their fight and</v>

6325
02:33:21.841 --> 02:33:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Mark Hunt hits harder than both of them combined.</v>

6326
02:33:24.211 --> 02:33:27.630
<v Speaker 2>There's no one in this heavyweight division that hits harder than Mark Hunt in</v>

6327
02:33:27.631 --> 02:33:28.050
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

6328
02:33:28.050 --> 02:33:28.840
<v Speaker 2>There's just not.</v>

6329
02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that fascinating that testosterone can do that for you?</v>

6330
02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:31.670
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

6331
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:34.650
<v Speaker 2>It's all you have to do is just go in there with a hyper elevated levels.</v>

6332
02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:38.310
<v Speaker 2>So take out the part that he has fucking giant Dantic TISM you know what I'm</v>

6333
02:33:38.311 --> 02:33:38.491
<v Speaker 2>saying?</v>

6334
02:33:38.491 --> 02:33:39.870
<v Speaker 2>That he's an absolute monster,</v>

6335
02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:42.840
<v Speaker 2>but now he can absorb punches.</v>

6336
02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6337
02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:45.420
<v Speaker 2>and hit harder and better cardio.</v>

6338
02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

6339
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.740
<v Speaker 2>If you're a,</v>

6340
02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:47.970
<v Speaker 2>if you do an EPO and everything,</v>

6341
02:33:47.971 --> 02:33:49.530
<v Speaker 2>are you assuming he's also doing that?</v>

6342
02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're open to this cocktail,</v>

6343
02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:57.620
<v Speaker 2>if you love your [inaudible],</v>

6344
02:33:58.140 --> 02:33:59.460
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

6345
02:34:00.050 --> 02:34:00.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't do anything.</v>

6346
02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:01.561
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6347
02:34:01.561 --> 02:34:03.690
<v Speaker 2>I think you're on that is he had to bring him back to himself.</v>

6348
02:34:03.890 --> 02:34:04.840
<v Speaker 2>That is the question.</v>

6349
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:05.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

6350
02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Jeff,</v>

6351
02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:07.260
<v Speaker 2>how many guys are,</v>

6352
02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:08.910
<v Speaker 2>how many guys are on things?</v>

6353
02:34:09.450 --> 02:34:10.110
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

6354
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:13.500
<v Speaker 2>if you're open to put these supplements in your body,</v>

6355
02:34:13.770 --> 02:34:15.990
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you be open to putting these other supplements here?</v>

6356
02:34:15.990 --> 02:34:17.200
<v Speaker 2>But of course not just like,</v>

6357
02:34:17.350 --> 02:34:17.711
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6358
02:34:17.711 --> 02:34:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I'll do this when I got to stay at this limit,</v>

6359
02:34:19.541 --> 02:34:19.871
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

6360
02:34:19.871 --> 02:34:19.991
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6361
02:34:19.991 --> 02:34:20.531
<v Speaker 2>if you do this,</v>

6362
02:34:20.531 --> 02:34:21.730
<v Speaker 2>you're really going to be a Badass.</v>

6363
02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:22.271
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6364
02:34:22.271 --> 02:34:24.040
<v Speaker 2>that's just ethically wrong.</v>

6365
02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:26.020
<v Speaker 2>If you're putting a needle in your ass,</v>

6366
02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:28.120
<v Speaker 2>what do you care if it's filled half way or full?</v>

6367
02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:28.890
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6368
02:34:28.890 --> 02:34:29.723
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

6369
02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:30.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6370
02:34:30.161 --> 02:34:30.821
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

6371
02:34:30.821 --> 02:34:31.654
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6372
02:34:31.690 --> 02:34:32.710
<v Speaker 2>a guy like chill,</v>

6373
02:34:32.711 --> 02:34:34.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's pretty much proves it.</v>

6374
02:34:34.410 --> 02:34:34.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6375
02:34:34.751 --> 02:34:36.640
<v Speaker 2>chill had his reasons why he said that.</v>

6376
02:34:36.641 --> 02:34:39.850
<v Speaker 2>He took those first two supplements and then it turns out that they have this</v>

6377
02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:45.120
<v Speaker 2>incredibly detailed testing that Lorenzo pays for that's $45,000 per fighter and</v>

6378
02:34:48.041 --> 02:34:48.850
<v Speaker 2>they're taking this,</v>

6379
02:34:48.850 --> 02:34:49.661
<v Speaker 2>this is a crazy thing,</v>

6380
02:34:49.661 --> 02:34:50.410
<v Speaker 2>they're taking the drug,</v>

6381
02:34:50.410 --> 02:34:51.250
<v Speaker 2>they take the blood,</v>

6382
02:34:51.251 --> 02:34:55.540
<v Speaker 2>rather they'd take a test from you and then the guy has a direct chain of</v>

6383
02:34:55.541 --> 02:34:56.290
<v Speaker 2>custody.</v>

6384
02:34:56.290 --> 02:35:00.520
<v Speaker 2>So he's taking this flying with his blood to the place where they're testing it</v>

6385
02:35:00.850 --> 02:35:01.990
<v Speaker 2>and there he's like a notary.</v>

6386
02:35:02.490 --> 02:35:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6387
02:35:03.220 --> 02:35:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Well it was basically like the guy carrying the fucking nuclear codes,</v>

6388
02:35:06.220 --> 02:35:06.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6389
02:35:06.431 --> 02:35:09.070
<v Speaker 2>he's flying with it in his possession at all times,</v>

6390
02:35:09.310 --> 02:35:11.830
<v Speaker 2>gets to the lab so it's never left his possession.</v>

6391
02:35:12.010 --> 02:35:13.990
<v Speaker 2>And then they test it and you know,</v>

6392
02:35:13.991 --> 02:35:18.460
<v Speaker 2>they tested on shale got busted for all that stone EPO and HGH,</v>

6393
02:35:18.461 --> 02:35:19.990
<v Speaker 2>which the athletic commissions,</v>

6394
02:35:19.991 --> 02:35:22.320
<v Speaker 2>we're not testing for it because it's fucking expensive as shit.</v>

6395
02:35:22.370 --> 02:35:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6396
02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:25.750
<v Speaker 2>If they had to look for fires getting paid eight grand,</v>

6397
02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:30.650
<v Speaker 2>eight and eight eight to win the show and it's cost $45,000 to test him.</v>

6398
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Something is crazy.</v>

6399
02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:34.360
<v Speaker 2>That's why only the superstars in you taught cause you're,</v>

6400
02:35:34.450 --> 02:35:35.950
<v Speaker 2>you're paying the suicides so much money.</v>

6401
02:35:35.951 --> 02:35:37.360
<v Speaker 2>It's worth it to risk it.</v>

6402
02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Is it worth it now?</v>

6403
02:35:38.620 --> 02:35:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Cause now we just lost one of the biggest faces to the UFC who could talk people</v>

6404
02:35:43.031 --> 02:35:44.230
<v Speaker 2>into liking the UFC?</v>

6405
02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6406
02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:46.631
<v Speaker 2>Is it though?</v>

6407
02:35:46.631 --> 02:35:47.620
<v Speaker 2>But it's worth it.</v>

6408
02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Well what is not the only one?</v>

6409
02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:49.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6410
02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:50.781
<v Speaker 2>it's like baseball.</v>

6411
02:35:50.781 --> 02:35:51.550
<v Speaker 2>When people freak out,</v>

6412
02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:52.780
<v Speaker 2>mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,</v>

6413
02:35:52.930 --> 02:35:54.430
<v Speaker 2>you dumb fucks.</v>

6414
02:35:54.431 --> 02:35:55.720
<v Speaker 2>All the pitchers were on it.</v>

6415
02:35:56.020 --> 02:35:57.370
<v Speaker 2>So it's a fair game.</v>

6416
02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Lance Armstrong,</v>

6417
02:35:58.780 --> 02:35:59.111
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

6418
02:35:59.111 --> 02:36:00.310
<v Speaker 2>when he tested positive,</v>

6419
02:36:00.490 --> 02:36:03.670
<v Speaker 2>they have to go back to 15th place to find a guy who didn't test positive.</v>

6420
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:05.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a level playing field.</v>

6421
02:36:05.201 --> 02:36:06.250
<v Speaker 2>If everyone's on it,</v>

6422
02:36:06.251 --> 02:36:06.820
<v Speaker 2>you fucks.</v>

6423
02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:07.620
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6424
02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:08.201
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>

6425
02:36:08.201 --> 02:36:09.640
<v Speaker 2>But it's chronic.</v>

6426
02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Well it's like,</v>

6427
02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:13.000
<v Speaker 2>especially in combat sports like well it's dangerous.</v>

6428
02:36:13.001 --> 02:36:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Well so's getting punched in the face,</v>

6429
02:36:15.310 --> 02:36:15.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6430
02:36:15.700 --> 02:36:17.010
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty dangerous too.</v>

6431
02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Super Dangerous.</v>

6432
02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:18.850
<v Speaker 2>It keeps your career.</v>

6433
02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:20.470
<v Speaker 2>You can fight longer,</v>

6434
02:36:20.471 --> 02:36:21.580
<v Speaker 2>you can play longer.</v>

6435
02:36:22.090 --> 02:36:22.451
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6436
02:36:22.451 --> 02:36:24.010
<v Speaker 2>you're not hitting a fast ball off your bat.</v>

6437
02:36:24.010 --> 02:36:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Speed slows down a lot of times in the major leagues.</v>

6438
02:36:26.290 --> 02:36:30.400
<v Speaker 2>But you can make 20 more million dollars in play for five years if you take some</v>

6439
02:36:30.401 --> 02:36:30.950
<v Speaker 2>stuff's signed.</v>

6440
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Bron Ryan Braun,</v>

6441
02:36:31.991 --> 02:36:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Leo got busted and then ratted.</v>

6442
02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:35.030
<v Speaker 2>How to everyone say how he was against.</v>

6444
02:36:37.510 --> 02:36:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Went to fucking Costa Rico.</v>

6445
02:36:39.041 --> 02:36:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I was suspended.</v>

6446
02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:40.211
<v Speaker 2>Came back.</v>

6447
02:36:40.211 --> 02:36:40.850
<v Speaker 2>He's fine.</v>

6448
02:36:40.850 --> 02:36:41.140

6451
02:36:47.081 --> 02:36:47.914
<v Speaker 2>bank?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everyone forgets.</v>

6453
02:36:48.881 --> 02:36:51.400
<v Speaker 2>He got a standing ovation when he went back to Milwaukee.</v>

6454
02:36:51.540 --> 02:36:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

6455
02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:52.301
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

02:36:52.301 --> 02:36:53.530
<v Speaker 2>he's back.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he made it guaranteed.</v>

6464
02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:05.920
<v Speaker 2>So they don't take any of that away from you and you test positive for drugs and</v>

6465
02:37:05.921 --> 02:37:06.641
<v Speaker 2>robbing your friend.</v>

6485
02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Like you could find that EPO is tricky.</v>

6486
02:37:33.350 --> 02:37:33.890
<v Speaker 2>That's soup.</v>

6487
02:37:33.890 --> 02:37:34.940
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous.</v>

6488
02:37:34.941 --> 02:37:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I say nobody went to jail for taking steroids,</v>

6489
02:37:36.711 --> 02:37:38.210
<v Speaker 2>but you go to jail for lying to the feds.</v>

6490
02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Go to jail for lying on,</v>

6491
02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:44.280
<v Speaker 2>goes to jail for lying and you go to jail for selling it and mass distribution.</v>

6492
02:37:44.850 --> 02:37:47.240
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be really interesting to see what happens with Shell.</v>

6493
02:37:47.241 --> 02:37:47.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6494
02:37:47.481 --> 02:37:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where the fuck he got it from,</v>

6495
02:37:48.891 --> 02:37:49.611
<v Speaker 2>but Brian,</v>

6496
02:37:49.611 --> 02:37:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Stan was talking about it like you know that he had a conversation with shale.</v>

6497
02:37:52.361 --> 02:37:52.671
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

6498
02:37:52.671 --> 02:37:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you better be forthcoming when they come to you and they ask you questions.</v>

6499
02:37:55.700 --> 02:37:56.990
<v Speaker 2>That is where you can't lie to them.</v>

6500
02:37:56.991 --> 02:37:57.381
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

6501
02:37:57.381 --> 02:37:58.790
<v Speaker 2>if Brian Stan tells me something,</v>

6502
02:37:58.791 --> 02:38:00.020
<v Speaker 2>as far as the government goes,</v>

6503
02:38:00.021 --> 02:38:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm for sure he's listening because I'm definitely,</v>

6504
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm calling a sir.</v>

6505
02:38:04.250 --> 02:38:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>

6506
02:38:04.730 --> 02:38:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>

6507
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:06.081
<v Speaker 2>Why are you calling me,</v>

6508
02:38:06.081 --> 02:38:06.800
<v Speaker 2>sir?</v>

6509
02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:07.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm really freaked out.</v>

6510
02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Can you just come back to my hotel room and talk to,</v>

6511
02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:12.910

6512
02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:13.760
<v Speaker 2>talk me to sleep.</v>

6513
02:38:13.850 --> 02:38:16.070
<v Speaker 2>You're the inside guy here more than any of us.</v>

6514
02:38:16.071 --> 02:38:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6515
02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:17.480
<v Speaker 2>If I had to ask you,</v>

6516
02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.070
<v Speaker 2>how many guys do you think,</v>

6517
02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:21.230
<v Speaker 2>what percentage guys are taking HGH?</v>

6518
02:38:23.570 --> 02:38:24.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a headline.</v>

6519

02:38:28.260 --> 02:38:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Bigfoot only in Denver.</v>

6526

6527
02:38:30.811 --> 02:38:34.970
<v Speaker 2>not some numbers and you just give me facial expressions that don't necessarily</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're going to stop there.</v>

6532
02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>

6533
02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:45.140
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

6534
02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't even,</v>

6535
02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:46.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6536
02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:46.881
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

6537
02:38:46.881 --> 02:38:47.091
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

6538
02:38:47.091 --> 02:38:48.070
<v Speaker 2>like when I thought Lavard,</v>

6539
02:38:48.071 --> 02:38:48.831
<v Speaker 2>John's for instance,</v>

6540
02:38:48.831 --> 02:38:51.170
<v Speaker 2>we went on the scales and we get off.</v>

6541
02:38:51.171 --> 02:38:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I turned my coach and he'll come on Bro.</v>

6542
02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously on stuff I just assumed like everyone's like bro,</v>

6543
02:38:56.841 --> 02:38:57.610
<v Speaker 2>he's jacked.</v>

6544
02:38:57.610 --> 02:38:58.130
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

6545
02:38:58.130 --> 02:38:58.521
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6546
02:38:58.521 --> 02:38:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

6547
02:38:59.240 --> 02:38:59.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6548
02:38:59.481 --> 02:39:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Well literally I just assume he's on shit.</v>

6549
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I assume he's on HGH.</v>

6550
02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:04.730
<v Speaker 2>I assume he was on testosterone,</v>

6551
02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:04.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6552
02:39:04.930 --> 02:39:06.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just part of the game we play,</v>

6553
02:39:06.530 --> 02:39:08.360
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking insane.</v>

6554
02:39:08.650 --> 02:39:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Cause he hit me with like this 30% outbreak cut and I was like in La La land</v>

6555
02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:15.140
<v Speaker 2>almost ripped my fucking lips off 30%.</v>

6556
02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:15.920
<v Speaker 2>30%.</v>

6557
02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Cause he kind of went with it.</v>

6558
02:39:18.250 --> 02:39:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6559
02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:19.220
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6560
02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:21.230
<v Speaker 2>That thing lands my jaws all shattered.</v>

6561
02:39:21.231 --> 02:39:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking Kanye West style talk like slurping my dinner and shit.</v>

6562
02:39:25.370 --> 02:39:25.790
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

6563
02:39:25.790 --> 02:39:27.860
<v Speaker 2>A Kanye West was a crotch shot I think.</v>

6564
02:39:27.861 --> 02:39:28.191
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6565
02:39:28.191 --> 02:39:29.850
<v Speaker 2>And broke his jaw or some was it?</v>

6566
02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I just figure a gangster shot I made,</v>

6567
02:39:34.010 --> 02:39:34.671
<v Speaker 2>I assumed,</v>

6568
02:39:34.671 --> 02:39:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I assumed he wears like Gucci loafers and Shit.</v>

6569
02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:38.450
<v Speaker 2>This guy gangster.</v>

6570
02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:39.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6571
02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:40.003
<v Speaker 2>Sports are crazy.</v>

6572
02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:40.873
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

6573
02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:41.630
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

6574
02:39:41.630 --> 02:39:42.620
<v Speaker 2>it's just not the UFC.</v>

6575
02:39:42.621 --> 02:39:44.090
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about like the UFC prom.</v>

6576
02:39:44.180 --> 02:39:45.530
<v Speaker 2>This is everything.</v>

6577
02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:47.690
<v Speaker 2>And watch the NFL network.</v>

6578
02:39:47.691 --> 02:39:49.150
<v Speaker 2>The bottom of screen goes black.</v>

6579
02:39:49.420 --> 02:39:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6580
02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Dixon gets spent for enhancing performance enhancers.</v>

6581
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:54.021
<v Speaker 2>It happens all the time,</v>

6582
02:39:54.021 --> 02:39:55.190
<v Speaker 2>but they don't make a big deal of it.</v>

6583
02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:56.600
<v Speaker 2>This like literally,</v>

6584
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:57.463
<v Speaker 2>you don't hear about it.</v>

6585
02:39:57.470 --> 02:40:00.470
<v Speaker 2>You didn't hear balance sports center when no one gets tested more than combat</v>

6586
02:40:00.471 --> 02:40:00.951
<v Speaker 2>athletes,</v>

6587
02:40:00.951 --> 02:40:01.880
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

6588
02:40:02.370 --> 02:40:03.920
<v Speaker 2>they make such a big deal of it.</v>

6589
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Well here's these other sports.</v>

6590
02:40:04.941 --> 02:40:08.510
<v Speaker 2>They don't because if you're better because of performance enhancing drugs,</v>

6591
02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:10.370
<v Speaker 2>you're better performing by,</v>

6592
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:11.810
<v Speaker 2>you're better at hitting a ball.</v>

6593
02:40:12.050 --> 02:40:13.440
<v Speaker 2>You're better at throwing a ball.</v>

6594
02:40:13.441 --> 02:40:14.274
<v Speaker 2>You're better at,</v>

6595
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:14.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6596

<v Speaker 2>doing sports,</v>

6597
02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:19.500
<v Speaker 2>but you're not better at beating the fuck at a person and causing damage to</v>

6598
02:40:19.501 --> 02:40:19.770
<v Speaker 2>their</v>

6599
02:40:19.770 --> 02:40:22.730
<v Speaker 5>brain and definitely taking years off their life.</v>

6600
02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:23.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6601

6602
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:28.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fan and I've always liked to have had a couple of gals with him.</v>

6603
02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:30.350
<v Speaker 5>Looks like he's having a good old time.</v>

6604
02:40:30.351 --> 02:40:31.130
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>

6815
02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:22.600
<v Speaker 1>something I've picked up in a book.</v>

<v Speaker 1>About like,</v>

6820
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:28.990
<v Speaker 1>like mental toughness?</v>

6821
02:45:30.470 --> 02:45:31.303
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>

6822
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.691
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

6823
02:45:31.691 --> 02:45:33.340
<v Speaker 6>I read a lot of like mental books,</v>

6824
02:45:33.390 --> 02:45:34.330
<v Speaker 6>a mental toughness.</v>

6825
02:45:34.331 --> 02:45:36.130
<v Speaker 6>I read a lot of like um,</v>

6826
02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:39.790
<v Speaker 6>military stuff really because if you can pitch it out,</v>

6827
02:45:39.791 --> 02:45:41.230
<v Speaker 6>military guys like navy seals,</v>

6828
02:45:41.231 --> 02:45:43.270
<v Speaker 6>what they go through in the mindframe they get in.</v>

6829
02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:46.030
<v Speaker 6>What we do is nothing compared to them.</v>

6830
02:45:46.110 --> 02:45:46.330
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

6831
02:45:46.330 --> 02:45:47.440
<v Speaker 6>You've got to think about the nerves,</v>

6832
02:45:47.441 --> 02:45:50.500
<v Speaker 6>the navy seals dealing with before they go into war and they talked about the</v>

6833
02:45:50.501 --> 02:45:52.240
<v Speaker 6>breathing technique and the mentality they have,</v>

6834
02:45:52.241 --> 02:45:56.020
<v Speaker 6>especially when they're going through like bootcamp and the navy seal selection,</v>

6835
02:45:56.021 --> 02:45:57.700
<v Speaker 6>which is insane because one,</v>

6836
02:45:57.701 --> 02:46:02.701
<v Speaker 6>I have like 99 makes the cut and seeing the guys who make it and the,</v>

6837
02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:06.430
<v Speaker 6>the guys who run it say they can always tell who's going to make it.</v>

6838
02:46:06.431 --> 02:46:07.690
<v Speaker 6>Cause I guess they talked to them,</v>

6839
02:46:07.691 --> 02:46:09.790
<v Speaker 6>interview them after each day and the one,</v>

6840
02:46:09.870 --> 02:46:10.940
<v Speaker 6>you know guys be like,</v>

6841
02:46:11.150 --> 02:46:11.870
<v Speaker 6>yeah man,</v>

6842
02:46:11.870 --> 02:46:13.240
<v Speaker 6>there's only three weeks left Africa.</v>

6843
02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:15.080
<v Speaker 6>If I can just get through these three weeks.</v>

6844
02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:17.150
<v Speaker 6>They see when they go acts of the room like he's fucked,</v>

6845
02:46:17.151 --> 02:46:17.984
<v Speaker 6>he's not going to make it.</v>

6846
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:19.730
<v Speaker 6>Then another guy comes in the room and he's like,</v>

6847
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:21.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm just trying to get through tomorrow man.</v>

6848
02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:22.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm just trying to get through tomorrow.</v>

6849
02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:24.590
<v Speaker 6>I literally take it one at a time.</v>

6850
02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:24.951
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

6851
02:46:24.951 --> 02:46:26.660
<v Speaker 6>just get through this drill and take the next drill.</v>

6852
02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:26.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6853
02:46:26.810 --> 02:46:29.360
<v Speaker 6>and it's the same thing in fighting and that that's what I do.</v>

6854
02:46:29.500 --> 02:46:31.820
<v Speaker 6>I had never look at the grand scheme of things.</v>

6855
02:46:31.821 --> 02:46:32.750
<v Speaker 6>I never do.</v>

6856
02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:34.040
<v Speaker 6>Like I'll wake up and like I,</v>

6857
02:46:34.041 --> 02:46:35.390
<v Speaker 6>you got five round spine,</v>

6858
02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:36.260
<v Speaker 6>let's go,</v>

6859
02:46:36.260 --> 02:46:38.750
<v Speaker 6>let's do this first round and then I look at the state ground third,</v>

6860
02:46:38.751 --> 02:46:39.081
<v Speaker 6>fourth,</v>

6861
02:46:39.081 --> 02:46:39.500
<v Speaker 6>fifth.</v>

6862
02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:40.190
<v Speaker 6>That's interesting.</v>

6863
02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:41.300
<v Speaker 6>If you look at the grand scheme of like,</v>

6864
02:46:41.330 --> 02:46:41.691
<v Speaker 6>Oh man,</v>

6865
02:46:41.691 --> 02:46:42.360

6867
02:46:43.380 --> 02:46:44.540

6869
02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:46.820
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot of work,</v>

6870
02:46:46.821 --> 02:46:47.091

<v Speaker 6>You're me overwhelmed.</v>

6872
02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:49.370
<v Speaker 6>You're not going to be focused at your best.</v>

6873
02:46:49.371 --> 02:46:50.600
<v Speaker 6>Breaking it down individually.</v>

6874
02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:51.831
<v Speaker 6>That's interesting,</v>

6875
02:46:51.831 --> 02:46:53.720
<v Speaker 6>but what about like the overall game?</v>

6876
02:46:53.721 --> 02:46:57.320
<v Speaker 6>Like if you look at your overall mixed martial arts game and trying to improve</v>

6877
02:46:57.321 --> 02:46:59.060
<v Speaker 6>and trying to compare all these things,</v>

<v Speaker 6>do you do like have like a,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I would like to be at these numbers.</v>

6883
02:47:10.851 --> 02:47:12.440
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to be doing these rounds.</v>

6884
02:47:12.441 --> 02:47:13.310
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to be doing.</v>

02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:51.801
<v Speaker 6>what kind of,</v>

6913
02:47:51.801 --> 02:47:53.180
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if I can put some one thing,</v>

6914
02:47:53.181 --> 02:47:55.100
<v Speaker 6>I'll just say just really like the tempo.</v>

6915
02:47:55.101 --> 02:47:58.910
<v Speaker 6>I sat nonstop and then I finished my week off by running on the track,</v>

6916
02:47:58.911 --> 02:48:01.910
<v Speaker 6>doing these long sprints where we monitor my heart rate.</v>

6917
02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:02.893
<v Speaker 6>So when it goes,</v>

6918
02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:03.370
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6919
02:48:03.370 --> 02:48:07.220
<v Speaker 6>and so I'll end my heart rate be like one 88 soon as it gets down to one 40,</v>

6920
02:48:07.221 --> 02:48:08.060
<v Speaker 6>I'm running again.</v>

6921
02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:09.313
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

6922
02:48:09.380 --> 02:48:09.741
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

6923
02:48:09.741 --> 02:48:10.191
<v Speaker 6>That does it.</v>

6924
02:48:10.191 --> 02:48:10.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6925
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:13.870
<v Speaker 6>As soon as it gets down to 140140140,</v>

6926
02:48:13.900 --> 02:48:14.900
<v Speaker 6>that's not very low.</v>

6927
02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:15.753
<v Speaker 6>It's not very low.</v>

6928
02:48:15.890 --> 02:48:16.420
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

6929
02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:16.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6930
02:48:16.670 --> 02:48:19.060
<v Speaker 6>So you just keep swiping my confidence from though,</v>

6931
02:48:19.061 --> 02:48:19.360
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

6932
02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:21.440
<v Speaker 6>Cause I'm fucking terrified and I,</v>

6933
02:48:21.441 --> 02:48:21.931
<v Speaker 6>and I'll,</v>

6934
02:48:21.931 --> 02:48:22.521
<v Speaker 6>I'll be honest,</v>

6935
02:48:22.521 --> 02:48:24.410
<v Speaker 6>I suffer a little bit from body issues too,</v>

6936
02:48:24.411 --> 02:48:24.830
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Everyone suffers from it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>For me though,</v>

6979
02:49:13.291 --> 02:49:14.040
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

6980

6984
02:49:18.151 --> 02:49:20.640
<v Speaker 5>I never want people to see me not in shape,</v>

6985
02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:21.780
<v Speaker 5>which I am in shape,</v>

6986
02:49:21.781 --> 02:49:24.690
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want people to see me like out of my peak.</v>

6987
02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:27.570
<v Speaker 5>But you see a guy like fade or like always had kind of like a little bit of a</v>

6988
02:49:27.571 --> 02:49:28.170
<v Speaker 5>gut,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like just fuck.</v>

6994
02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:37.890
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't worried at all about,</v>

6995
02:49:37.891 --> 02:49:38.671
<v Speaker 5>I know it's different.</v>

6996
02:49:38.671 --> 02:49:39.151

<v Speaker 5>Like maybe if he like thought the way he thinks I miss.</v>

7004
02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:52.610
<v Speaker 5>Is there a way to like emulate that sort of a mindset or program yourself like</v>
