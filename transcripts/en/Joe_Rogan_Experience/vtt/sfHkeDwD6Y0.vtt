1
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.290
The joe rogan experience

2
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.150
while I'm on.
Pretty easy.
Huh?

3
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.330
How do I know for sure?
Exactly.
That's the key.

4
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.700
I think that's eventually going to be the whole world.

5
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.230
You were just going to be online.

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.990
<v 1>I wouldn't doubt it.
I mean it looked the size of these cameras.
I'm shocked.</v>

7
00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:33.250
I was expecting to see this big studio with like do to do this is Hollywood.

8
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.570
<v 0>Yeah.
This is tiny little cameras.
A normal consumer grade,
you know,</v>

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.030
and that's basically what it is.

10
00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:43.750
I mean we have a new ones that are high definition ones that we haven't worked

11
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:47.590
the kinks out yet.
That'll be up shortly.
But uh,
other than that,

12
00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:51.490
just regular cameras.
And this is actually like,
just like this,
the background,

13
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:53.990
everything's on.
This is online like right now.
Yeah.

14
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.980
We can show it to you if you want.
Yeah.
You see it?
Show it to you.

15
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:58.960
I'm one of the screens.
Yeah,
that's,
that's really cool.

16
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.660
I spend a little bit of time out in the mountain so I don't get the little bit a

17
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.150
little bit.
You live online right now.
We'll wait.
Cool.

18
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.170
So,
uh,
I saw your show,

19
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.880
the new show and the old show.
I've seen them online,
um,
from,

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.750
I guess the last couple of years.
And for folks who don't know,
Jim Shockey,

21
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:25.150
you're famous,
a hunter,
a famous,
uh,
outdoorsman,
conservationist,

22
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.310
all the above.
But you're,
uh,

23
00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:30.550
your new show is what really drew me in when I really started tweeting about it.

24
00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:32.650
The show uncharted,
where,

25
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.540
I mean there's shows that transcend the genre that they're in.
You know,

26
00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:40.270
there's shows that like,
they might,
it might be a comedy show,

27
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:43.260
but there's more to it.
It might be a drama,
but it's,

28
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.130
this show is very difficult to define this uncharted show cause it's almost like

29
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:51.430
a documentary on these strange cultures that you're visiting.

30
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.720
<v 1>Yeah.
With hunting as,
as the,
as the underlying reason we're there.
Um,</v>

31
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.270
and the theme when we're in those places,
you know,
what,
what,

32
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:04.070
what's going on with the hunting in those crazy wild lands.
Um,
then I,

33
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.720
you know,
just for,
I mean,
before we even go one step further,
I've got to say,

34
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.800
I like to take full credit for it,
but it's,
uh,
it's our son Brandon,

35
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.300
you know,
this is his brainchild.
He,
he actually,
you know,

36
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.690
I've done television hunting shows and you've seen the hunting shows.
I mean,

37
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:23.460
they started my original ones a zillion years ago.
Now we're pretty bad.
Like,

38
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.470
hi,
I'm Jim Shockey.
This is my big buck,
you know.
But,
uh,
you know,

39
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:32.850
Brandon wanted to do something that would change television.

40
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.900
Like literally that,
that was,

41
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:37.180
that was his goal was to change television the way you watch television.
And,

42
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:41.640
and uh,
you know,
I said,
absolutely.
If it's,
if it's art,
which I think,

43
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.590
you know,
we don't get enough credit in as hunters.
They,
people think,
oh,

44
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:49.230
we're just louts,
you know,
swilling beer,

45
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:53.270
shooting out the window of the truck and,
and,
and causing havoc.
Well,
that's,

46
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.990
that's not what hunters are,
you know,

47
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:59.320
hunters have some of the highest sensibilities you can possibly have there.

48
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:03.100
They're tuned into nature like nobody else.
Maybe mountaineers.
I mean,

49
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.060
you read mountaineering books,
those guys,
they're also switched on for that.
But,

50
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.850
uh,
your brand wanted to try and capture that and,

51
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.180
and the cultures are on the road.
I,
that's,
that's uncharted.
Yeah.

52
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:18.181
I think it's a very unfortunate aspect of our culture that we live in this weird

53
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.290
insulated world where people are so detached from the meat they eat and where it

54
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:27.160
comes from,
that they view the people who go out and get it themselves.

55
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.900
And the most difficult circumstances,

56
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.920
they've used those people to be less intelligent,

57
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.510
have a low moral standards.
They view them to be drunks.

58
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:41.200
And I don't know how it happened that hunter's got lumped into this strange

59
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:41.501
group,

60
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:44.830
but I was having a conversation with a friend of mine online the other day and

61
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:46.420
he was having these,

62
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.770
he was making these accusations about hunters and I was like,

63
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:52.570
do you actually even know any hunters?
Like,

64
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.290
are you just like basing this on like an episode of bugs bunny that's like,

65
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.530
what is this is,
you know what it is?
It's a,
I mean,

66
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.880
I'm old enough to remember Walt Disney when he did Bambi,
that son of a gun,

67
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.070
I'm telling you,
that was the day that was the day that,

68
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.080
that the pendulum starts swinging in the other direction.
And we,

69
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.270
in the popular press became that guy that killed Bambi,
his mother.
I mean,
oh God.

70
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.240
You know,
Walt,
while I'm down here,

71
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:22.360
I'm actually going to see if I can have a visit with them and go piss on his

72
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.380
grave.
Well,
yeah.
Oh,
I know.
Because he also,

73
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:31.080
he also did Pollyanna and some great movies,
but uh,
but,
uh,
you know,
he,

74
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.070
that's where it started.
And,
and to be fair,
to be fair,
you know,
go back 19,

75
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.440
say 50s,
you know,
you've got Howard Roark and Hemingway foot on top,

76
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.940
other lion,
you know,
with their gun up.
And these guys,
you know,
you know,

77
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.860
there's no wonder there was a backlash,
especially by females.

78
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.290
I mean [inaudible] what did he brag about?

79
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.510
And I apologize if I get the numbers wrong,

80
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:59.530
but how many women he slept with in his life?
I mean,
and that's fine.
That's fine.

81
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:03.310
But it went against everything that was family and,

82
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:07.540
and what this country and Canada was built on,
you know,
the foundation.

83
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.760
So these,
these guys were,
they were showing us,
you know,

84
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.950
bores and no offense on,
and I,

85
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:17.740
and I Apologize Hemingway if you're listening or Rourke,

86
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.960
but they did us no service.
So when,
when Disney came in and did Bambi,

87
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.870
that was it,
you know,
and then,
and that was the same time,

88
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.690
roughly approximately one a Kennedy was shot.

89
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.300
So now you had this whole gun thing and you know,

90
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:34.750
the hippie movement and Wham were,
we're,
we are,

91
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.690
I guess,
a alienated or certainly marginalized,
uh,
as,
as human beings.

92
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:45.430
And,
and since 1960,
you know,
so this,
this is what we've been fighting.

93
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:50.350
And now finally,
you know,
we,
we did not have access to any press.

94
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:52.750
We had no way to tell our message where we,
you know,

95
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:57.380
we had American sportsman with curt Gowdy.
That was up until 1962,
she'll cancel,

96
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.210
gone goodbye.
Or whenever it was canceled.
Uh,
we had no way,
no way to access,
uh,

97
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.000
the,
the airwaves,
you know,
the,
the three major networks,

98
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.950
they want to know part of hunters,
they would,
you know,

99
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.200
they wanted to show Bambi or,
or,
you know,

100
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:12.530
anything else that was similar and they,
we had no way to talk.

101
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:15.680
We had no way to tell people our story other than magazines,

102
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.830
which of course television superseded that very quickly.

103
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:21.550
So it's only been in the last,
you know,

104
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.590
10 really 10 years that we've started to reach into the households,

105
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.980
you know,
with,
with outdoor channels,
like the outdoor channel,
literally.

106
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.180
<v 2>And that's,
even though that's sort almost preaching to the choir a bit.
Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:36.181 --> 00:06:39.300
Unfortunately the,
and that there's,
there's economics,
right?
Who's,

108
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.560
who buys that network?
Well,
it's,
it's a case of you have to buy the households

109
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.470
<v 1>before you're going to get distribution into those households.</v>

110
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.640
So your cost money,
I mean,
I don't know what the numbers are,

111
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.670
say $4 a household and ends up being,
it's

112
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.700
<v 2>pensive.</v>

113
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.360
I feel like there's a swing in the other direction now in a pretty big way.

114
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:59.270
And I think one of the reasons why is these,
um,

115
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.360
these shows like life below zero and these Alaska mountain men shows where

116
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:06.830
they're showing people living off the land and it,

117
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.020
it paints this attractive view of living this sustenance lifestyle.

118
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.820
Yeah.
So simpler,
simpler lifestyle.
I mean,
I,

119
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.790
I still have issues with how they portray the characters.
I mean,

120
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.240
they still want that,
you know,

121
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:24.070
they don't want to see somebody who's articulate can form a whole sense.
Not,

122
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.140
not saying those guys can't,
but you know,

123
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.630
they still want know to build a justify watching it.

124
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:32.750
They want to see them being a little bit different.
You know what I mean?
Look at,

125
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:36.290
uh,
look at Phil and William.
The guys on Duck Dynasty,
they,
you know,

126
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:40.460
they're allowed because they've got the big beards and their talk funny.
So,
okay,

127
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:44.120
well we can let them hunt,
you know,
but they don't want to see somebody that is,

128
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.130
looks like them hunting.

129
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:49.160
It doesn't compute inside their brains because that's not what hunters are.

130
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.710
Why don't think it's necessarily that they don't want to see it.

131
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.560
It's just that they're trying to sell.
They're trying to sell television,

132
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:56.450
the way to sell television to show freaks,

133
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.490
to show honey booboo and show Weirdos and these duck guys live in the swamps

134
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:03.470
with these crazy beards.
You know,

135
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.240
that's what people will tune into a will or he didn't mean that about being

136
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:12.720
freaks.
I did.
I did.
I just tried to stick up for William.

137
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.730
He needs to stick up for himself.
You know,

138
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.040
Willie's been telling people to watch the new Nicholas cage movie to prepare for

139
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:21.770
the a apocalypse.
I haven't heard that.

140
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.870
I'll play it for I feel like is the reckoning or what have you.

141
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.610
Yeah,
I mean but yeah,
that's,
that's what people want to see.

142
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.580
They want to see different,

143
00:08:32.581 --> 00:08:34.100
want to see a free cause they don't want to say normal.

144
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:37.400
They want to see the Kardashians.
Dysfunctional family.

145
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.730
You know what that has to change.

146
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.420
That has to change because we can't keep feeding people that swill and expected,

147
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.860
<v 1>you know,
what,
what's going to happen with the country and uh,
10 years of that.</v>

148
00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:53.490
Have you been so dumbed down you won't even be able to remember how to breathe.

149
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.070
<v 2>I think it is changing.
I</v>

150
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.670
<v 3>think what we're dealing with is like the last throes,</v>

151
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.710
like the last dying twitches of our culture.

152
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:09.450
Making this weird shift into the age of information and along the way you're

153
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:13.530
just going to give people is anything to keep them occupied and people,

154
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.950
they don't have communication with their neighbors,
they don't.

155
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.010
The the gossip that they get is like gossip at work.
I come in and work,

156
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.920
this motherfucker always wants to talk to me about Kanye West is getting

157
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.910
divorced and this guy's in trouble and Jay z got an argument with his girlfriend

158
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:30.870
and like the these people that live in this culture today.

159
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.790
A lot of it,
and I'm not Jamie,
a very intelligent guy,
but he loves pop culture.

160
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.440
We are,

161
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.820
we're constantly inundated with stuff that's,

162
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.530
that's flashy and distracting and nonsensical things that don't mean anything.

163
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.400
And I think a lot of it is just because of the way human beings live.

164
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.300
I think a lot of it is the way people live in these neighborhoods where they

165
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:58.950
don't know anybody and we have a desire for gossip.
We have a desire to,

166
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.000
to talk shit about people and to,

167
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.680
to like hear what the secrets are and what the dirt is.

168
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:09.681
And I think these shows feed that they feed into that they give you this world

169
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:12.870
that you can pay attention to,
that's way more screwed up than your world is.

170
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.110
And it's right in front of your face and you can tune in every night and you get

171
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.480
engrossed and caught up in his character.

172
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.660
One guy owns a pawn shop and his dad's always sleeping and you know,

173
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.130
and you watch this dumb show and you wasted a half an hour of your time.

174
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.360
And because of clever editing and because they put these Weirdos in front of you

175
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:33.990
and just interesting enough to keep you paying attention before you know,

176
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:35.580
what your hours gone.
Like,
what happened?

177
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.060
What did you just stole something from my life.
He did a dance for me.
And yeah,

178
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.520
he would wave the clock in front of my face,
you know,

179
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:43.230
Tick Tock and you hypnotize me,

180
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.000
<v 1>you know?
Uh,
speaking of that,
actually,
uh,</v>

181
00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:50.550
I've been caught on that because it's true when you're,
oh,

182
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.690
you're saying it that way.
I mean,
I was caught up in the Arctic here this year.

183
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:57.350
We were watching a,
I couldn't get out on the land for a hunt,

184
00:10:57.351 --> 00:11:00.680
so we were trapped in a little tiny hotel room,
which will hotel,

185
00:11:00.681 --> 00:11:05.681
there was like a trailer divided up into compartments and on television was

186
00:11:06.111 --> 00:11:09.470
reruns of storage wars and they,
the one storage,

187
00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:12.740
the guy had bought a vault.
It was just a safe,

188
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:18.100
and I watched the whole darn show and rental rental attest to this event is

189
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.280
listening.
Another way,
you can't do it on line,
but uh,
you know,

190
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.090
there is nothing more important.

191
00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:27.350
I watched every commercial so I wouldn't miss the opening of that stupid safe

192
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:30.680
and it,
and they open it up and there's nothing in it.
It's like,
oh my goodness.

193
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.610
Gotcha.
Oh,
of course they did.
And that you said it.
I mean,
they,
they dumb us down.

194
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.740
They don't want us,
they,
they like,

195
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:39.950
they hook us on sugar and there's at the end of it,

196
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:44.000
you're still hungry but you don't feel sated yet.
You're,
you know,
you're,

197
00:11:44.001 --> 00:11:47.390
you know,
you're 20 pounds heavier than you were when you started the show.

198
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.860
So it's a or 20 Iq points lighter,
less.
Uh,

199
00:11:51.861 --> 00:11:56.610
and I,
I ma,
I just,
I just have hope.
I mean,
I,

200
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.190
I,
I don't always,
there's times when I,
when I despair,
you know,
when,
uh,

201
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.010
when I look at this big picture,
cause I,
you know,

202
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:07.390
I look at it from an outside objective view.
You talked about Jay Z and,
and,

203
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.410
and k west or something like that.
I have no idea who those guys are.

204
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:14.560
And they are assuming their guys.
Yeah.
I,
you know,

205
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:19.561
I spent a lot of time on a mountain top looking at the world and,

206
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.470
and you know,
there's times I just despair and,
and,
and then,

207
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.770
then I'll tell you honestly,
and they said,
this is a compliment to you.
You know,

208
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:28.240
I get a tweet like that where you,

209
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:33.100
you saw what we're producing and someone in this place,
and this isn't,
you know,

210
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.170
no offense,
but you're not far from Hollywood,

211
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.250
which got to be around here somewhere.

212
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.450
<v 2>I had to have driven to,
it is $100 for the cab ride from the airport to here.</v>

213
00:12:41.451 --> 00:12:43.360
So I must've come unless they got it

214
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.890
<v 1>took me on a tour.
I have no idea.
It's probably just the traffic.
Yeah,
it was.</v>

215
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.300
I mean,
you're close to that.
But again,
back to the compliment,
you know,

216
00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:56.040
I'm here for one reason because you're standing up for good things.

217
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.310
Things that are important.
And you know,
in my world that's the hunting and to,

218
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.510
to bring it to the forefront and you'll take the heat.
You know,
I,

219
00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:05.880
I saw some of the comments about you and whatnot with your hunting and how

220
00:13:05.881 --> 00:13:09.330
you've had to define what you're doing is hunting,
eating the meat.

221
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.860
And I respect that you are standing up the,
and that's hence the reason there's,

222
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.670
you know,
a zillion people watch your podcasts and listen to what you say.
I mean,

223
00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:21.470
we were listening to it in,
uh,
Tanzania this last month.
Wow.

224
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.990
One of my cameraman is a huge fan.
He's probably listening right now.
Hey John,

225
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.640
what's up John?
He,
he's,
he's probably,
they say,
listen right now he had your,

226
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.110
your podcast with Steve Rinella.
So,
and it was fascinating.
I mean,

227
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.440
you're reaching out and educating people about what hunting is about and you

228
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:43.110
know,
from the meat side and,
and that perspective and it's fantastic.

229
00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:45.120
All support that any day and that,
that gives me hope.

230
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.200
So when I stand up there and,
and look at this picture of this world,

231
00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:54.150
it was just like you say,
it's been honey booboo wise,
do you,
you,
you know,
there,

232
00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:55.970
there,
there's really,
it's just despair.

233
00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.210
I just see the big mass of despair until these tiny little voice has come up,

234
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.030
you know,
and,

235
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.620
and you're making an attempt and you're reaching people and you're fighting and

236
00:14:04.621 --> 00:14:07.990
that,
you know,
that's why I'm here.
That's,
that's hope.
There is hope that

237
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.410
people are just not that stupid.
No,
they're not.
They're not that stupid.

238
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.300
<v 2>They're not in just like you,</v>

239
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.890
you got roped into watching this stupid store to storage wars show.
Excuse me.

240
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:22.890
That was a safe thing.
That was,
that was different.

241
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.450
That was different.
There is a safe and they see the had to be something in that.

242
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:29.870
You remember Al Capone's vault?
I do with her other.

243
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.130
There was like a special live episode.

244
00:14:35.131 --> 00:14:39.750
Like what kind of a fool like opens up this stupid vault live hoping it's

245
00:14:39.751 --> 00:14:44.730
something you name there.
Excuse me,
I got caught on that one too.
I actually,

246
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.730
I actually did watch and then what'd they find?
Newspapers or something.

247
00:14:47.731 --> 00:14:51.950
I didn't know that.
Nothing.
Nothing but you,
you're a guy who

248
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.220
<v 3>is constantly in the outdoors.
You're completely intuned to nature.</v>

249
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:56.570
You're a conservation issue.

250
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:59.810
We're very passionate about the outdoors and about hunting and about the

251
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:03.140
traditions of it and what a discipline it is.

252
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.980
But yet you got sucked into this and I think that this is the same way.

253
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:11.510
Like if people are starving and all that's on the shelf is some sugary cereal,

254
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.600
you'll have a ball.
That stupid sugary cereal because that's what's there.

255
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.580
But if something else is more interesting and it grab it,

256
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.610
it gets your attention and pulls you into it,

257
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.100
that'll be ultimately much more satisfying.

258
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.000
It's just a matter of not having those options.

259
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.580
And the people that are programming television,

260
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.780
they're just trying to make money.
They're not artists with their,

261
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.550
their goal is to not embarrass themselves.

262
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.980
They don't want to put anything out that shames their family.

263
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.340
They want to put something out that they could say,
Hey,

264
00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:43.190
a storage wars is a good show.
Hey to 100 more episodes of storage work.

265
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.850
And they'll click champagne glasses and they'll drive off in their Mercedes and

266
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:49.190
they think they're doing a great job.
They're not bad people.

267
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.150
They're just selling something that sells.
They're there,

268
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.880
they're promoting something that they think is going to earn them a living,

269
00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:56.370
living

270
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.260
<v 1>the a hundred percent I agree.
I mean,
we,</v>

271
00:15:58.261 --> 00:16:01.720
we've done the chips out to New York City and met with these people and,

272
00:16:01.721 --> 00:16:05.040
and you know,
I'm probably burning all kinds of bridges on this,
but you know,

273
00:16:05.041 --> 00:16:06.890
it's mediocrity at its best and then that,

274
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.820
that is what you see and for very good reason,
you know,
the tall poppy,

275
00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:11.820
he's going to get cut off.

276
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.140
So if somebody has the guts to,

277
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.280
to put a show that's actually good that people will watch,

278
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.150
they're going to be the first one to do it.
So they've got to fight against,

279
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.090
imagine that it's not just one box of cereal,

280
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.760
fruit loops and captain crunch on this.
You know,

281
00:16:29.761 --> 00:16:32.010
there is chocolate and nuts and all kinds.
I mean,
it's a,

282
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.780
it's an aisle full of that crop,

283
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.090
that sugary crap and everyone's trying to get the attention of,

284
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.640
now you put one good show in that same mile,

285
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:43.050
you got everybody addicted to the sugar,
right?
I mean,
once you're eating sugar,

286
00:16:43.051 --> 00:16:45.540
you know,
it's hard to put down a package of Jube use and Twizzlers,

287
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.640
Twizzlers particularly I will eat until the last Twizzlers gone and that,

288
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.570
that's what people will do.
Yeah,
I mean some metaphor,

289
00:16:51.571 --> 00:16:54.570
but that's what they're doing.
They're,
you know,
they're going down that aisle.

290
00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:58.470
There's,
there may be one good show on there,
but you know,
the odds on them,

291
00:16:58.471 --> 00:17:01.470
a biting on or trying it or are really slimmed.

292
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.550
These guys that are making the choice to put that show on that,
on that shelf,

293
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.960
you know,
that guy sitting there with,
with his entire career on the line,

294
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.220
because he tried to do the right thing and to,

295
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.290
to under me down on what's being fed to us on television.

296
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:19.620
So his mortgage is on the line.
His kids got to go to school,

297
00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:23.220
he's got to have shoes on their feet and now he's done something that's right.

298
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.940
And it doesn't work because there's too much on that shelf over that garbage.

299
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.600
Know there's too many networks.
Everybody's fighting for that,
those eyeballs.

300
00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:35.500
And how does his show stand out?
So he loses his job.
So what do they do?
What,

301
00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:38.310
what,
what do you do?
You put another box of cereal on that,

302
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.330
that shelf of crap and,
and let people eat it.
And,
and that's,
you know,

303
00:17:42.331 --> 00:17:45.360
so like you say there,
it's not their fault.
They're,
they're just,

304
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.890
they're in between a rock and a hard place.
They got to save their,
it's,
it's,

305
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.100
it's their income.
And I,
you know,
well,
you know,

306
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:56.070
even the good thing is we have the outdoor channel,
the outdoor channel,
the,

307
00:17:56.071 --> 00:18:00.720
the powers that be at the outdoor channel made the decision to put something

308
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:04.890
other than crop on the shelves.
And that's why you have uncharted.
I mean,

309
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:09.180
there are a partner in that show.
They backed it.
They,
they,
uh,

310
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.000
they allowed us to do something that's,
that's you said,

311
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:15.240
was outside of the genre or beyond the genre that that's what they've done.

312
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:20.220
So Kudos to them.
I wish that the powers that be in New York City,

313
00:18:20.221 --> 00:18:22.110
on the big networks,
uh,
you know,

314
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:27.111
the 110 million universe networks had the same guts to do that.

315
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.270
<v 3>You know,
it's just very difficult to get funding for those kinds of shows.</v>

316
00:18:32.271 --> 00:18:34.370
It's very difficult to get the approval.

317
00:18:34.371 --> 00:18:37.520
You're dealing with a giant conglomeration of human beings.

318
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.170
When you're on NBC or CBS or even a cable network history channel,

319
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.620
you're dealing with a large group of people and there's a lot of money involved

320
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.460
and risk taking is not on the top of their list of priorities.

321
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.970
What's on the top of the list of priorities is how cheap can we do this show?

322
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.890
How many people are going to be reached by the show?

323
00:18:54.891 --> 00:18:57.980
And when you have a show like duck dynasty,
as goofy as that show is,

324
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:02.160
one of the good things about it is that show reaches millions of people and

325
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.960
millions of people get to see hunting.
And I think that alone,

326
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.130
even if it's not necessarily the most positive show because it is very low brow

327
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.360
and it's very scripted,
it's very obvious.
It's almost insultingly scripted.

328
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.520
Like when you watch it,
you could tell that it's not,

329
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.690
you're not really watching reality,
you know,
they're calling it a reality show.

330
00:19:20.691 --> 00:19:22.640
But all these scenarios are set up in advance.

331
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.240
And I know a lot of people will work in,
in the bay,
like storage wars,

332
00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:29.600
those kinds of shows.
They don't even,
that's not even real.

333
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.400
Like they set those things up,

334
00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:32.613
<v 2>put those,</v>

335
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.590
there's no way you're going to slag all the other shows,
but it,

336
00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:42.040
you start slagging storage orders.
Well,
the way finding big foot,

337
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.800
big foot for six fucking years now.

338
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.300
They don't find anything on that show that even find skunks.
Yeah.

339
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.710
They find nothing.
That's the same as a ghost show.
I mean,

340
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.740
it's a perfect show to produce because you know,

341
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.410
you know the result every single time.
Yeah.
They actually,
I uh,

342
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.460
<v 1>they called me in animal planet,</v>

343
00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:03.600
I think it was called me in for a to do a swizzle or something or something.

344
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:05.010
They call it it to do a on

345
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:09.610
<v 2>sign real.
Yeah,
exactly.
To find,
to find big foot.
I didn't know.</v>

346
00:20:09.611 --> 00:20:12.490
I went down and he was like,
okay,
they wanted a hunter.
I,
okay,
I'll go down there.

347
00:20:12.491 --> 00:20:14.210
And he was just,
see what this is all about in the,

348
00:20:14.211 --> 00:20:18.400
I was supposed to be hunting big foot.
It's like,
Oh man,
I see.
Seriously,

349
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:23.380
Les Stroud,
who's a survivor manager who I loved dearly.
He's a good friend,

350
00:20:23.381 --> 00:20:27.760
a great guy,
but you don't realize how ridiculous the search for big foot is

351
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:32.200
<v 3>until you're watching one of those big foot hunter shows with a real hunter.</v>

352
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.260
I was sitting next to Cameron Hanes.
Do you know cam shows very well.
Yeah.

353
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.570
And you know,
Cam Hanes is as legit as it gets.

354
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.780
He's got a good friend of mine and where we're bear hunting up in Canada and

355
00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:45.100
Alberta and we're uh,
in between,
you know,
at night after the Hunt's over,

356
00:20:45.101 --> 00:20:48.030
we're sitting watching television and we're this big

357
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.470
<v 2>foot show and he's laughing.</v>

358
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.370
He just thinks it's the dumbest thing he's ever seen.
He's just,
they'll what?

359
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.380
Cause the guy that less trout is with is like clearly some sort of a Charlotte,

360
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.590
some sort of a hoaxer and you know,

361
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.850
this guy's got big foot masks on and everything pretended to be big foot.

362
00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:06.680
Like the,
of this crystal clear view of,

363
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.810
of Sasquatch hiding the bushes aren't know if you've seen it,
but it's,

364
00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:14.290
it's so stupid letter strollers,
hosting the show.
Let's tribes a part of it.

365
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:16.600
And I don't think he buys into this guy either,

366
00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:21.100
but less apparently according to him.
And I believe him.
He's a very,

367
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:26.050
very honest guy.
Very good guy.
But he had an experience when he was in Alaska.

368
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.370
They flew him into this place to by himself in a,
in a,
in a tent.

369
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.140
And he had this experience of what he believes is a large bipedal animal,

370
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.880
was near his tent and made like an ape,
like noise.
And it freaked him out.

371
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.240
It was many,
many years ago.
He heard like in the middle of the night.

372
00:21:43.241 --> 00:21:46.510
And I'm like,
well,
maybe it was a bear.
I don't mean bears make weird noises.

373
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.441
I don't know what it was.

374
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:51.460
But he says it was distinctly primate and that when he went for his camera and

375
00:21:51.461 --> 00:21:55.870
started moving and gathering stuff,
it,
it took off.
And he said when it ran off,

376
00:21:55.871 --> 00:22:00.720
it was like,
boom,
boom,
boom.
Like a bipedal animal would rather.
Yeah.
I mean,
I've,

377
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.970
uh,
I would never tell this to the public or anything,

378
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.680
but I do have to say that the,
uh,

379
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.230
I was in British Columbia and this was early in my career hunting,

380
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.330
uh,
can't remember what I was hunting for Moose or something and,
and uh,
uh,

381
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:22.180
I heard a sound that absolutely had to be to me an ape.
It was like,

382
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:27.040
Ooh,
like that,
like,
like loud and clothes.

383
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.680
And then I knew I was only in person in there,

384
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:35.140
scared the living heck out of me at that time until about 10 years later to

385
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:38.860
always hid that memory has said you'll find a happy place and keep it

386
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:39.694
compartmentalize.

387
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:45.780
I was in British Columbia on a different hunt and I heard the exact same noise

388
00:22:46.361 --> 00:22:49.270
again.
Only this time,
you know it a little bit older,
not,

389
00:22:49.271 --> 00:22:53.320
not quite so self tool to suggestion.
So I snuck up on it.

390
00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:57.400
It was an elk and the elk was doing exactly the [inaudible].
No,
no.
You know,

391
00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:03.050
we like,
I don't go do the whistle.
It was,
it was like,
Ooh,
like that.
Like,

392
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.330
like a a monkey.

393
00:23:04.331 --> 00:23:07.960
I've heard them a million times down in the jungles of West Africa and this was

394
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.290
an elk totally outside of their normal sound range doing sounds that uh,

395
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:15.341
you know,
if I,

396
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:19.470
if I didn't know better after 10 years of walking around those monitors and no

397
00:23:19.471 --> 00:23:21.370
one darn well there's nothing in there that the,

398
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.750
the lives on two feet and has a hair all over it other than maybe some of my

399
00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:30.600
guides,
but the,
the uh,
the animal itself was an elk making that noise.
So,

400
00:23:30.601 --> 00:23:34.150
so there's,
you know,
I can't say,
you know,
unless this case,

401
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:36.940
a elk in Alaska don't sound,
it doesn't sound reasonable.

402
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:39.520
So what that could have been,
I have no idea,

403
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.340
but it could have been a bear making noises outside of it's range.

404
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.010
100% he was in grizzly country also wolverines.
I,
I've

405
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.880
<v 1>been chased off a mountain one time by a,</v>

406
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.420
a wolverine and that was all night long.

407
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:53.780
Walked around the tent making crazy ass noises.

408
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:56.570
That scared the heck out of me then too.
Again,
I'm a little older now.

409
00:23:56.571 --> 00:24:01.040
I don't care as he's,
in fact,
I'm not scared at all anymore.
But,
uh,
you know,

410
00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:05.540
I get concerned sometimes very concerned,
but not,
not freight,
a freight.

411
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:09.560
They're not frightened,
but that,
that was a,
a wolverine did that.
So same thing,

412
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:14.270
you know,
it's not normal outside of their normal sound range.
And you know,

413
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:16.460
when you're on a mountain and,
and you know,

414
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:19.670
the stars are going in the northern lights and you know,
there's a,

415
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:25.670
you're the wind and it's a spiritual place in spiritual places is where spirits

416
00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:29.540
live.
So,
you know,
your imagination can run a little wild sometimes,

417
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:33.860
especially when you're by yourself in a tent.
Uh,
yeah.
By yourself.
Uh,

418
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.190
it's actually worse when you have a hunting partner that's really scared

419
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.730
by yourself,
by yourself.
You've got to deal with things.

420
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:44.510
When you've got a partner,
you tend to lean on them,
you know,
for help or support.

421
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.760
And if they're even more scared than you are,

422
00:24:46.761 --> 00:24:50.750
then you both just spiraled down into heel.
World's end.
These guys falling in.

423
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.051
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

424
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:53.720
This is the other thing that happens with people when it comes to their memories

425
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:55.880
that memories change over time.

426
00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.530
Like I've had conversations with people that about events that we both witnessed

427
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.160
where they have one portrayal of it and have another portrayal of it,

428
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.520
and it's there so different that it's either one of us has lied to ourselves or

429
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:16.270
over time the retelling of the story has led to the memory getting distorted and

430
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:19.730
twisted and especially when it comes to the narrative of I was there.

431
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:22.010
I know big foot is real.
I know it's real.

432
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.640
I saw I was in the woods once and I saw what I thought was a wolf.

433
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.890
It was a squirrel for like two seconds.
I thought it was a wolf wolf.
Yup.

434
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.630
It's a squirrel.
What the fuck is wrong with me?

435
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.470
<v 1>No,
that can happen easily if you take away all your outside stimulus,</v>

436
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.510
like in the Arctic,

437
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.800
it absolutely hundred percent I've been riding along in a common tech and look

438
00:25:44.941 --> 00:25:48.360
out the side and get all panicky.
There's Grizzy burgers.
They were,
you know,

439
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.560
200 grizzly and all of a sudden I realized,
no,
it's a,
it's a white out.

440
00:25:52.561 --> 00:25:54.940
There's a slope right beside me.
And it's just one of those six hooks,

441
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.130
a little gopher,
and it's 10 feet away.
And you,
you don't,
you don't know.
I mean,

442
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.360
and it's,
thank goodness the Inuit,
if they're open the sled up front,

443
00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:06.880
they can't hear you when you're screaming and cuisine a little,

444
00:26:06.881 --> 00:26:10.740
a little bit embarrassing in that case.
Making fun of the White Man.
Oh yeah.

445
00:26:10.741 --> 00:26:15.180
And those fantasies.
Yeah.
W what do they call this?
A Kabloona big nose.

446
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.710
That's what they call white people were called.
Luna is a,

447
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.120
that means just big nose for whatever reason.

448
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.100
<v 0>It's interesting.
We let them,
they can say whatever they want.
Uh,
you,</v>

449
00:26:24.101 --> 00:26:29.101
you literally can't make like a bad slang for a white person.

450
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.613
Doesn't exist.

451
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.203
<v 1>We don't,</v>

452
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.760
you want to call it honkies cause we were so egotistical.
We think,

453
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:41.200
well that's gotta be a compliment.
Oh,
we're the greatest.
So,
yeah.
Okay.

454
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.980
Just a couple.
Must be,
has to be a compliment.
We're very happy

455
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.400
<v 0>with being white.
So like whatever you call us,
it just doesn't affect us.</v>

456
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.240
At the end of the day.
We're still white.
Yeah.
They call us a cracker.

457
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:53.990
You can cause whatever you want.
And we're like,
all right,
this doesn't,
you know,

458
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
like an insult for an African American or for a Chinese person or what,

459
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.210
you know,
fill in the blank.
He's,
he's like very devastating,
horrible racial slur.

460
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:07.170
But an insult for a white person.
He's like,
yeah,
I mean that doesn't work.

461
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.490
I mean,
I can't speak for all white people,
but for me,

462
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.650
I'm willing to speak for all white people.

463
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.040
Cause there's a white person out there that does get offended by any sort of a

464
00:27:17.041 --> 00:27:21.180
slur towards white people.
They don't deserve to be white.
How about that?

465
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.890
I'm saying it said by Joe Rogan,
I said,
I said it,
you don't deserve.

466
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.170
You got lucky.
You're born white.

467
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:33.430
It's like the most acceptable like minority or it's almost a minority now.

468
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:37.770
Right.
It's getting to the point where in 2000 and it said that in America,

469
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.490
within the next,
uh,

470
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:44.190
I think it's two or three decades being in Caucasian will actually be a
minority.

471
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.140
<v 1>Oh,
I'm sure.
I mean,
you know,
and if you look at,</v>

472
00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.260
if you look at that historically,
I mean,
and again this is,
you know,

473
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.000
so unscientific,
but,
but you know,

474
00:27:55.001 --> 00:27:59.500
maybe our role was to explore and discover new places and colonize.

475
00:27:59.501 --> 00:28:03.040
And then who comes after?
I mean there's always an after.
Who is it?
You know,

476
00:28:03.041 --> 00:28:05.380
like you go to Africa right now and you know,

477
00:28:05.381 --> 00:28:06.610
it's wonderful being a white person,

478
00:28:06.611 --> 00:28:10.060
but there's parts Africa that is not quite so great and,

479
00:28:10.061 --> 00:28:14.680
but what you do find is tons and tons of Chinese people.
They're there,

480
00:28:14.681 --> 00:28:18.970
they're in Africa,
they're colonizing Africa.
How of the resources.
Resources.
Yeah.

481
00:28:18.971 --> 00:28:22.150
And,
and it's,
you know,
we are,
again,

482
00:28:22.151 --> 00:28:25.090
this is one of those times when I sit on my little mountain top and look out

483
00:28:25.091 --> 00:28:29.050
with and feel despair.
Um,
you know,
the,
these,
the entire continent,

484
00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.560
continent of Africa is being colonized by,
by the Chinese.
Uh,

485
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.470
and it'll be a different,
it'll be a different roadmap in 20 years.
30 years.

486
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.380
Wow.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's amazing.
So Amy,
you know,

487
00:28:41.381 --> 00:28:43.210
when we may well be knocked off our,

488
00:28:43.211 --> 00:28:46.420
or our pedestals here in the next couple of minutes,

489
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.810
<v 0>even if we are,
we'll still be so super,</v>

490
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:52.180
I still be you or any white slur that you throw our way.

491
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.520
We'll just still take it as a couple.
And I were like,
fine,

492
00:28:54.521 --> 00:28:58.540
whatever you want to call us,
we're still white.
That's true.

493
00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:01.360
I think the most egotistical raise ever to white folks.

494
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.450
But it's interesting that you brought that up because,
um,
in,

495
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.180
in a related point when you're talking about,
you know,

496
00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:09.430
what comes next and people exploring.

497
00:29:09.431 --> 00:29:14.431
And I think that what I was saying earlier about the age of information and

498
00:29:14.471 --> 00:29:15.220
that,
um,

499
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:20.220
one of the things that's changing because you've got these reality shows on and

500
00:29:21.251 --> 00:29:23.710
all these is goofy programming,

501
00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:27.880
this sugar programming that you're getting on television because of the age of

502
00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:32.170
information that we live in.
There's all these alternatives now on the Internet.

503
00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.800
I mean you have like these,
uh,
things like Netflix,

504
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:40.570
which has I think something like 60 million subscribers that pay $7 a month.

505
00:29:40.571 --> 00:29:42.340
They have so much,
they are producing their own original

506
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.860
<v 3>programming now and they have this show called house of cards.</v>

507
00:29:44.861 --> 00:29:47.530
It's a fantastic show.
They're doing talk shows.

508
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:49.630
I've got to Chelsea handler talk show that they're doing,

509
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.610
they're doing stand up comedy specials.

510
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.830
They're doing all these different things because they have all this money now,

511
00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:56.650
but they're taking all these wild chances and they're doing this really

512
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.820
interesting out of the box stuff.
And then you have things like podcasts,

513
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:02.920
things like this where we don't really have a boss,

514
00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:04.240
we don't have anybody to tell us what to do.

515
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:05.870
So we could have a guy like you want to,
I,

516
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.890
anybody I have on this show is only anybody.
I'm interested.

517
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.070
I'll take that as a company.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

518
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.580
You should definitely take it as a compliment.
But this,
this,

519
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.640
this sugar diet is not necessary anymore.

520
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.250
Now this is a part of what's happening,

521
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:25.420
this rapid change that's happening in our culture.
And when,

522
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.100
one of the things that I think a backlash against hunting is that people are

523
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:34.930
hoping that we're going to separate from what we were,

524
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.170
what took what we,

525
00:30:36.171 --> 00:30:39.880
we we went through to get us here and what we went through to get us here is all

526
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:43.420
the brutality that we know that happened with the native Americans and all the,

527
00:30:43.421 --> 00:30:46.330
you know,
the idea that they were almost wiped off the buffalo wipe,

528
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:49.780
the buffalo off the face of the planet and that people had to hunt for a living

529
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.160
to feed their families.

530
00:30:51.161 --> 00:30:55.900
They had to go out and be barbaric and that this age of information and that

531
00:30:55.901 --> 00:31:00.010
this,
this change is evolutionary change is going on in our culture is eventually

532
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:02.440
going to lead us away from a diet of eating meat.

533
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.660
And I think that's something that people,

534
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.620
that's one of the reasons why people have this sort of rejection of hunting.

535
00:31:08.621 --> 00:31:09.050
That's this,

536
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:13.690
this idea that they have in their head is at this is the remnants are the echoes

537
00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:18.520
of a barbaric past.
And when you see these people understanding with a,
you know,

538
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:21.850
a rifle on top of a lion like Ernest Hemingway,
and instead of that,

539
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.290
it's that cute girl.

540
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:25.780
I don't know what her name is that was involved in that huge Facebook

541
00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:29.380
controversy because she had Kendall Kendall.
Yes.
Yup.

542
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.710
And it's along the same lines.

543
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:37.420
It's like we're trying to get away from that old way and embrace some sort of a

544
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:38.254
new way.

545
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.020
<v 1>Yeah,
it's a new messiah.
I mean that,
that's,</v>

546
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.860
that's what they're looking at as opposed to looking at the real picture,

547
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:47.890
which is how many millions of years,
depending on what you believe in.

548
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.810
Have we been doing the same thing?
We're not going to change it.
I use an analogy,

549
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.310
you know,
two dinosaurs standing there.
You'll,
one has three toes on,

550
00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:59.050
one has four toes,
and the one with three toes.

551
00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:02.290
He's highly of all because he's got three toes and he's laughing at the other

552
00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:05.740
one.
You know,
you got four toes.
I got three toes.
I'm,
I'm evolved.

553
00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:09.550
And when the comment strikes,
it doesn't matter how many tools you have,

554
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:11.050
you are still a dinosaur.

555
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.690
You're a dinosaur and this is what people are trying to do.

556
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:18.310
They're trying to ignore what brought them to the,
to the dance,
you know,

557
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:20.590
like you said it,
you know,
the,
the hunting brought us here.

558
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:24.550
We've been hunting cultures up until 10,000 years ago when we turned agrarian.

559
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.460
And even then,
some of us still stayed as a hunting,
you know,

560
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.060
there's a percentage have that gene where the hunters were the better hunters in

561
00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:33.250
the tribe back then were,
we're still hunters.

562
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:36.820
You can't get rid of that in 10,000 years.
Doesn't happen.
So they're trying to,

563
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.620
trying to,
like you say,

564
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:44.000
ignore the fact that all of us are here because of hunting and you want to

565
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:48.530
change because you think what you eat soy means,
I mean,
give me a break,
you know,

566
00:32:48.531 --> 00:32:50.450
go look that soybean field,
how many,

567
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.640
how many acres of that soybean field is actual ecosystem where wildlife can

568
00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:56.570
live.
You know,

569
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:59.990
someone that says I'm a Vegan or Vegan or whatever they call themselves and you

570
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:04.100
know,
they can punch his pilot.
I don't hurt animals.
Look at the soybean field.

571
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:04.611
You killed.

572
00:33:04.611 --> 00:33:08.240
How many animals in that field because you had to survive with your soybeans.

573
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:12.880
That's,
that's,
there's no way you can separate us,
you know,
and,

574
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.000
uh,
you know,

575
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.360
no matter how much information is out there and how stair you want to make this,

576
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:21.380
say,
we don't eat meat,
there's no way you can separate the fact that all of us,

577
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.260
we're carnivores or omnivores at the very least,

578
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:28.880
and all of us got here were around today because of hunting.
And,
and it's,

579
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.490
it's not a tradition.
It's not a skill.

580
00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:35.570
It's not a lifestyle that's going to go anywhere.
In fact,
I suspect,
you know,

581
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:38.810
when that comment does hit that that's who I'll still be around,
you know,

582
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:40.820
soybean fields,
you know,

583
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.480
<v 0>pretty common does hit,
I hope it hits me right in the head.</v>

584
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:48.640
I don't want to live some strain,
post apocalypse,
Mad Max world.

585
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:50.870
<v 1>You may not want to live like that,
but,</v>

586
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.310
but guess who's going to survive in that suit?
Of course,

587
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.990
<v 0>the people who know how to actually live.</v>

588
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.140
<v 1>Yeah.
And I,
and I'm not,
I'm not predicting that anyway.
You know,</v>

589
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.850
I'm certainly not saying that.
This is what's going to happen.

590
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:01.691
<v 0>Well,</v>

591
00:34:01.691 --> 00:34:05.920
it's fascinating to me that there's so much backlash against hunters and someone

592
00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:09.100
posing with an animal that they shot get so much backlash.

593
00:34:09.101 --> 00:34:13.360
Yet you can have an advertisement of a guy eating a Carl's junior cheeseburger

594
00:34:13.361 --> 00:34:17.530
with a big smile on his face and nobody thinks it's offensive.

595
00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.240
Nobody has any problem with it.
One of the,

596
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:24.220
I shot a bear and there's a picture of me and Cameron Hanes and I hate that
bear.

597
00:34:24.221 --> 00:34:25.054
By the way,

598
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.540
me and Cameron Hanes standing over this bear and we're both smiling and people

599
00:34:28.541 --> 00:34:30.640
were angry.
They were saying you,

600
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:33.670
this should be a somber moment like you're smiling,

601
00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:37.120
but this should be a somber moment.
Says,
who is it?

602
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.130
If I was eating a cheeseburger and smiling,

603
00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.080
would anybody really have a problem with it?

604
00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:46.350
You go down any road in America and Canada as well and pass by in any town where

605
00:34:47.441 --> 00:34:49.180
their stoplights and stores,

606
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:51.550
you're going to find dead animals all over the place.

607
00:34:51.551 --> 00:34:54.930
You're going to find dead animals that are on people's cars in the,
in their,

608
00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.580
in their seats.
You're going to find it on their feet,

609
00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.460
you're going to find it in all the restaurants you see.

610
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:05.490
99 plus percent of all restaurants serve some form of animal protein.

611
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.280
Everywhere you go,
you're seeing dead animals.

612
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:14.160
And we conveniently ignore that and focus on what we think is in our cake

613
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:18.540
practice.
The practice of going into the wild and killing the animal.
Yeah.

614
00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:19.374
Yourself

615
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.880
<v 1>know,
to there,</v>

616
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:27.940
to there in their defense when they see us smiling over a dead animal.

617
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.990
And this is something that I've,
you know,
I have to reconcile it,
you know,

618
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.570
inside myself.
Why,
you know,
why,
what bothers them about it?
Well,

619
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.170
it looks like you took joy in,
in the actual death of the animal.
Yes.

620
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.970
But that's not what you took joy yet.
And that's not what you're smiling.

621
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.240
You're smiling about the accomplishment,

622
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:47.550
the fact that you met the challenge as great as it may be,

623
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:50.550
and they don't understand that people looking at the picture,

624
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.760
how great that challenge is to get that bare,
you know,

625
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:56.510
the skills that it took for you to get,
I think he used a bow and arrow.
Yeah.

626
00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.960
And I mean,
just go try and learn a bone Arrow first then talk to me about,

627
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.110
you know,
the challenge of getting that bear,

628
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.260
a wild animal that's switched on,
tuned in.

629
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.260
It's his backyard and you're in there trying to hunt him and he's,

630
00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:14.020
if he's true to what his nature is,

631
00:36:14.021 --> 00:36:16.860
is his nature is to try and avoid being hunted.

632
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:21.540
Whether it's by another bear for interspecies predation or whether it's a hunter

633
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:22.111
human hunter,

634
00:36:22.111 --> 00:36:25.650
maybe it's walls coming in to kill him or a cougar who knows what's trying to

635
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:27.450
kill him.
His,
his job is to survive.

636
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:32.040
So you're going in there with a bone Arrow to hunt that animal and it worked.

637
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.890
It's a huge challenge that you met and challenge.

638
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.460
The accomplishment is directly proportional to the challenge.
You met it.

639
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:43.710
Why wouldn't you smile?
Why wouldn't you be,
you know,
paying homage to that,

640
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:47.650
that hunt for that animal and,
and be proud of it and be smiling and,

641
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.090
and I think this is where the disconnect is for people looking at it.
You know,

642
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:55.770
they see a picture of,
of like my daughter with her bare smiling and they go,

643
00:36:55.771 --> 00:36:58.860
how can you do that at the pictures?
What offends those people?

644
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:03.020
Because they equate the smiling with a joy of killing the animal.

645
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.230
That's not what hunting's about that.
That's a necessary part to have hunted.

646
00:37:07.231 --> 00:37:11.100
In fact it was or take it to gas at the Spanish philosopher said that,
you know,

647
00:37:11.101 --> 00:37:14.910
I don't hunt to kill,
I kill to have hunted.

648
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.990
So you have to eventually kill something to actually be hunting.

649
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.480
If you're taking photographs,
you didn't hunt what you were a boy year.
You,

650
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.650
you weren't part of nature,
you were just there.
And,

651
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.080
and no offense to all the photographers out there,

652
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:32.140
cause I'm sure in a lot of ways it's like hunting and for them that capturing or

653
00:37:32.141 --> 00:37:36.750
the animal is,
is,
is like capturing of the animal.
But you know what?

654
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.500
It doesn't taste good.
I don't care.
I don't care how you prepare.

655
00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:44.820
That picture is not going to taste like you're your bear roaster or whatever you

656
00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:48.930
did.
It made sausages with it.
And I think that the pictures,
you know,

657
00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.030
that the people that don't hunt and maybe sitting on the fence about hunting or,

658
00:37:53.031 --> 00:37:55.620
or anti hunters for sure they don't,

659
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.490
they equate the smile with the joy of killing and,
and that's,

660
00:37:59.491 --> 00:38:02.520
that's not what it is.
That's not what it's about.
And,
and I,
you know,
again,

661
00:38:02.521 --> 00:38:06.540
that's,
that's us,
I guess educating.
We haven't done a great job.

662
00:38:06.541 --> 00:38:08.610
We haven't had the tools to do it until now,

663
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.580
<v 3>until now.
I know what it is,</v>

664
00:38:10.581 --> 00:38:14.210
is people just haven't had a guy like you explain it that way.

665
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.050
They just see that image and they draw their own conclusions based on our

666
00:38:18.051 --> 00:38:21.650
culture,
based on our culture of being able to go to the supermarket,

667
00:38:21.651 --> 00:38:24.920
pick up a piece of meat,
pay for it with a credit card and you're done.

668
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.190
And this complete disconnect.
And now you see a guy smiling,

669
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.920
standing over a dead animal.
Meanwhile,
these people,

670
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:32.390
I had a guy come up to me in the airport,

671
00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:36.130
I've talked about this on the podcast before,
but he was upset that I a bear.

672
00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:38.980
He's like,
I can't believe he killed a bear.
I go,
you're wearing leather shoes,

673
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.730
you're wearing leather.
What do the fuck are you talking about?
I ate that bear.

674
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.810
You're wearing leather shoes,
man.
You don't even know where that shoe came from.

675
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.290
You don't know that cow.
You don't know anything about how it was acquired.

676
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.500
You're eating meat probably on a daily basis,

677
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.540
and if you're not eating meat and you're wearing leather shoes,

678
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:57.730
either it's for health purposes or you're a silly person.

679
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.900
<v 1>Yeah.
They don't want to know the truth.
I mean,</v>

680
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:05.200
they don't want to know that that cow that they're eating,

681
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.140
which is an hammered reform,
it wrapped in cellophane.

682
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.060
They don't want to know about the life of that cow,

683
00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:13.870
that they want to keep that like insulated.
They want to,
you know,

684
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.830
coordinate off and I,
you know,
oh,
I say it is,

685
00:39:17.831 --> 00:39:22.300
it's like the truth sometimes is like laying on cold hard ground.

686
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.480
It's not fun.
It's cold.
It's hard and you try and sleep when they're gone.

687
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:30.760
It's just,
but it's the truth.
It's the reality.
It's the truth.
Many,

688
00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:35.560
many people in our culture nowadays or are they,
they build a house of,

689
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.920
of an ideology.
They build a house.
It's just like a castle.

690
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:44.140
Elliot protects them and from the truth and they then they make a bed of,
of,

691
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.860
of hypocrisy,
you know,
and the wear leather,
they eat meat,

692
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.470
but they don't wanna know the truth out there.
That animal,
how it lived.

693
00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.920
Then they cover themself in a,
in a comforter of denial.

694
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.820
They wanted to deny that they had anything to do with that.
You know,

695
00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.250
punches probably at washed her hands.
Don't,
I don't want to hit,

696
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.500
I don't want to see it.
Don't want to hear it.
The cold,
hard truth,

697
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:07.000
it means lying on the ground sometimes and they live inside these,
these castles,

698
00:40:07.001 --> 00:40:10.600
these ideological castles that they,
it just,
it,

699
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:15.430
it would destroy their world to realize that that person that took you to task

700
00:40:15.431 --> 00:40:20.431
for killing that beer and eating it actually is wearing a killed animal and eats

701
00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:23.110
animals and they had a horrible life,

702
00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.700
which is a better life that bear that lived till whatever it was.
You know?

703
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.760
I know,
I saw the picture is probably uh,
you know,
six,
seven,
eight year old boar,

704
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:35.220
you know,
probably pass breeding age.
This animal lived,

705
00:40:35.221 --> 00:40:40.221
hits life wild and free and then one arrow came out of the blue because it made

706
00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:43.660
one mistake and walked in when it shouldn't have walked in.

707
00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:47.590
Its senses weren't switched on as much as they should have been to ensure that

708
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.730
that animal passes it's jeans on for generations to come and it's dead.

709
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.340
The cow,
the deck is eating,

710
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.700
thinking well that life in a feed pan being shot full of every describable

711
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:03.490
antibiotic and you know,
sprayed with any pesticides,

712
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.980
living with no space.
What kind of life is that?

713
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:11.220
And that person has the right to come to you and take you to task for killing a

714
00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:15.760
wild animal that lived wild and free and had every chance to walk away but

715
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:19.030
didn't.
And in fact,
you know,
if you,
if you believe in Darwin,

716
00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.520
it was probably a good thing you shot it.
You know,

717
00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:24.250
no offense to you and you and a camera.
I mean,

718
00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:26.920
it had to be a pretty dumb bear to walk in,
you know,
so.

719
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.390
So is that a very you on passing on his jeans?
Right,
right,
right.

720
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.190
<v 3>Well,
I think that in in the defense of the people who get angry and they're not,</v>

721
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.140
they're just not getting the information.
They're just not,
there's no,

722
00:41:37.141 --> 00:41:39.860
the dean of the information is not being representative by our culture.

723
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.080
And that's why they have these ideas.

724
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:45.350
That's why they have these childish notions.
Well,
you're talking about the cold,

725
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:50.210
hard truth.
You live in the cold,
hard truth,
but it's not ugly.
It's not nasty.

726
00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:53.210
I've been living in the cold hard truth for the past couple of years since I

727
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:57.320
started hunting.
It's not bad.
I just shot a moose last weekend.
It was great.

728
00:41:57.321 --> 00:41:59.900
Had a great time.
Congratulations.
Yeah,
I mean people want,

729
00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:02.630
don't want to hear that you shot a moose.
He had a great time.
I had a great time.

730
00:42:02.631 --> 00:42:06.110
It was a hard hunt.
We hunted for four days climbing up hills,

731
00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:10.010
sneaking up on moves that winded us and they took off and there was a lot going

732
00:42:10.011 --> 00:42:14.210
on.
It was day after day of struggling.
It's very difficult to shoot.

733
00:42:14.211 --> 00:42:17.960
A Moose is difficult to acquire or you get lucky and one can just,
you know,

734
00:42:17.961 --> 00:42:20.930
in the Rut could walk right in front of you and you blasted when that's possible

735
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:25.610
too.
But,
and in our situation it was a long and difficult time.

736
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.820
So when we finally did get this animal,
it was very exciting.

737
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:30.950
It was very exciting.
It was a very happy moment.

738
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.770
But most people don't experience that.

739
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.150
And what we're talking about when you say that people don't live in the truth,

740
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.080
they don't have the opportunity,
they,
they,
they don't urinate all the time.

741
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:45.830
I've been in it over the last couple of years,
but it's not,

742
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.300
I don't believe it's their fault.

743
00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:52.301
I think it's our culture is filled with these infant tile notions of like what's

744
00:42:53.181 --> 00:42:57.140
acceptable,
what's not acceptable,
what,
what?
What should we lau,

745
00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.210
which should we not allow me?

746
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.760
We're constantly adding new words to the words that we're not allowed to say

747
00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:06.380
anymore.
We're constantly changing our,
our,
our,
our stances on,

748
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.680
on all sorts of behavior that was normally accepted and we're becoming more and

749
00:43:11.751 --> 00:43:12.890
more hypersensitive.

750
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.920
And I think one of the reasons why we're so hypersensitive because we're fucking

751
00:43:15.921 --> 00:43:16.754
babies,

752
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.740
were a bunch of babies were babies that are coddled and we have this really
soft,

753
00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:25.820
easy life who we hop in metal boxes with a rubber tires and we ride over this

754
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:27.080
hard surface everywhere.

755
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:32.230
We sit into his cubicle and we live this life of zero threat of zero challenge

756
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.160
of zero risk.
The only risk is that they might take away your cubicle.

757
00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:41.210
Oh No,
how will I be able to stuffed myself full of sugar cereal?

758
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.820
I can't sit at this stupid fucking cubicle anymore.

759
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:48.380
That's our main risk in this life outside of car accidents and disease,

760
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:50.000
which by the way,

761
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.000
the car accidents are caused because you have to get to this stupid fucking

762
00:43:53.001 --> 00:43:56.960
cubicle.
The diseases are caused by the Diet that you're eating is terrible.

763
00:43:56.961 --> 00:44:01.961
Diet is responsible for a large majority of the diseases that people have in

764
00:44:02.451 --> 00:44:05.360
this world.
A large,
I mean,
outside of viral illnesses,

765
00:44:05.361 --> 00:44:10.010
of course a lot of the problems that we have in this country deal with obesity,

766
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.860
poor diet,
massive sugar intake,

767
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.970
cholesterol is all sorts of shit that people put into their bodies today.

768
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.730
That's absolutely terrible and it's all a part,

769
00:44:19.731 --> 00:44:21.670
it's a symptom of the same thing of this,

770
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:26.180
this w this infant tile society that we live in.
There's no risks.

771
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:30.950
We're trying,
we're trying to regulate out all objective dangers.
Yes.

772
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.100
And soon as you do

773
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.000
<v 1>that,
what,
what have,</v>

774
00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:36.480
what have you created a society of people that are unable to adapt,

775
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:41.430
unable to respond to a new novel situation.
And you know,

776
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:42.360
when you bring in the Diet,

777
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:47.820
they're unable to fight off whatever diseases are out there.
I mean,

778
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.310
God forbid that there's,
you know,

779
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:55.050
we get hit by a real bad pandemic of whatever because we're not going to be able

780
00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:59.010
to fight it off if we don't have the drugs.
We don't have the resistance.

781
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:02.700
Now you want to see resistance,
just go over to these Asian countries,

782
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.740
go over to Africa and South America and in those people are tough.

783
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:12.060
You know,
and really,
I mean,
we shouldn't be the sugar,

784
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.300
get rid of the sugar diets and go eat a more panty worm.
You know,

785
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:17.700
like they can expand your,

786
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.470
what you ingest because that's going to give you resistance to all of these

787
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.440
various strains of whatever.
I mean,
it's a,

788
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.080
<v 3>I mean this,
when I was saying is it's not terrible.</v>

789
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:33.100
Our society's not 100% awful and we still create great art.

790
00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:37.840
We still have these incredible technological achievements that are fascinating

791
00:45:37.841 --> 00:45:38.381
and interesting.

792
00:45:38.381 --> 00:45:42.190
Our education system is better than it's ever been before as far as the acts and

793
00:45:42.191 --> 00:45:44.920
shouldn't say system,
but our access to information,

794
00:45:44.921 --> 00:45:46.180
it's better than it's ever been before.

795
00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:50.350
So there's all sorts of great things about living in a civilized society that I

796
00:45:50.351 --> 00:45:54.160
appreciate except to take,
you know,
take part of,

797
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.670
I think there's,
it's,
it's not universally bad,

798
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.860
but what is missing is a connection with all the other animals that are on this

799
00:46:02.861 --> 00:46:05.470
planet.
It connection with the cycle of life.

800
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.970
And that's something that I think people rejecting when they reject hunting.

801
00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.760
They're rejecting this idea that we are a part of that,

802
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:14.530
that we are a part of the cycle of life,

803
00:46:14.531 --> 00:46:17.870
that we've moved past that we've moved past that I've had to pay people tale.

804
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:21.490
Tell me why would you go hunting when you buy meat at a store you just go to a

805
00:46:21.491 --> 00:46:25.060
store.
I've met people that,
I know they're are smart but they just,

806
00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:28.150
they haven't been exposed to it.
They haven't thought about it.

807
00:46:28.151 --> 00:46:29.890
This is almost a new concept to them.

808
00:46:29.891 --> 00:46:33.430
They have this peripheral thinking when it comes to where the meat comes from

809
00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:38.500
and if you show any interest whatsoever and being more involved in it and

810
00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:42.070
participating in it and a much deeper level of specialty actually going out into

811
00:46:42.071 --> 00:46:45.310
the woods and calling it an elk and trying to shoot an arrow through its lungs

812
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.130
and like what the fuck is wrong with you?
Like why would you do that?

813
00:46:48.131 --> 00:46:49.090
Why do you want to do that?

814
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:54.360
<v 1>Yeah.
The old and again it's a denial.
They're denying that we are part of nature.</v>

815
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:59.730
I mean we,
we are instruments of nature's change.
That's what we are,

816
00:46:59.731 --> 00:47:02.760
but we are still part of nature,
whatever.
Again,

817
00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:06.060
this is looking from the big picture where this biomass on this planet,

818
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.590
it's changed from dinosaurs.
Now it's a lot of it is us and whatever we create,

819
00:47:10.591 --> 00:47:14.400
but it's,
it's still there in the same,
the same amount is still there.

820
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.550
So it's just change form and if they think they're not part of that,

821
00:47:17.551 --> 00:47:21.750
there are somehow above and aloof from it.
I mean,
and again,
I,
you know,

822
00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.170
I watch television and,
which isn't a lot,
but if I do see it in,

823
00:47:25.171 --> 00:47:29.100
I see the nature shows,
you're always,
you're,
it's the animal,

824
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:33.820
a boy you're looking in at it.
So they,
they perpetrate that are perpetuated that,

825
00:47:33.821 --> 00:47:37.360
that,
that image that we're separated from wildlife.

826
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.930
We're not looked at that lion killing the whatever,
Cape Buffalo.

827
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:44.470
We would never do that because we just watched and we observe and look in the

828
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:47.980
lower life forms.
That's not what it's about.
We are those life forms.
We're,

829
00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:52.210
we're part of nature.
And you just have to get out of your,
like you say,

830
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:55.270
your cubicle,
not,
not,
I won't describe the same way you did,

831
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:59.230
but the cubicle you get out of it going into the world.

832
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.650
And you'll see,
I mean,
everywhere around this world,

833
00:48:02.651 --> 00:48:06.220
we are part of nature and unfortunately we're,
we're,
um,

834
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:08.890
we're an ugly part of it right now.
If,

835
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:13.840
if you're concerned about wildlife because we're pushing back these animals into

836
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:17.200
these tiny little enclaves and they're fighting for their survival.

837
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.270
<v 3>Well,
I had this conversation recently with someone online who was telling me,</v>

838
00:48:21.271 --> 00:48:25.440
you know,
hey man,
you know,
your ideas about animals are ridiculous.
You know,
the,

839
00:48:25.441 --> 00:48:26.251
those bears,

840
00:48:26.251 --> 00:48:30.330
the reason why those bears are pushing into this New Jersey suburb was cause

841
00:48:30.331 --> 00:48:32.940
people are pushing it to the,
now that's not true.
There's,

842
00:48:32.941 --> 00:48:36.270
there's an overpopulation of them and it's not good for the bears.

843
00:48:36.271 --> 00:48:40.860
There's more bears per capita or per square mile in New Jersey than anywhere

844
00:48:40.861 --> 00:48:43.530
else in North America.
That's crazy.

845
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.590
The fact that you've got a place like New Jersey,
that's,
you know,

846
00:48:46.591 --> 00:48:49.980
you think about New Jersey,
you think,
uh,
Joe Piscopo from Saturday night live.

847
00:48:49.981 --> 00:48:50.814
You think of,
you know,

848
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.940
you think of Frank Sinatra and Jon Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen.

849
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.880
You don't think of fucking bears.
Let me,

850
00:48:55.881 --> 00:48:59.160
while a kid from Rutgers last month got killed by a black bear,

851
00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.580
and the reason is there,
there,
there are too many of them.
They're starving.

852
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:05.010
And that's why you see that,
that battle.
Well,

853
00:49:05.011 --> 00:49:08.820
those two big black bears were duking it out in that New Jersey suburb.
I mean,

854
00:49:08.821 --> 00:49:13.680
that's Rutherford,
New Jersey,
that's like,
might as well be here in Canoga Park.

855
00:49:13.681 --> 00:49:14.030
It's just,

856
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:19.030
it's a normal American suburb and you got seven foot black bears,

857
00:49:19.231 --> 00:49:24.090
Duke it out on the streets,
big 300 pound bear's going to war with each other.

858
00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:28.110
That has to be taken care of.
If you want a Pete,
if you want to have people,

859
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.450
if people want to live in those environments,

860
00:49:30.451 --> 00:49:33.450
you have to regulate and control those populations.

861
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.910
And that's something that people don't want to see.

862
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:37.410
They don't want to think of it that way.

863
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:40.950
They want to think that somehow another nature's just going to sort it all out.

864
00:49:40.951 --> 00:49:45.330
Nature of just leave nature on its own guests.
What you're a part of nature.

865
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:47.700
That's what people don't.
Yeah,
it,
we'll sort it out,

866
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.480
but it might mean they eat us.
That is a possibility.

867
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:54.480
And that's what people don't want to consider when they think about nature.

868
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:59.170
Sorting it up.
Nature sorts it out.
Meaning if you have too much of one thing in,

869
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.280
in an area,
yeah,
it does it achieve some sort of a balance.

870
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.350
But along the way you might lose some kids.

871
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:08.940
<v 1>Yeah.
It's,
uh,
again,
we're,
we're so removed and it's,</v>

872
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:13.620
the problem with the whole thing from a hunter's perspective is the wildlife

873
00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:17.790
loses that battle 100% of the time.
They,
you know,
we push,

874
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.880
we pushed them back because w there's too,
there's too many people,

875
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.420
so they have less area to live.
So they pushed back.
When we get more numbers,

876
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:29.290
they come into our suburbs and you saw the bears battling,
but it's a,

877
00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:34.310
hey,
you know,
we,
we can't,
we hunters want more animals,

878
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:38.360
but we also want to be able to control the numbers.
We're realists again,

879
00:50:38.361 --> 00:50:40.850
the cold,
hard truth,
they have to be killed.

880
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.030
Now that you can do it two different ways.
You,
and this is again,

881
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:48.830
you know I've seen this before where people somehow don't have a problem with,

882
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:53.150
with euthanization,
right?
They hire a,

883
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:57.620
a mercenary shooter who has no feeling for those animals.
That's just,

884
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.120
it's just a target and he'll go in there at night with a silencer and pop off

885
00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:04.280
the bears and kill a bunch of them.

886
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.390
I guess what people don't want to see is that hunters go in there and in some

887
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:13.040
way are enjoying themselves on this hunt and there again,
this is that,

888
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.350
that disconnect.
They don't realize the challenge.

889
00:51:15.351 --> 00:51:18.020
It's not so simple to just go with their simpler to go up there and pop them off

890
00:51:18.021 --> 00:51:22.460
at night with,
with a night vision scope.
When a silencer,
you can do that easily,

891
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.160
you know,
and you do kill them and,
and they're gone.
But,
but you know,

892
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.800
to me that's,
that's treating them like a,
with such disrespect.

893
00:51:30.801 --> 00:51:33.980
I mean these are wild animals that,
that were,

894
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.110
their entire being is to survive and to live through hunters trying to kill him,

895
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:43.790
not,
not to pop them off with a,
you know,
with a sniper scope at night.
So again,

896
00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:48.940
this is a battle that US hunters have to fight and fight it well because we will

897
00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:52.910
lose that.
They want to euthanize.
It's okay to kill how many,

898
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:56.320
how many dogs and cats get put down every single day.
Right,
right around here.

899
00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:00.880
<v 3>Dogs and cats get put down by Peta that some people don't want to listen to.</v>

900
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:03.850
That's the Beta is responsible for the death of a large number.

901
00:52:03.851 --> 00:52:05.350
Of course they can't take care of,

902
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:10.150
<v 1>but somehow in people's mind,
that's okay.
That's okay.
Yeah.
And it's a,</v>

903
00:52:10.151 --> 00:52:11.820
it's a weird thing.
And again,

904
00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:14.710
it goes back to the picture of the smiling hunter over the animal,

905
00:52:14.711 --> 00:52:16.780
or you enjoyed the death of that animal that's sick.

906
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:20.610
<v 3>It's also ignorant in the form of they don't understand that the money that goes</v>

907
00:52:20.611 --> 00:52:25.050
to hunting tags and to where when you pay for,
for to hunt,

908
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:27.120
when you,
when you buy a hunting tag,

909
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:31.770
that money directly goes into the fish and wildlife departments and the fish and

910
00:52:31.771 --> 00:52:35.100
wildlife departments hire biologists to,
they don't,

911
00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:39.210
they're not like putting hunts out because people say,
well,

912
00:52:39.211 --> 00:52:41.910
we weren't to hunt the animals.
We don't care how many of them they are.
No.

913
00:52:41.911 --> 00:52:46.140
The fish and wildlife department,
they tell you how many animals can be taken.

914
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.620
They release a certain amount of tags and dependent upon the area.

915
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:52.950
If you can have some areas where they have unlimited tags because there's too

916
00:52:52.951 --> 00:52:53.581
many animals,

917
00:52:53.581 --> 00:52:57.600
they're trying to thin the herd or you have animals like you know like a big

918
00:52:57.601 --> 00:53:00.990
horn sheep in Montana,
very difficult to get a tag for it.

919
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.870
It's hard to draw because they're trying to build the numbers out in Nevada,

920
00:53:03.871 --> 00:53:06.120
same situation.
They're trying to build the numbers up.

921
00:53:06.121 --> 00:53:09.720
Very difficult to get a tag for.
These are all done by biologists,

922
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:14.730
and the money that comes from hunting them goes directly into conservation.

923
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:19.620
That money is exactly the opposite of what happens if you have to go in and hire

924
00:53:19.621 --> 00:53:22.110
somebody to kill them on a sniper rifle.
Because if you have,

925
00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.800
if you have to hire someone to thin the herd,
the herds out you have to that guy.

926
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.180
So the money that would have come from the conservation,
from the hunting tags,

927
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.880
it's not there anymore.
And now instead you're,

928
00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:37.680
you're in a deficit because you have to actually use public funds to go in there

929
00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:38.760
and eliminate those animals.

930
00:53:38.761 --> 00:53:42.720
So instead of those animals being a valuable resource,
now those animals,
it's a,

931
00:53:42.721 --> 00:53:45.540
it's an issue where you have to actually pay for it,
the taxpayers.

932
00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:50.300
<v 1>But the bill,
here's a,
here's another little side angle on that one.</v>

933
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.840
When hunters pay for their licenses,
when they,

934
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:57.650
they bring an economic value to that community,

935
00:53:57.651 --> 00:54:02.360
that area where those animals live,
the animals are suddenly empowered with,

936
00:54:02.361 --> 00:54:04.490
with,
with money,
they have value.

937
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:09.440
Now you can actually those animals in,
in one way.
I mean,
it's a,
it's a,

938
00:54:09.441 --> 00:54:14.300
again,
a strange,
uh,
is difficult for people to understand this,

939
00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:17.330
but it's the,
you give the,
you hunt the animals,

940
00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:22.340
they essentially have value and they have,
if they have a surplus of that value,

941
00:54:22.341 --> 00:54:27.170
they can start to buy back habitat,
right?
I mean,
all the CPR,

942
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.080
was it what you guys call CWP lands or whatever they are.

943
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:32.030
Our WP lands where they're,
they're,

944
00:54:32.031 --> 00:54:36.290
they're farmers are allowed to put their land back into natural habitat.

945
00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:41.510
That's wildlife buying back that land.
So,
so not only are you bye bye.

946
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:44.510
Sniping them off.
What have you done?
You've killed them for predation.

947
00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:49.190
Depredation on the crops.
Okay,
great.
I get it.
What value to the animal health?
No,

948
00:54:49.191 --> 00:54:52.010
you're just going to keep killing them.
And if the crops keep pushing into the,

949
00:54:52.011 --> 00:54:54.530
where the animals live,
you're going to kill them all.
I mean,

950
00:54:54.531 --> 00:54:57.830
we did it with the Bison.
Virtually.
We killed down to 500 of them.

951
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.530
That's if you give those animals money when witch hunters do it,
you know it's,

952
00:55:03.531 --> 00:55:07.370
you know,
it's a,
it's a hard,
you know,
hard to grasp because it's,

953
00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.730
it doesn't make sense.
But you give those animals money,

954
00:55:10.731 --> 00:55:14.210
they buy back the habitat.
You hunter kills one animal,

955
00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:18.380
but the animal is buy back 10 more acres,
which means two animals live,
you know,

956
00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.460
and,
and a bigger picture,

957
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:24.320
they buy back hundreds of thousands of acres like in places in Africa where it's

958
00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:28.760
only hunting that has kept those animals alive without hunting.
They are gone.

959
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.580
And they're the buffer zone between the parks and,

960
00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.760
and the great massive crush of humanity coming in towards the parks.

961
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:41.930
The hunting dollars protects those animals that animals have bought back their

962
00:55:41.931 --> 00:55:46.100
land,
literally bought it back.
The hunters pay hundreds of thousands of dollars,

963
00:55:46.101 --> 00:55:49.790
millions of dollars to go hunt there,
that communities get the money.

964
00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:50.541
So they said,
okay,

965
00:55:50.541 --> 00:55:53.330
we'll protect the animals will protect them because we're getting more money

966
00:55:53.331 --> 00:55:58.160
from that.
That killing these animals for $5 on Bushmeat and,
and over here.
Yes,

967
00:55:58.161 --> 00:56:02.450
it's,
you know,
we may be more sophisticated,
but the problem is still there.

968
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.730
You know,
the bears in North Carolina,
if the hunters,

969
00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:07.790
they might be losing $60,000 in,
in one,

970
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:13.560
three or 400 acre crop field,
you know,
$60,000 in,

971
00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:18.560
in crop depredation from the,
from the bears.
They get zero money for those bears.

972
00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.170
What do you think that they're gonna do?
They're gonna shoot,

973
00:56:21.171 --> 00:56:24.490
shovel and shut up the animals.
The bears will be gone.

974
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.000
Now when the hunter comes in and pays x amount of dollars,

975
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.150
suddenly the farmer and they,
and they don't want to kill the bears,
you know,

976
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:33.090
they're,
they're,
they're sent here in human beings.
They,
they,

977
00:56:33.091 --> 00:56:35.440
they know what they're doing.
They don't want to kill him and bury them.

978
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.220
So now they're,
they have a reason they're there.
They're grasping for it there.

979
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:40.480
They're begging for it.

980
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:43.650
Give us money for these animals and we will then protect animals.

981
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:48.250
I'll let them meet my $60,000 in corn crop.
So the hunters are not just,
you know,

982
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.940
working as a conservation tool to,
you know,
buffer.
These,

983
00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:53.980
protect these animals from coming into our communities.

984
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.880
They're also empowering the animals to buy back their,
their lives.

985
00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:01.300
They're there giving them value and nothing is going to survive the next,

986
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.440
I'd say 30 years,
nothing,
no wildlife,
no tree,

987
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.220
nothing in this planet will survive the next 30 years unless it has value.

988
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.280
They have to be able to pay their way.
In today's world,

989
00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.620
<v 3>I don't like the spotted owl when they shut down logging.</v>

990
00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:19.730
<v 1>Same thing the spotted owl.
When,
when push comes to shove,</v>

991
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:23.330
when this world gets really cranked up,
they're going to cut down those trees,

992
00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:23.541
you know,

993
00:57:23.541 --> 00:57:27.500
down the marbled Murrelet it's going down because the trees coming down.

994
00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.840
But if the Marble Mule let,
for whatever reason,

995
00:57:29.841 --> 00:57:34.010
can pay for those trees to stand up,
which know they tried to do,
uh,
you know,

996
00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.950
I mean the big fight back in that was like an eighties or nineties fight.

997
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:41.570
You know,
they did protect some of the habitat back then.
But when,

998
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:46.720
when it gets really dire and we realize we're in a fight with the rest of the

999
00:57:46.851 --> 00:57:47.360
world,

1000
00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:52.070
the competition around this world for resources is going to be so huge and so

1001
00:57:52.071 --> 00:57:52.904
expensive.

1002
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:57.830
You know when your house costs you $20 million to build because there's no wood,

1003
00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.550
you know you're going to cut down the trees that you have access to and you know

1004
00:58:01.551 --> 00:58:06.050
down the marble and mule led,
it's going down on that tree.
So,
so these animals,

1005
00:58:06.051 --> 00:58:09.650
if there's a way for them to pay,
then they have to pay.
Now as hunters,

1006
00:58:09.651 --> 00:58:13.160
we can't fight the marble mural letter,
the spotter dollars flight.

1007
00:58:13.161 --> 00:58:13.994
We can't fight that.

1008
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:18.620
But we can fight the battle for the bigger game like the,

1009
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:23.750
I mean all the way up from prairie dogs to Moose and in North America,

1010
00:58:23.751 --> 00:58:25.610
we can fight for them on their behalf.
We can,

1011
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:29.990
we can finance them to buy back their existence to protect their existence.

1012
00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.070
<v 3>Isn't that such a bizarre contradiction?</v>

1013
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.530
And this is one of the things that people have such a hard time grasping.

1014
00:58:34.531 --> 00:58:39.120
The idea that somehow or another you killing those animals is good for those

1015
00:58:39.121 --> 00:58:41.750
animals.
Yeah.
It doesn't make sense.
What,
what's the word?

1016
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:43.680
I've been trying to think of what my brain,
I've gone brain dead.

1017
00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:47.910
It's a contradictory then I know there's another oxymoron.
Oxymoron.
Yeah.

1018
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:52.280
Jumbo shrimp.
Military Intelligence.
It doesn't,
it doesn't make sense.
Yeah.
It's,

1019
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.220
it's indicative of like how bizarre life really,

1020
00:58:56.221 --> 00:58:59.430
truly is and also how bizarre life truly really is.

1021
00:58:59.431 --> 00:59:02.370
When we're disconnected from the information that,

1022
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:07.200
that we really should have access to when it comes to like where our food comes

1023
00:59:07.201 --> 00:59:09.060
from,
that we are actually animals,

1024
00:59:09.061 --> 00:59:11.490
that we are actually a part of this cycle of life.

1025
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:12.820
That we are actually in Greece,
we,

1026
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:17.670
we've done this strange thing by putting ourselves in these big cement boxes and

1027
00:59:17.671 --> 00:59:22.671
buildings and pave the roads and locked ourselves and put bolts on the doors.

1028
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:27.680
We've separated ourselves from our environment in such a profound way that we

1029
00:59:27.681 --> 00:59:31.280
don't think that we're a part of it anymore until you're forced to be out naked

1030
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:33.500
and afraid.
You know,
those,
those silly shows,

1031
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:36.640
they make people go out into the wild and you realized like,
wow,
we're,

1032
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.310
we're so fucking vulnerable.
We're unbelievably vulnerable.

1033
00:59:40.311 --> 00:59:43.130
If you take away our buildings and you take away our cars.

1034
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.990
And especially if you take away our clothes,

1035
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.490
we truly are just a life form.
We just a weird,

1036
00:59:49.491 --> 00:59:50.660
bizarre life form.

1037
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:55.700
It's figured out how to wait to make clothes and shoes and houses and all these

1038
00:59:55.701 --> 00:59:58.430
different things.
But we want to think of ourselves as being alien.

1039
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.350
We want to think of ourselves as being separate from it.

1040
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:05.530
<v 1>Yeah.
But we're not,
we're not and,
and you know,
and to be fair,</v>

1041
01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:08.560
not everybody lives like that.
You know,
not everybody does,

1042
01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.680
but there's a deal with urbanization over the last,
whatever,

1043
01:00:11.681 --> 01:00:16.150
starting in the 50s forties 50s you know,
we have gone that route,

1044
01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.170
but not everybody.
It's a recent thing.
Yeah.
And it's not everybody,

1045
01:00:20.171 --> 01:00:23.530
like you can still go out into Wyoming and find people.
Alaska.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1046
01:00:23.531 --> 01:00:26.830
look at the everybody up there and even northern California,
you know,

1047
01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:28.480
there's still people,
lots of them.

1048
01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.830
There's lots of us that are still out there that aren't buying in.
You know,

1049
01:00:32.831 --> 01:00:36.680
we're not,
we're not drinking that Koolaid.
Uh,
we'll,
we'll take advantage of,

1050
01:00:36.681 --> 01:00:40.300
of the,
uh,
the modern technologies.
I mean,
you know,
Internet's great.

1051
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:44.590
We can tweet and Facebook and do all that kind of thing,

1052
01:00:44.591 --> 01:00:47.770
but we can also be in touch with nature.

1053
01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.510
We can be true to who we are as human beings.

1054
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:54.180
<v 3>I thought it was really fascinating,
one of your shows to get back to uncharted.</v>

1055
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.280
It was amazing.

1056
01:00:56.281 --> 01:01:01.281
You were in Pakistan and you were putting something up on Facebook and the

1057
01:01:03.001 --> 01:01:07.650
negative comments of people that had this very ignorant idea.

1058
01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:08.880
And when I say ignorant,

1059
01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:12.420
it's based not on any information that they've gotten firsthand.

1060
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:17.370
It's based only on the propaganda of Pakistan has nuclear weapons.

1061
01:01:17.371 --> 01:01:20.160
It's a Muslim country.
They're going to go to war with India.

1062
01:01:20.161 --> 01:01:22.080
They harbored terrorism.
They have all the,

1063
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:26.640
we have all these ideas that we have been fed.
And meanwhile,

1064
01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:29.700
you're over there with these people.
You're breaking bread with these people.

1065
01:01:29.701 --> 01:01:33.870
You're sitting around a fire with these people and you're,
you're posting these,

1066
01:01:33.871 --> 01:01:35.580
uh,
updates of your,

1067
01:01:35.581 --> 01:01:40.410
your hunting experience on Facebook and these people are making these comments.

1068
01:01:40.411 --> 01:01:42.180
He's super negative comments.

1069
01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:45.180
And because of that you had to actually get out of town.

1070
01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:50.190
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
that's not everybody over there is a good guy.
You know,
that,</v>

1071
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.320
that's,
that's just face it.
That's the reality.

1072
01:01:52.321 --> 01:01:55.950
But that's like not everybody hears exactly right.
Not Everybody on this planet,

1073
01:01:55.951 --> 01:02:00.420
I don't care where you touched down on is a good guy and I use that figuratively

1074
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:05.210
there.
There's bad people over there.
And when you,
when you,
uh,

1075
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.600
the,
the,
that particular situation,
I actually had to cut out a lot of,

1076
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.490
a lot of what we videoed because people would get hurt if I hear that.

1077
01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:15.930
But I'll get,
I'll,
I'll,

1078
01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:21.200
I'll give you a quick sort of idea of what could happen in a place like that.

1079
01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.800
Uh,
it,
you know,
where there's people that are,

1080
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:29.850
are monitoring Facebook pages.
There's,

1081
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.880
there's political party that wants change in democracy and they're the good

1082
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:35.874
guys.

1083
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:41.210
Then there's military powers that want to take overs,

1084
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:46.320
basically dictate to the people and in those countries that that's a volatile

1085
01:02:46.321 --> 01:02:49.380
changing,
evolving dynamic situation.

1086
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:53.640
Now the military has access to the,
uh,

1087
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.200
like you have the CIA,

1088
01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.440
so they have their secret service or their intelligence agencies that are second

1089
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:05.040
only to Israeli or Israel because of their,
their,
uh,

1090
01:03:05.041 --> 01:03:09.900
the money that was pumped into their,
through the 1980s,
you know,
the 1990s,

1091
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.210
the money came in by the billions of dollars.

1092
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.480
These guys are very capable.

1093
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:20.430
So the military runs the,
the,
the,
the intelligence agencies,

1094
01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:22.440
the intelligence age,
she's monitor everything.

1095
01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:27.930
What happens is the,
this is where it gets a little complicated.

1096
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:32.520
If somebody was with somebody who's maybe associated with government and

1097
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:36.270
democracy and you know,
the good guys,
they would,
well,

1098
01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:37.830
I'm never going to get back into this country if I,

1099
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:42.480
if I go too far down this line.
But,
but they just say for instance,

1100
01:03:42.481 --> 01:03:44.100
the intelligence agency could,

1101
01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:47.880
could do something that would cause the political side of things,

1102
01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:52.590
the good guys to get an egg on their face.
Like,
say somebody who was kidnapped,

1103
01:03:52.591 --> 01:03:56.790
that was a,
you know,
a known entity over here in North America,

1104
01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:01.950
that person would be,
you know,
family.
It's a terrible thing for that to happen.

1105
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:06.300
So if the intelligence agency knows what's going on and they happen to slip that

1106
01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:10.470
word too,
the real bad guys.
Right?
And those,
those are just the thugs.

1107
01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:14.520
The criminals are gangsters.
If they slipped that information to them,

1108
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:17.610
they would love nothing more than to,
you know,
cause anarchy.

1109
01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:21.570
They don't care who it is.
So,
so that's what happened.
We got to,
we got a,

1110
01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:26.730
a word that we had 15 minutes,
get out of there now.
Right now.

1111
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.210
Go and,
and you know,
do not take any of the roads you've traveled on.
You,

1112
01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:34.260
you know,
it's,
it's,
the word's been given out to the bad guy.

1113
01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:37.170
So we actually had to go and that,
that's,
you know,

1114
01:04:37.171 --> 01:04:40.470
I didn't know what was going on at that point.
I was going,
what's awesome action,

1115
01:04:40.471 --> 01:04:42.990
action and uh,
and we're on the road.

1116
01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.900
No sirens going and getting the heck out of dodge.
Well,
that was,

1117
01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:49.680
that was what that was about.
And I couldn't air that,

1118
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:53.190
I couldn't show that because it would have caused people to be in trouble.

1119
01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:55.400
Who phoned?
Who warned who?
You know,

1120
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:57.510
it brings up too many questions and like I say,

1121
01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.380
I'm hoping I'm not causing anybody in trouble right now.
I don't think so.

1122
01:05:00.381 --> 01:05:04.380
Or Pre being pretty vague about it.
So I think the visual depictions of,
you know,

1123
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:07.950
you interacting with those guys would probably be much more problematic I would

1124
01:05:07.951 --> 01:05:11.550
guess.
But so they would,
you,

1125
01:05:11.551 --> 01:05:14.490
you could be used as almost like a political tool.
That's all you are.

1126
01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.171
That's all your and,

1127
01:05:15.171 --> 01:05:18.040
and your nothing in this world that when those guys could care less right there,

1128
01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:22.970
there,
I mean there'd be hitting guys right now.
Uh,
it's,
it's just your,

1129
01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.460
you know,
nothing personal,

1130
01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:27.670
but we're going to be heads you because this is going to get us press and that's

1131
01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:28.240
what we need,

1132
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.090
<v 0>right?
Like all these journalists that they keep sending over that thing out,</v>

1133
01:05:31.091 --> 01:05:35.740
putting them on video,
you're still putting yourself in those situations though,

1134
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.640
and you're doing it to film the show and your deal.
I mean,

1135
01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:44.020
you could easily go to Nebraska and go big buck hunting and some cornfield and

1136
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.420
you know,
and you could probably have a really interesting show,

1137
01:05:46.421 --> 01:05:51.100
but instead you're choosing to go halfway around the world to one of the most

1138
01:05:51.101 --> 01:05:55.990
dangerous volatile areas currently and on an animal.

1139
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.480
And do it as the hunting the animals,

1140
01:05:58.481 --> 01:06:01.420
like a task that you have to do on this show.

1141
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:05.920
The actual show itself is more about you interacting with the culture and you

1142
01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:06.754
getting this,

1143
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.480
this very unique sense of who these people are and what their lives are like.

1144
01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:13.020
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't know that there's any other way you could do it.</v>

1145
01:06:13.350 --> 01:06:18.000
I mean that in every society in this world,
there's hunters.
They are there,

1146
01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:20.460
no denying it.
There's 10% of the population are hunters.

1147
01:06:20.461 --> 01:06:25.010
And that's probably historic.
Uh,
it goes back into prehistoric times.
Actually,

1148
01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:25.860
you know,

1149
01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:29.490
a percentage of the population was that were the hunters and a percentage where

1150
01:06:29.491 --> 01:06:34.470
the basket makers,
I mean,
someone had to do both.
Right?
So,
you know,
for,
for me,

1151
01:06:34.471 --> 01:06:37.290
I go to these countries to find those hunters.

1152
01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.330
And once you're embedded with them living like they do with them doing what they

1153
01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:46.740
do every day,
you are so far away from the tourist lanes,
you know,
the,

1154
01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:50.400
the photography photo op places,
busloads or,

1155
01:06:50.401 --> 01:06:55.280
or even individuals going,
even our journalists,
you know,
there's very few there.

1156
01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:58.260
They're being fed,
whatever,
they're being fed.

1157
01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:00.450
When we're with the hunters in that community,

1158
01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:04.560
we literally are being swallowed up and integrated into that community.

1159
01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.710
And that's what we try and do is live with the hunters learned from the hunters.

1160
01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:10.560
And that gives us an insight into their,

1161
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:14.610
these societies all around the world that you can't get any other way.

1162
01:07:14.611 --> 01:07:15.540
I don't believe you can.

1163
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:19.860
And you maybe Jane Goodall argue with me when she goes in there that she's,

1164
01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:22.200
you know,
she's embedding herself and,
and,

1165
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:26.150
and she's part of their cultures and she probably is.
But hunting is,

1166
01:07:26.151 --> 01:07:29.850
is definitely a way to do it.
I mean,
Marco Polo is a hunter.

1167
01:07:29.851 --> 01:07:32.520
All the great explorers were hunters.
That's how they,

1168
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:36.060
that's how they fed themselves on these trips.

1169
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:40.470
Everyone Shackleton named,
named them,
named Lewis and Clark,
all of them,

1170
01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:44.820
they hunted to survive while they explored.
And for me,
you know,

1171
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:48.210
uncharted is,
is,
you know,
you said I was there to film the show.

1172
01:07:48.211 --> 01:07:49.090
That's not really what I'm doing.

1173
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.530
I'm there to just be who I am and to do what I do with the shows,

1174
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:55.680
documenting what I do.
If there was no camera with me,
I would still be in there.

1175
01:07:56.270 --> 01:08:00.210
You know,
for your own personal,
of course,
of course.
I want to know,

1176
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.030
I want to experience.
And I also,
you know,
I said at the beginning,

1177
01:08:03.031 --> 01:08:06.510
I don't feel fear.
I id test when,

1178
01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:11.550
when somebody tries to instill that feeling in me,
they tried to terrorize me.

1179
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:16.070
I,
it just drives me wild to the point where,
okay,

1180
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:21.310
now here we are now mano a Mano and you,
you tell me,
go ahead.
You know,

1181
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.460
I'm facing,
you know,
this is not an unknown,
lurking dark fear.

1182
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:29.120
That whole side of the world is a scary place.
No,
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

1183
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:34.370
You know,
and what you find most times is that our press tends to,

1184
01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:36.780
uh,
you know,
they,
they,

1185
01:08:36.781 --> 01:08:41.540
they tend to feed us propaganda and people in all of these places,

1186
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:44.330
the vast majority are good people.

1187
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:49.390
Now they may believe in a totally different construct than we do religiously.

1188
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:52.130
Politically.
It just civilly,

1189
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:56.300
they may be in like unfathomable to us.
We look at and go,

1190
01:08:56.301 --> 01:08:59.250
you gotta be kidding me.
You know,
you say you own your wife like,

1191
01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:03.710
like you are one confused guy.
But that's if we're judging them,

1192
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.290
if we're just there going,
okay,
you know,
that's what they believe.

1193
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:10.520
But they're good people.
They just have a,
you know,
different than us.
So,

1194
01:09:10.521 --> 01:09:14.540
so that what I found traveling into these places,
and again,
it's just to affirm,

1195
01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:19.541
I think partially inside myself that the vast majority of this world is filled

1196
01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:22.910
with good people,
good people that,
you know,
they have children,
they laughed,

1197
01:09:22.911 --> 01:09:25.820
they raise them with love.
They may have the weirdest,
you know,

1198
01:09:25.821 --> 01:09:29.540
the two wives have 10 wives or whatever.
That stuff.
I don't get the,
you know,

1199
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:34.130
they may eat stuff that I just look and go,
well,
it's not really for me,

1200
01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:36.770
but hey,
you know,
that's good for them.

1201
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:39.470
And the hunting allows me to go inside those communities,

1202
01:09:39.471 --> 01:09:42.740
see what they're really like,
you know,
without,

1203
01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:47.510
without buying the bullcrap that I'm reading the propaganda in our popular press

1204
01:09:47.511 --> 01:09:50.890
and to say no,
these,
these people,
I don't hate everybody there.
I don't.

1205
01:09:51.790 --> 01:09:56.240
And there in lies the basis of hate is fear.

1206
01:09:56.750 --> 01:10:00.550
When you fear something,
you hate it.
You have to hate it because it,

1207
01:10:00.551 --> 01:10:03.770
it's a threat to you.
So this is why,
you know,
I mean,

1208
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:06.590
tying it all back into the animal rights,
they're,
they're,
you know,

1209
01:10:06.591 --> 01:10:11.240
they hate us because they fear,
they fear you because you represent,
you're not,

1210
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:14.000
you're not supposed to be talking positively about hunting.

1211
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:18.080
You told this company line down here in California and just this is where it

1212
01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:20.960
should be in Hollywood.
You got,
you can't do this.
So,

1213
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:23.120
so this the same thing for over there in these countries,

1214
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.690
they want us to hate all these people because we're supposed to fear him.

1215
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:28.940
And most people fear them because they don't.
It's unknown.

1216
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:32.390
So I'd rather just go there and visit them and find out what's going on with

1217
01:10:32.391 --> 01:10:34.520
hunting as the,
as what I do,

1218
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:37.110
which I also want to see what's going on with the wildlife,
how,

1219
01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:41.600
how are the wildlife these animals fairing with,
with all this going on,

1220
01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:44.540
I mean these people and what you find out is the hunters are taking care of the

1221
01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:47.510
wildlife there.
They're taking care of them in Russia,

1222
01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:50.960
they're taking care of them or all these crazy places where you'd expect it's

1223
01:10:50.961 --> 01:10:52.700
anarchy knows not.
They're still,

1224
01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:56.930
the wildlife has still benefiting from the conservation efforts of hunting and

1225
01:10:56.931 --> 01:10:57.350
that,

1226
01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:02.060
that's what I always hope to find out when I go to these places sometimes.

1227
01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:07.340
Sometimes,
you know,
it's not the way it is,
but that whole journey,

1228
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:09.530
that's all part of hunting.
It's all part of hunting.

1229
01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:14.531
That's a voyage of discovery and that's why back to the people see a smiling or

1230
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.630
you know,
with that animal dead animal,
you're,
you're smiling about the killer.

1231
01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:21.030
The animal that's sick,
wrong does not worth smiling about.

1232
01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:25.200
Where smiling about the process that was involved to get to that animal.
I mean,

1233
01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:27.780
we,
we had to think about where to go learn about the animal,

1234
01:11:27.781 --> 01:11:29.220
learn the skills to actually hunt it,

1235
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:32.390
learn the skills to shoot whatever we're shooting with rifle even that isn't

1236
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.700
easy.
We have to then learn to track it,
wait for it.
How the patients,

1237
01:11:35.701 --> 01:11:38.070
we have to know when to move the wind.
We have to,

1238
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:41.800
we have to live this animal's life in,

1239
01:11:41.801 --> 01:11:45.450
in sort of a counterbalance until we cross paths and we kill it.

1240
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:47.850
That's what the picture represents.
That whole process.

1241
01:11:47.851 --> 01:11:52.470
And when you add in a place like Pakistan,
you know,

1242
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.230
I'll have,
you know,
I mean I've got a big smile if I'm,

1243
01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:58.800
whatever animal I've hunted.
But there that the,

1244
01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:02.610
that degree of difficulty is just so much higher because there's all these other

1245
01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:06.850
elements you shouldn't have to be,
you know,
looking over your shoulder and,

1246
01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:11.890
and wearing a shalwar Kameez and the Topi Cindy hat,
you know,

1247
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:16.380
to go hunting.
But you have to,
you know,
this is becomes part of it.
So for me,

1248
01:12:16.381 --> 01:12:20.670
it's all exploration discovery.
And the hunters is the theme to it all.

1249
01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:22.890
That the thing that ties us into,

1250
01:12:22.891 --> 01:12:26.580
it's a network around this entire planet of hunters that are looking after the

1251
01:12:26.581 --> 01:12:30.840
wildlife and,
and who for the most part or are the good people,

1252
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:35.010
<v 0>all of this world and you're wearing the traditional garb of these people and a</v>

1253
01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:35.920
lot of the places where you go,

1254
01:12:35.921 --> 01:12:38.950
it's not like you're wearing like Sitka digital cammo and you know,

1255
01:12:38.951 --> 01:12:42.940
we are you wearing like what they wear so that you fit in?
Yeah.
Depends.

1256
01:12:42.941 --> 01:12:46.420
It depends on where I am there absolutely.
There is not to blend in with the,

1257
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:49.940
<v 1>the environment is to blend in with the culture.
You know,</v>

1258
01:12:49.941 --> 01:12:54.941
I did you walk around with Justin a cowboy hat like I would hear and cowboy

1259
01:12:55.011 --> 01:12:58.070
boots,
I look a little weird when you're,

1260
01:12:58.370 --> 01:13:02.330
you're right on the know on the Swat valley.
Well,
you know,

1261
01:13:02.331 --> 01:13:04.970
on the Caricom highway,
I mean,
you just would stand out too much.

1262
01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:09.370
So I'd rather look like a posh tune warrior,
then I would,
you know,
uh,
uh,

1263
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.800
cowboy from the West.
So,
so,
and that,
you know,
again,
it's not fear,

1264
01:13:12.801 --> 01:13:15.740
it's just adapting.
It's just you,
you want to walk in there just like that.

1265
01:13:15.741 --> 01:13:18.590
Go ahead.
You know,
all the more power to you,
but you know,

1266
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:22.120
<v 0>be prepared because you're,
you're just a target at that point.
And,</v>

1267
01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:25.230
and it's almost disrespectful in some ways.
When you go to these countries,

1268
01:13:25.231 --> 01:13:27.000
do you bring a translator?

1269
01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:29.880
Do you hire someone before you get there and to translate,
do you,

1270
01:13:29.881 --> 01:13:33.300
do you hire someone who's integrated into the culture?
Like how do you,

1271
01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:37.080
how do you set these things up?
Well,
like,
like I said,
there's a net network

1272
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.500
<v 1>of hunters around this world that are,
that are conserving wildlife.</v>

1273
01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:44.820
They're looking after the wildlife of this world and,
and make no mistake,

1274
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:49.080
every wildlife population on this planet is managed to some degree or other

1275
01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:53.730
nowadays that the world is just crushed with,
with humanity.

1276
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:58.080
So every,
every single big game animal,
a small game animal,
they're all managed.

1277
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.070
So there is hunters around the entire world and,

1278
01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:05.370
and all work that network to find who's there.
You know,
that,
you know,

1279
01:14:05.371 --> 01:14:09.390
they're the hunter.
They know they,
they,
they know the places to go.
They,
you know,

1280
01:14:09.391 --> 01:14:13.330
they're proud to be hunters are happy to help you out to take you to this place.

1281
01:14:13.331 --> 01:14:17.860
Now on the translation basis,
we do our best,
but it's a,
I mean I was,

1282
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.160
I did a self guided hunt into the jungles of Cameroon in west Africa,

1283
01:14:23.231 --> 01:14:24.400
right on the Congo border.

1284
01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:29.430
And we literally took a bus from,
uh,

1285
01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:31.300
we landed into Walla airplane,

1286
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.810
took a bus and we were the only white people on that bus and then that bus

1287
01:14:34.811 --> 01:14:39.811
station to Yoni and then hired a taxi cab to take us as far out into the Bush on

1288
01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:43.900
the Bush trails as the tax.
We would go another eight hours,

1289
01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.950
ended up in a little village filled with pygmies and there's another tribe that

1290
01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:52.510
will come to me,
but they,
they,
uh,
we hired them to be our,
our,
uh,

1291
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.760
our guides into the forest.

1292
01:14:54.761 --> 01:14:57.160
Then we hiked into the forest for two weeks and hunted.

1293
01:14:57.670 --> 01:15:01.990
My translator was the only translator I've ever hired that could only speak one

1294
01:15:01.991 --> 01:15:05.040
language French.
So that was my,
that was my,

1295
01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.790
my attempt at that point to,
to hire a translator.
We,
it works sometimes,

1296
01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:13.240
sometimes it doesn't,
you know,
so it's uh,
but you know,

1297
01:15:13.241 --> 01:15:17.920
the language of hunting is,
is,
uh,
is co,
it's like a universal language.

1298
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:21.520
We,
I can talk with anybody Swahili.
It doesn't matter.
We can,

1299
01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.920
we can converse because we know what we're talking about.

1300
01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:26.220
<v 0>That sounds like such a crazy plan.</v>

1301
01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:31.460
Hire a cab to drive you as far as he's willing to go on these roads into the

1302
01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:36.210
Congo,
then you get out and what are you camping?

1303
01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:40.130
<v 1>Yeah,
we,
we,
we actually had a little pup tents.</v>

1304
01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:43.790
It was just me and my cameraman and,
and uh,
and uh,
yeah,

1305
01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:47.660
we just hiked into the jungle and,
and wandering around the jungle for two weeks.

1306
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:51.440
And it wasn't in the Congo by the way,
cause that would be illegal.
It was,
it was,

1307
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:55.970
but it was very,
very close to the Congo that it's illegal to hunt in the Congo.

1308
01:15:56.790 --> 01:16:00.770
Uh,
it's not illegal to hunt,
but there is no,
in the Congo itself now,

1309
01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.630
Congo Brazzaville,
I've hunted there you can hunt.
There's actually a,
a mandate.

1310
01:16:05.631 --> 01:16:08.960
It's its proclamation with the government that you can,
you can hunt.

1311
01:16:08.961 --> 01:16:13.590
There's a way to do it,
so very complicated way,
but you can do it.
But in the,
the,

1312
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:17.870
the Congo Democratic Republic of the,
they're hunting,

1313
01:16:17.871 --> 01:16:20.660
the animals are getting hammered in there because of the civil wars.

1314
01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:25.280
There is no oversight in there.
I mean there's animals.
The Okapi is in there,

1315
01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:28.490
they're being slaughtered and there's no,
there's no hunting without hunting,

1316
01:16:28.491 --> 01:16:31.720
there's no one overseeing it.
Now,
there will be some biologists,
uh,
you know,

1317
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:34.070
they're probably the bravest of the brave actually when you're,

1318
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:37.300
when you break it right down,
they go into those places and,

1319
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:39.460
and do their best to protect it.
But it's,

1320
01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:41.240
it's a losing battle right now in that country.

1321
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.300
<v 0>Wow.</v>

1322
01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:47.300
So you are with just you and a camera man and you bring just one rifle.

1323
01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.630
<v 1>Yeah,
I had a muzzle loader actually.</v>

1324
01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:55.340
<v 0>Yeah.
It was a
not with a muzzle loader.</v>

1325
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:57.230
Is it extra challenge or something?

1326
01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.590
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
you know what I started,
it was a bow hunter and,</v>

1327
01:17:00.591 --> 01:17:03.690
and I realized fairly quickly and that,

1328
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:08.030
that beginning of my career that I wasn't patient enough to be a bow hunter.

1329
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.620
I mean,
I trust my,
my skills and old gamble on my skills every single time.

1330
01:17:12.621 --> 01:17:15.920
And the problem with bowhunting,
you can't do that.
There's just rules.

1331
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:19.640
You can't shoot an animal quarter towards.
You shouldn't shoot it.
You know,

1332
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:24.350
if it's severely quartered away,
if it's,
you know,
if it's ready to jump string,

1333
01:17:24.351 --> 01:17:24.711
you can't,

1334
01:17:24.711 --> 01:17:28.370
you shouldn't shoot if it's a greater distance and 40 years now everybody's

1335
01:17:28.371 --> 01:17:33.050
skill level is different.
So a guy that Cameron Hanes,
I,
you know,
I'd say Cameron,

1336
01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:35.720
shoot,
if it's 80 yards,
shoot,
he,
cause he's going to be able to hit it.

1337
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.570
In those days,
the equipment,
I was using,
finger tabs,

1338
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:42.990
there was none of the modern,
it was compound bows but barely compound.
And,

1339
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.940
and I actually wounded a dear one day and I,
and I,
uh,
it was horrible.
I had to,

1340
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.670
I couldn't get close enough for a second shot.
I had to watch it die.
And that,

1341
01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.130
that,
that,
uh,
that I,
I just said,
look,

1342
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.000
Jimmy face it,
you should never have taken that shot.
You did.

1343
01:17:59.001 --> 01:18:00.590
And now this animal suffering,
it's wrong.

1344
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:03.500
And so I put my boat down and I picked up a muzzle or,

1345
01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:07.490
because that still gave me the challenge of archery hunting where I had to do

1346
01:18:07.491 --> 01:18:10.280
the same stocks,
get justice clothes.

1347
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:14.180
But when I took that shot at,
you know,
55 yards,

1348
01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:17.030
which is how far that Deere was with a muzzle or you know,

1349
01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:20.210
I'm going to kill it and it's going to be humane and done,
done deal.

1350
01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.210
And so that's why I switched the muzzleloader rifle for me wasn't,

1351
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:24.800
it just wasn't as challenging.

1352
01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:28.820
Now as I'm hunting and some of these places around the world nowadays,

1353
01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:34.060
I'm back to using a rifle occasionally because there's places you just can't get

1354
01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:36.890
within three,
400 yards of these animals in the mountains.

1355
01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:39.700
<v 3>What about a second shot?
Like a followup shot?
Like,
if the,</v>

1356
01:18:39.701 --> 01:18:43.010
if an animal is wounded and is trying to take off and you would normally be able

1357
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:47.870
to just with a bolt action rifle and have another shot in the chamber ready you,

1358
01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.760
it takes what,
30 seconds?

1359
01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:51.250
<v 1>Uh,
if,
if,</v>

1360
01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:54.910
if I was with a speed loader waiting,

1361
01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:59.830
anticipating having to reload quickly,
I can do it in about 30 to 40 seconds.

1362
01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:02.500
Uh,
but then you know,
and then acquire the target and shoot.

1363
01:19:02.501 --> 01:19:05.660
So you're about a minute.
The,
the uh,
you know,

1364
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:11.110
the idea of using a muzzle loaders that you have to get close because you don't

1365
01:19:11.111 --> 01:19:15.370
have the range that you would with a high power rifle and that you have to make

1366
01:19:15.371 --> 01:19:17.590
the first shot.
Perfect.
I mean,
that's all you don't,

1367
01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:22.270
you don't really have an option.
So,
so you know,
the more opportunity or humans,

1368
01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:24.760
right,
the more opportunity we give ourselves to do it the easy way.

1369
01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:28.120
We'll do it the easy way.
Second Shadow,
cal reload and shoot again.
No.

1370
01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:33.330
So I actually almost never have a second load ready to go.

1371
01:19:33.551 --> 01:19:38.380
I just,
I make sure I don't take a shot unless it's perfect.
Now that,

1372
01:19:38.381 --> 01:19:42.790
you know,
we're still human so you can mess up,
but,
but that's not an alternative.

1373
01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:46.810
And,
and it gets a little hairy on dangerous stuff.
It's,
yeah,
I would imagine.

1374
01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:52.050
Yeah.
It's,
it's not that,
that I,
I don't,
I can't say that I enjoyed,

1375
01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:56.950
you know,
sneaking in on Cape Buffalo and
they're just,

1376
01:19:56.951 --> 01:20:01.240
it's just a scary situation.
I know.
The thing is,
it may not be me that gets hurt.

1377
01:20:01.241 --> 01:20:04.510
Maybe it's the,
the native tracker that's helping us out.
You know,

1378
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:08.220
someone's going to get scratched or spit on or stumbled and it's going to be

1379
01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:12.150
because I was,
you know,
hunting with a muzzle or that's a bit of a stunt.
Uh,

1380
01:20:12.151 --> 01:20:14.820
I was just in Africa here,
uh,
just got back,
actually,

1381
01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:19.380
it probably don't even know what time it is here,
but,
uh,
one 20.
Okay.

1382
01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:22.420
It's probably midnight for me right now.
So it,
you know,

1383
01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.270
I was over there and I was using a rifle.
I didn't take my muscle,

1384
01:20:25.271 --> 01:20:29.670
I took my bowl and a and a high powered rifle and I got to say it was kind of

1385
01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:30.990
Nice,
you know,
to,

1386
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:34.680
for once to go in on these Cape Buffalo and not have to worry.

1387
01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:39.840
I've got a rifle that I'm entirely capable of taking care of the situation.

1388
01:20:39.841 --> 01:20:43.020
In fact,
we got a,
I was going to bring you the footage,
but my computer died.

1389
01:20:43.021 --> 01:20:46.050
It was uh,
uh,
we were charged by a hippo.

1390
01:20:46.051 --> 01:20:49.920
We were hunting a hippo that had been terrorizing the village and they wanted us

1391
01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:52.890
to help.
It was wrecking their crops and it was one particular hippole.

1392
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:57.720
So we were sneaking along a river.
I and you know,
sort of a creek,
um,

1393
01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.740
thick,
thick,
thick stuff working our way along.

1394
01:21:00.741 --> 01:21:02.000
We could hear the hip as they come home.

1395
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.020
You hear my audio and how's it going again,

1396
01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.070
I'm not a good hippo color.
I'd never went in the national hip calling contest.

1397
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:14.190
But,
uh,
as we went,
we were sneaking,

1398
01:21:14.191 --> 01:21:17.790
I s we saw this hippo that we're after one came from behind us,

1399
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:21.630
literally hunting us and,
and came through the grass,

1400
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:26.430
hit full speed when it was going 30 miles an hour and hit the opening or the

1401
01:21:26.431 --> 01:21:31.360
grass between me.
And it was 30 feet at that point.
Yeah.
And,

1402
01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:32.780
and coming at 30 miles an hour,

1403
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:36.420
a hippo and 100% someone was going to get killed.

1404
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.120
If I had my muzzle or my hands at that incident,

1405
01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.740
it would have been questionable if I could have stopped it.
But with the,

1406
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.060
you know,
with a big rifle,
I did stop it.
Yeah.
It's all in camera.
It's incredible.

1407
01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:49.080
You see how quick it's like,
it's,

1408
01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:53.070
it's a 10th of a second from when you have to acquire the target shoot.

1409
01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:54.360
<v 4>Ooh.</v>

1410
01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.360
<v 1>Yeah.
Scary stuff.
Wow.
So yeah.</v>

1411
01:21:57.361 --> 01:22:00.200
You don't want to be with a Flint lock when you're doing that?
No.

1412
01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.740
Just the hang fire would be to get,
you know,
that took poof,
you're already dead.

1413
01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:08.840
You because cut half halfway that hip and they're actually people,
you know,

1414
01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:12.540
think hippo.
It's a big chunky beast.
What is ever do,

1415
01:22:12.541 --> 01:22:14.760
but they're behind crocs,

1416
01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:18.630
mosquitoes and puff adders hippos kill more people in Africa than any other

1417
01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:22.650
animal there.
There are a dangerous animal to hunt with their enormous too,

1418
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.070
and they don't have any fear of crocodiles.
There's this crazy video,

1419
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:30.240
these crocs that are hanging around this waterhole and the hippo walks through

1420
01:22:30.241 --> 01:22:34.260
him like it's a bunch of children.
Cool.
Excuse me.
Pardon me?

1421
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:38.340
He's murderous.
Dinosaurs are floating around next to him.
He doesn't care at all.

1422
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:42.300
It's the bottles through those crocs.
By the way,
I was in Mozambique to,

1423
01:22:42.301 --> 01:22:46.170
that was the last place I was.
Those Tanzania,
Mozambique,
Mozambique.
We were,

1424
01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.900
we were along the Zambezi river helping the villagers there.

1425
01:22:48.901 --> 01:22:52.830
They were getting hammered by these crocs that literally while we were there,

1426
01:22:52.831 --> 01:22:57.670
a woman got taken 800 yards down the beach from us,
killed dead eating and,

1427
01:22:57.810 --> 01:23:01.350
and we were there because another lady had been killed two days before we went

1428
01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:05.770
into the village.
There was a dozen people that were chewed up chomped on,

1429
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.790
you know,
over the years that survived.
The majority.
Never ever survived.
The CROC.

1430
01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:13.360
Just comes up,
takes them underwater and gone.
Uh,
it was,
it was,

1431
01:23:13.810 --> 01:23:17.780
and they live with that every single day of their lives.
It's a,
you know,
those,

1432
01:23:17.781 --> 01:23:20.130
those animals,
Cox,
uh,
you know,

1433
01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:24.100
I actually don't feel much compassion for crocs.

1434
01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:26.890
I just think they're too primitive.
You know,

1435
01:23:26.891 --> 01:23:29.890
they haven't changed in 250 million years.
They were here,
they are dinosaurs.

1436
01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:34.330
They are dinosaurs.
And you see a 15 foot crock come out of the water.

1437
01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:39.310
It is a sight to behold.
Frightening.
And you've seen them in real life.

1438
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:41.690
Yo,
I shot one here.
Just uh,
yeah,

1439
01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:45.970
two weeks ago and we autopsy that there was a shirt inside it.

1440
01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.020
They found her.
Yeah,
they found,

1441
01:23:48.021 --> 01:23:50.050
now I don't know if it actually eight somebody cause you don't know.

1442
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.700
But they found one KROC had six flip flops in it and you know,

1443
01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:57.340
but we never did get the one that got the,
uh,
the young girl,

1444
01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:02.280
<v 0>six flip flops inside of it.
So most likely it's been eating.
People don't know.</v>

1445
01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:02.910
Don't know.
Right.

1446
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:06.580
You don't know either that or it's a really dumb crock that has a thing for flip

1447
01:24:06.581 --> 01:24:08.080
flops floating down the Zambezi river.

1448
01:24:08.081 --> 01:24:12.000
It's more likely it's getting people I'd say so.
Yeah.
Yeah,
they are there.

1449
01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:17.130
200 people in a 10 mile stretch were killed in the last year.
Two years.
Wow.

1450
01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.610
So that's almost a person that day.
Yeah,
the Oh,
it absolutely is.

1451
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:25.140
That's incredible.
Yeah.
It's a,
anyway,
that,
that's all part of uncharted.

1452
01:24:25.141 --> 01:24:27.540
That's what we were there.
It was helping us.
These villagers,

1453
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:31.170
and this is an episode obviously you just shot.
So it's in the cat.
No,

1454
01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.540
it'll come out in 2015.
How many of them are you doing?

1455
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.660
<v 1>We do a 13 one hour episodes a year,</v>

1456
01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:41.230
so we have to do 13 in the course of a year.

1457
01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.990
And you still doing your other hunting show is dot yeah.
Hunting adventures.
Yeah.

1458
01:24:43.991 --> 01:24:48.110
We do 26 half hour episodes of that,
but that I have helped cause Evy,
uh,

1459
01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.470
our daughters,
you know,
she's helping me coast at and,

1460
01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:54.160
and sometimes we'll do the opening side of things where we're guiding other

1461
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:57.580
hunters.
So I don't necessarily have to be on camera for this.

1462
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.731
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1463
01:24:58.731 --> 01:25:01.340
And it's just kind of synchronicity that your daughter's in the news today and

1464
01:25:01.341 --> 01:25:05.960
she was on Fox and friends this morning defending this a bear kill because this,

1465
01:25:05.961 --> 01:25:06.710
um,

1466
01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:10.430
she put a Facebook post up and Steve Rinella has a very interesting take on all

1467
01:25:10.431 --> 01:25:11.900
this stuff.
There's the,
uh,

1468
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.520
there's the picture of her with an enormous bear from North Carolina giant 510

1469
01:25:16.521 --> 01:25:17.540
pounds.
We can't play that,

1470
01:25:17.541 --> 01:25:20.810
but there's probably some better photos that there's a picture of her holding

1471
01:25:20.811 --> 01:25:24.860
onto the bear's head.
Um,
I think it's from Facebook.
They could fine,

1472
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:26.310
but,
um,

1473
01:25:26.690 --> 01:25:30.830
Rinella has an interesting take on it that I think really holds a lot of weight.

1474
01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:35.330
And what he's saying is that a lot of what you're getting from these people that

1475
01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:39.620
are getting upset at,
uh,
these women posing with these bears is sexism.

1476
01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:43.790
That if it was a man posing with that band Facebook,

1477
01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:46.610
it wouldn't get nearly as much press or nearly as much interest.

1478
01:25:46.611 --> 01:25:50.870
He was a fat old,
bald man that had this date,
this dead bear.
They'd be like,

1479
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:53.330
asshole hunter,
and that'd be the end of it.

1480
01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:57.770
But because of the fact that she's a young,
pretty woman,
they're attacking her.

1481
01:25:58.490 --> 01:26:02.200
I mean,
look at the size of that bear.
My God,
it's like a grizzly.
Uh,

1482
01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.670
it's a bigger,
most grizzlies,
it's enormous.

1483
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:08.810
<v 1>North Carolina has the biggest bears,
black bears in North America.
Really?</v>

1484
01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.310
The other huge,
how big is that about?
Hers was 510 pounds.

1485
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:15.560
Yeah.
Giant giant bears.

1486
01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:16.773
<v 3>Wow.</v>

1487
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:21.550
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
when I,
I mean,
Steve is right.
Absolutely.
It is sexist.</v>

1488
01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:24.400
But I think the reason that there,

1489
01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.560
there's such the Vitrail from these animal rights people is that they are scared

1490
01:26:29.561 --> 01:26:33.700
to death about this as being the image of hunting the new image.
You know,

1491
01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:37.980
it's easy to stereotype.
You know,
me,
I'm,
go ahead.
You know,

1492
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:41.740
I am what I am.
Right.
You know,
and it's easy to stereotype.
You know,

1493
01:26:41.741 --> 01:26:44.370
that that big slovenly hunter that,
you know,

1494
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:48.670
swells beer and shoots out the truck window,
it's very difficult.

1495
01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:51.610
What do you do with that?
Right.
Would he do with a young,

1496
01:26:51.611 --> 01:26:55.480
beautiful smile on her face?
They are scared to death.

1497
01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.880
They're scared to death of the,
this,

1498
01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:02.110
this impact because the women prior to this generation,

1499
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:04.060
very,
very few of them hunted.

1500
01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.870
Now it's the fastest growing component of the hunting side of the world that

1501
01:27:08.230 --> 01:27:12.030
they,
uh,
I talked to the guys at bass pro shops,

1502
01:27:12.031 --> 01:27:16.990
Johnny Morris and he said 10 years ago,
3% of their customers were female.

1503
01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:21.960
Today it's 30%.
So this is the fastest rising part of our,

1504
01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:26.620
our industry.
The hunting industry is the female component,
the animal rights.

1505
01:27:26.621 --> 01:27:31.020
People look at this and go,
how do you battle that?
How do you battle that?
You,

1506
01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:35.080
she's a beautiful young lady,
articulate.
She,
you know,

1507
01:27:35.081 --> 01:27:37.960
she's not a a red neck lote,
which,
you know,

1508
01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.130
I mean you can cheap shot me for that,
but you can't cheap shot her for that.

1509
01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.870
She's got a degree from a university.
She and she hunts and she's,

1510
01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:49.750
she's beautiful and pure and her reasons for hunting

1511
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:52.950
<v 3>well did,
the other thing that was really disgusting was on Facebook people,</v>

1512
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:56.950
they were,
they were telling,
they were saying horrible things about her,

1513
01:27:56.951 --> 01:28:00.010
but they were also saying horrible things about killing her dog.

1514
01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.610
Are you an animal lover or would you just the hair evil person.

1515
01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:10.180
She did a fantastic job on that.
Fox and friends,
by the way,

1516
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:12.790
because if you didn't know that she was a hunter,

1517
01:28:12.850 --> 01:28:15.820
you would think she's some news correspondent or something.
She comes off,

1518
01:28:15.821 --> 01:28:17.830
she's very articulate,
very well spoken.

1519
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:21.240
She's not overly emotional.
She's too,

1520
01:28:21.241 --> 01:28:24.100
she doesn't distort the reality of the situation.

1521
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.190
She's just talking about in a very clear,
concise way,

1522
01:28:27.191 --> 01:28:29.170
which is pretty remarkable for a young girl.

1523
01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.970
<v 1>Yeah.
She,
uh,
she,
Evie is a very special young lady,
you know,</v>

1524
01:28:33.971 --> 01:28:36.850
uh,
her mother and I,
Louisiana actually,

1525
01:28:36.851 --> 01:28:40.960
that's our be our 30th anniversary here in another few days.
Very,

1526
01:28:40.961 --> 01:28:45.820
very proud of a baby.
Um,
you know,
that's a tough thing to sit.
You know,
she's,

1527
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:51.160
I'm,
I've,
I'm prepared to fight that battle,
you know?
I mean,
I,
you know,

1528
01:28:51.161 --> 01:28:55.660
I'm a warrior for this stuff.
Go ahead,
bring it on.
You want to argue,
debate,

1529
01:28:55.661 --> 01:28:59.650
what do you,
what basis religious,
cultural,
you know,
family.

1530
01:28:59.651 --> 01:29:02.310
How do you want to talk about this biologically?
I can find,
I can,

1531
01:29:02.311 --> 01:29:03.300
I'll argue with you.

1532
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:07.020
Evie is a young lady who's just do it because she loves to hunt and she knows

1533
01:29:07.021 --> 01:29:08.220
it's good for conservation,

1534
01:29:08.221 --> 01:29:11.700
good for the animals in Long Island and she loves to hunt,
you know,

1535
01:29:11.701 --> 01:29:12.534
pure and simple.

1536
01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.050
And it's a tough thing to be thrown in front of a national television camera and

1537
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:20.820
asked hard questions about it.
And so we're,
yeah,
we're very proud of her.
And I,

1538
01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:24.670
you know,
hard to say where this all ends up,
but,

1539
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.830
but I know one thing that the animal rights people are,
and,
and uh,
you know,

1540
01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:32.670
the majority of the people or the 80% in the middle,
10% hunt,
10% hate it.

1541
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:36.690
80% of the people are riding the fence swinging one way or another depending on

1542
01:29:36.691 --> 01:29:41.110
what they hear or learn.
But for the most part,
if you educate them there,

1543
01:29:41.150 --> 01:29:44.640
there is only one logical answer,
one logical way.

1544
01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:48.320
This whole thing can be played out.
Hunting is good period.
You know,

1545
01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:53.280
he may not want to do it yourself.
That's fair enough.
But slamming hunters.

1546
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:57.960
In fact,
you know,
Evy made a mention of it on her,
uh,
on the Fox and friends.
If,

1547
01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:00.750
uh,
or maybe it was on the blaze,
I think on the Internet,

1548
01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:06.380
if every dollar that people donate to organizations that try and stop hunting or

1549
01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:11.430
actually aiding and abetting the poaching and the decimation of our wildlife

1550
01:30:11.431 --> 01:30:15.150
around the world.
Now that's a weird thing for people to,

1551
01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.640
to computer and their brand.
How does that work?
Well they,

1552
01:30:17.641 --> 01:30:22.410
if if in a place like lists lists,
let's pick a,
the Serengeti Park for instance,

1553
01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.480
Serengeti is,
and I,
you know,

1554
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:27.750
go off continent cause this is an easy one to use as,
as a,
as an example,

1555
01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:33.290
the Serengeti Park is this huge area that wildlife essentially is protected by

1556
01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:38.310
dollars from tourism,
tourism being photo safaris,

1557
01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:44.060
photo safaris,
photo safaris essentially.
But it's only that area.
But the,

1558
01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:47.100
the wildlife of the Serengeti isn't just,

1559
01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:52.260
isn't just in the Serengeti.
It's,
it's,
uh,
crosses the borders.

1560
01:30:52.261 --> 01:30:54.690
It's outside of that.
There's,
you know,
less and less animals.

1561
01:30:54.691 --> 01:30:57.920
The further away you get because there's more and more people coming in.

1562
01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:58.890
This is in Tanzania.

1563
01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:03.390
So what they've done is they've created border hunting areas.
And this,

1564
01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:06.330
this is what the government in,
in full,
you know,

1565
01:31:06.331 --> 01:31:10.610
recognition of the value of hunting as a conservation tool.
They have the,

1566
01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:11.550
and now a buffer,

1567
01:31:11.551 --> 01:31:16.551
a huge buffer that's thous tens of thousands of miles where hunting dollars are

1568
01:31:17.341 --> 01:31:21.000
the only thing that financed the protection of those animals.
Now,

1569
01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:23.720
if the animal rights guys,
or if,

1570
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:28.140
if the animal rights people convince Joe Blow public,
you know,

1571
01:31:28.141 --> 01:31:31.320
somebody sitting in their apartment in New York City that you'll donate your

1572
01:31:31.321 --> 01:31:33.240
money,
this will stop hunting.
You'll,

1573
01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:37.200
you'll stop those bad hunters from killing the animals,
what they're doing.

1574
01:31:37.201 --> 01:31:40.200
And then those guys,
they have the money.
They go in there and they,
you know,

1575
01:31:40.201 --> 01:31:43.770
they uh,
rally the forces.
They,
they,
uh,

1576
01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.950
convinced the government that all you've got to stop hunting if they get the

1577
01:31:46.951 --> 01:31:51.120
World Bank behind them are some very wealthy,
prominent people to support it.

1578
01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:55.950
Suddenly they stopped hunting.
Now what happens at that point?
They stop hunting.

1579
01:31:55.951 --> 01:31:59.010
Kenya,
here's an example.
Kenya.
They stopped hunting in [inaudible] 72,

1580
01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:01.900
the animals are,
are decimated outside of these parks.

1581
01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:04.120
There's nothing left in Tanzania.

1582
01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:07.960
There's still animals outside of the parks because of hunting.
You stop hunting.

1583
01:32:07.961 --> 01:32:10.540
So those dollars go into an anti hunting organization.

1584
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:13.780
They go their lobby over those in,
in those foreign countries,

1585
01:32:13.781 --> 01:32:17.770
and you can buy just one.
Anything over there.
They buy support.
Not,

1586
01:32:17.771 --> 01:32:20.590
not saying that's how they do it every single time,
but it does happen.

1587
01:32:21.190 --> 01:32:23.500
They stop hunting,
no more hunting there.

1588
01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:27.130
So all those animals outside of the park are protected now by who?

1589
01:32:27.370 --> 01:32:30.970
Who's paying for the anti poaching patrols to go around the border?

1590
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:35.950
Nobody,
there's no money.
There's no economics.
They add.
So what happens,

1591
01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:38.860
the poachers come in like a tidal wave,

1592
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:43.510
wipe out all the animals and the next boundary they're going to cross it are the

1593
01:32:43.511 --> 01:32:48.190
parks.
So essentially the money that these people are donating to,

1594
01:32:48.191 --> 01:32:53.080
the anti hunting organizations are aiding of betting that the,
the criminals,

1595
01:32:53.081 --> 01:32:57.470
the poachers to decimate the wildlife populations.
It's a weird thing,
but it's,

1596
01:32:57.471 --> 01:33:01.240
it's counterintuitive,
but it's,
it is a fact.
It is a reality.

1597
01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:04.510
Hunting dollars are the only thing that are protecting those animals in those

1598
01:33:04.511 --> 01:33:07.450
areas like the mass while areas it works.

1599
01:33:07.690 --> 01:33:09.880
It's a model that works and it can work all over the

1600
01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:13.590
<v 0>world.
Isn't that just Africa though?
I mean,
how does that apply in America?</v>

1601
01:33:13.591 --> 01:33:16.770
I mean the punch of the poaching issues not nearly as large in America.

1602
01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:19.880
<v 1>No,
it's,
it's not,
it's not a poaching,
but its habitat loss.
You,</v>

1603
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:22.280
you have to look at it as,
as you know,

1604
01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:27.330
poaching is a guy with a snare or a set gun or a leg hold trop.

1605
01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:29.680
But while they,

1606
01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:34.570
or habitat loss is by far and away the greatest danger the wildlife faces here

1607
01:33:34.571 --> 01:33:38.680
in North America,
so you've got to have that wildlife land set aside for them.

1608
01:33:38.681 --> 01:33:42.590
Now it's a luxury in our world to be able to say,
here,

1609
01:33:42.591 --> 01:33:45.130
we're going to have this as a park,
and this,
you know,
no hunting in this area.

1610
01:33:45.131 --> 01:33:48.250
There's a corridors.
It's a luxury.
So right now,

1611
01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:51.940
maybe it's not quite quite as important as it would be over in Africa.

1612
01:33:51.941 --> 01:33:56.230
There it's a war.
I mean,
it is literally a war in wildlife over there.
Over here,

1613
01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:59.080
it's not as important,
but we still can never,

1614
01:33:59.470 --> 01:34:04.470
never let our guards down because there's always a push.

1615
01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:08.740
Humanity is going to push those,
those animals out of that habitat.

1616
01:34:08.890 --> 01:34:11.890
You're talking about it in Jersey.
Wah.
Why are the bears there?
Well,

1617
01:34:11.891 --> 01:34:16.090
because there's not enough space for the number of bears outside of the city.

1618
01:34:16.091 --> 01:34:18.190
So they're moving into the cities.
When it doesn't work,

1619
01:34:18.191 --> 01:34:21.970
they're going to kill the bears.
So we have to,
okay,
then let's make buffer zones.

1620
01:34:21.971 --> 01:34:26.490
Let's do it.
We can list,
let's get more area for these bears.
You know,

1621
01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.890
let's not put subdivision over there.
Let's let the animals live there.

1622
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:32.290
But if we're not going to put a subdivision there,

1623
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:36.220
that's going to cost somebody some money.
So,
okay,
how do we buy that land?
Well,

1624
01:34:36.221 --> 01:34:39.820
you can do it with taxpayer dollars and just print money or you can actually do

1625
01:34:39.821 --> 01:34:41.920
it in a revenue based,
uh,

1626
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:46.060
concept or model where the animals get the money through the hunting and they

1627
01:34:46.061 --> 01:34:49.480
can buy back that land or on behalf of them,
we can buy back the land.

1628
01:34:49.481 --> 01:34:50.314
The habitat.

1629
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.440
<v 0>One of the big controversies when it comes to Africa as the high fence hunting</v>

1630
01:34:53.441 --> 01:34:57.740
operations,
it's a very,
very contentious issue.

1631
01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.620
<v 3>These areas where they fenced off these large tracks of land and the only reason</v>

1632
01:35:03.621 --> 01:35:07.190
why they've done it is so that these wild animals can live inside and people

1633
01:35:07.191 --> 01:35:08.090
show up and they pay,

1634
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:12.170
pay a lot of money and they go in and hunt does pros and cons.
The pros being,

1635
01:35:12.171 --> 01:35:12.590
of course,

1636
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:15.770
the animals or the exists in much higher numbers than they ever have in the
past.

1637
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:18.680
Animals that were on the verge of extinction and now flourishing,

1638
01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:22.550
they have massive populations and the reason being is because they're a valuable

1639
01:35:22.551 --> 01:35:26.930
resource now.
But people have an issue with that high fence thing.

1640
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:30.230
The fact that they're all trapped in this area and then they can't get out,

1641
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:32.720
even if it's 10,000,
a hundred thousand acres,

1642
01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:37.820
it's still kind of bugs people that you're hunting essentially in a fenced in

1643
01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:40.700
backyard or park.
That's the,
that's the idea behind it.

1644
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:45.080
<v 1>Yeah.
That's a far more complicated issue.</v>

1645
01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.870
I heard you and Steve Vernella talking about it actually,
and it's,

1646
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:52.910
you have to be their feet on the ground to get a real grasp of what the

1647
01:35:52.911 --> 01:35:57.020
situation is.
And,
and,
and even,
even on a philosophical basis,

1648
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:59.660
it's,
it's far more complicated than,

1649
01:35:59.661 --> 01:36:03.650
than just animals are trapped inside a big area and the hunter is going to kill

1650
01:36:03.651 --> 01:36:07.130
him.
Um,
as a,
for instance,
and,
and I,
you know,
I,

1651
01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:11.360
I was actually asked to do a,
uh,
uh,
I used to write,

1652
01:36:11.361 --> 01:36:12.830
that's how I started in the outdoor industry.

1653
01:36:12.831 --> 01:36:16.640
I wrote magazine articles and I was asked to do the con side of,

1654
01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:21.200
of high fence hunting,
which I was no problem doing because I didn't believe in,

1655
01:36:21.201 --> 01:36:25.020
and I thought it was a bad thing.
And I,
and I did it,
but you know,
I,

1656
01:36:25.021 --> 01:36:28.130
and I received death threats from the,
the guys that do the game farms.
So they,

1657
01:36:28.131 --> 01:36:32.900
you know,
they,
they were very unhappy with the version I took of it.
Uh,
but,

1658
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:36.530
but it was an assignment.
But what I did on the assignment afterwards,

1659
01:36:36.531 --> 01:36:38.450
I started looking,
well,
you know,
maybe there is something,

1660
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:42.800
maybe there is another way to look at this.
And,
and I mean,
I'll,

1661
01:36:42.810 --> 01:36:45.620
I'll adjust this whole thing if you wanted,
if it will start right off the bat.

1662
01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:50.560
Okay.
You've got say a patch of 10,000 acres,
you know that,

1663
01:36:50.561 --> 01:36:55.100
that's a big area.
You know,
it's,
it's more than 10 square miles.
Um,
it,

1664
01:36:55.290 --> 01:36:56.150
it's a big area.

1665
01:36:56.990 --> 01:37:00.920
If the animal that you're hunting has a home range of,
say,

1666
01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.430
one square mile,
that means he never would have been outside that fence,

1667
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:08.090
whether it was there or not.
And I'm not standing up for high fence hunting.

1668
01:37:08.091 --> 01:37:12.320
I'm just giving you a,
I'm objective.
Yeah.
I'm looking at it from the other side.

1669
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:17.210
If,
if that animal has a home range in one square mile,

1670
01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.920
then you know,
is it really inside the fence if it never hits that boundary.

1671
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:25.340
Now my argument on the other side was,
okay,
well if I want that animal,

1672
01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:28.910
I'm going to bulldoze that entire 10,000 acres.
I will get it.
Can't get away.

1673
01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:30.560
Okay,
got you.
On that one.

1674
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:35.480
What if you're only allowed to hunt in one square mile of that 10,000 square

1675
01:37:35.481 --> 01:37:37.040
acres,
right?

1676
01:37:37.041 --> 01:37:40.310
Is that now is that hunting because the animal street to go outside of your

1677
01:37:40.311 --> 01:37:44.000
little one mile,
but you're only allowed to hunt in that one mile.
Right?
So now,

1678
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:46.220
yet,
can't get out of the 10,000 acres,

1679
01:37:46.221 --> 01:37:48.260
but it can sure as heck get away from you as a hunter.

1680
01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:53.000
So there's another way it said another gray area.
What if there's one,
if there's,

1681
01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:57.330
you know the,
you know they say high fence,
but high fences,

1682
01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:02.130
an eight foot high fence usually with electric wire around it and page wire or

1683
01:38:02.131 --> 01:38:06.930
you know,
they call it Jocko wire along the bottom.
What if it's a low fence?

1684
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:11.790
Is that okay?
You know,
does a hunter that hates high fat high fence hunting,

1685
01:38:11.791 --> 01:38:15.450
would he say it's okay to hunt in a low fence?
It's four feet high.

1686
01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:20.070
Most animals can jump over it.
But what about the ones that can't,
you know,

1687
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:24.030
it's just as effective as a high fence.
Bonta Buck,
you know,

1688
01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:28.760
there's animal in in Africa that can't jump over a fence or a springbok.

1689
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:31.080
They don't jump over fences.
They'll try and go through it.

1690
01:38:31.081 --> 01:38:33.660
But if there's a jackal fence along the bottom of that four foot fence,

1691
01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:35.310
they won't go through it.
So they're just as,

1692
01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:40.640
they're just as kept inside a certain range as those animals inside the high

1693
01:38:40.981 --> 01:38:42.360
fence.
So,

1694
01:38:42.361 --> 01:38:46.080
but with the guys that have this huge hate of the high fence,

1695
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:48.480
they'd have no problem honey and low fence.

1696
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:51.210
But the animal still just kept in there,
can't get out.

1697
01:38:51.210 --> 01:38:55.260
No animals like eland and Kudu,
they'll go over it.
Right.
The other,

1698
01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:59.340
the other flip side to that is those fences that they built in Africa,

1699
01:38:59.341 --> 01:39:04.341
we're not to keep the game animals in there to keep people out.

1700
01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:10.610
And to say that it was only for hunting isn't true either because a lot of them

1701
01:39:11.161 --> 01:39:12.810
make their living with photo safaris.

1702
01:39:13.110 --> 01:39:17.160
Now as the animal's multiply inside those high fences,
what do you have?

1703
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:19.500
You have the same situations of bears in New Jersey.

1704
01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:21.930
You've got to go manage that hurt.
So now,

1705
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:26.400
now after a couple of generations of this high fence ranching and in southern

1706
01:39:26.401 --> 01:39:29.340
Africa,
even the photo safari places,

1707
01:39:29.370 --> 01:39:32.730
they're adamant about against hunting,
they're realizing,
oh,

1708
01:39:32.731 --> 01:39:35.580
we're going to go in there and call these animals.
Something has to be done.

1709
01:39:35.581 --> 01:39:37.530
There's too many animals inside these fences.

1710
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:39.990
So what they've actually started doing over there,

1711
01:39:39.991 --> 01:39:42.870
and again this is fairly new developments in Africa,

1712
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:47.820
they're starting to build these conservancies where you had a 10,000 acre patch

1713
01:39:47.821 --> 01:39:49.590
here that was high fenced rate against it,

1714
01:39:49.591 --> 01:39:54.000
a 50,000 redgate's at another 10,000 another 20,000 and they were all high

1715
01:39:54.001 --> 01:39:55.350
fenced other shared fences.

1716
01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:57.630
What they're doing now is they're removing all the fences.

1717
01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.360
They have enough area and these conservancies,
you know,

1718
01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:04.320
500,000 acres with no fence around the outside.

1719
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.250
So essentially the good of the high fences,

1720
01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:11.580
whether you agree with hunting inside the high fences are not the good.

1721
01:40:11.581 --> 01:40:15.690
The benefit is now years later the fences are all down and in those

1722
01:40:15.691 --> 01:40:18.690
conservancies there's no fences on the outside.

1723
01:40:18.691 --> 01:40:22.800
So you're hunting wildlife that would not have been there except for the high

1724
01:40:22.801 --> 01:40:27.180
fences.
So again,
I've,
you know,
I've taken the,
no,
not the pro side.
Cause do I,

1725
01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:32.250
do I enjoy hunting inside of high fence?
Will,
you know,
to me,

1726
01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:34.740
I get to hunt in the Himalayas,
you know,

1727
01:40:34.741 --> 01:40:37.760
I get down to the rocky mountains and we're spoiled over here.
You know,

1728
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:41.630
we have that,
you know what I would I go into a,

1729
01:40:42.670 --> 01:40:46.710
you know,
a thousand acres and shoot a big deer?
No,
it would be nothing to me.

1730
01:40:46.711 --> 01:40:49.890
It would,
it would be like,
I wouldn't go shoot a cow or wouldn't want someplace.

1731
01:40:49.891 --> 01:40:53.920
It's not even a thousand.
I mean,
Ted Nugent has like a 200 acre ranch

1732
01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:56.020
<v 2>and his show,</v>

1733
01:40:56.021 --> 01:41:00.010
a good percentage of his show was him sitting in a tree in his backyard shooting

1734
01:41:00.011 --> 01:41:04.810
these animals that live in his yard have a pile of corn.
I can't,

1735
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:08.910
I don't know how big Ted's ranches,
it's only a few hundred acres.
I,

1736
01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:14.160
but I do know one thing that Ted is as an oat sport at outspoken proponent of

1737
01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:16.630
hunting and,
and the right to bear arms.

1738
01:41:17.230 --> 01:41:20.920
I don't know anybody that reaches more people that was messages,
you know,

1739
01:41:20.921 --> 01:41:24.010
it's Ted,
it's all ted is pure Ted.
But if you read his books,

1740
01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:28.330
a lot of it is just common sense on steroids,
you know?
And that,
that's,

1741
01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.790
that's Ted.
So I,
you know,
I won't,
I mean,

1742
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.190
I appreciate that he'll stand up there and fight our battles.

1743
01:41:33.191 --> 01:41:34.750
I don't think there's anything wrong with what he's doing.

1744
01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:37.970
Let me clarify the fact that he's hunting these animals in his,

1745
01:41:37.971 --> 01:41:41.560
his own piece of property.
I think it's a great way to acquire,

1746
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:45.050
meet if that's what he wants to do.
And if he needs to manage his hurt.
And,

1747
01:41:45.051 --> 01:41:48.460
and I know he donates a lot of the food to a hundred hunters for the hungry.

1748
01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:50.740
I know that nothing goes to waste.
Nothing.

1749
01:41:50.741 --> 01:41:55.240
Absolutely nothing wrong with never way better than farming or then you know,

1750
01:41:55.241 --> 01:41:58.390
having some animal to corral that you just fattening up and you mentioned the

1751
01:41:58.391 --> 01:42:01.060
going to shoot him in the head.
I mean it's,
it's way better.
These are,

1752
01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:05.530
these animals are essentially living a wild life in a contained area and then he

1753
01:42:05.531 --> 01:42:06.364
shoots him.

1754
01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:09.500
I don't even have a problem with him leaving out food for them and then shooting

1755
01:42:09.501 --> 01:42:10.420
them off a bait piles.

1756
01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:13.330
I mean it's an effective way to make sure that you have a clear shot.

1757
01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.370
I think he's got really bad knees anyway.

1758
01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:19.210
I don't think he can like go hiking up into the hills and go looking for him or

1759
01:42:19.211 --> 01:42:23.590
anything.
I know I've seen him perform.
He's a,
if he's got bad knees,

1760
01:42:23.591 --> 01:42:26.590
he hides the pain.
Well,
he's a,
he's an amazing performer.

1761
01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.520
Well my friend Ben O'brian was telling me about how I went to see Ted Nugent

1762
01:42:30.521 --> 01:42:34.030
backstage.
He's got ice on his knee,
just got done with knee surgery.
He looks at,

1763
01:42:34.031 --> 01:42:37.570
he's in a wreck.
He goes on stage and just hammered.
It goes crazy.

1764
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:40.240
It's jumping around like a 20 year old man.
Yeah,
he's,

1765
01:42:40.241 --> 01:42:44.700
he's a fucking pro and hard worker and a minute he's,
yeah,
he's,
he's,

1766
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:47.500
he's on our side.
Yeah.
He's crazy as hell.

1767
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:51.250
But a lot of what he says has merit.
You know,

1768
01:42:51.251 --> 01:42:53.670
a lot of what he says when it comes to hunting and conservation as metal.

1769
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.600
But one of the times he's almost his own worst enemy with is all the Yahoo Gonzo

1770
01:42:58.601 --> 01:42:59.730
stuff that he,
it's,

1771
01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:04.750
he takes it so far and like threatening the president and all that shit when

1772
01:43:04.751 --> 01:43:06.950
they had a visit them with the secret service and go,
come on line.

1773
01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:10.180
He can't say stuff like that.
Like what are you doing?
Yeah,
he runs at a,

1774
01:43:10.181 --> 01:43:11.980
at a high speed.

1775
01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:17.080
He runs at a high speed and you know,
sometimes it trip.
Yeah.

1776
01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:21.000
So if you're going to run that speed.
Exactly right.
And that's,
you know,
you were,

1777
01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:25.180
we'll all sit there and countenance every word before.
Say It,
you know,
ted,

1778
01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:26.163
you know that he's,

1779
01:43:26.890 --> 01:43:30.340
he's just at a speed that my brain doesn't work that fast without care.

1780
01:43:30.341 --> 01:43:33.550
Who's made it is eventually,
like you say,
you're going to trip.
Well,

1781
01:43:33.551 --> 01:43:37.030
he also has some preprogrammed sentences that are ready to go.

1782
01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.630
He could just press play,
you know,
and just drop of a hat.

1783
01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:43.210
He can say spiritual back straps and all this,
you know,

1784
01:43:43.211 --> 01:43:47.320
he has all these things that he'll say the drop of a hat professionals,

1785
01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:50.280
but doing it for 40 years.
So,
exactly.
You know,
after 40 years if you,

1786
01:43:50.281 --> 01:43:52.400
if you don't have that and,

1787
01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:57.420
<v 0>or he's also been defending hunting in the public eye long before it was</v>

1788
01:43:57.421 --> 01:43:58.160
fashionable.

1789
01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:02.990
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
And he's debated like,
I've,
I've seen him debate.
Uh,
I don't know,
again,</v>

1790
01:44:02.991 --> 01:44:07.700
I don't know the TV guys,
but one of those talky guys and,
and masterful,

1791
01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:11.330
masterful,
I mean,
he's just bang on and what he's saying now,

1792
01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.370
sometimes when he says it is a little harsh,
I mean it's,
it might be not,
not,
uh,

1793
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:20.370
family friendly,
but it's,
you know,
it's Ted.
Ted.
Yeah.

1794
01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:23.470
<v 0>Well did you see him debate Pierce Morgan?
I never saw that.</v>

1795
01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:28.650
A little trial because he knew all the actual facts about gun deaths.

1796
01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:29.950
He's like,
do you understand that the,

1797
01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:34.360
the numbers that you're quoting also involve cops shooting bad guys?
Like you,

1798
01:44:34.361 --> 01:44:36.020
you're,
you're adding that in.
Do you know?

1799
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:39.570
And Morgan didn't know for Pierce Morgan,
he's,
he doesn't know anything.

1800
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:41.430
It's just he sees some numbers.

1801
01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.250
He's got them written down and he tries to throw them out there.

1802
01:44:44.251 --> 01:44:47.610
But new Jen has a deep understanding of what those numbers actually entail and

1803
01:44:47.611 --> 01:44:50.190
where they come from and what's really at the root of it all.

1804
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:53.400
<v 1>Sure.
Yeah.
And you can't argue with that.
And he's a,
he's a brilliant guy.</v>

1805
01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:57.900
He's brilliant.
So he's definitely not dummy.
No,
no.
So He's just crazy.

1806
01:44:58.310 --> 01:45:00.860
<v 0>Yeah.
He's fucking Ted Dude.
It was crazy.
Crazy.</v>

1807
01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:04.940
Like a Fox Wango tango cat scratch fever.
I mean,
that's who he is.

1808
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:08.200
Cat scratch fever.
I mean,
I grew up with this.
That's my,
a stranglehold,

1809
01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:12.890
one of my favorite workout music songs ever.
Um,
but you know,
the,

1810
01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:17.960
the,
the,
what I think is necessary today,
um,

1811
01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:22.310
when it comes to like a,
a modern face of what,
what hunting is,

1812
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:26.630
is guys like you guys like you guys like Cam Haynes,

1813
01:45:26.631 --> 01:45:28.310
guys like Steve Rinella,

1814
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:33.430
people who when you sit down and have a conversation with them and you realize

1815
01:45:34.611 --> 01:45:37.100
where they're coming from,
Pete,
people can,

1816
01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:41.350
are going to be able to relate to the message in a way that I don't think they,

1817
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:45.020
I think it's too easy to marginalize someone like Ted,
unfortunately.

1818
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:48.800
<v 1>Yeah.
Well,
I,
I don't disagree with that,
but,
but by the same token,</v>

1819
01:45:48.801 --> 01:45:51.320
he reaches more people than any of us do.
I mean,
you know,

1820
01:45:51.321 --> 01:45:54.980
we're reaching people today.
It's thanks to you and I mean,
this is why I'm here.

1821
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:58.700
You're,
you're doing great work.
I mean,
you're,
you're putting yourself out there.

1822
01:45:58.701 --> 01:46:01.250
This is definitely not an anti hunting show.

1823
01:46:01.251 --> 01:46:06.170
You're not following the masses on this year.
You are reaching out and saying,

1824
01:46:06.171 --> 01:46:09.110
Hey,
this is something you want to think about.
So you know,

1825
01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:12.100
you're making a big difference.
Ted makes a difference in his own way.

1826
01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:15.280
<v 0>Nope.
No question.
No question.
All,
I mean not putting them down.
Um,</v>

1827
01:46:16.810 --> 01:46:19.210
I'm not putting myself out there though.
I mean,
I kind of am,

1828
01:46:19.211 --> 01:46:22.780
but I'm not because all the other thing I'm,
I'm so easy to marginalize already.

1829
01:46:22.781 --> 01:46:26.170
I'm a cage fighting commentator,
you know,
by the way,

1830
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:30.310
<v 1>saw you in the UFC 100 I was there.
My son and I,
they were</v>

1831
01:46:30.330 --> 01:46:33.050
<v 0>over the Brock Lesnar fighting.
Yeah,
we were,
we were guests of Brock Lesnar.</v>

1832
01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:37.130
Actually,
I have his gloves after the fight with Frank Mir was blood on them.

1833
01:46:37.131 --> 01:46:41.840
He actually gave them to me after the fight.
Whoa.
Mouthpiece.
Oh yeah.

1834
01:46:41.841 --> 01:46:44.180
He took it out and put it in my pocket while I was interviewing them.

1835
01:46:44.181 --> 01:46:48.980
I still have it.
That was a,
that was amazing.
So I,
I mean,

1836
01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:52.770
I dunno about marginalized.
I think this is two worlds colliding.
In fact,
someone,

1837
01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:57.360
someone a Facebook me today,
I think,
uh,
said that,

1838
01:46:57.361 --> 01:47:00.540
that there are no,
they texted me and said that you are,

1839
01:47:00.541 --> 01:47:02.880
they listened to you when they're going out hunting,
right.

1840
01:47:02.881 --> 01:47:05.790
They're hunters and their UFC.
I don't know what they know about that,

1841
01:47:05.791 --> 01:47:09.960
but they know you and they know that you represent UFC and of course you did the

1842
01:47:09.961 --> 01:47:13.980
fear factor and whatnot in there.
These guys now they saying,
you know,
my world,

1843
01:47:13.981 --> 01:47:17.450
which they also listen to where it's,
it's colliding,
it's perfect for them.
It's,

1844
01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.060
it's,
it's building and reaching more people.

1845
01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:24.030
I definitely think that message is getting out there.

1846
01:47:24.031 --> 01:47:27.990
And I think today people are more concerned now than ever before about where

1847
01:47:27.991 --> 01:47:32.430
their food comes from and about getting to this sort of back to basics idea.

1848
01:47:32.770 --> 01:47:36.060
Um,
people are more concerned with eating grass fed beef.

1849
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:38.910
People are more concerned with eating organic vegetables.

1850
01:47:38.911 --> 01:47:42.840
People are more concerned with taking in quality food and not eating as much

1851
01:47:42.841 --> 01:47:45.120
gluten and processed sugar.
There's,

1852
01:47:45.150 --> 01:47:50.150
there's much more concern now for eating what you would call a holistic diet

1853
01:47:50.850 --> 01:47:51.960
than has ever been before.

1854
01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:56.220
And then when people start thinking about where their food comes from,

1855
01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:00.480
that's what opens the door for hunting.
And then when a show like this comes on,

1856
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:03.030
the difference between this and any other show is it,
first of all,

1857
01:48:03.031 --> 01:48:04.320
it's completely uncensored.

1858
01:48:04.530 --> 01:48:07.320
No one can tell us what to talk about or when not to talk about and we're going

1859
01:48:07.321 --> 01:48:10.650
to talk for as long as we want.
And so if you have a point you don't,

1860
01:48:10.651 --> 01:48:12.450
you don't get cut off by a commercial,

1861
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:15.390
you don't get cut off because it's an uncomfortable subject.

1862
01:48:15.391 --> 01:48:18.360
You don't get cutoff because,
hey,
let's not talk about bears.

1863
01:48:18.361 --> 01:48:21.600
People don't like to hear you hunt bears.
Let's talk about only game animals.

1864
01:48:21.601 --> 01:48:24.810
Let's talk about some ugly.
Let's talk about pigs.
Wild pigs,

1865
01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:27.390
basic good know I'm be has problem with pigs.
I haven't.

1866
01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:31.470
My agent who I love to death,
she's a sweetheart,
she's an,
she loves animals,

1867
01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:35.070
but she's like,
you could hunt pigs because they're ugly checks.
He said,

1868
01:48:35.071 --> 01:48:37.930
that to me
is fair enough.
I mean,

1869
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:42.720
the animal rights people who do they have as as their icons on their posters,

1870
01:48:42.721 --> 01:48:45.690
you know,
polar bear or a tiger or a lion.

1871
01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:49.710
The worst elements in the world to be stuck alone with.
Oh,
there you go.
There.

1872
01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:53.940
And also the ones that need our protection most right now.
Yeah.
Obviously Tigers,

1873
01:48:53.941 --> 01:48:58.200
right?
100% yeah.
There's as many tigers in Texas as there are in the wild.

1874
01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:02.820
That's a sad commentary series and those wild animal parks and people have like,

1875
01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:07.680
those are really crazy rich oil barons have these giant backyards like Mike

1876
01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:10.310
Tyson style,
like a thousand tigers running around.
I mean,

1877
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:14.460
I think it's great that they're doing that because it does protect those animals

1878
01:49:14.490 --> 01:49:17.970
somewhere else outside of their native habitat.
But you know,
it's,

1879
01:49:17.971 --> 01:49:21.570
it's a sad commentary that there's so few tigers left in the,

1880
01:49:21.571 --> 01:49:23.670
in the real world out there and again,

1881
01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:28.020
they are being killed and they're being poached constantly.
Constantly.
Yeah.

1882
01:49:28.021 --> 01:49:31.020
So much so that,
um,
I was in,
I think it was Philadelphia regionally,

1883
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:35.970
there's a big poster at the airport with a tiger's face that it said,

1884
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:39.590
I am not a rug and I put it on my Instagram.
I was like,

1885
01:49:39.591 --> 01:49:43.680
is this isn't really that much of an issue that you have to like,
first of all,

1886
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:46.530
anybody who's going to poach a tiger,
it doesn't give a shit.

1887
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.100
If you put a poster of

1888
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.740
<v 2>it saying,
I'm not a rock,
there's still going to fucking shoot it.</v>

1889
01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:54.190
I don't understand who that's for.
Well,
it's to raise money.

1890
01:49:54.191 --> 01:49:56.650
It takes awareness is to tug on the,

1891
01:49:57.030 --> 01:50:00.960
the sympathy strings of have that little old lady walking down there at the

1892
01:50:00.961 --> 01:50:05.300
airport going,
turning my tigers into rugs.
I mean,
that's terrible.
Look,

1893
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:08.860
hunters aren't,
they haven't hunted taggers and since the colonial days,
I mean,

1894
01:50:08.861 --> 01:50:10.660
since since they left India,

1895
01:50:10.661 --> 01:50:13.600
I don't think there's been a tiger killed legally by a hunter.

1896
01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.670
So it's nothing to do with hunting and they're just,

1897
01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:19.930
they're raising money on our backs as hunters and still using that stereotype

1898
01:50:19.931 --> 01:50:22.660
that yeah,
we kill tigers to make them into rugs,
which we don't,

1899
01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:27.310
you'll poachers do poachers tournament to Aphrodisiacs I dunno.

1900
01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:28.670
Yeah.

1901
01:50:28.670 --> 01:50:33.670
Summary Rhinos to write Rhino Horn know harness is the latest one is what I was

1902
01:50:34.841 --> 01:50:37.000
over in Africa just now with the skeletons of,

1903
01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:40.960
of a alliance for some reason that that's got to,
you know,

1904
01:50:40.961 --> 01:50:45.250
they're on not kick now,
which is don't they know about Viagra?
I mean it's,

1905
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:48.660
you tell him there's,
you can get a lot of Viagara you really don't need to,

1906
01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.730
you don't need to chop off any rhino horn.
You just go to cvs,

1907
01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:56.230
one tiny little pill and you're good.
And this is,
this is probably off color,

1908
01:50:56.231 --> 01:50:59.320
but it begs the question of why do they need so much viagara over there?

1909
01:50:59.321 --> 01:51:03.640
Like what's their problem?
Well,
I think it was before they knew about Viagra.

1910
01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:06.880
I think that's where all this rhino horn,
it became a part of the tradition.

1911
01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:10.450
The animal products from these virile,

1912
01:51:10.451 --> 01:51:15.451
powerful animals were thought of as aphrodisiacs or at least some male

1913
01:51:15.941 --> 01:51:20.180
enhancements and some sort of strange way,
you know,

1914
01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:23.170
the way they do it,
I think it's a status symbol too for them.

1915
01:51:23.171 --> 01:51:27.700
If you have your little tiny sliver of Rhino Horn that you dip into your soup,

1916
01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:28.930
I mean it literally,
that's what they do.

1917
01:51:28.930 --> 01:51:31.780
They'll keep it for years real and just dip it in there.
And that's,

1918
01:51:31.781 --> 01:51:35.950
that gives you this power.
I mean it's,
it's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous.
But,

1919
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.670
but you know,
it's,
it's ridiculous.
But it's happening.

1920
01:51:40.150 --> 01:51:44.770
So the result is you've got 1.3 billion Chinese.

1921
01:51:44.771 --> 01:51:47.170
I'm not saying it's all China,
could be Korea as well.

1922
01:51:47.171 --> 01:51:48.310
Who knows where it's going over there.

1923
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:53.410
There's just not enough rhinos to sustain that kind of a pressure and the prices

1924
01:51:53.411 --> 01:51:55.750
are going through the roof on the horns and,
and that's,

1925
01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:58.120
you got all the social problems in Africa,

1926
01:51:58.121 --> 01:52:00.960
so someone's going to go over and try and kill that Ryan.

1927
01:52:00.961 --> 01:52:03.480
Or even if they're going to be put in jail or shot,
you know,

1928
01:52:03.490 --> 01:52:06.040
by anti poaching teams,
they're going to do it because they get 500 bucks.

1929
01:52:06.041 --> 01:52:06.874
Which hole?

1930
01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:12.660
This is where it brings up a really interesting contradictory issue that rhino

1931
01:52:12.791 --> 01:52:17.350
that was put up for auction by The Dallas Safari Club,
right?

1932
01:52:17.770 --> 01:52:22.660
Huge issue because someone spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this rhino

1933
01:52:22.661 --> 01:52:27.550
hunt to be able to go and hunt this rhino and everybody was so angry.

1934
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.000
What they didn't understand was that that rhino was an old male who was not

1935
01:52:33.761 --> 01:52:36.820
breeding,
who was killing young rhinos.

1936
01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:42.060
He was killing young breeding rhinos and the only way to prevent that was to

1937
01:52:42.341 --> 01:52:46.160
kill him.
And the money that was raised by

1938
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:51.430
<v 0>auctioning off a hunt for this rhino helps in the conservation of the rhinos.</v>

1939
01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.090
That's so difficult to,
it won't unless it's explained to you,

1940
01:52:56.270 --> 01:53:00.710
unless you're deeply immersed in the world of conservation and of hunting as a

1941
01:53:00.711 --> 01:53:03.260
form of conservation,
it seems completely contradict.

1942
01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:08.230
<v 1>Yeah.
It was counterintuitive.
Yes.
How do you kill the animal to save the species?</v>

1943
01:53:08.231 --> 01:53:12.280
Well,
it doesn't make sense.
And by the way,
that was Corey Knowlton who,

1944
01:53:12.281 --> 01:53:16.780
if you watch the uncharted is,
is my sort of teammate on several of the shows.

1945
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:21.370
Um,
and I think the price was 250,000 or 350,000 for that.

1946
01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:26.350
They felt Dell Safari club felt that they would get over $1 million.

1947
01:53:26.351 --> 01:53:27.420
They had people that would have,

1948
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:31.570
would have essentially donated very wealthy people that would have paid this.

1949
01:53:32.190 --> 01:53:33.510
<v 0>Jamie just put up an article,</v>

1950
01:53:33.690 --> 01:53:37.620
feds could force Dallas Hunting Club to scrap the rhino hunt auction to

1951
01:53:37.621 --> 01:53:41.750
$350,000.
Wow.
I haven't seen that test today.

1952
01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:46.380
Whoa.
Last night.
Oh Wow.

1953
01:53:46.410 --> 01:53:47.610
How Apropos.

1954
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:53.070
<v 1>Yeah.
The,
you know,
the US fish and wildlife has,</v>

1955
01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:56.770
they're pretty powerful organization.
They can actually say,
well,

1956
01:53:56.771 --> 01:54:01.570
we're not going to let you import it.
Right.
But they can,
they can't stop an,

1957
01:54:01.590 --> 01:54:04.780
I can't say that they can't even stop that auction from,
you know,

1958
01:54:04.781 --> 01:54:06.280
it's already happened,
but they can't,

1959
01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:09.100
they can't stop it from hunting and because it's in another country,

1960
01:54:09.101 --> 01:54:12.000
but where they can stop,
it's him bringing the animal over after he settled.

1961
01:54:12.130 --> 01:54:15.940
For sure they can stop.
But they also might be able to after the fact,

1962
01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:19.090
say that was not illegal auction.
I don't know.
I've never heard of this.

1963
01:54:19.091 --> 01:54:21.970
This is the first I've seen of that title.
But they do have,
they're,

1964
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.750
they're pretty powerful and they,
you know,
they do some good things and they do,

1965
01:54:25.751 --> 01:54:27.940
they do some things that don't make sense from the hunting side.

1966
01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:28.441
<v 0>They do well,</v>

1967
01:54:28.441 --> 01:54:31.410
they do some things based on political pressure and lots of that political

1968
01:54:31.411 --> 01:54:36.110
pressure is not based on wildlife management biologists recommendations.

1969
01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:36.710
<v 1>Yeah.
The,</v>

1970
01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:41.710
I think they stopped the importation of polar bears again recently after the 72

1971
01:54:42.661 --> 01:54:45.470
marine mammals act.
You know,
then they opened it again.

1972
01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.080
Cause there's so many polar bears up in northern Canada and Canada has

1973
01:54:49.081 --> 01:54:52.320
biologists,
they're smart guys,
they're doctors.
They know what they're doing.
The,

1974
01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:55.320
the communities up in the North or killing those bears anyway.

1975
01:54:55.890 --> 01:54:59.970
So why not have hunters come in and pay $20,000 so that a young one,

1976
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.970
a young female breeding age doesn't get killed but just know board beyond

1977
01:55:02.971 --> 01:55:06.420
breeding age.
So us fish and wildlife for whatever reason,
you know,

1978
01:55:06.421 --> 01:55:08.700
and their wisdom and I,
you know,
I don't know them.
I don't,

1979
01:55:08.701 --> 01:55:11.580
I don't know what pressures they're under to make these decisions,

1980
01:55:11.581 --> 01:55:14.850
but they banned the importation again.
So now you know,

1981
01:55:14.851 --> 01:55:17.220
everyone else in the world is still hunting the polar bears in Canada,

1982
01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:18.293
just not American.

1983
01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:21.740
<v 0>Well,
you can hunt polar bears in Canada,
which you can't bring back.</v>

1984
01:55:21.741 --> 01:55:23.440
The body can import any point of,

1985
01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:25.520
they even know that it was still legal to Honamin Canada.

1986
01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:27.260
I just didn't know till I was up there.

1987
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:30.900
<v 1>Yeah,
absolutely.
A walrus.
Same thing.
Atlantic wall where you can hunt up there,</v>

1988
01:55:30.901 --> 01:55:35.220
but you can't as an American bring them into the states.
Not even a whisker.

1989
01:55:35.290 --> 01:55:37.390
<v 0>Isn't that the same with African elephants?</v>

1990
01:55:37.391 --> 01:55:39.700
Like there's some African elephants that you're allowed to hunt,

1991
01:55:39.701 --> 01:55:44.030
but you can't bring the tusks back there.
They've just shut

1992
01:55:44.110 --> 01:55:49.110
<v 1>down the importation from Zimbabwe and Tanzania recently with both countries</v>

1993
01:55:49.651 --> 01:55:53.920
were until this year allowed,
you know,
can hunt them and bring them back into,

1994
01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:54.780
into the states.

1995
01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:00.080
They still allow the importation from Namibia and South Africa as far as I know.

1996
01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:04.110
Um,
but you know,
Cameroon,
they don't allow it.
Now this is us fish and wildlife.

1997
01:56:04.111 --> 01:56:08.490
It's a,
it's a national centric decision.
It's not a world decision.

1998
01:56:08.491 --> 01:56:12.300
There's sites that convention for the international trade in endangered animals

1999
01:56:12.301 --> 01:56:13.134
or species.

2000
01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:17.730
They control all of that export import around the world.

2001
01:56:17.731 --> 01:56:20.820
And the U S is a signatory to the site.
He's convention.

2002
01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:25.590
So they should listen to what [inaudible] does,
but they don't,
you know,
they,

2003
01:56:25.591 --> 01:56:30.390
they above and beyond that say no side,
he says it's okay,
but we say it's not.

2004
01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:33.360
And again,
I,
I'm not saying that they're right or wrong on that.

2005
01:56:33.361 --> 01:56:37.800
I'm just saying that they are very powerful and sometimes the decisions they

2006
01:56:37.801 --> 01:56:40.140
make as a hunter,
and again,

2007
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:43.920
looking for my little mountain top at this whole objective picture and you know,

2008
01:56:43.921 --> 01:56:48.330
having hunted in Botswana,
you know,
for elephant Cameroon and,
and,
uh,

2009
01:56:48.630 --> 01:56:52.860
Tanzania,
all of these places,
you know,
it's,

2010
01:56:52.930 --> 01:56:57.720
it's was to the detriment of wildlife,
nay to the elephant as near as I can tell.

2011
01:56:58.170 --> 01:57:01.560
So I,
it doesn't make sense how they,
what was their justification?

2012
01:57:01.561 --> 01:57:04.890
I know they shut down the importation of polar bears from Canada because they

2013
01:57:04.891 --> 01:57:09.510
said the potential of,
of,
uh,

2014
01:57:09.511 --> 01:57:11.310
what was it,
uh,
global warming,

2015
01:57:11.610 --> 01:57:15.390
the impact of global warming over the next 50 years,
the potential is there.

2016
01:57:15.391 --> 01:57:19.950
So we're going to shut down.
Importation is just like,
this is reactive,

2017
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:22.710
uh,
management.
It makes no sense.
Well,

2018
01:57:22.711 --> 01:57:25.170
if you pay attention to the stories on global warming,

2019
01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:28.680
most people believe that the polar bears are endangered.
Right now.

2020
01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:33.510
Most people believe that their habitat is being lost at an alarming rate.

2021
01:57:33.511 --> 01:57:35.570
That the ice caps are melting.
The,

2022
01:57:35.890 --> 01:57:39.540
the ice islands that they swim up to are going away.

2023
01:57:39.930 --> 01:57:44.820
If you talk to the average person that is aware of all the new stories on global

2024
01:57:44.821 --> 01:57:47.850
warming and you asked him,
do you think the polar bears endangered?
Oh yes.

2025
01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:51.810
Polar bears and danger.
Those drinking the Koolaid,
they,
you know,

2026
01:57:52.030 --> 01:57:55.590
they're not telling you is that there's the polar bear population is directly

2027
01:57:55.591 --> 01:57:57.780
proportional to the population of ring seals,

2028
01:57:57.781 --> 01:58:02.190
bearded seals and harp seals up there that these animals,

2029
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:04.680
if there's a heavy freeze,

2030
01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:07.140
like say for instance we're going to hit another mini ice age,

2031
01:58:07.290 --> 01:58:11.460
which I'm old enough to remember back in the 60s when all these same scientists

2032
01:58:11.461 --> 01:58:14.530
were predicting ice age coming ice age,
it's going to be a mile.

2033
01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:17.140
I worried about that as a kid.
Right.
I'm going to,
you know,

2034
01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:20.920
I'm going to get my Toboggan and and you,
you know,
sled all my,

2035
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:24.960
my toys down to Mexico cause I'm going to be a mile in rice here.
Right.

2036
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:26.910
So the same guys,
now it's global warming,
global.

2037
01:58:26.911 --> 01:58:30.260
Well sort of because they have a lot more information nowadays.
You know,

2038
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:33.810
they have more,
they have more to back it up.
But what they're not,

2039
01:58:33.930 --> 01:58:38.400
whether they're abusing is the,
the reality up there,

2040
01:58:38.401 --> 01:58:43.401
which is you need new ice fur seals to grow.

2041
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:47.740
If they have old isis too deep,
the seals,
they die and they die.

2042
01:58:47.741 --> 01:58:52.330
The polar bears die.
So a mini ice age kills polar bears,
global warming.
This,

2043
01:58:52.331 --> 01:58:55.720
I still freezes every winter it freezes and the CEO's that come up through it

2044
01:58:55.721 --> 01:58:58.210
and the,
the bears can fight or fight through the ice,

2045
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:59.800
find their seals and survive.

2046
01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:02.380
So there's more seals up now than there ever has been,

2047
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:05.540
which translates to more polar bears than there ever has been.

2048
01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:10.680
And this is backed up by numerous studies up in Canada by Canadian scientists

2049
01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:16.380
and the,
and by anecdotal evidence,
just go talk to the new one up there.
You know,

2050
01:59:16.381 --> 01:59:18.400
back 40 50 60 years ago,

2051
01:59:18.401 --> 01:59:22.180
they had to work really hard to find a polar bear now and also remember that

2052
01:59:22.181 --> 01:59:26.490
there was commercial harvesting of these polar bears up until 1970 you know,

2053
01:59:26.690 --> 01:59:31.360
10,000 a year.
They were killing up in the northern,
in,
in the north.

2054
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:34.060
Whether you're in between Russia and Canada,
just for the,
for just for the,

2055
01:59:34.061 --> 01:59:38.260
for now.
That's all gone.
So what do you think those bears did?

2056
01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:41.260
They had babies,
the ones that survived.
And those babies have babies.

2057
01:59:41.261 --> 01:59:43.750
There's bears everywhere up there now.
So again,

2058
01:59:43.751 --> 01:59:45.160
the in you know better than anybody.

2059
01:59:45.161 --> 01:59:48.580
They lived there when you can't walk out of your house and Nazi polar bear

2060
01:59:48.581 --> 01:59:52.570
tracks,
there's a lot more polar bear than there were.
So,
so again,

2061
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:57.130
to say that global warming is potentially going to cause the demise a polar
bear.

2062
01:59:57.131 --> 02:00:01.720
So we're going to stop hunting,
devalued the polar bear for the new it up there.

2063
02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:05.020
The Americans were the main market for those polar bears for the hunters.

2064
02:00:05.650 --> 02:00:08.800
So what do they do now?
They still kill him,
but now they don't care.

2065
02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:12.280
The first one they see baby mother doesn't matter,
you know,
cause it's meat.

2066
02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:14.020
It's just plain and simple meat.

2067
02:00:14.410 --> 02:00:17.850
And is that a great way to manage the polar bear populations up there?
So he,

2068
02:00:18.190 --> 02:00:20.200
you know,
coming back to the u s fish and Wildlife Service,

2069
02:00:20.201 --> 02:00:25.030
I'm not saying that there,
I don't understand the logic behind their decision.

2070
02:00:25.450 --> 02:00:28.450
Now,
I would love for one of them to explain to me what the logic is,

2071
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:31.990
but I don't see it on the ground,
feet on the ground in the Arctic.

2072
02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:35.980
And I was there this,
this spring for a month.
You know,
it's the same story.

2073
02:00:35.981 --> 02:00:36.880
More bears than ever.

2074
02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:41.310
<v 0>It's so interesting how counterintuitive that is based on like what most people</v>

2075
02:00:41.311 --> 02:00:41.701
believe.

2076
02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:46.701
Most people believe that this area is diminishing in habitat and that the polar

2077
02:00:47.761 --> 02:00:51.030
bear is going to be forced into extinction.
Sure.
Well,
meanwhile,

2078
02:00:51.090 --> 02:00:52.050
there's more than as it is,

2079
02:00:52.810 --> 02:00:57.160
<v 1>it is really easy to take a picture of a mother polar bear with two cubs on a</v>

2080
02:00:57.161 --> 02:01:00.130
tiny little ice cube out on the water and say,
you know,

2081
02:01:00.131 --> 02:01:01.480
my world is melting around me

2082
02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:05.120
<v 0>dying.
And what would you do for a Klondike Bar?
I have a coke and a smile.</v>

2083
02:01:05.210 --> 02:01:07.990
There you go.
I mean,
they're the most vicious predators we know.
And they're,

2084
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.480
you know,
they're used to sell ice cream and soda.
They're there.

2085
02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:15.070
<v 1>They're marine mammals.
They're marine mammals.
That's,
they swim.</v>

2086
02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:16.820
That's what they do.
You know

2087
02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:20.180
<v 0>these animals are doing,
no,
no,
no.
There,
there,
there's,
their habitat is lost.</v>

2088
02:01:20.181 --> 02:01:21.980
They're drowning.
Oh,
don't,
you know,

2089
02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:26.060
<v 1>that's ridiculous.
But it's also,
it's also a way for scientists who,
who,</v>

2090
02:01:26.061 --> 02:01:28.460
and I use the term scientists lately,

2091
02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:32.990
the way for them to raise funds because you got to remember they have to pay for

2092
02:01:32.991 --> 02:01:36.470
their mortgages to,
so jump on the bandwagon,
let's get,

2093
02:01:36.710 --> 02:01:39.830
I'm going to study these polar bears now because look,
this is danger.
The threat.

2094
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:44.450
And if you get enough people believing it,
then you know there's money available.

2095
02:01:44.451 --> 02:01:49.260
Right?
Okay,
let's give $25 million to studies now.
Now,
yeah.
I mean,
I mean,

2096
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:52.550
I'm sound like a conspiracy theorist,
but it's,
you know,
it's,

2097
02:01:52.551 --> 02:01:54.920
the reality is people are trying to make a living.

2098
02:01:54.921 --> 02:01:57.790
They're just trying to make a living and just trying to sell storage wars that

2099
02:01:57.791 --> 02:02:00.080
just trying to get you to look in Al Capone's vault.
That's right.

2100
02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:03.890
And they're trying to get you to send money and to their organization that's

2101
02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:05.850
raising whatever billions of dollars a year,

2102
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:10.910
hundreds of millions to protect wildlife.
Have you eaten polar bear?
Oh,

2103
02:02:10.911 --> 02:02:14.600
absolutely.
What is polar bear?
It tastes like,
you know,
when I've eaten it,

2104
02:02:14.601 --> 02:02:18.680
it's up in the Arctic with the annual.
And so they,
they boil everything.

2105
02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:23.960
It's a boiled and,
and uh,
it's funny you put salt lick the brisket,

2106
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:26.840
you normally where we need the backstraps,
you know,

2107
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:30.550
that'd be the first choice or tenderloins the Inuit nod.

2108
02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.630
It's the brisket because when you boil it,

2109
02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:37.040
that's where you've got this great textures,
you know,
that they're crunchy.

2110
02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:41.480
Uh,
I mean,
I don't even know what you'd call a cartilage and connective tissue.

2111
02:02:41.481 --> 02:02:45.890
There's not just meat and fat.
So that's,
you know,
it was,
it was a delicacy.

2112
02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:49.670
I would rate it right up there with the best of the meat I've ever had now
Healy.

2113
02:02:49.730 --> 02:02:53.990
Oh,
absolutely.
But boiled with salt and being very hungry out on the ice.

2114
02:02:54.370 --> 02:02:57.340
You know,
you spent 20 days out in the ice with you,
it on a dog sled.
You're,

2115
02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.290
you're hungry.
He,
you know they kill a barrier unit near,

2116
02:03:00.670 --> 02:03:04.280
it's like the best finest Coby beef and downtown New York City.

2117
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:08.380
Is it relative to where you're at in the struggle that your enemy,
if you had it,

2118
02:03:08.890 --> 02:03:10.670
if I took it to a restaurant down the street,

2119
02:03:10.671 --> 02:03:14.000
hard to say cause cause you there is no restaurant serves it.

2120
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:19.030
So it's hard to hard to take it out of that context and say is it the best meat

2121
02:03:19.731 --> 02:03:23.150
now here,
I don't know.
I mean while cheap,
same thing.

2122
02:03:23.151 --> 02:03:27.830
You're on a mountain and you've been backpacking for 10 days carrying 50 to 70

2123
02:03:27.831 --> 02:03:32.810
pounds on your back and you finally get your realm and rundown to blow Alpine

2124
02:03:32.811 --> 02:03:35.780
and find some little sticks and make a fire and roast the ribs on it.

2125
02:03:36.230 --> 02:03:41.230
I defy anybody to tell me there's a better piece of meat in this world that

2126
02:03:41.301 --> 02:03:44.840
tastes better than that while cheap on a mountain after a sheep hunt.

2127
02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:50.010
But would it be that good if I was downtown New York City or here in La I,

2128
02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:54.170
you know,
I don't know because you,
you just can't do it.
It doesn't exist.

2129
02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:57.410
One of the best meals I've ever had in my life.
We shot a mule deer that,

2130
02:03:57.470 --> 02:04:01.270
that deer right there in Montana.
And uh,
we,

2131
02:04:01.271 --> 02:04:05.360
we ate the liver and the heart that night and it was insane.

2132
02:04:05.670 --> 02:04:07.520
It was so delicious.
Yeah.

2133
02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:11.540
That's the camp fire and just cooked it over oil with little salt and pepper and

2134
02:04:11.550 --> 02:04:13.970
then just moaning with delight like an orgy.

2135
02:04:15.230 --> 02:04:19.700
Anyone that doesn't hunt that isn't out there can never know what we're,

2136
02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:24.020
what you're describing.
I know it,
I know it.
I've had the same thing and I've had,

2137
02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:27.280
you know,
Moose liver and name it,
you name it,
you know,
antelope,

2138
02:04:27.281 --> 02:04:32.000
you all around the world.
We've had the same thing.
It's the best of the best.

2139
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:36.620
It's the perfect,
I think it's because that's who we are.

2140
02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:41.520
That's who we are.
We're not the,
the fancy restaurant,
you know,

2141
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.740
thousand dollar bottles of wine and whole,
whole,
whole,

2142
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:47.820
whole cuisine is not what we are.
We're just,

2143
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:51.120
we're just that we eat wild game cooked on a fire.

2144
02:04:51.810 --> 02:04:53.940
That's the choose we can ever be.
That's the truest,

2145
02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:59.190
most natural flavor and,
and eating that we could ever do.

2146
02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:03.210
But one of the number one post and when I Instagram pictures that like the,

2147
02:05:03.370 --> 02:05:07.860
<v 3>the ones that get the most likes or all meat cooking wild game is crazy.
Yeah.</v>

2148
02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:12.440
Wild pig or wild,
you know,
Santa or the Moose recently.
It's,

2149
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:15.220
it's weird how people at resonates with people.

2150
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:19.160
<v 1>Yeah.
And again,
I think it w we are making inroads.
Like they're,
you know,</v>

2151
02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:23.740
the hipsters nowadays are in the big cities are looking at this and saying,
hey,

2152
02:05:23.741 --> 02:05:28.530
yeah,
it's organic meat.
It truly is better than anything that's raised.
So I mean,

2153
02:05:28.531 --> 02:05:30.030
why not?
It's,
it's organic.

2154
02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:33.720
And if they look at it objectively and it's managed herds and it's,
you know,

2155
02:05:33.721 --> 02:05:33.911
there,

2156
02:05:33.911 --> 02:05:38.911
there's wildlife populations that can sustain a harvest of a certain number of

2157
02:05:38.971 --> 02:05:42.120
animals that's regulated.
Okay,
well why not?
Now?

2158
02:05:42.121 --> 02:05:47.121
Suddenly it makes all kinds of sense to not eat that instead of a [inaudible].

2159
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:50.460
But it's not that simple to go get that,
you know,
you've done it,

2160
02:05:50.461 --> 02:05:53.640
you've made the effort,
you've learned the skills,
you know,
you shoot a ball,

2161
02:05:53.641 --> 02:05:55.650
you should arrive.
Do you rifle?
I don't even know.

2162
02:05:56.970 --> 02:05:58.890
But all those are skills that you've acquired.

2163
02:05:59.190 --> 02:06:01.110
You can't just walk out there and go shoot something.

2164
02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:03.050
<v 3>Well,
I'm very lucky in the first of all,</v>

2165
02:06:03.051 --> 02:06:04.820
lucky that I got to meet Steve are now on,

2166
02:06:04.821 --> 02:06:09.200
I have my podcasts and I got to take my introductory course in the hunting was

2167
02:06:09.201 --> 02:06:10.250
with a master hunter.

2168
02:06:10.251 --> 02:06:14.510
I mean took me out the right way in the wild and the Missouri breaks and place

2169
02:06:14.511 --> 02:06:15.500
where there's no people.

2170
02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:18.500
The deer that I shot most likely never even seen a person.
I mean,

2171
02:06:18.501 --> 02:06:22.160
you're in a very inhospitable environment for most people.

2172
02:06:22.161 --> 02:06:26.120
It's very difficult to do and very difficult to find the time to go to the range

2173
02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:28.940
to learn.
I mean learn how to bow hunt with Cameron Hanes.

2174
02:06:28.941 --> 02:06:31.220
I mean she's a very fortunate in that sense.
I mean,

2175
02:06:31.221 --> 02:06:35.240
he taught me so much about archery and equipment and how to,
you know,

2176
02:06:35.241 --> 02:06:39.500
adjust your equipment and dial it all in and had a practice and what to do and

2177
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:44.240
you know how to stand and hold your breath and you know the proper way to

2178
02:06:44.241 --> 02:06:47.210
release all that stuff takes.
It takes a lot of it.

2179
02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:50.150
You have to invest a lot of time and energy that people,

2180
02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:53.570
a lot of people don't have,
you know,
they have this,
his cubicle existence,

2181
02:06:53.571 --> 02:06:54.381
whether they like it or not,

2182
02:06:54.381 --> 02:06:57.100
they're tied into their student loans and tied into their bills.

2183
02:06:57.101 --> 02:07:02.060
So when I talk about like those existences,
like I've been trapped too,
man,

2184
02:07:02.061 --> 02:07:04.910
I've had plenty of jobs.
It's sucked and I was stuck there forever.

2185
02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:09.920
But you what I,
what I'm saying is,
is not,

2186
02:07:09.921 --> 02:07:13.940
I'm not judging people for not being able to do it or not doing it themselves.

2187
02:07:14.150 --> 02:07:16.700
What I'm trying to do is just let them know the benefits,

2188
02:07:16.730 --> 02:07:19.280
if it's possible to figure out a way to get to that part,

2189
02:07:19.700 --> 02:07:22.490
to get to that point in your life.
The benefits of being able to do it.

2190
02:07:22.491 --> 02:07:22.941
The benefits,

2191
02:07:22.941 --> 02:07:26.660
being able to hunt your meat and actually kill that animal and cook that liver

2192
02:07:26.661 --> 02:07:29.630
over the fire.
You wouldn't believe how good it tastes you.

2193
02:07:29.631 --> 02:07:32.720
You literally wouldn't believe.
And it's a completely different thing.

2194
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:36.850
I've had many delicious,
where I went to the store,

2195
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:40.240
I bought a nice steak and I bought some vegetables and I came home and I cooked

2196
02:07:40.241 --> 02:07:41.110
it up and you know,

2197
02:07:41.111 --> 02:07:45.860
just no connection whatsoever to how that Kale was grown or how those mushrooms

2198
02:07:45.861 --> 02:07:49.900
are picked or how that cow die.
But it's still fantastic,
delicious meal.

2199
02:07:50.110 --> 02:07:54.670
But there's another level that comes from like this Mousse.

2200
02:07:54.730 --> 02:07:58.510
I cook some Moose last night,
does this,
this is a totally different level.

2201
02:07:58.511 --> 02:08:02.710
I know exactly where that animal came from.
I cut the backstraps off its body,

2202
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:07.570
I put it in the plastic bag,
we froze it,
I took it home,
I defrosted it.
I,

2203
02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:11.860
you know,
I put the garlic salt on it and I started the fire,
the whole deal.

2204
02:08:11.861 --> 02:08:12.694
And when that,

2205
02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:16.330
this is a complete different thing when you're eating that and that's,

2206
02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:18.400
that's the next level of connection.

2207
02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:21.250
<v 1>Yeah.
I think,
no question.
And that I,
I mean,</v>

2208
02:08:21.251 --> 02:08:24.400
I think we're sitting in the popular person on television with,
with the,
uh,

2209
02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:28.030
you know,
guys like Anthony Bourdain and I mean,
I don't know the other cook guys,

2210
02:08:28.031 --> 02:08:32.560
but one of them,
I think it might've been him,
killed an Eland in Africa.

2211
02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:35.920
And that's hunting.
Yeah.
You don't know what,
what they're missing.

2212
02:08:36.190 --> 02:08:37.810
They're doing it very surgically.
They're not,

2213
02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:41.820
they're missing the spirituality of the hunting side,
the skillset.
You know,
I,
I,

2214
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:43.990
I'm not sure which one was how it happened.

2215
02:08:43.991 --> 02:08:47.080
I think it was shot right from the truck.
You know,
they missed the hunt part.

2216
02:08:47.081 --> 02:08:49.590
So their people are maybe coming in the backdoor on the,

2217
02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:53.470
on this whole hunting the issue.
Like,
okay,
we get the meat part,
right.

2218
02:08:53.471 --> 02:08:56.100
It's just the honeypot we don't get yet.
So,
so,
you know,

2219
02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:59.440
but if we reach them through the meat side and they recognize this as the best

2220
02:08:59.441 --> 02:09:04.300
meat that you can pause,
the best sustenance,
you can have the most natural,

2221
02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:08.440
then that's fine.
I'll take that any day.
Now here,
let me,

2222
02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:11.920
let me take you into the outdoors and show you the part that you don't get yet,

2223
02:09:11.921 --> 02:09:16.921
which is the actual killing of this animal animal and what that means to you as

2224
02:09:17.471 --> 02:09:21.670
a person that's going to then supply your family with this meat and eat it

2225
02:09:21.671 --> 02:09:25.990
yourself.
You know,
that,
you know,
besides the fact what the meat tastes like.

2226
02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:30.370
It's also that,
that uh,
it's a spiritual connection with,

2227
02:09:30.371 --> 02:09:33.410
with life.
I mean life.
Uh,

2228
02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:37.120
where do you think that that state came from and your,
you know,
life,

2229
02:09:37.150 --> 02:09:41.860
it was a life,
you know,
life begets death.
I guess life begets death.

2230
02:09:42.250 --> 02:09:42.760
This is,

2231
02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:47.380
this is the part that we've almost got the people coming in from.

2232
02:09:47.650 --> 02:09:48.810
Like I say,
the backside,

2233
02:09:48.820 --> 02:09:53.740
the meat side almost got them to where they understand now are there ready to

2234
02:09:53.741 --> 02:09:56.350
understand that?
Okay,
well now they're,
here's the death part.

2235
02:09:56.351 --> 02:09:59.710
This is the hunting part.
Yeah.
They accept the wild game and no question.

2236
02:09:59.711 --> 02:10:02.700
All our friends like wild game meat,
it w w we give it,
it's,

2237
02:10:02.701 --> 02:10:06.760
it's gone the instant we offer it to anybody.
But you know,
the hunting part,

2238
02:10:06.761 --> 02:10:11.530
they're still on the fence about so,
but,
but slowly,
slowly.

2239
02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:15.400
And if it has to come through the meat side with the cooking shows,
great.

2240
02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:19.810
And it will also push on the other side,
the exploration,
the,
the uh,

2241
02:10:20.410 --> 02:10:21.770
discovery,
the,

2242
02:10:21.850 --> 02:10:26.290
the skills that it takes and the joy to be out in the wild lands.
I mean,
uh,

2243
02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:26.561
you know,

2244
02:10:26.561 --> 02:10:30.440
I don't spend my day worrying about how to make enough money to drive a Rolls

2245
02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:35.090
Royce like my,
my neighbors.
You're a second TV or,
or,
you know,

2246
02:10:35.091 --> 02:10:38.960
whatever channel that people chase in this world today.
I don't do that.

2247
02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:41.510
I use my time and my money to be out there.

2248
02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:43.850
You say that people don't have enough time.
You do have enough time.

2249
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:47.630
You just have to change your priorities.
You know,

2250
02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.650
instead of sending your kids off to the nannies,
want her to take them out there,

2251
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:55.850
take them on into the,
the wildlands,
wherever that may be.
A maybe a 40 acre park,

2252
02:10:56.210 --> 02:10:58.970
but at least shout there,
show him a bug.
Show him an insect,
show him a butterfly.

2253
02:10:58.971 --> 02:10:59.804
Show him a bird.

2254
02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:03.290
And maybe you'll be lucky and see a squirrel or a rabbit and if you're really

2255
02:11:03.291 --> 02:11:07.610
lucky,
a deer,
you know,
that's,
that's,
it's just priorities.
There's time.

2256
02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:10.880
If people prioritize properly,
well to me properly,

2257
02:11:10.881 --> 02:11:13.650
maybe not to them yet because maybe they want the Rolls Royce,
you know,

2258
02:11:13.651 --> 02:11:14.484
it doesn't interest me.

2259
02:11:14.610 --> 02:11:18.170
<v 3>I think there's also an issue that's coming up now where the,</v>

2260
02:11:18.171 --> 02:11:23.171
the moral high ground that people take five by endorsing vegetarianism or

2261
02:11:24.391 --> 02:11:29.220
veganism,
we're starting to understand that that plants might be sent in,

2262
02:11:29.610 --> 02:11:33.180
that plants actually can communicate with each other,

2263
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:38.100
that plants can transmit information,
that plants can feel pain,

2264
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:42.690
that plants recognize when they're being consumed and that plants have

2265
02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:48.020
protective measures in order to discourage predation because in that protective

2266
02:11:48.601 --> 02:11:53.601
measures that become enacted upon them being torn apart or being eaten,

2267
02:11:54.330 --> 02:11:57.930
where we're starting to find out all sorts of strange things about plants that

2268
02:11:57.931 --> 02:12:01.620
plants might not be this.
We would like to look at plan as being like,
oh,

2269
02:12:01.621 --> 02:12:03.510
it's like fucking eating styrofoam,
which is grows.

2270
02:12:03.511 --> 02:12:06.510
You pull it out of the ground and it's,
it's fine.
What's a life form?

2271
02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:09.390
It's a life form.
It just because he can't scream when you eat it.

2272
02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:12.540
It doesn't mean it's not a life form like any other life form,

2273
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:15.140
<v 1>you know?
And it doesn't mean it's not screaming in a language.</v>

2274
02:12:15.141 --> 02:12:16.550
We don't understand it.

2275
02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:20.420
You see the Kudu and Africa feeding into the windows that to protect them from

2276
02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:21.730
predators?
No,
it's,

2277
02:12:21.731 --> 02:12:26.450
it's because the plants that they feed on that they prefer Cat San pheromones or

2278
02:12:26.451 --> 02:12:26.991
whatever that,

2279
02:12:26.991 --> 02:12:30.770
whatever that signal is where they talk to each other and I mean it sounds like

2280
02:12:30.771 --> 02:12:35.090
doctor Doolittle here,
Mister Mister plant little,
but they are,

2281
02:12:35.110 --> 02:12:39.270
the plants actually send a signal to the plants ahead if it's downwind and they

2282
02:12:39.271 --> 02:12:40.360
all send out a,

2283
02:12:40.361 --> 02:12:45.290
a chemical and the leaves that make them inedible for the animals so that that's

2284
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:47.540
there.
They're talking to each other and there's no doubt.
Now.

2285
02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:50.540
Now would that stop me from eating the leaves of that plant or lettuce or a

2286
02:12:50.541 --> 02:12:52.820
carrot?
No,
not a bit.
But you know,

2287
02:12:52.821 --> 02:12:55.130
I mean I guess if people want to sit there and say,
I don't kill things.

2288
02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:58.640
I would say more like you drive a car.

2289
02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:02.210
How many bugs do you think you killed in that car?
How many birds have you hit?

2290
02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:05.180
You know,
of course you're killing animals.
No,
no one can,

2291
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:07.860
no one can wash their hands of that.
Well there was a experiment

2292
02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:09.320
<v 3>that was recently done,
um,</v>

2293
02:13:09.390 --> 02:13:13.740
where the student showed that plants won't grow near a Wifi router.

2294
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:19.260
They show the difference in plant growth like we were near a Wifi,

2295
02:13:19.290 --> 02:13:21.360
grout router and a without,

2296
02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:25.410
and they're starting to realize that there's something that these,

2297
02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:26.670
these plants are,

2298
02:13:26.730 --> 02:13:29.850
they're interacting with their environment in ways that were not totally aware

2299
02:13:29.851 --> 02:13:34.380
of the same way sort how bees are affected by cell phone signals.

2300
02:13:34.381 --> 02:13:37.380
This is a huge issue with,
with bee populations.

2301
02:13:37.381 --> 02:13:42.060
I think that bees on a regular basis are dealing with radio frequencies and cell

2302
02:13:42.061 --> 02:13:46.300
phone frequencies,
Wifi signals.
These actually affect their,

2303
02:13:46.301 --> 02:13:50.340
their ability to communicate with each other,
their ability to,
um,
to navigate.

2304
02:13:50.670 --> 02:13:54.630
And that there's all sorts of things that the wild life,

2305
02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:58.140
whether it's wild plants,
whether it's insects,
animals,

2306
02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:00.480
there's their senses that they have.

2307
02:14:00.510 --> 02:14:03.210
There's ways of their interacting with their environment that we're not totally

2308
02:14:03.211 --> 02:14:06.570
aware of.
So when we look at a plant,
it grows and we go,
oh,

2309
02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:07.590
we'll just eat this plant.

2310
02:14:07.591 --> 02:14:12.030
And it's so simple and convenient because it doesn't scream because we don't

2311
02:14:12.150 --> 02:14:16.650
recognize it's life in the same level as our life.

2312
02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:19.950
We don't put it in the same hierarchy.
It doesn't mean it's not life.

2313
02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:22.230
Life eats life.

2314
02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:25.810
<v 1>That's the exact correct.
Uh,
and I say life begats death,
the guest's life,</v>

2315
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:27.790
it's a continuum.
It's a perfect balance.

2316
02:14:28.150 --> 02:14:30.260
Has been going on forever and this planet,

2317
02:14:30.261 --> 02:14:34.030
and it's not going to change just because someone calls himself a vegetarian.

2318
02:14:34.210 --> 02:14:38.110
I mean it's,
it's animals die,
plants die so that we can live.

2319
02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:43.070
<v 3>Now when you traveling to all these different worlds,
I mean,</v>

2320
02:14:43.071 --> 02:14:45.110
there really are almost like different worlds.

2321
02:14:45.111 --> 02:14:47.670
It's different parts of this planet and your,

2322
02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:50.330
you're interacting with all these indigenous people.
What are they,

2323
02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:53.260
what's their attitude when it comes to vegetarianism?
And it was,
is that,

2324
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:55.340
does that even exist in some of these places?

2325
02:14:55.670 --> 02:14:59.960
<v 1>No,
I mean,
proteins at a premium all around the world.
It's a first world issue.</v>

2326
02:15:00.170 --> 02:15:03.500
Yeah,
it's,
it's a,
it's our,
it's a luxury that we can call ourselves a vegetarian.

2327
02:15:03.501 --> 02:15:07.460
Now that doesn't mean that some places they're not vegetarian because they have

2328
02:15:07.461 --> 02:15:10.640
to be,
you know,
but if they get an opportunity to eat a fish,

2329
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:14.780
they're going to eat it.
You know,
I,
it doesn't matter where you are,
whether it's,

2330
02:15:14.781 --> 02:15:15.740
you know,
you'll see the,

2331
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:18.890
the pygmies and the creeks catching the little freshwater shrimp.

2332
02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:21.970
If they didn't catch an animal that day,
they're eating the shrimp,
you know,

2333
02:15:21.971 --> 02:15:26.660
their protein as is is a premium all around the world.
No,
there's no one

2334
02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:30.950
who is a third world that's not really a great term.
But

2335
02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:33.280
<v 3>yeah,
I don't like those terms.
First World Thurber I,
you know,</v>

2336
02:15:33.281 --> 02:15:38.281
I used that term about Mexico and I did it at a show once talking about San

2337
02:15:38.350 --> 02:15:39.190
Diego,
how weird it is.

2338
02:15:39.191 --> 02:15:43.810
A San Diego is just a 20 minute drive to Tijuana and this guy came up to me

2339
02:15:43.811 --> 02:15:47.120
after the show and he was from Tijuana.
He came to the show and he's like,
yeah,

2340
02:15:47.121 --> 02:15:48.250
I'm from a third world country.

2341
02:15:48.251 --> 02:15:50.560
Like you could tell like bothered him that I said that.
Well,

2342
02:15:50.561 --> 02:15:54.850
at this designation of first,
second,
Third World,
I was just in Mexico City.

2343
02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:56.950
Some of the nicest people I've ever met in my life.

2344
02:15:56.951 --> 02:16:01.060
They're so friendly and make Mexico City.
It's,
it's overly crowded.

2345
02:16:01.061 --> 02:16:05.380
It's unbelievably polluted.
But the people are fantastic.
Yeah.
And I think first,

2346
02:16:05.381 --> 02:16:08.960
second,
Third World,
all these distinctions at this,
it's kind of,
yeah.
Weird.

2347
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:11.800
<v 1>No,
it's just,
uh,
you know,
again,
it's,
it's ego centric.
Yes.</v>

2348
02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:16.580
Like the world revolves around us.
It's earth.
Exactly.
And they're there.

2349
02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:20.360
It's just,
it's different situation over there.
But they don't have protein,

2350
02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:22.910
you know,
they're getting it from their bean plants or whatever.

2351
02:16:22.911 --> 02:16:26.390
They happen to be growing if they're agrarian.
But,
but you know,

2352
02:16:26.391 --> 02:16:31.030
that that whole vegetarian thing,
I've never met anybody in any place that says,

2353
02:16:31.031 --> 02:16:32.590
you know,
I'm a vegetarian.
They're proud of it.

2354
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:35.380
They're vegetarian because the have to be,

2355
02:16:35.381 --> 02:16:40.180
there's no other food around and given a choice,
they will absolutely eat that.

2356
02:16:40.430 --> 02:16:44.380
You know,
clam,
fish,
crab,
whatever.
If they're,

2357
02:16:44.381 --> 02:16:47.710
if they're along the ocean or rivers.
A lot of people in India,
aren't they?

2358
02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:51.820
Vegetarian by choice?
Isn't that,
uh,
you know,
Hinduism,
I dunno,
you know,
that,
that,

2359
02:16:51.821 --> 02:16:55.240
uh,
once you,
once you start injecting the religious side of it,

2360
02:16:55.241 --> 02:16:58.900
that's a different deal.
Chelios right?
Um,

2361
02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:00.261
<v 3>you,</v>

2362
02:17:00.261 --> 02:17:04.230
you doing 13 of these a year where you're traveling to all these ridiculously

2363
02:17:04.231 --> 02:17:08.340
remote places like that one where you went to Russia and he took that crazy four

2364
02:17:08.341 --> 02:17:13.341
wheel drive truck near the side of this cliff mean that I was clenching my fist

2365
02:17:14.581 --> 02:17:18.690
and tightening my legs watching that.
I was like,
Jesus,
what are they doing?

2366
02:17:18.990 --> 02:17:22.380
You took like the most precarious path to go.

2367
02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.670
Was it a ram you went to go shoot around?
Yeah,
yeah.
The

2368
02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:29.020
<v 1>TN Shannon,
our galley and the TN Shannon mountains that was in Kurgastan,
right.</v>

2369
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:33.340
Uh,
an ex Soviet protectorate.
So it's a,

2370
02:17:33.341 --> 02:17:35.980
it's the only way to get there.
How long did it take to get to that spot?

2371
02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:39.760
You know,
that that time we were pretty lucky.
I think we did it.
And,
uh,

2372
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.770
from where we left pavement,
uh,
I'm gonna say 14,

2373
02:17:44.771 --> 02:17:47.920
16 hours,
maybe it was 18 hours.
So,
you know,
somewhere in that range,

2374
02:17:47.921 --> 02:17:51.770
it's not bad sometimes.
And these places like to Gica Stan,
you know,

2375
02:17:51.771 --> 02:17:53.920
going along the Joaquim corridor there,
you can,

2376
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:58.240
it can take 36 hours in one of those little Russian jeeps was a brutal,
brutal.

2377
02:17:58.510 --> 02:17:59.081
I swear,

2378
02:17:59.081 --> 02:18:03.130
they just run their exhaust pipe into the inside of the truck for their heater.

2379
02:18:03.310 --> 02:18:07.150
Really?
Yes.
I swear like it.
It's just,
it's disgusting.
You,
you're,

2380
02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:10.180
I have a headache pounding and you're up at 14,000 feet,

2381
02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:13.330
so you have a headache anyway.
But,
uh,
and you breathing exhaust fumes,

2382
02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:17.380
smelling exhaust fumes the whole way.
36 hours of sitting in a,
in a,
you know,

2383
02:18:17.381 --> 02:18:21.550
they're not made for comfort.
The,
the Soviet era,
anything was,

2384
02:18:21.620 --> 02:18:23.620
had nothing to do with comfort.
So,
yeah.

2385
02:18:23.621 --> 02:18:27.740
But so the Kurgastan wanted in that big Russian unilog deal was a,

2386
02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:31.510
you know,
relatively speaking,
it was fairly,
fairly quick.

2387
02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:36.280
Still still,
you know,
and,
and I,
I've just become a bit of a fatalist on that.

2388
02:18:36.281 --> 02:18:40.360
If I'm,
if it's my time and this thing's going to go over the edge,
it's my time,

2389
02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:43.380
you know,
and you,
you're not going to stop.
You can,
you know,

2390
02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:46.960
stress out the entire time and get shots of adrenaline every time that chuck

2391
02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:51.490
liens and lurches,
it's just not worth it.
You know,
I,
I just go on his own and,

2392
02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:55.870
wow.
What a beautiful view.
Straight,
straight,
willing to take you to these places.

2393
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:59.050
They live there.
That's where they live there.
They're hunters.
That's,

2394
02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:03.670
that's where they have to meet you where they don't live and then take you to

2395
02:19:03.671 --> 02:19:05.710
where they live.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
that's the,

2396
02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:09.090
that's why you have those wonderful road systems the Soviets built.
Yeah.

2397
02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:13.860
Wonderful.
No,
I swear like you built them along the way.
Yeah.
They're there.

2398
02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:15.820
Uh,
there's the there,

2399
02:19:15.850 --> 02:19:19.150
but they're nowhere near as scary as down in South America and Peru.

2400
02:19:19.350 --> 02:19:20.820
Go in the Andes and,

2401
02:19:20.830 --> 02:19:24.100
and go into some of those communities where you're doing 20 switch batch

2402
02:19:24.550 --> 02:19:27.960
switchbacks up a mountain.
Frightening.
What does it switch back?

2403
02:19:27.961 --> 02:19:32.550
What does that well,
they,
the,
you can't,
they come one way up,
45 degree angle,

2404
02:19:32.551 --> 02:19:35.450
then cut 45 degree angle cut 45 cut 40.
Oh,
I see.

2405
02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:38.330
And you can climb almost any mountain if you build a road,
you know,

2406
02:19:38.331 --> 02:19:41.840
wide enough for a,
for attract,
uh,
wheels to go on.

2407
02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:47.030
And scariest thing I've ever,
ever scariest place I've ever driven.

2408
02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:50.100
You know,
Kurgastan was bad,
but,
but uh,

2409
02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:53.450
the Andes in South America and Peru were by far worse.

2410
02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:57.340
We were hunting a little white tail that lives only the Andys Andy and whitetail

2411
02:19:57.350 --> 02:20:00.860
deer.
He lives up in the high Andes at 14,
15,000 feet.

2412
02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:04.820
The only one animal is higher as the [inaudible],
which is another deer species.

2413
02:20:04.821 --> 02:20:09.680
That's,
that's higher.
Wow.
Fascinating place.

2414
02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:14.960
Have you hunted everything that's on this planet?
No,
but I'm sure.

2415
02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:17.630
Do you have a list?
Yeah,
well,
I had a bucket list.
Yeah.
I mean,

2416
02:20:17.631 --> 02:20:20.130
I like a literal bucket list for them to,
yeah.
I mean,

2417
02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:24.650
the thing is that because no one's going to discover a new big game animal in

2418
02:20:24.651 --> 02:20:25.401
this planet anymore.

2419
02:20:25.401 --> 02:20:28.430
I mean they were all at that Fang cheap or they're fang dear that they just

2420
02:20:28.431 --> 02:20:31.280
found in Afghanistan for 60 years.
I heard about that.

2421
02:20:31.281 --> 02:20:35.750
But that just start salivating if they,
if they were allow hunting.
The thing is,

2422
02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:41.080
the thing is probably they could raise $1 million if they auction off a tag to

2423
02:20:41.451 --> 02:20:44.420
one hunter who knows a Russian oligarch guy,
he had paid the money.

2424
02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:47.050
Oh he probably doesn't.
He'd go hundred anyway.
But,

2425
02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:51.950
but if they raised $1 million for conservation of that animal,
they'd lose one.

2426
02:20:51.951 --> 02:20:54.920
But they'd saved the whole species,
you know,
in the,
and they protect it,

2427
02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:59.100
give the animals money.
They buy back some space for themselves.
So in fact,

2428
02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:02.720
you know,
I,
I would actually like to see one of them hunted,

2429
02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:05.870
maybe not 20 of them hunted when there's so few of them.

2430
02:21:05.871 --> 02:21:08.510
They didn't even know it existed until recently.

2431
02:21:08.810 --> 02:21:12.440
I thought the numbers can't be healthy enough to kill one.
Can they?
Probably not.

2432
02:21:12.441 --> 02:21:16.430
Not at this point,
but look at it this way.
What if there's one like the rhino,

2433
02:21:16.431 --> 02:21:21.230
the Black Rhino.
What if there's one that's overbreeding age pass breeding age,

2434
02:21:21.650 --> 02:21:21.861
right?

2435
02:21:21.861 --> 02:21:25.670
So he's not contributing to the preservation of that species anymore or the or

2436
02:21:25.671 --> 02:21:30.620
the perpetuation of that species.
He's just living.
So if you lost that one,

2437
02:21:30.621 --> 02:21:34.010
raised $1 million for a study of those animals and the protection of those

2438
02:21:34.011 --> 02:21:38.390
animals,
can you justify it?
You know?
And again,
it's,
it's,
it's a life,

2439
02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:41.930
you know,
to protect more lives or,

2440
02:21:41.931 --> 02:21:46.160
or don't take the million dollars that one dies because he's gonna die.

2441
02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:48.320
He's gonna die for whatever.
Cause you know,

2442
02:21:48.321 --> 02:21:51.710
whether he gets pneumonia or whatever,
those Fang dear whatever they die from.

2443
02:21:52.310 --> 02:21:55.880
So it,
it just dies and there was no million dollars,
you know,

2444
02:21:55.881 --> 02:21:59.600
so now they're still struggling to get financing to,
to protect these animals.

2445
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:02.990
They could have done it with one auction,
with one tag,
wouldn't we?

2446
02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:06.770
The argument against,
obviously I'm playing devil's advocate here,
it was like,

2447
02:22:06.771 --> 02:22:09.170
wouldn't it be better if people were just,

2448
02:22:10.220 --> 02:22:14.210
we just wanted to keep these animals alive and it for a charitable reason.

2449
02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:16.490
I mean,
people would say like,
why do we have to hunt these things?

2450
02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:21.760
Why can't you just just keep these things alive because you care.

2451
02:22:21.921 --> 02:22:23.900
Because you want to see them flourish.

2452
02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:28.170
That's a who was somewhere over the rainbow.
Disneyland.
I mean those,

2453
02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:32.920
those places exist,
but not in the real world.
Not right now.
No.
Nobody has a,

2454
02:22:32.970 --> 02:22:36.480
nobody's going to give $1 million to protect the Fang deer in Afghanistan.

2455
02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:39.660
It's not going to happen,
you know,
and they can go try and raise money,

2456
02:22:39.661 --> 02:22:42.300
but you know what,
if you're going to raise money,

2457
02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:47.100
would you use a picture of a fang deer from Afghanistan or,
or you know,

2458
02:22:47.101 --> 02:22:51.900
a pretty,
uh,
an hour?
Yeah,
an eagle or you know,
something else.

2459
02:22:51.901 --> 02:22:55.170
Anything else?
A Fang deer that people just look and go,
yeah,

2460
02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:58.980
this is kind of like a pig,
you know?
It's a weird,
it's got thanks.
What do you,

2461
02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:01.320
how do you feel about hunting animals that you don't eat?

2462
02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.680
It depends what you mean by that.
Because there's,

2463
02:23:04.770 --> 02:23:09.770
there's almost no animals that are hunted that aren't utilized as food.

2464
02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:14.690
So,
you know what I mean?
Is Hyenas would be the,

2465
02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:19.150
they call him cousin over there.
So they high needs,
they don't eat.
Um,

2466
02:23:20.350 --> 02:23:23.400
you know,
that's a tougher one.
It is a tougher question,
right?

2467
02:23:23.401 --> 02:23:25.890
And it's not one that,
uh,
uh,

2468
02:23:26.430 --> 02:23:30.060
not one that I have a ready answer for because you're a wolf for instance.

2469
02:23:30.061 --> 02:23:34.980
I understand that wolves kill my Caribou in the Yukon and my opening territory

2470
02:23:34.981 --> 02:23:39.390
up there,
they kill the heck out of Caribou.
They kill the heck out of,
uh,
Moose.

2471
02:23:39.391 --> 02:23:41.460
Whatever they can kill,
they're going to kill the sheep.
You're,

2472
02:23:41.461 --> 02:23:45.990
that were struggling to raise the populations on.
So,
you know,
you know,

2473
02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:49.840
a wolf to say don't kill a wolf.
It makes no sense.
They have huge letters.
They,

2474
02:23:49.841 --> 02:23:52.890
they,
you know,
they work on a boom and bust with a natural cycle,

2475
02:23:53.610 --> 02:23:57.530
the kill everything.
So then they all die off and then everything starts again.

2476
02:23:57.540 --> 02:24:01.980
And that's all fine and dandy.
If you don't want x amount of ungulates around,

2477
02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:04.950
you know,
they're,
they're going through it in Yellowstone right now.
So,
you know,

2478
02:24:04.951 --> 02:24:08.970
should you kill it,
you don't eat it,
you know,
who doesn't mean you can't eat it?

2479
02:24:09.330 --> 02:24:12.180
I mean,
that's nothing wrong with wolf made.
I imagine.
I've never tried one,
but,

2480
02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:15.210
but I,
you know,
on the conservation side,
you,
you know,

2481
02:24:15.211 --> 02:24:18.650
they're competitors for a resource.
So,
you know,

2482
02:24:19.890 --> 02:24:24.110
it's a tough one.
Very tough one.
Yeah.
I mean,
I want the for,
you know,

2483
02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:28.050
I want to get a fur collar.
It doesn't,
it doesn't,
uh,
frost up,
you know,

2484
02:24:28.051 --> 02:24:32.130
that and Wolverine,
you know,
don't even over neither.
So would you kill that?
Uh,

2485
02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:35.730
yeah,
it's a,
it's a tougher one.
You know,
it's a tough one,

2486
02:24:35.731 --> 02:24:39.120
but they're carnivores and you're,
you're,
you know,
as a hunter,

2487
02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:44.130
you've got a dot.
An animosity towards him.
But certainly there's a competitive,

2488
02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:48.510
uh,
competition between them and us for the same resource.
So there's,
you know,

2489
02:24:48.511 --> 02:24:50.490
it's almost like a justification in that way,

2490
02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:54.060
but because you can't have them and have wildlife,
you know,
like,

2491
02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:58.410
like the unusual,
it's living in the same place.
You just can't have,
you know,

2492
02:24:58.411 --> 02:25:00.210
cause walls will kill them all.
They will,
you know,

2493
02:25:00.211 --> 02:25:02.410
anyone that says wools only killed the,
the,

2494
02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:05.950
the old and the infirm bullcrap that,
you know,

2495
02:25:05.970 --> 02:25:09.840
they will kill an entire herd of Caribou if they can't just for fun,

2496
02:25:10.110 --> 02:25:13.770
just for fun and eat what they can.
And then on the go,
you know,
the,
you know,

2497
02:25:13.771 --> 02:25:17.170
wasted meet,
yeah.
Wasted meat and walls will kill them all that,
that they're,

2498
02:25:17.210 --> 02:25:20.220
they're killing machines.
So it's uh,
yeah,
it's a,

2499
02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:24.400
it's a much tougher on hyenas over and over and Africa.
There they are predators.

2500
02:25:24.401 --> 02:25:27.340
They try and paint them as non predators.
You know,
they're,

2501
02:25:27.341 --> 02:25:31.690
they're scavengers and take away from the lions,
pull crop,
they're killers.

2502
02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:34.390
And then when the wild dogs over there kill,
kill,
kill there,

2503
02:25:34.391 --> 02:25:36.910
they're very efficient predators,
you know?

2504
02:25:36.911 --> 02:25:41.140
So do you kill that Hyena to save 50,

2505
02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:46.310
uh,
you know,
pick a impala,
you know,
can you justify that?
If you,

2506
02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:50.500
if your job as a conservationist is to increase numbers of ungulates,

2507
02:25:50.501 --> 02:25:54.670
but still still maintain a balance on the predators,
you know,
there's the key,

2508
02:25:54.671 --> 02:25:58.150
right?
Maintain the balance.
So,
you know,
how do,
how do ya,

2509
02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:00.640
how do you justify you kill them.
You don't eat them but,

2510
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:04.590
but you're increasing the numbers of annulets.
You know,
and again,
we're,

2511
02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:06.490
we're kind of playing God and some of this stuff

2512
02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:10.100
<v 0>where I was in BC,
there's no bag limit on wolves.</v>

2513
02:26:10.310 --> 02:26:14.570
They can shoot as many words as you want.
They were the guys who are there.

2514
02:26:14.571 --> 02:26:16.500
The hunting guy that I was with,
um,

2515
02:26:16.820 --> 02:26:20.360
big country outfitters and some of the people that I met in the town,

2516
02:26:20.390 --> 02:26:23.180
they were describing like the wolf situations out of control.

2517
02:26:23.181 --> 02:26:26.150
They have wolves took down a cow.
My uh,
friend's neighbor,

2518
02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:31.070
2000 pound cow is just bowls descended upon.
It just started ripping it apart.

2519
02:26:31.071 --> 02:26:32.390
They looked out the window,

2520
02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:36.710
they heard howling and the craziness and these wolves are ripping apart cow.

2521
02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:37.720
<v 1>Yeah,
there,
there,</v>

2522
02:26:37.730 --> 02:26:41.750
there's a lot of walls up there and there and they breed quickly.
You know,

2523
02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:43.040
they'll have litter of five,

2524
02:26:43.041 --> 02:26:47.020
six babies and they have five or six babies within two years of is,

2525
02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:50.630
it's a number that increases very quickly as it were saying in Yellowstone

2526
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:55.140
<v 0>ballpark.
I ran into a guy at the airport.
Really Interesting Guy Cause uh,
he,
uh,</v>

2527
02:26:55.170 --> 02:26:59.340
saw that I was checking in a rifle when I was coming back and he was a hunter

2528
02:26:59.700 --> 02:27:03.180
but,
uh,
just very,
very intelligent,
articulate guy.

2529
02:27:03.181 --> 02:27:06.870
But he was talking to me about how much he enjoys hunting walls and like that's

2530
02:27:06.871 --> 02:27:10.680
a crazy subject to dis trike up at somebody because if you just randomly struck

2531
02:27:10.681 --> 02:27:12.180
up,
you know,
he's a moose hunter,

2532
02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:15.360
but he enjoys hunting the wolves because they're a huge,

2533
02:27:15.390 --> 02:27:16.530
they'd just decimate the them,

2534
02:27:16.590 --> 02:27:19.680
the moose populations and decimate the elk and the deer populations.

2535
02:27:20.130 --> 02:27:23.370
And he was just talking about how this tract of land,

2536
02:27:23.371 --> 02:27:27.840
he owns a large piece of land up there about how he's driven the wolves off of

2537
02:27:27.841 --> 02:27:29.970
his land because he's killed so many of them there.

2538
02:27:30.270 --> 02:27:33.480
But there's no way you even put a dent in the population.
He's like,
it's a Gel.

2539
02:27:33.481 --> 02:27:34.260
Like people,

2540
02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:38.550
they have this idea of what it is in the city and what he was telling me about

2541
02:27:38.551 --> 02:27:41.130
what the p,
the people that,
uh,
uh,
a hunted with were telling me about,

2542
02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:44.850
that they had a situation where these wolves,

2543
02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:48.710
they were taking the wolves and they would take the Alpha male and they were,

2544
02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:50.610
it's spam.
They would a nude room,

2545
02:27:50.730 --> 02:27:53.580
take his balls and release him back into the wild.

2546
02:27:53.581 --> 02:27:55.770
They thought that was going to control the population.

2547
02:27:56.220 --> 02:28:00.870
So then they came back after a couple of years and there was a huge increase in

2548
02:28:00.871 --> 02:28:05.490
the amount of wolves because the pack that existed that had this one alpha male

2549
02:28:05.610 --> 02:28:09.870
was overrun by another pack that realized that they were weak.
The these other,

2550
02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:11.980
there's other wolves came in and go,
look at these motherfuckers.

2551
02:28:11.981 --> 02:28:15.750
It's guy doesn't even have any balls,
so they kill him.
They killed him,

2552
02:28:15.751 --> 02:28:18.690
probably ate them and then just swarmed.

2553
02:28:18.691 --> 02:28:21.650
And there was just a hundred more wolves than there were before.

2554
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.940
<v 3>And they're like,
well,
this is fucking crazy.
It didn't work at all like this.</v>

2555
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:28.550
These the best laid plans of mice and men,
you know,
it just

2556
02:28:28.970 --> 02:28:32.850
<v 1>of getting off to stray.
Yeah,
that's a,
I mean,
you know,</v>

2557
02:28:32.860 --> 02:28:36.220
it was good intentions and I mean if you're trying to avoid killing a wolf,

2558
02:28:36.221 --> 02:28:37.510
that's one way to do it I guess.

2559
02:28:37.511 --> 02:28:41.590
But if you're trying to manage the population of wolves,

2560
02:28:41.860 --> 02:28:43.990
this is ludicrous.
So it makes no sense.

2561
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:47.540
<v 3>Well,
they were describing that the people in Vancouver are,</v>

2562
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:51.470
it's also the same province,
it's the same area.
And the people in Vancouver,

2563
02:28:51.471 --> 02:28:53.390
they're all urban,
they're living in cities.

2564
02:28:53.391 --> 02:28:57.470
They think wolves are cute and they're voting on how all this goes down.

2565
02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:00.740
And then the people who were up there in the Bush,
you know,

2566
02:29:00.741 --> 02:29:05.090
they're here in the Howells every now and then like she'll fuck these guys.
Like,

2567
02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:09.470
come hang out with me.
Come,
come,
come be up here and come take a look at history.

2568
02:29:09.471 --> 02:29:12.950
Come take a look at the fact that wolves killed 40 people in Paris one year in

2569
02:29:12.951 --> 02:29:17.480
the 14 hundreds or during World War One when they actually had to call a cease

2570
02:29:17.481 --> 02:29:20.360
fire between the Russians and the Germans because they were getting so many of

2571
02:29:20.361 --> 02:29:22.760
them were getting killed by wolves.
They said,
listen,

2572
02:29:22.970 --> 02:29:24.320
they were in Russia and they go,
look,

2573
02:29:24.321 --> 02:29:27.380
just stop killing each other for a little bit.
Fuck these wolves up,

2574
02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:30.470
drop the populations down and then go back to business.

2575
02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:35.740
Like that's a very rare or a rarely discussed piece of history and actual cease

2576
02:29:37.101 --> 02:29:39.560
fire between Russians and Germans just to do

2577
02:29:39.810 --> 02:29:42.420
<v 1>with wolves killing soldiers.
And I've heard of,</v>

2578
02:29:42.421 --> 02:29:44.460
I've heard right now they have issues up there again,

2579
02:29:44.470 --> 02:29:48.480
they're packs of 60 70 walls running around taking down horses,

2580
02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:51.180
taking Oh kill everything.
That's,
I mean,

2581
02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:54.410
and to say the wolves won't attack humans.
They said,
they say that that's,

2582
02:29:54.411 --> 02:29:56.310
that's absolute bunk.
You know,

2583
02:29:56.311 --> 02:29:59.310
in Saskatchewan a couple of years ago a guy was killed,
you know,

2584
02:29:59.311 --> 02:30:02.250
the scientists tried to say,
oh,
it's maybe a bare of,
I mean it's a wolf,

2585
02:30:02.251 --> 02:30:05.250
it's a wolf.
Kill Them.
There was an attack in British Columbia recently too,

2586
02:30:05.251 --> 02:30:09.690
on one of the islands.
Again,
Wolf,
you know,
so they will,
they will attack.

2587
02:30:09.691 --> 02:30:10.524
And that the,

2588
02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:15.620
the biggest problem is we've made it easy for the wolves to kill animals.

2589
02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:20.380
You know,
we build roads.
Soon as you build a road,
whether it's a logging road,

2590
02:30:20.381 --> 02:30:21.960
a trail,
Skeeter trail,
doesn't matter.

2591
02:30:22.290 --> 02:30:25.860
The rules can run that trail much easier than they can over rough terrain.

2592
02:30:26.220 --> 02:30:29.690
So they run that trail until they hit a track of,
uh,
you know,

2593
02:30:29.691 --> 02:30:32.250
a Mousse and then they off they go kill the Moose back on the trail,

2594
02:30:32.251 --> 02:30:35.160
run it until they hit a track of a deer,
kill it.
You know,
elk kill it.

2595
02:30:35.490 --> 02:30:39.160
We've made it too easy for them to survive.
So we've actually,
you know,

2596
02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:43.320
people say,
let nature take care of it,
boom and bust.
That's not what's happening.

2597
02:30:43.321 --> 02:30:45.800
It's not natural.
We have built roads,

2598
02:30:45.801 --> 02:30:49.670
so we've made their advantage to grate over the ungulates Va.

2599
02:30:49.860 --> 02:30:53.970
We've added an unnatural element.
Exactly.
So pretty natural because it's humans.

2600
02:30:54.240 --> 02:30:56.050
We've done a beaver makes a damn right.

2601
02:30:56.100 --> 02:31:00.870
But then it's also natural for us to manage that population of wolves to kill

2602
02:31:00.871 --> 02:31:04.340
them.
So back to your question.
Oh,
how do you,
how do you justify it?
Wolf?
I,

2603
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:07.260
you know,
I don't have a problem justifying killing a wolf.
You know,

2604
02:31:07.261 --> 02:31:11.430
the Hyena over in Africa,
that money for the trophy fees goes to the village.

2605
02:31:11.431 --> 02:31:12.960
So the Hyena died.

2606
02:31:12.961 --> 02:31:17.490
But in general it helped a while a population as a whole,
you know,

2607
02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:21.990
if you get into the,
you know,
the deep philosophical question of it,

2608
02:31:21.991 --> 02:31:25.350
biologically,
it makes no difference that that animal got killed.

2609
02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:29.760
It was going to die anyway.
You know,
it's,
everybody dies,
everything dies.

2610
02:31:29.761 --> 02:31:32.220
And how it dies is irrelevant.
You know,

2611
02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:36.670
as long as the population is stable or,
or even growing,

2612
02:31:36.690 --> 02:31:40.260
then it doesn't matter why you killed it.
And ultimately as hunters,

2613
02:31:40.261 --> 02:31:42.870
you don't really need to justify it to anybody.
Why you hunted?

2614
02:31:43.140 --> 02:31:48.030
I hunt because I hunt.
I hunt and killing as part of hunt.
You know,
that's,
it's,

2615
02:31:48.031 --> 02:31:50.490
it's what I do.
So,
so I,
you know,

2616
02:31:52.050 --> 02:31:57.030
but put to to couch it in terms of a non hunter would understand why you killed

2617
02:31:57.031 --> 02:32:01.890
that Hyena.
It was very difficult.
Very,
it's very difficult.
And I,
you know,

2618
02:32:01.891 --> 02:32:06.520
since elephants are big one,
that's a,
that's a hot point.
That's the mean.

2619
02:32:06.521 --> 02:32:09.060
You said earlier that you've hunted elephants.
We say,

2620
02:32:09.330 --> 02:32:13.920
I want to kill an elephant to someone named the almost universal reaction in a

2621
02:32:13.921 --> 02:32:18.060
city.
He's like,
you're an asshole.
I want to kill an elephant answer.

2622
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:23.050
You're an asshole to,
you know,
the elephant situation over there is so tragic.
Uh,

2623
02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:28.880
I was in cr a couple of years ago and we were between the elephant herd and the

2624
02:32:29.341 --> 02:32:30.420
Sudanese rebels.

2625
02:32:30.690 --> 02:32:35.370
They were on horseback and chasing after the elephants and popcorn with AK 47

2626
02:32:35.380 --> 02:32:38.810
just popped up dup,
dup,
dup,
dup,
dup,
dup,
and we were between them.
This,
you know,

2627
02:32:38.850 --> 02:32:43.020
they went right by us.
They,
they shoot him,
kill him.
The entire herd babies.

2628
02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:46.140
Doesn't matter if it's got a pound of ivory,
it's going to get killed.

2629
02:32:46.650 --> 02:32:48.380
Then following them are the,

2630
02:32:48.381 --> 02:32:53.381
the pack trains of camels and more donkeys with the people that then butcher up.

2631
02:32:53.911 --> 02:32:56.490
The elephants at the horseback,
riders have killed.

2632
02:32:57.120 --> 02:33:01.980
They were literally extra painting the elephant from car.

2633
02:33:01.981 --> 02:33:06.690
And I,
at this point right now,
I,
I tried to get back into a bang we last year,

2634
02:33:06.691 --> 02:33:07.524
but it was,

2635
02:33:07.860 --> 02:33:12.120
it was the civil war was going on and I air France wasn't even flying in there.

2636
02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:17.460
I just have a feeling that CR elephants are gone.
They're gone.

2637
02:33:17.850 --> 02:33:20.120
Um,
we're having the same thing now on camera,

2638
02:33:20.121 --> 02:33:24.360
on the northern Savannah regions of Cabernet when they were five years ago,

2639
02:33:24.361 --> 02:33:28.080
there's elephants everywhere.
Gone.
I was in Tanzania and the Solu,

2640
02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:33.170
the slew is the largest game reserve in the world.
It was,
it was,
uh,
uh,
what,
what,

2641
02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:37.800
how big is it?
Uh,
uh,
it'll come to me with 6 million acre or something,

2642
02:33:37.801 --> 02:33:40.260
something just absolutely enormous.

2643
02:33:40.770 --> 02:33:45.540
And when I was there five years ago,
I probably saw,

2644
02:33:45.930 --> 02:33:49.680
I dunno,
a thousand elephants,
there were 90,000,

2645
02:33:49.681 --> 02:33:52.770
98,000 elephants in the Solu 10 years ago.

2646
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:57.030
Today they feel there may be 8,000 altogether.
And I was just there.

2647
02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:00.690
We did an uncharted segments in the aunt on the Solu and on the elephants.

2648
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:05.700
I found skull after skull after skull faces chainsawed off,

2649
02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:10.590
uh,
ivory gone.
And these are young elephants,
their young ones,
you know,
they're,

2650
02:34:10.591 --> 02:34:13.780
they're actually,
you know,
the shooting,
cause it's easy to carry the ivory.
It's,

2651
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:16.320
they're going to shoot everything and two pounds of ivory,

2652
02:34:16.321 --> 02:34:17.154
they're going to kill it.

2653
02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:21.880
<v 0>So it's just the unbelievably difficult circumstances that they find themselves</v>

2654
02:34:21.881 --> 02:34:22.750
in as human beings.

2655
02:34:22.751 --> 02:34:26.200
Like they're almost forced into this horrible situation because they're

2656
02:34:26.201 --> 02:34:29.200
incredibly impoverished and there's nothing else for them there.

2657
02:34:29.201 --> 02:34:31.180
There's no other resources.
Is that what the cases

2658
02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:36.040
<v 1>yeah,
there's big money to,
and you know,
not only at their level,
it's big money.</v>

2659
02:34:36.041 --> 02:34:39.940
Maybe they get what they're saying.
They get $300 for an elephant,
you know,

2660
02:34:39.941 --> 02:34:44.090
just to 10 pounds of ivory.
The money that,

2661
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:47.950
that I read then goes to the middleman who then goes to another middle man who

2662
02:34:47.951 --> 02:34:49.840
then another middle man and finally,
you know,

2663
02:34:49.841 --> 02:34:51.250
to the big guys and get shipped out.

2664
02:34:51.850 --> 02:34:56.500
There's huge money at high levels in those African countries.

2665
02:34:56.980 --> 02:34:58.420
Um,
I mean,
I,

2666
02:34:58.810 --> 02:35:02.560
I think we'd be surprised at who is behind a lot of the WHO's making money off

2667
02:35:02.561 --> 02:35:03.850
the poaching of the ivory.

2668
02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:09.540
And the only thing that in the saloon that was stopping the poaching where the

2669
02:35:10.001 --> 02:35:13.510
hunters,
the hunters were there,
but it was too little.

2670
02:35:13.690 --> 02:35:16.000
It was just not enough.
We needed a,

2671
02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:20.080
we needed a a thousand times more hunters in there that we'd had a thousand

2672
02:35:20.081 --> 02:35:22.720
times more dollars.
You could have kept the poachers out.
Yeah,

2673
02:35:22.721 --> 02:35:24.760
you're losing some of the older bulls,
but they're,
you know,

2674
02:35:24.761 --> 02:35:28.330
very carefully controlled,
very carefully harvested out of this herd.

2675
02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:33.280
Not when it happens to be poaching it,
everything gets wiped out.
Babies,

2676
02:35:33.281 --> 02:35:35.760
mothers doesn't matter.
And I,
you know,

2677
02:35:35.770 --> 02:35:39.100
there's a case of where the hunting dollars just weren't enough,

2678
02:35:39.130 --> 02:35:43.640
but the hunters were the only ones between the poachers and the elephants and,

2679
02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:47.500
and you just can't hold back that tide.
There's too many poachers,

2680
02:35:47.501 --> 02:35:51.650
too much demand from Asia,
and not enough money on the hunting side to,

2681
02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:55.960
to finance the anti poaching patrols that you need it,
you know,
and,
and you know,

2682
02:35:55.961 --> 02:35:57.970
now,
after the,
they're pretty well decimated,

2683
02:35:57.971 --> 02:36:01.330
the government's come back in and they're starting to impose heavy fines for

2684
02:36:01.331 --> 02:36:05.140
poaching now in Tanzania,
you know,
20 years if you're caught with,

2685
02:36:05.170 --> 02:36:08.840
with poached meat.
And if you're an elephant,
you're,
you're,
you know,

2686
02:36:08.841 --> 02:36:13.390
you're going to jail for life if you don't get shot,
you know,
on the way to jail.

2687
02:36:13.450 --> 02:36:16.240
There are serious about it now.
But,
but it begs a question,

2688
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:17.950
why did they wait until now?

2689
02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:23.340
Why did they wait til 90,000 elephants were killed in the last 10 years in one

2690
02:36:23.471 --> 02:36:26.260
area,
one easily to protect area with,
you know,
it takes money,

2691
02:36:26.261 --> 02:36:29.530
but why were they killed?
Who was making the money?
Follow the money.

2692
02:36:29.531 --> 02:36:33.190
And that's when you'll find out the reason why the that happened.
You know?

2693
02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:36.910
And I think we'd be surprised.
Like I say,
who's behind it when they stop hunting?

2694
02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:41.920
You open the doors for the poachers and uh,
it's,
it's a tough one.
I mean,

2695
02:36:41.921 --> 02:36:45.790
it's really,
really sad.
Then Botswana shuts down hunting altogether.
You know,

2696
02:36:45.791 --> 02:36:49.990
very wealthy country,
lots of tourism and too many elephants.

2697
02:36:50.350 --> 02:36:55.350
The elephants are actually ruining the ecosystems near the river Rhine Habitat.

2698
02:36:55.800 --> 02:36:59.890
You're going to walk 10 miles to find a tree that's not been torn down in some

2699
02:36:59.891 --> 02:37:03.910
places.
You know,
everything that relied on those trees,

2700
02:37:03.911 --> 02:37:06.160
that ecosystem is dead and gone.

2701
02:37:06.580 --> 02:37:09.820
All the antelope that required the trees and there's too many elephants for the

2702
02:37:09.821 --> 02:37:11.680
habitat now in South Africa,

2703
02:37:11.681 --> 02:37:15.290
they used to go in and rent up until I'd say the 70s they were,

2704
02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:19.910
they were calling them,
they would walk in and kill the entire herd off.
You know,

2705
02:37:19.911 --> 02:37:21.230
cause they knew there's too many elephants.

2706
02:37:21.231 --> 02:37:25.280
They actually reproduced too quickly when they're protected.

2707
02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:29.240
So you end up with this,
this two sided problem.

2708
02:37:29.241 --> 02:37:30.770
Too many elephants in Botswana,

2709
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:36.170
elephants being wiped out by Sudanese poachers and places like cr,

2710
02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:39.470
Cameroon,
even Congo there,
they're everywhere now.
Tanzania,

2711
02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:44.660
a Somali poachers are coming down into Tanzania.
It's a,

2712
02:37:44.661 --> 02:37:48.140
it's a really,
really sad thing.
And that,
that,
that's,

2713
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:53.060
that's one where I don't see the,
uh,
I,
I don't see a solution for it.

2714
02:37:53.061 --> 02:37:57.680
I honestly don't.
I don't,
I just think that the world,
it's,
it's,

2715
02:37:57.710 --> 02:38:01.520
it's like Lord of the rings where the Elvis realized this world isn't for us

2716
02:38:01.521 --> 02:38:04.250
anymore.
And the elephants,
I'm a,
I'm really,
really,

2717
02:38:04.251 --> 02:38:08.600
really afraid that they're just no hope for them in spite of the dollars that

2718
02:38:08.601 --> 02:38:12.650
hunters put in to these areas to stop poaching.
I,
I,
it's a,

2719
02:38:12.651 --> 02:38:14.000
it's a real sad one for me.

2720
02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:18.450
<v 0>Have you ever seen,
do you know who Louis Theroux is thorough,
thorough,</v>

2721
02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:21.640
and he said,
well,
I said,
I,
you it,
I'm probably said it wrong.
I think,

2722
02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:25.360
I think he said that through,
right.
Anyway,
um,

2723
02:38:25.390 --> 02:38:29.710
he's a documentary guy from England.
Great Guy,
had him on the podcast for a very,

2724
02:38:29.711 --> 02:38:30.580
very interesting guy.

2725
02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:35.590
And he had a great piece about Africa and about the hunting camps in Africa.

2726
02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:36.933
And,
uh,

2727
02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:42.150
one of the most profound moments in it was when he's kind of talking to this guy

2728
02:38:42.641 --> 02:38:47.320
who runs this wild game farm and he's annoying the guy and you know,
the guy,

2729
02:38:47.321 --> 02:38:50.200
he's been there for like three weeks talking to them and videotaping him.

2730
02:38:50.201 --> 02:38:52.000
The guy shows him all the lions that they,

2731
02:38:52.001 --> 02:38:55.050
they're feeding lines or throwing a calf over the like,

2732
02:38:55.051 --> 02:38:58.180
it's just like Jurassic Park.
They throw this calf over the fence of lions,

2733
02:38:58.181 --> 02:39:01.350
tear it apart in front of them.
It's like wild shit.
Um,

2734
02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:05.860
but he's talking to this guy and finally the guide just sort of breaks down and

2735
02:39:05.861 --> 02:39:08.590
he's like,
you don't get it.
Like Africa is fucked.

2736
02:39:09.010 --> 02:39:12.550
Like this is the only thing that keeps these animals alive is the fact there

2737
02:39:12.551 --> 02:39:16.690
were something like this is,
this is what keeps him alive.
If it wasn't for that,

2738
02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:18.970
they'd be nothing.
They would just destroy everything.

2739
02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:23.800
<v 1>No,
the Africa is in dire straits and as I say,</v>

2740
02:39:23.801 --> 02:39:27.790
Africa is being colonized right now.
You know,

2741
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:29.583
to me,

2742
02:39:29.710 --> 02:39:34.030
you can call a nice two different ways militarily or economically in Africa is

2743
02:39:34.031 --> 02:39:35.500
being colonized economically.

2744
02:39:36.010 --> 02:39:39.670
And if you look at the track record of WHO's colonizing Africa,

2745
02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:44.260
you know,
the wildlife track record.
And I,
you know,
and again this,
you're talking,

2746
02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:46.880
this is big world politics that who am I?

2747
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:51.010
I'm a little guy that sits on a mountain and just looks at stuff and sees it

2748
02:39:51.011 --> 02:39:55.930
hopefully objectively.
And if this Africa,

2749
02:39:56.020 --> 02:39:58.840
20 years from now,
you know,

2750
02:39:58.841 --> 02:40:01.270
they're the only place you're going to probably find wildlife is going to be on

2751
02:40:01.271 --> 02:40:05.640
the parks.
Wow.
And that's,
you know,
hunting is,
is helping,
you know,

2752
02:40:05.650 --> 02:40:09.220
the parks will be bigger because of hunting.
We can hold them back on the,

2753
02:40:10.090 --> 02:40:14.200
on the boundaries of the park of buffer zone,
but,
but it's,
uh,

2754
02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:18.540
<v 2>it's actually really,
it's really sad that we set up a feet on the ground thing,</v>

2755
02:40:18.541 --> 02:40:20.430
as you said,
like you've,
unless you're there,

2756
02:40:20.431 --> 02:40:25.140
you don't truly understand the situation.
Yeah.
I mean,
we,
we get,
we get fed,

2757
02:40:25.300 --> 02:40:28.510
you know,
the propaganda from our press,
right.
Uh,
and,

2758
02:40:28.650 --> 02:40:33.100
and a lot of it's sensationalism.
What sells the,

2759
02:40:33.101 --> 02:40:35.800
the go talk to somebody in Africa that,

2760
02:40:35.810 --> 02:40:39.150
that's living the life there and see what they say about Ivan Carter.

2761
02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:42.600
Pull that back down.
Jamie.
Don't scroll it.
It Chinese Africans knew.

2762
02:40:42.601 --> 02:40:45.540
Colonial overlord says fame,
primate research.
Jane Goodall.

2763
02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:49.770
You know what else Jane Goodall's house.
Big Foot's real.
So yeah.

2764
02:40:49.771 --> 02:40:52.380
So take it with a grain of salt.
Yeah,
I've,
I've actually heard,

2765
02:40:52.381 --> 02:40:56.130
I know quite a few people that know her and they say she's,
she's a you,

2766
02:40:56.220 --> 02:41:00.180
she'll drink beer and she'll slice to party you.
Yeah.
Oh,
she'll,
she'll,

2767
02:41:00.181 --> 02:41:03.800
she's not afraid of cuss words and she'll huh?
Yeah,
that's what I've heard.

2768
02:41:03.801 --> 02:41:05.740
And I don't know Jane,
I'm sorry for this thing with,

2769
02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:09.210
she's probably a huge fan of yours and she's listening right now over and,
oh,

2770
02:41:09.211 --> 02:41:12.000
I have no idea.
I should probably thinks I'm an idiot.
More likely.

2771
02:41:12.310 --> 02:41:16.700
But she does believe in big foot.
Is that right?
Is She's just a,

2772
02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:20.550
there's a,
um,
well,
I have to play the clip.
We played it,
played it before,

2773
02:41:20.551 --> 02:41:25.110
but she is convinced that there's some unknown primate.

2774
02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:27.900
I think there's someone owned primary,

2775
02:41:27.940 --> 02:41:29.130
I don't think there's a question about that,

2776
02:41:29.131 --> 02:41:33.230
but there'll will be in the Democratic Republic of Congo somewhere it was

2777
02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:36.390
[inaudible] was or whatever they call it.
Yeah.
Well do you know about that?
Uh,

2778
02:41:36.391 --> 02:41:40.590
the Billy ape or the,
the uh,
uh,
this,
this,
this,

2779
02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:44.670
this giant a chimpanzee that they've found in the Congo,

2780
02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:48.540
uh,
may have heard about it.
Yeah.
It's,
um,

2781
02:41:49.050 --> 02:41:54.050
there's this version of a chimpanzee that they found in the Congo that's much

2782
02:41:54.301 --> 02:41:58.700
larger.
It's about six feet tall.
Sometimes there's one of them.
They,
uh,

2783
02:41:58.770 --> 02:42:02.460
they can get up to like 400 pounds and enormous chimpanzee.

2784
02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:03.990
Is that the ones that are,

2785
02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:07.250
they're quite friendly or they don't fight or something or they know that's it.

2786
02:42:07.251 --> 02:42:11.160
But no bows because those are smaller.
Actually.
Those are,
uh,

2787
02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:14.040
those are like the least violent.
Um,
these ones,

2788
02:42:14.041 --> 02:42:18.550
the locals call them lion killers.
What was the other term?
Form the,
but no,
not,

2789
02:42:18.551 --> 02:42:22.680
it's not the Bondo.
The bondo,
the Bondo.
Ayp.
And they,

2790
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:26.850
they thought it was a myth until like 19,
the 1990s.

2791
02:42:26.851 --> 02:42:29.580
Carl Amon is a Swiss wildlife photographer,

2792
02:42:29.970 --> 02:42:34.350
became infatuated with them and started using camera traps and got a photo of

2793
02:42:34.351 --> 02:42:38.790
one walking upright.
It's very strange when you see this thing that's very odd.

2794
02:42:38.820 --> 02:42:43.820
Chimpanzee the six foot Tall Chimpanzee walking upright say yeah,

2795
02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:46.700
they nest on the ground like gorillas.
Yup.

2796
02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:51.690
Cause they really don't give a shit who's looking at anything.
Toughest guys.

2797
02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:54.150
They're just,
they're,
they're,
you know,

2798
02:42:54.151 --> 02:42:58.770
when a chimpanzee walks up to your wild one there,
there are frightening animal.

2799
02:42:58.830 --> 02:43:03.200
Oh yeah.
Scary looking,
scary acting.
Have you seen him in the wild?
Oh yeah.
A lot.

2800
02:43:03.210 --> 02:43:06.390
Yeah.
Grillers as well.
And the chimps would come up to you in the wild,

2801
02:43:06.391 --> 02:43:08.250
like what is that experience like?
Well they're there.

2802
02:43:08.490 --> 02:43:12.040
Normally if they come up to us it's because we're calling for Dikers,
a little

2803
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:14.080
<v 1>forest antelope,
you know,
there's all,</v>

2804
02:43:14.081 --> 02:43:18.190
there's 20 or 30 different species that live in the jungles very far to very

2805
02:43:18.191 --> 02:43:22.600
difficult to hunt.
And so what we do is we sneak around and then set up,

2806
02:43:22.601 --> 02:43:26.950
sit down,
call [inaudible] trying for whatever reason,

2807
02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:30.850
the Dikers come to this distress call and they'll come running in.

2808
02:43:30.851 --> 02:43:34.090
But they're not the only things that come into the distress calls.
They,

2809
02:43:34.091 --> 02:43:35.740
the chimpanzees are carnivorous.

2810
02:43:35.741 --> 02:43:39.760
They'll come in absolutely 100% to come and kill whatever is making that noise

2811
02:43:39.761 --> 02:43:44.650
and eat it.
So when they come in there,
they're nasty,
nasty,
and big.

2812
02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:48.520
They're big.
You know,
you see the muscles,
how they're ripped.
It's a,

2813
02:43:48.521 --> 02:43:51.040
it's a frightening thing.
Grill is not,
you know,
grill,
grill is,

2814
02:43:51.041 --> 02:43:55.750
are big as well and,
and surely vegetarian.
Yeah,
they don't,
they,
it was scary.

2815
02:43:56.110 --> 02:43:56.531
Like they,

2816
02:43:56.531 --> 02:44:00.640
they will turn you inside out when one comes out of the Bush at you just

2817
02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:04.780
shaking all the trees right in front of you.
And then they're gone.

2818
02:44:05.450 --> 02:44:09.240
They got killed by the pygmies.
They get eaten their food source.
So they're,

2819
02:44:09.241 --> 02:44:12.900
they hate people.
Hate people.
Isn't that crazy?
They're,
they'll eat gorillas.

2820
02:44:12.901 --> 02:44:16.270
Those,
yeah,
they're,
they're an amazing animal.
I last year I spent,
uh,

2821
02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:20.570
I was in a Mishawn,
uh,
again on the border with,

2822
02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:25.030
with the Congo and had a troop of will a nine or 11,
uh,

2823
02:44:25.140 --> 02:44:28.480
gorilla's come in with one big silver back and they for 40 minutes in front of

2824
02:44:28.481 --> 02:44:32.980
us,
like 20 hours.
No idea.
We were there.
It was fantastic.
And these aren't,

2825
02:44:32.981 --> 02:44:34.830
these aren't the habituated once from Rwanda.

2826
02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:38.140
You know that everybody goes and pays their $20 and sits there and don't look in

2827
02:44:38.141 --> 02:44:40.750
their eyes.
These are the ones will kill you if there,
if you look,

2828
02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:43.950
look in your eyes not looking your eyes.
If they see you,
their kill you.
Wow.
Yeah.

2829
02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:47.200
Scary animals.
And they had no idea where their video on the whole time.

2830
02:44:47.201 --> 02:44:50.290
It was fantastic.
Wow,
that's amazing.

2831
02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:54.250
Now do you have a rifle ready to go if they make a run for you?
Yeah.

2832
02:44:54.251 --> 02:44:58.210
Which you would never kill.
What?
I mean you'd,
you'd scare them.
I don't,
you know,

2833
02:44:59.590 --> 02:45:01.630
there's a body language.
I think they would,

2834
02:45:02.270 --> 02:45:04.690
they would bluff charge every time I've ever seen him.

2835
02:45:04.691 --> 02:45:05.770
It's always been a bluff charge.

2836
02:45:05.771 --> 02:45:08.680
I've never seen one press a charge right to the very end,

2837
02:45:08.820 --> 02:45:10.780
but I wouldn't see it if I did.
I would be here.

2838
02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:13.800
<v 0>I saw bluff charge online ones.
Oh,</v>

2839
02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:18.400
this guy standing there in this silver back comes charging out of the woods,

2840
02:45:18.610 --> 02:45:21.400
right up to the guy and then just turns away.

2841
02:45:21.401 --> 02:45:26.110
But the guy just stands there and stands his ground.
But this enormous beast,

2842
02:45:26.111 --> 02:45:29.230
I mean I don't know how many hundred of pounds he weighed probably five,

2843
02:45:29.231 --> 02:45:33.840
600 pounds,
just running full charge,
just full of sin,

2844
02:45:33.841 --> 02:45:38.380
you and giant fangs and you're like,
Oh God,
how do you stand still

2845
02:45:38.530 --> 02:45:42.220
<v 1>monsters and the,
and they also roar like a visceral,</v>

2846
02:45:43.390 --> 02:45:47.230
scary feeling inside anybody that's got ears,
you can,
it just

2847
02:45:48.810 --> 02:45:51.880
turned you in a jelly.
It's they're scary.
Or they'll charge your truck.

2848
02:45:51.881 --> 02:45:55.690
I've had them on those little overgrown logging roads come out just right in

2849
02:45:55.691 --> 02:45:59.020
front of why runs down there and then into the bushes and shake the bushes.

2850
02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:03.130
Scares the heck out of here.
That's,
it's a,
it's a neat thing.
And you know,

2851
02:46:03.131 --> 02:46:04.810
they're not habituated animals.
These are,

2852
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:10.110
these are animals that live wild and free hate humans you for a good reason.

2853
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:11.083
<v 2>They get hunted down.</v>

2854
02:46:11.180 --> 02:46:14.780
Is there anything that you haven't hunted that you want to hunt that like is on

2855
02:46:14.781 --> 02:46:19.781
your list of things to go after that you have had difficulty finding maybe?

2856
02:46:19.890 --> 02:46:24.040
Yeah,
I've been out.
I'd love to go into Baluchistan on the border with,
uh,

2857
02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:28.330
uh,
I didn't even know that was a real place.
John Belushi came from,

2858
02:46:28.530 --> 02:46:33.380
now it's a province in Pakistan.
Danger.

2859
02:46:33.410 --> 02:46:34.910
Got to go back to Pakistan.

2860
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:37.220
While I might not be able to after what I've said here today,

2861
02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:40.040
but please just answer.
It's a fascinating place.

2862
02:46:40.041 --> 02:46:44.870
And then it seems like there's an animal called a Sulaiman mark whore,

2863
02:46:45.140 --> 02:46:46.940
which it'll Jason and the fleece.

2864
02:46:46.970 --> 02:46:51.380
That was probably what he was after was a Sulivan mark.
Jason in the fleece.

2865
02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:56.030
It's a Greek tale or I assume it as Jason is Jason and the argonauts.

2866
02:46:56.300 --> 02:47:00.380
No,
the golden fleece.
Who was,
it wasn't adjacent.
I don't know.
I don't know.

2867
02:47:00.510 --> 02:47:03.740
Was talking to this.
Maybe I got my,
uh,
my mythical heroes.

2868
02:47:03.741 --> 02:47:06.170
It was probably after this animal,
what's it called again?

2869
02:47:06.540 --> 02:47:09.230
The Sulaiman mark whore.
Suliman mark.

2870
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:13.490
He got straight horns with,
with kind of a corkscrew on them.

2871
02:47:13.970 --> 02:47:17.080
And the only place you can hunt them is there.
And it's kind of a,

2872
02:47:17.081 --> 02:47:19.370
a real if place right now,
but they,

2873
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:23.450
they have allowed I think five to 10 of these to be hunted a year.

2874
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:26.510
It's all controlled by the warlords over there,
but sites,

2875
02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:28.520
they've got scientists in there and they're these,

2876
02:47:28.521 --> 02:47:32.990
these warlords or are educated in the states or England that they're,
you know,

2877
02:47:32.991 --> 02:47:33.890
they're not dumb guys.

2878
02:47:33.891 --> 02:47:37.220
They speak English very well and they understand conservation there.
You know,

2879
02:47:37.221 --> 02:47:39.680
they just pick one side this week and one side that week,
you know,

2880
02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:41.180
depends on what's going on.
But,

2881
02:47:41.270 --> 02:47:45.740
but they are for conservation of these animals and they get a lot of money for

2882
02:47:45.741 --> 02:47:48.680
them.
They're extremely expensive.
What do they call themselves?

2883
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:52.030
We call them war lords.
That's a,
seems that it's a strange,

2884
02:47:52.050 --> 02:47:55.130
almost archaic designation.
Is this the animal?
Uh,

2885
02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:57.670
that's actually a cashmere more core.
Uh,

2886
02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:01.020
it also could be a look at the horns on that thing.
Yeah.
There,

2887
02:48:01.021 --> 02:48:05.720
there's about three or four different species.
There's a,
what's the other one?

2888
02:48:05.721 --> 02:48:10.570
The uh,
oh,
I was just there.
There's that.
There's a silicon mark or in the middle.

2889
02:48:10.590 --> 02:48:15.080
Middle.
Top.
Wow.
Look at that thing.
Yeah,
it's,
wow.

2890
02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:20.450
That's,
that's like a drill.
Like an oil drill growing out of its head.

2891
02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:25.430
Yeah.
Like two opposing oil drills.
Yeah.
Wow.

2892
02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:28.580
What a strange looking out and that's when obviously that's somebody hunted.

2893
02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:32.570
Yeah,
it's dead and there the Sula and mark or I'd love to go.

2894
02:48:32.571 --> 02:48:35.690
You could also hunt the Afghan urial there and I've not heard that either.

2895
02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:39.920
So those two animals,
I'd love to get into that problem.
Sure.
So bizarre.
I mean,

2896
02:48:39.921 --> 02:48:43.690
even an elk or a moose,
this idea,
they grow these antlers on their head.

2897
02:48:43.691 --> 02:48:47.660
He's enormous racks of login trees grown out of their heads every year.

2898
02:48:47.850 --> 02:48:52.430
That's the hard thing to believe.
They drop them every spring and then grow.
What?

2899
02:48:52.730 --> 02:48:56.300
50 pounds of Horn?
Like a,
an antler on a,
on a moose.

2900
02:48:57.130 --> 02:49:01.430
That's African euro.
They keep it rams.
Keep it all their lives.
Yeah.
That's horn.

2901
02:49:01.470 --> 02:49:05.240
Yeah.
The only one that drops its horns or is the antelope,

2902
02:49:05.241 --> 02:49:08.520
the pronghorn antelope will the sheath,
the outside will drop off every year.

2903
02:49:08.521 --> 02:49:11.820
Otherwise,
otherwise,
horn animals grow every year.

2904
02:49:12.130 --> 02:49:15.540
Antler an animals drop theirs and regrown memory or a passage going born in the

2905
02:49:15.541 --> 02:49:18.090
world.
Antlered animals that drop him.

2906
02:49:18.270 --> 02:49:21.420
Like how long do they have no antlers.
Like an elk,

2907
02:49:21.450 --> 02:49:26.100
like saying when the elk sheds a lot depends on the season.
Uh,

2908
02:49:26.310 --> 02:49:29.340
what the year's going to be like.
If it's a rough winter coming up.

2909
02:49:29.550 --> 02:49:32.420
Seems to be they dropped earlier.
They don't want to carry those,
you know,

2910
02:49:32.430 --> 02:49:36.420
soon as the ruts over,
off they go,
and then they're,
you know,
not caring it.

2911
02:49:36.421 --> 02:49:39.120
There was all there basically testosterone,
I guess.

2912
02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:41.070
So that's what causes them to drop.

2913
02:49:41.310 --> 02:49:44.310
And the only animal that's a female that carries them as Caribou.
Right.

2914
02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:46.680
And does that to defend against wolves and bears.

2915
02:49:46.681 --> 02:49:50.490
And who knows what the reason they're on their head,
but they,
you know,
they're,

2916
02:49:50.491 --> 02:49:54.030
they're so tiny.
I would,
would never protect them from a wolf.
Oh,

2917
02:49:54.031 --> 02:49:58.240
they really small compared to the males.
Males are huge,
you know,

2918
02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:02.160
largest antlered animal compared to body size.

2919
02:50:02.161 --> 02:50:05.190
Largest antlers compared to body size of any,
any animal.
Yeah.

2920
02:50:05.191 --> 02:50:06.580
They don't even look real like you.

2921
02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:08.880
If you care about the shovels and all the crazy stuff,

2922
02:50:08.881 --> 02:50:13.100
they get grown off their head like that's,
that's like a Whoville thing.
Exactly.

2923
02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:16.960
Yeah.
Something from doctor said.
Exactly.
No,
it's fascinating.
They're there.

2924
02:50:16.990 --> 02:50:20.760
Caribou or an underrated big game animal love hunting and Mountain Caribou

2925
02:50:20.761 --> 02:50:23.970
particularly.
That's,
that's of all the Caribou species.

2926
02:50:23.971 --> 02:50:27.530
That's my favorite to hunt.
And do you prefer like when you,

2927
02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:29.160
you're going into these,
these places,

2928
02:50:29.161 --> 02:50:32.730
do you prefer to do it with a camera crew or do you get a chance to hunt where

2929
02:50:32.731 --> 02:50:34.830
you just hunt sometimes?
No.
Well

2930
02:50:35.170 --> 02:50:38.630
<v 1>I don't,
I would have difficulty hunting without a camera crew.</v>

2931
02:50:38.631 --> 02:50:42.000
And the reason is because it's become part of the challenge.
It's,

2932
02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:45.830
it's far more difficult to hunt when you've got to drag along,

2933
02:50:45.890 --> 02:50:50.210
at least one guy sometimes too.
And you can only,
you can't shoot into the sun.

2934
02:50:50.211 --> 02:50:53.360
You can't.
If there's a flakes on the lands,
we've got to call it off.

2935
02:50:53.361 --> 02:50:56.630
If they can't get an in focus,
if I could shoot where they can't see it,

2936
02:50:56.631 --> 02:50:59.480
if it's too dark for them to see,
but it's legal light and I can see it.

2937
02:50:59.750 --> 02:51:03.500
I can't shoot and has to be broad side head up.
You know,

2938
02:51:03.501 --> 02:51:08.300
you start throwing in all of these extra degrees of difficulty.
It to me,

2939
02:51:08.301 --> 02:51:10.520
it's become part of the challenge of the hunt nowadays.

2940
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:12.980
And I want to share it with everybody.
I mean,
I'm in a,

2941
02:51:13.370 --> 02:51:17.690
I'm in a position in my life and in my career where I can,
you know,

2942
02:51:17.691 --> 02:51:22.070
I'm able to,
so why wouldn't I share it with the guys that can't go along.

2943
02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:25.430
There are hunters that maybe,
you know,
they would love to,

2944
02:51:25.431 --> 02:51:27.680
maybe they don't have the money,
maybe they don't have the time.
Maybe they,

2945
02:51:27.980 --> 02:51:29.990
you know,
for whatever reason can't do it.

2946
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:35.950
My goal when I started doing the television hunting television was to bring all

2947
02:51:35.961 --> 02:51:37.970
of these fellow hunters with me.
You know,

2948
02:51:37.971 --> 02:51:40.850
they're there with me as much as they can be.
They're not pulling the trigger,

2949
02:51:40.851 --> 02:51:45.440
but their experience and exactly what I'm experiencing.
So to me,

2950
02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:49.700
to,
to,
it's a responsibility now and,
and it's also a challenge and I love it.

2951
02:51:49.701 --> 02:51:52.550
I mean,
I,
I,
you know,
I wanna I want,

2952
02:51:52.551 --> 02:51:55.350
I'm proud of being a hunter and I want to share it with,

2953
02:51:55.351 --> 02:51:58.220
with other hunters that want to watch or with people that want to learn about

2954
02:51:58.460 --> 02:52:00.800
conservation and why hunting is good.
So,

2955
02:52:00.801 --> 02:52:05.410
so to me to not hunt with a camera would be,
why would I kill then?

2956
02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:09.580
It's other than to eat it,
you know,
so it's,
uh,
I don't know,

2957
02:52:09.581 --> 02:52:12.610
maybe as part of the reason I,
you know,
justification for hunting.

2958
02:52:13.060 --> 02:52:17.170
Do you eat any store bought meat?
Well,
you know,
if,

2959
02:52:17.400 --> 02:52:21.010
if I'm at our convention season's coming up,
so there'll be,

2960
02:52:21.011 --> 02:52:24.700
I'll be wine and dine and taken to the fanciest steakhouses around and that's in

2961
02:52:24.701 --> 02:52:26.740
Vegas at the shot show shot show.
Yeah,
that'll be,

2962
02:52:26.741 --> 02:52:30.220
that'll be one of the shows with sci.
And we've got Ata,
the archery trade show,

2963
02:52:30.730 --> 02:52:35.620
um,
the Dallas Safari Club,
you know,
so,
so yeah,
I will eat,

2964
02:52:35.740 --> 02:52:40.510
store bought meat,
but it's always in those kinds of situations.
I can't,

2965
02:52:41.020 --> 02:52:45.050
I can't recall last time Louisie or you know,

2966
02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:48.730
brought store,
bought meat into our house.
I mean it's just not,

2967
02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:52.780
I mean we live on Moose and Caribou and deer,
you know,
bear,
if we have it,

2968
02:52:52.781 --> 02:52:55.450
if it sits,
it's what we eat now.
Bear not so much.
I've,

2969
02:52:55.451 --> 02:52:59.590
I've eaten lots of bears in my life so I prefer to share the bears with southern

2970
02:52:59.591 --> 02:53:03.780
people.
It's not my favorite is still good,
but it's not my favorite.
But uh,

2971
02:53:03.820 --> 02:53:07.870
to buy me to it makes no sense.
Why would we do eat grizzly?
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

2972
02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:11.980
What does that like?
I've heard it's disgusting.
No,
now that,
that's,
that's,

2973
02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:15.820
that's such bonk on the,
the,
the people that say that while game is Gamey,

2974
02:53:16.450 --> 02:53:19.690
it's all in the preparation.
So if you're,
if if it goes,

2975
02:53:19.691 --> 02:53:21.380
he's been eating salmon for instance,
and,

2976
02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:26.760
and you cut a big chunk of steak off and a big swath of fat on it and you know,

2977
02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:31.150
fry it up.
Well guess what?
It smells like.
Smells like rotten fish.

2978
02:53:31.151 --> 02:53:32.890
Cause guess that's what he's been eating,
right?

2979
02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:37.240
We get rid of the fat and just take off the mile and cheating and just have the

2980
02:53:37.241 --> 02:53:41.320
meat.
It's excellent.
It's excellent.
Same as polar bear.
It's,
it's good.
You know,

2981
02:53:41.321 --> 02:53:44.440
black bears are excellent.
I mean,
most of the time they just eat,
uh,

2982
02:53:44.890 --> 02:53:47.530
eat berries and grass,
clover,
whatever.

2983
02:53:47.620 --> 02:53:50.110
I was amazed at how good blackberry tastes.
No,
it's really good.

2984
02:53:50.200 --> 02:53:53.770
That's really good.
As one of the things that I,
that I got criticized for,

2985
02:53:54.010 --> 02:53:57.160
people were telling me that back black bears tasted terrible.
Like,

2986
02:53:57.161 --> 02:53:59.110
why do you want to shoot something that you're not going to eat?

2987
02:53:59.111 --> 02:54:03.280
And I was really concerned.
I was like,
man,
who's telling the truth here?

2988
02:54:03.281 --> 02:54:07.930
Until I actually tried it,
I tried it before actually shot one and I was like,
oh,

2989
02:54:08.170 --> 02:54:09.003
they're just lying.

2990
02:54:09.010 --> 02:54:12.280
Or they don't know or can't I define anybody to tell that they're reading a

2991
02:54:12.281 --> 02:54:16.810
black bear as opposed to,
I mean,
I honestly,
I suspect I could,
you know,

2992
02:54:16.811 --> 02:54:20.110
sausage for sure.
No one's ever gonna know.
Uh,
you'd never tell.

2993
02:54:20.210 --> 02:54:22.930
And even from other wild game.
I don't think you could tell,

2994
02:54:22.931 --> 02:54:27.040
but I suspect you wouldn't build a tell it from a even beef,

2995
02:54:27.041 --> 02:54:31.530
a few of us prepared properly.
If it's in a stew,
there's no way it's,
it's,

2996
02:54:31.531 --> 02:54:33.310
it's good.
It's good.
It's not my favorite.

2997
02:54:33.610 --> 02:54:36.850
I have to know that I'm allowed to have favorites.
I like Moose.
That's,

2998
02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:40.390
if I'm going to live on something for the winter.
It's Moose.
Moose is amazing.

2999
02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:41.600
Yeah.
Ribs move through.

3000
02:54:42.010 --> 02:54:46.840
The best of the best for about game animals like Moose or elk or venison is that

3001
02:54:46.841 --> 02:54:51.460
you can eat it rare.
He didn't like medium rare.
That's the only way to eat it.

3002
02:54:51.461 --> 02:54:54.910
You don't want to overcook it and you have to sear the outside seal in the

3003
02:54:54.911 --> 02:54:58.120
juices so it looks,
when you cut it,
you swear,
oh,
that's way too rare.

3004
02:54:58.330 --> 02:55:01.240
But you let that sit there for another half an hour off the heat and it'll go

3005
02:55:01.241 --> 02:55:04.130
all,
you know,
Brown like it's,
it's cooked.
You just,

3006
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:08.200
<v 2>it's just,
they're so juicy and so,
I mean,
flavor folder there.</v>

3007
02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:09.140
You got eat him like that.

3008
02:55:09.190 --> 02:55:11.510
You have to be careful of overcooking that kind of games,

3009
02:55:11.511 --> 02:55:14.210
especially on who's right.
Yeah.
Sear,
sear the outside.
Don't,

3010
02:55:14.211 --> 02:55:15.800
don't overcook the inside.
You can't.

3011
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:17.900
You have to leave a juicy because there's no fat.

3012
02:55:18.410 --> 02:55:22.480
These animals have very little fat on them,
and if it is on a deer,
it's tally.

3013
02:55:22.481 --> 02:55:26.690
It's not,
not the same kind of fad is on a,
on a cow,
so you're normally,

3014
02:55:26.691 --> 02:55:30.380
you trim the fat off on any wild game if it,
if they have any,
but the,

3015
02:55:30.420 --> 02:55:34.470
in the actual muscles themselves,
there's no fat.
It's,
it's a,

3016
02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:38.090
it's a fairly dry meat,
so you have to,
you have to prepare it properly.

3017
02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:41.010
We're now recently got a trick analysis from that.
You know what?

3018
02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:43.840
I heard your podcast with him talking about the chicken houses.

3019
02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:47.210
I was kind of giggling about that.
What's Hilarious,

3020
02:55:47.211 --> 02:55:50.430
because he was always talking about chicken gnosis the dangers of tricking us

3021
02:55:50.431 --> 02:55:53.780
and the,
if you watch his show,
he was with this guy,
a Rourke Denver,

3022
02:55:53.781 --> 02:55:56.330
who's a navy seal,
took him out for his first haunt ever.

3023
02:55:56.540 --> 02:55:58.970
They shot a bear and you're watching them cook the bear and you're like,

3024
02:55:58.971 --> 02:56:02.900
that is not cooked.
Do you really gonna to eat that?
It's his red.

3025
02:56:03.470 --> 02:56:06.800
And he wound up getting tricky noses from it.
Yeah,
I mean that's,
uh,

3026
02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:10.490
I heard the podcast,
I was kind of giggling.
I'm,
I was,
while I was in Africa,

3027
02:56:10.491 --> 02:56:10.820
I mean,
there,

3028
02:56:10.820 --> 02:56:15.650
I'm worrying about three foot long Guinea worms and microfilaria and Belle has

3029
02:56:15.651 --> 02:56:18.800
the,
I mean,
real serious stuff.
Chicken Osis says,
you know,
I mean,
that's,

3030
02:56:18.950 --> 02:56:22.160
I'm sure a lot of us are carrying that around.
We just don't know it.
Really.

3031
02:56:22.220 --> 02:56:24.680
You think you have it?
I don't think I do.
Of course.
But

3032
02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:28.580
I know one thing when I come back from these trips,

3033
02:56:28.581 --> 02:56:31.730
my wife will occasionally say,
Oh,
I've made a doctor's appointment for you.

3034
02:56:31.731 --> 02:56:33.950
And so I'm fine,
I'm healthy,
I'm good.
And she says,

3035
02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:37.120
you're going into the doctor and you're getting dewormed.
Right.
So she,

3036
02:56:37.130 --> 02:56:40.940
she doesn't,
I know I don't have chicken houses or any of these crazy parasites,

3037
02:56:40.941 --> 02:56:43.340
but,
uh,
you know,
just for insurance,

3038
02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:46.970
my wife does send me to the doctor to take a course of whatever,
horse pills,

3039
02:56:46.971 --> 02:56:47.804
whatever.

3040
02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.340
There's some weird stuff out there in Africa especially,

3041
02:56:52.430 --> 02:56:56.810
I'm sure that's as about as wild as it gets for now.
For now.

3042
02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:01.200
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
I,
you know,
in actual people places the,

3043
02:57:01.260 --> 02:57:05.240
the Yukon is,
is more remote than anywhere in Africa,
anywhere in Asia.

3044
02:57:05.241 --> 02:57:09.050
That's Russia.
There's some pretty remote places,
but they're usually,

3045
02:57:09.051 --> 02:57:13.130
there's people there somewhere,
but,
uh,
you know,
Yukon North America,

3046
02:57:13.131 --> 02:57:16.130
we still have some of the most remote lands left in this planet.

3047
02:57:16.580 --> 02:57:19.820
We're very fortunate.
Jim Shockey,
you're an awesome dude.
This is really,

3048
02:57:19.821 --> 02:57:23.620
really enjoyable podcast.
I was looking forward to it for a long time and,
uh,

3049
02:57:23.621 --> 02:57:23.841
I've,

3050
02:57:23.841 --> 02:57:27.170
I really appreciate you taking your time to come down here and I really want

3051
02:57:27.171 --> 02:57:30.380
people to watch your television program.
Uncharted is an amazing program.

3052
02:57:30.381 --> 02:57:33.030
Whether you like hunting or not,
it's more of a,

3053
02:57:33.031 --> 02:57:37.400
a documentary on the culture than it is just a hunting show.
It's,

3054
02:57:37.401 --> 02:57:42.380
it really does transcend the genre and a real honor and a pleasure having you on

3055
02:57:42.381 --> 02:57:43.990
here.
Thank you very much,
my honor.

3056
02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:47.060
You're doing great work and I'll support that any day.
All right,
fine.

3057
02:57:47.061 --> 02:57:50.870
Jim On Facebook.
Uh,
what is your Facebook page?
Uh,

3058
02:57:50.871 --> 02:57:52.790
Jim Shockey and Twitter.
Same thing.

3059
02:57:52.791 --> 02:57:56.750
Jim Shockey and then underscore after Shockey.
Right.
Thank you very much,
sir.

3060
02:57:56.780 --> 02:57:58.250
Really appreciate it.
Tell you betcha you,
Joe,

3061
02:57:58.430 --> 02:58:01.500
thanks for having us do this again some time.
Anytime you want me to hunting.

3062
02:58:01.730 --> 02:58:04.380
I do that too.
That would be really fun.
Come on.
Let's do it.

3063
02:58:04.381 --> 02:58:07.350
I'll do it for your show.
Coming to my house next time.
I would love it.

3064
02:58:07.710 --> 02:58:11.010
Let's do it.
You,
here we go.
All right.
Thanks everybody.
We'll see you soon.

3065
02:58:11.060 --> 02:58:11.893
<v 5>Bye.</v>

3066
02:58:21.770 --> 02:58:21.900
<v 6>Hmm.</v>
