1
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.820
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:07.654
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see with your pile of your </v>

3
00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:12.100
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could you got?</v>

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Their moral arc?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heavens on earth.</v>

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to take magazine.</v>

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.173
<v Speaker 1>It's the latest issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is there something rather than </v>

7
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:21.574
<v Speaker 1>nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to tackle the little </v>

8
00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a deep one.</v>

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>You've dealt with this on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

11
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>that's one that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.280
<v Speaker 1>when you're in traffic and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

13
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>When you have someone like neil or Sean </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carroll or,</v>

14
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.750
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence Krauss talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

16
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a physicist.</v>

17
00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm a social scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

18
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I come at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by this word?</v>

19
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:42.844
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because most of us have this idea of </v>

20
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:44.994
<v Speaker 1>what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

21
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>In physics it means this other thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

22
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.663
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think our limited understanding </v>

23
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>of what they're talking about.</v>

24
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.853
<v Speaker 1>Like when I see those guys writing down </v>
<v Speaker 1>on legal papers with all that scritchy </v>

25
00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:56.584
<v Speaker 1>scratchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy looking very fake alien language </v>

26
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>and mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

27
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>thank God you guys are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I opened heaven on earth with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine yourself dead and you know,</v>

29
00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>most people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see myself in the casket and my </v>

31
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>friends and family around a hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>their morning.</v>

32
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't see anything.</v>

33
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Of course you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead to imagine anything.</v>

34
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to be conscious and alive so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even picture being dead.</v>

35
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>So he can't picture not existing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be the same thing.</v>

36
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Imagine there's no universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

37
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I see blackness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

38
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.130
<v Speaker 1>there's no blackness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

39
00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>nothing would literally be not just no </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

40
00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no perception of darkness,</v>

41
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even nothing.</v>

42
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.353
<v Speaker 1>I was going through instagram the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and there was this one person who </v>

43
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>was talking about the purpose of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you die,</v>

44
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen?</v>

45
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.050
<v Speaker 1>And I immediately just started laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

46
00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:54.130
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how he's saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you die,</v>

47
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

48
00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 1>one of them spiritual type characters is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of a huckster,</v>

49
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>is a lot of spiritual hucksters out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there these days.</v>

50
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.100
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

51
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.933
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the nineties we debunked all those </v>

52
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 1>psychics talking to the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

53
00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

54
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.520
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't been too popular in recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

55
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:10.354
<v Speaker 1>but that was a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but caught onto that little earpiece </v>

56
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.590
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earpiece or just the cold reading.</v>

57
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I see a father figure as a grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

58
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:20.680
<v Speaker 1>uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of the family,</v>

59
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:21.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

60
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saying something about,</v>

61
00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:27.220
<v Speaker 1>it's okay for you to forgive yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

63
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:29.830
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well where was the,</v>

64
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 1>will he hid his will somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is that?</v>

65
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what we want to know is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ring he had.</v>

66
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.513
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're just vague enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like horoscopes of you're just </v>

67
00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Speaker 1>vague enough people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

68
00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:44.560
<v Speaker 1>it's right all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always right.</v>

69
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even a real horoscope.</v>

70
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.023
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual astrology that you have to know </v>

71
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>the date you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that time you were born.</v>

72
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the month of August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like they got to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to know or evening,</v>

74
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about all that stuff?</v>

75
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>It's all bunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>

76
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

77
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why has it been around so long?</v>

78
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>

79
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>well it's called the barnum effect where</v>
<v Speaker 2>pt Barnum,</v>

80
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 2>you just offer something for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you make a general enough,</v>

81
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

82
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.433
<v Speaker 2>I sent you an intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wise person that people really enjoy </v>

83
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:19.864
<v Speaker 2>your company and you like going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties and being with other people and </v>

84
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.160
<v Speaker 2>yet you liked the quiet solitude of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk on the beach and when people go,</v>

85
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is so me.</v>

86
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.563
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've pretty much described every </v>

87
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 2>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have your alone,</v>

88
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:31.834
<v Speaker 2>you're with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's one of those things where if </v>

89
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>you talk to someone who is an actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>believer in astrology,</v>

90
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are so convinced.</v>

91
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.843
<v Speaker 2>I got a friend of mine who was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me that he makes all of his </v>

92
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 2>decisions based on consulting with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>astrologer.</v>

93
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Well Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nancy Reagan for his travel.</v>

94
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 2>After he was shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got real paranoid about that.</v>

95
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.833
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so part of the problem is the </v>

96
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.603
<v Speaker 2>astrologers and psychics are themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>remembering their hits and forgetting </v>

97
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 2>their misses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the confirmation.</v>

98
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>And so I knew a psychic or a magician </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was working.</v>

99
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:10.621
<v Speaker 2>The psychic friends network</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the nineties when it's hard,</v>

100
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to make a living as a magician</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing kids' parties.</v>

101
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 2>They all want to have their own biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

102
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 2>but only a few people get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got to do something on the side.</v>

103
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>So this guy was doing psychic friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>network and uh,</v>

104
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 2>he told me all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave him a book,</v>

105
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:23.224
<v Speaker 2>a three ring binder and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the kinds of things you should </v>

106
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 2>say and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are calling for love,</v>

107
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:28.601
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

108
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 2>career questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can spend 20,</v>

109
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes at three 95 a minute just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through there.</v>

110
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.623
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent you in a relationship right now </v>

111
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 2>and one of these more committed than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

112
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten minutes later,</v>

113
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:40.354
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still talking and you're </v>

114
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 2>thinking about travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not happy with your job.</v>

115
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 2>There's some financial stress in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life right now.</v>

116
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 2>And then he told me about stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now go get a crystal and then a candle.</v>

117
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:51.754
<v Speaker 2>I want you to set it up here on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk and this would go on and on for </v>

118
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 2>hours and they charge by the hour and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they chose what they are.</v>

119
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:57.724
<v Speaker 2>So one of the problems that psychic </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend networks had was people were not </v>

120
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.230
<v Speaker 2>paying their phone bills because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back on $800 phone.</v>

121
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 2>They would just not pay it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the phone companies crackdown down on</v>

122
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 2>the psychic friends network company </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

123
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:09.094
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is getting out of hand that people </v>

124
00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 2>aren't paying their bills.</v>

125
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 2>So they had to ratchet it back a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

126
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 2>This right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would do it through the phone.</v>

127
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

128
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't get a credit card from </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

129
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>They would just stay on the line with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

130
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.633
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he told me that when he first </v>

131
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:23.434
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got like sixty cents on the minute a </v>

132
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.213
<v Speaker 2>for three 95 at that per minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they bumped it up as he got </v>

133
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 2>more experience and kept them on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>line longer.</v>

134
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:34.084
<v Speaker 2>They gave them bonuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you get a dollar per minute or </v>

135
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that not illegal?</v>

136
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not even a psychic,</v>

137
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.263
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't you have to be a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to go and you've got to go to </v>

138
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 2>medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to get a degree.</v>

139
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.883
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a interesting history there </v>

140
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:47.854
<v Speaker 2>because in New York City for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was difficult to outlaw like the </v>

141
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:51.694
<v Speaker 2>three card Monte guys on the sidewalk </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the cardboard because it's just </v>

142
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 2>kind of a game right now.</v>

143
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Now it would be illegal to sell </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraudulent stocks or something like that</v>

144
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 2>or sell a product that's advertised as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>health product when it's not,</v>

145
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:05.984
<v Speaker 2>but if say in that case it's under food </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than drugs or say no health </v>

146
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:11.744
<v Speaker 2>products like vitamins are under </v>
<v Speaker 2>different standards than say medical </v>

147
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:16.484
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a psychic is more like an </v>

148
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:19.634
<v Speaker 2>entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is for entertainment purposes </v>

149
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 2>only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can do whatever we want as opposed</v>

150
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 2>to a medical doctorate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's dispensing advice.</v>

151
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 2>So in medical doctor is a bad example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I shouldn't say that engineer,</v>

152
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 2>but the point is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to work as a psychic,</v>

153
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.233
<v Speaker 2>like on a psychic network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a business of selling </v>

154
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:42.070
<v Speaker 2>psychics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you should be able to.</v>

155
00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 2>You have to exhibit some sort of psychic</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

156
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.183
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't,</v>

157
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 2>under controlled conditions they always </v>
<v Speaker 2>fail.</v>

159
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.543
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that's ever been done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what about the one thing that I've </v>

160
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.250
<v Speaker 2>read that a statistically more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can recognize that people are staring at</v>

161
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:58.154
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they're looking at you from </v>

162
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 2>behind that horseshit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

163
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not been consistently replicated.</v>

164
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 2>So is it possible some people with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain sensitivity can detect?</v>

165
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one explanation,</v>

166
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:12.374
<v Speaker 2>the skeptics explanation is that if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a say a starbucks or something and I </v>

167
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:19.000
<v Speaker 2>kind of have a sense that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about maybe looking at me and,</v>

168
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.843
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I look and that catches somebody's </v>

169
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 2>eye and they turned to me and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

170
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 2>that person's looking at me or vice </v>
<v Speaker 2>versa.</v>

171
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at them and then they send </v>
<v Speaker 2>something or whatever.</v>

172
00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:30.950
<v Speaker 2>So there could be some element of chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

173
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm the guy that does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rupert sheldrake,</v>

174
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.083
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.923
<v Speaker 2>he believes that it's actually some kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like a psychic power through the </v>

176
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 2>medium like that when I'm looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

177
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 2>something's coming out of my eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in your neck.</v>

178
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>So that's morphic resonance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morphic resonance.</v>

179
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:48.944
<v Speaker 2>Now Richard Wiseman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a British like experimental </v>

180
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:51.824
<v Speaker 2>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's tried to replicate that and he </v>

181
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 2>always fails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this other woman,</v>

182
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:56.084
<v Speaker 2>Marilyn Schlitz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she also tried to replicate it and she </v>

183
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 2>was able to replicate some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there may be an experimenter bias.</v>

184
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.983
<v Speaker 2>It's not clear if it's the skeptics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are biased or the believers that are </v>

185
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 2>bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that case it's best to just say,</v>

186
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:09.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know it.</v>

187
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.243
<v Speaker 2>So the default position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the null hypothesis is that it's not </v>

188
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 2>true until you prove otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a difficult one to prove.</v>

189
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.310
<v Speaker 2>Now if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I say,</v>

190
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is the effect so subtle?</v>

191
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:21.524
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you go to Vegas and become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>millionaire gambling or play the stock </v>

192
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:25.934
<v Speaker 2>market?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

193
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 2>we know traders just need a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

194
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 2>one point point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

195
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 2>one percent advantage over the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>traders,</v>

196
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can make a lot of times it just</v>

197
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:33.210
<v Speaker 2>psychic abilities.</v>

198
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Psychic abilities is a very broad term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

199
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like saying drugs because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like certain drugs that put you to sleep</v>

200
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 2>and certain drugs that make you hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have very different effects.</v>

201
00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:43.664
<v Speaker 2>So saying psychic ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe have the ability to see if </v>

202
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:46.724
<v Speaker 2>someone's looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have the ability to pick </v>

203
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 2>the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

204
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.313
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the hard part in testing psych exist </v>

205
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:54.800
<v Speaker 2>to pin down what exactly are you saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do?</v>

206
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.653
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that's where it gets pretty </v>

207
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:57.654
<v Speaker 2>fuzzy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these like why is it legal for the </v>

208
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 2>phone psychics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they,</v>

209
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 2>you can't pin them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody says,</v>

210
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just giving relationship advice,</v>

211
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.633
<v Speaker 2>why is that illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I say like the Tony Robbins Netflix </v>

212
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.020
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not your guru,</v>

213
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.883
<v Speaker 2>which is basically I am your guru.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has that moment in this huge </v>

214
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:14.994
<v Speaker 2>auditorium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like 3000 people there and he </v>

215
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 2>gets this woman up on stage and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got relationship problems.</v>

216
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have your phone feels yeah,</v>

217
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 2>take out your phone and call him right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

218
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.403
<v Speaker 2>And she talks her through dumping this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy onstage on the phone and he's at </v>

219
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 2>work or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

220
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:31.464
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she hangs up and everybody's </v>

221
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 2>happy that she did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is that a good thing or a bad thing?</v>

222
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great for show business,</v>

223
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 2>but what if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how the fuck.</v>

224
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.983
<v Speaker 2>I mean that seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you know what kind of </v>

225
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:45.294
<v Speaker 2>relationship they really have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now somebody that talked to both of </v>

226
00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:48.001
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

227
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody that I brought this up at a,</v>

228
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.590
<v Speaker 2>at an event recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a party and somebody said,</v>

229
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the backstory.</v>

230
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.790
<v Speaker 2>His staff had been working the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

231
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 2>they knew all about her and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and it was about to go sour</v>

232
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we brought her up.</v>

233
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.291
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

234
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 2>so this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you see the psychics on tv,</v>

235
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:09.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of stuff you don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They work the audience,</v>

236
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:12.200
<v Speaker 2>they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people fill out like the psych,</v>

237
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.040
<v Speaker 2>the faith healers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fill out prayer cards,</v>

238
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 2>they put their name and address and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ailment and then,</v>

239
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the faith healers have a little earbud </v>

240
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 2>in there and they're listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person in the back reading,</v>

241
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.900
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the person they have clocked coma</v>

242
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 2>or whatever and you hear him calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>this out.</v>

243
00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:28.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

244
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of that that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

245
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.080
<v Speaker 2>The Anthony Robbins is not claiming any </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of psychic ability.</v>

246
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:34.914
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just trying to provide positive </v>

247
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:40.260
<v Speaker 2>path for improving your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're in a bad relationship,</v>

248
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:41.094
<v Speaker 2>that would be a positive path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get out of that relationship and </v>

249
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:43.584
<v Speaker 2>then move forward with it with emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and power and love and fucking probably </v>

250
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 2>throw a karate kick and get everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>pumped up and jump around a little Bobby</v>

251
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.083
<v Speaker 2>Brown headphones on.</v>

252
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 2>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a showman too.</v>

253
00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

254
00:10:59.161 --> 00:10:59.994
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

255
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.980
<v Speaker 2>but my point is that the psychic could </v>
<v Speaker 2>say the same thing.</v>

256
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just dishing out at.</v>

257
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

258
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 2>it's weird to put him in that category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

259
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Because he's just trying to get people </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited.</v>

260
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he does some good.</v>

261
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I really do because he did me some good </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 21 years old.</v>

262
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I used to listen to his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called unlimited power.</v>

263
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.663
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the name of the book </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I listened to it on audio cassette </v>

264
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:23.544
<v Speaker 2>by the pool was shitty apartment that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was living in when I was trying to be a </v>

265
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:26.664
<v Speaker 2>standup comedian and it helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had some really good advice in terms </v>

266
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:32.094
<v Speaker 2>of setting goals and in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you approach things and look at </v>

267
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:35.784
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I agree all of that in any of these </v>

268
00:11:39.001 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 2>self help books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jockos books or Amy Alkon.</v>

269
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of stuff that very similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what Tony Robbins.</v>

270
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.820
<v Speaker 2>A issues and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

271
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:48.654
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Set goals and be motivated and think </v>

272
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.803
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe air a little bit on the side of </v>

273
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>over optimism</v>

274
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.843
<v Speaker 1>so you can push through the failures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't be blind because maybe it's </v>

275
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 1>certain times it cut and run and change </v>
<v Speaker 1>course in your life.</v>

276
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hard part is getting,</v>

277
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 1>getting is studying that which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 1>experimentally which are the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques versus others.</v>

279
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy wrote a book called Sham</v>

280
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.040
<v Speaker 1>s h a m self-help actualization movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was the head guy for Rodale press</v>

281
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:19.760
<v Speaker 1>that publishes these self help books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

282
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.673
<v Speaker 1>and so his takeaway on in this book was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the number one predictor of people </v>

283
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:25.234
<v Speaker 1>who will buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell up books are people who already </v>

284
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>bought self help books and they continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying them.</v>

285
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.530
<v Speaker 1>So if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it work?</v>

286
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

287
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:37.750
<v Speaker 1>If you work at sort of consistently like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta listen to the tapes like every</v>

288
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:38.584
<v Speaker 1>weekend or every low moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like taking the pill and your </v>

289
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:42.484
<v Speaker 1>cancer's gone.</v>

290
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:43.883
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of keep practicing it </v>

291
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 1>as this is a lifestyle change for it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

292
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>

293
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>and also what do you mean by work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Tony goes into a corporation and they</v>

294
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:56.650
<v Speaker 1>get a bump a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an example in this book to get a</v>

295
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 1>bump in sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they get the salesmen all motivated,</v>

296
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>they hit the phones on Monday morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

297
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 1>within two weeks their sales are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to where they were.</v>

298
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.993
<v Speaker 1>So you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they got to bring the self help guy </v>

299
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 1>back in every month or so to keep them </v>
<v Speaker 1>super motivated.</v>

300
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Well you've got to give them some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of incentive to state,</v>

301
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 1>state pumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

302
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.763
<v Speaker 1>I mean some financial incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those I'm old school </v>

303
00:13:21.461 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 1>phrases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inspiration is like bathing.</v>

304
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 1>It works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to do it regularly in order</v>

305
00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 1>for it to be effective.</v>

306
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean bathing works,</v>

307
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.670
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean you like hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two months later a smell like shit.</v>

308
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.873
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

309
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.761
<v Speaker 1>Daily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

310
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:38.890
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying why?</v>

311
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Why can't the NFL teams play the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>game like the last two minutes?</v>

312
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Because it's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two minute drill,</v>

313
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 1>because they can't do it physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep that up.</v>

314
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

315
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could physically keep up </v>

316
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:52.810
<v Speaker 1>that enthusiasm that Anthony Robbins </v>
<v Speaker 1>provides,</v>

317
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:53.644
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be either you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some sort of an office environment </v>

318
00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 1>that is an incredibly enthusiastic to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where you guys have engineered</v>

319
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 1>this environment where everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pumped up,</v>

320
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.263
<v Speaker 1>but that's going to be a being that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't leave a whole lot of room for </v>

321
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:10.534
<v Speaker 1>the individual to be themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that would be terrible to </v>

322
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:13.924
<v Speaker 1>work for a place like that where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you go there's motivational </v>

323
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:16.924
<v Speaker 1>sayings and people were chanting things </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hallway and everybody's just got </v>

324
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 1>energy at 10.</v>

325
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a Co,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

326
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:24.803
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a guy like anthony robins </v>

327
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:30.190
<v Speaker 1>will provide you for a short burst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just hope that some of it sticks.</v>

328
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:30.941
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

329
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>this is amy elkanns book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfuck allergy.</v>

330
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:34.474
<v Speaker 1>It's great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

331
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 1>she calls these small wins or whoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls him small wins,</v>

332
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.030
<v Speaker 1>like make your bed in the morning or </v>
<v Speaker 1>shave or whatever,</v>

333
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>or like Jockos little twitter posts at </v>
<v Speaker 1>4:30 AM.</v>

334
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm never getting up at 4:30,</v>

335
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.054
<v Speaker 1>but when I get up at 6:30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll occasionally like five this </v>

<v Speaker 1>so I'm not happy getting up at 5:30,</v>

338
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:54.561
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

339

347
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Make your bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean your room.</v>

348
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 1>What's he talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about these little wins,</v>

349
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:16.094
<v Speaker 1>like if you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the next thing that's a little </v>

350
00:15:18.141 --> 00:15:22.700
<v Speaker 1>harder comes a little easier and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things that are in the background.</v>

351
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:23.534
<v Speaker 1>If you know that your your life as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>master cars filled with fast food </v>

352
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:27.470
<v Speaker 1>wrappers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

353
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

354
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:28.594
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got that thing that you haven't </v>

355
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:32.740
<v Speaker 1>taken care of in the back of your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

356
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 1>that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's going to disrupt.</v>

357
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.240
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be flowing in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

358
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 1>For the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a distraction.</v>

359
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.173
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those little things apparently do </v>

360
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:43.844
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a theory of crime called the </v>

361
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:50.291
<v Speaker 1>broken windows theory that is favored by</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminologists to explain the decline.</v>

362
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.910
<v Speaker 1>The crime decline in the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened in New York City,</v>

363
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 1>they started cleaning up the graffiti.</v>

364
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.560
<v Speaker 1>They started catching the turnstile </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumpers.</v>

365
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:03.800
<v Speaker 1>They started cleaning up the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started boarding up.</v>

366
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Windows has no broken windows or </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing the windows.</v>

367
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.693
<v Speaker 1>The theory is that if there's a signal </v>
<v Speaker 1>in society that no one's paying </v>

368
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:13.160
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no law and order here.</v>

369
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:15.950
<v Speaker 1>There are no rules or norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

370
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.433
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get more crime if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>send the signal through little things </v>

371
00:16:19.641 --> 00:16:20.474
<v Speaker 1>like we're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow graffiti on this wall anymore and </v>

372
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 1>no more turnstile jumpers in the subways</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

373
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:27.530
<v Speaker 1>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that happened,</v>

374
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 1>then there was a trickle down effect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then crime decline.</v>

375
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:30.824
<v Speaker 1>So that's the most popular theory for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I think there's something to </v>

376
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:34.521
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

377
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:35.354
<v Speaker 1>that makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they did with New York City is </v>

378
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:41.290
<v Speaker 1>really fantastic if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to when I was a kid and I</v>

379
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.780
<v Speaker 1>traveled to New York City the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I saw times square,</v>

380
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was probably like 18 or 19.</v>

381
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking crazy place.</v>

382
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Like this is madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

383
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 1>you see it in movies and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>always this horrific scene.</v>

384
00:16:55.431 --> 00:17:00.431
<v Speaker 1>It's always peep shows and hookers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pimps and thugs and drug dealers.</v>

385
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 1>And you go there now and it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mall threw up.</v>

386
00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like a giant neon mall of America </v>
<v Speaker 1>Time Square.</v>

387
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:11.743
<v Speaker 1>If you took a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you grabbed a guy from like 1988 and </v>

388
00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:16.100
<v Speaker 1>you put them in a time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

389
00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:16.934
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bring you 30 years in the </v>

390
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 1>future and you're going to see New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>City the way it looks.</v>

391
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you expect?</v>

392
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:23.271
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

393
00:17:23.271 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like blade runner.</v>

394
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:25.904
<v Speaker 1>People are going to be shooting people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and selling body parts and now you get </v>

395
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 1>there and it's like Guy Fieri Aries </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>

396
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:31.844
<v Speaker 1>And two huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic lcd screens and then there's </v>

397
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:38.780
<v Speaker 1>some people that would long for the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

398
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>the dirty seediness Lenny Bruce talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

399
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:43.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he lived there.</v>

400
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

401
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.963
<v Speaker 1>well that has a certain charm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if go going into the nightclubs </v>

402
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the surrounding daytime neighborhood</v>

403
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:52.970
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

404
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.550
<v Speaker 1>this isn't where you want to live rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in the vomited mall.</v>

405
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not crazy about that either,</v>

406
00:17:58.561 --> 00:17:59.610
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

407
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.453
<v Speaker 1>so there's a reason why cities have </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain restrictions on those kinds of </v>

408
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.350
<v Speaker 1>stories coming in in a crappy </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood like downtown,</v>

409
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.213
<v Speaker 1>old town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasadena now is kind of a hip place to </v>

410
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:10.224
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the seventies when I went to the </v>

411
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:12.811
<v Speaker 1>ice house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

412
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

413
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 1>in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

414
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:16.404
<v Speaker 1>just as a spectator and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was terrible down there and </v>

415
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

416
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:22.020
<v Speaker 1>it was a dump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

417
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:23.370
<v Speaker 1>there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

418
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:24.151
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

419
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 1>it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word was,</v>

420
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 1>according to my friend Bob Fisher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who owns the icehouse,</v>

421
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.310
<v Speaker 1>he said that what it was was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early days of Hollywood,</v>

422
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.330
<v Speaker 1>the producers would all buy homes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasedena.</v>

423
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have these beautiful old estates in</v>

424
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:40.284
<v Speaker 1>Pasadena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the stars would all live in the </v>

425
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:44.124
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they would all be just boozing it up </v>

426
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:47.034
<v Speaker 1>and partying down in the Hollywood hills</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the producers like let those crazy </v>

427
00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:54.450
<v Speaker 1>animals go have added in the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to back out a little bit and</v>

428
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:55.284
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they establish that community out there </v>

429
00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:57.690
<v Speaker 1>in Pasadena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

430
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to turn it around,</v>

431
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.250
<v Speaker 1>like one of the key things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

432
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.930
<v Speaker 1>a mall can do is get an what they call </v>
<v Speaker 1>an anchor store.</v>

433
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Someone like a saks fifth avenue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that's really respectable,</v>

434
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:10.080
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can call the other guys,</v>

435
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:10.381
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

436
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:11.790
<v Speaker 1>we've got saks fifth avenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

437
00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>you got sex because they haven't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I can be next to him.</v>

438
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:17.610
<v Speaker 1>And then it starts going and then little</v>
<v Speaker 1>by little,</v>

439
00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:20.190
<v Speaker 1>each of them cleans up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood a little bit more.</v>

440
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.020
<v Speaker 1>And pretty soon you end up with old </v>
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

441
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Pasadena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

442
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:23.663
<v Speaker 1>well I was telling you guys before I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue today where my credit card got </v>

443
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:30.200
<v Speaker 1>robbed and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

444
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever credit card fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone got a hold of my number,</v>

445
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.073
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one thing that people worry </v>

446
00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 1>about the most about shopping online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

447
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.190
<v Speaker 1>But I guess that could kind of happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere,</v>

448
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.653
<v Speaker 1>but you got to think that if there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that has changed malls more </v>

449
00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.584
<v Speaker 1>than anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be the ability to just shop </v>

450
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:49.254
<v Speaker 1>online on your phone like Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the fact that they figured that </v>

451
00:19:52.561 --> 00:19:53.394
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Amazon came out and it </v>

452
00:19:55.231 --> 00:19:56.400
<v Speaker 1>was just a bookstore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

453
00:19:56.401 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is going to buy books </v>
<v Speaker 1>online?</v>

454
00:19:58.351 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 1>You can just go to the bookstore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>

455
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.340
<v Speaker 1>What a stupid business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

456
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:06.570
<v Speaker 1>that guy has more money than any human </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet is poor bastards.</v>

457
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:07.403
<v Speaker 1>Getting divorced too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard last night that there's a rule </v>

458
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.900
<v Speaker 1>in Washington that everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make as a couple,</v>

459
00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:15.570
<v Speaker 1>you have to split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been together for over 25 years.</v>

460
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California law is.</v>

461
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 slash 50.</v>

462
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm marriages,</v>

463
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:22.583
<v Speaker 1>20 years or 10 years or more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 50 slash 50 and that includes </v>

464
00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:29.850
<v Speaker 1>downstream income from anything you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're still getting paid for.</v>

465
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Say Ten years ago you wrote a book or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

466
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Bezos is getting paid and he's worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 plus billion dollar and 37.</v>

467
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

468
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:43.440
<v Speaker 1>so she's going to get half of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're probably going to.</v>

469
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:44.303
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a lot of stock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said they're going to have to just </v>

470
00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:50.511
<v Speaker 1>be stay friends because they better be </v>
<v Speaker 1>super nice to him.</v>

471
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Even if he gives her a quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

472
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I got Rollin got wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The richest people in the world now,</v>

473
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.070
<v Speaker 1>but after all these bookstores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a business,</v>

474
00:21:00.071 --> 00:21:00.904
<v Speaker 1>there's some irony that Amazon now wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start opening physical brick and </v>

475
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:04.264
<v Speaker 1>mortar stores.</v>

476
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.343
<v Speaker 1>That is kind of ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does make sense though because </v>

477
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:11.030
<v Speaker 1>there are some brick and mortar stores </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that guy's a conquer.</v>

478
00:21:11.031 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I think he just wants to take over </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

479
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why else would he buy whole foods?</v>

480
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.230
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

481
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 1>the supermarket business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can fuck this up too.</v>

482
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>automate it.</v>

483
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.870
<v Speaker 1>He can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

484
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe get ordered whole foods delivered </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your house.</v>

485
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's available yet,</v>

486
00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:26.464
<v Speaker 1>but I think it is right as an essay now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most grocery stores even like all the </v>

487
00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Ralphs have home delivery within two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours to compete with Amazon prime.</v>

488
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

489
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are.</v>

490
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.860
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just order it online and pick it</v>

491
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:39.694
<v Speaker 1>up and I'll bring it out to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to pavilion's the other day and </v>

492
00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:44.580
<v Speaker 1>they had a bunch of delivery trucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>parked in the parking lot.</v>

493
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this,</v>

494
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.980
<v Speaker 1>think of these cool delivery trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have to have that one store you can walk</v>

495
00:21:50.981 --> 00:21:51.814
<v Speaker 1>in and there's no cashiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just trust that everyone's not </v>

496
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:55.294
<v Speaker 1>stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they just are comfortable </v>

497
00:21:58.331 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 1>with a certain amount of theft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

498
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

499
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:03.933
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably have cameras everywhere </v>

500
00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:05.194
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

501
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.393
<v Speaker 1>but it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the online purchasing like that has got </v>

502
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 1>to put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must be putting the most,</v>

503
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.640
<v Speaker 1>as far as like the most impact on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stores,</v>

504
00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:16.474
<v Speaker 1>brick and mortar stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the ability to purchase </v>

505
00:22:17.471 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be devastating for them.</v>

506
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:19.661
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

507
00:22:19.661 --> 00:22:20.494
<v Speaker 1>And up in Santa Barbara where I live now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just riding upstate street this </v>

508
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.550
<v Speaker 1>morning at the end of the ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

509
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:27.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like the third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a quarter of the stores are closed</v>

510
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.280
<v Speaker 1>out of business empty and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state street,</v>

511
00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:31.114
<v Speaker 1>Santa Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was like the happened in place to </v>

512
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 1>be and I and a real estate friend of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine says,</v>

513
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's see that story there.</v>

514
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.580
<v Speaker 1>That's $22,000 a month to lease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

515
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.361
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

516
00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:41.194
<v Speaker 1>So you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to have a retail outlet </v>

517
00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:43.474
<v Speaker 1>that's really turning over the customers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot that just can't do </v>

518
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:46.354
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't have an antique store </v>

519
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:49.210
<v Speaker 1>that's going to do that are a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>knickknack store.</v>

520
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.493
<v Speaker 1>Santa Barbara is one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>places and it's really interesting </v>

521
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:56.080
<v Speaker 1>because it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a small area,</v>

522
00:22:56.081 --> 00:23:00.210
<v Speaker 1>like I don't even think there's 150,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people less than it is about 90,000.</v>

523
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Is it Montecito included or with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montecito included?</v>

524
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Galito Gilead is like another 30,000 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>so below that.</v>

525
00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:10.570
<v Speaker 1>You have carpenter Ria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like another $20,000 or so,</v>

526
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:13.170
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>

527
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

528
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.910
<v Speaker 1>You get the right spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

529
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it needs to be that close to</v>

530
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

531
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.713
<v Speaker 1>like you get a little bit of trickle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can sit down there 75 miles from my </v>

532
00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 1>house to your studio here in my office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Alta Dena for a skeptic magazine.</v>

533
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.020
<v Speaker 1>That's 105 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's doable.</v>

534
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

535
00:23:33.611 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

536
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.433
<v Speaker 1>I think that as human beings when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're living in these gigantic </v>

537
00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:40.384
<v Speaker 1>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Los Angeles or New York or </v>

538
00:23:42.011 --> 00:23:42.844
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just a certain amount of people </v>

539
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:49.840
<v Speaker 1>become less valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

540
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:50.683
<v Speaker 1>there's just too many of them and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose that sort of appreciation </v>

541
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:57.240
<v Speaker 1>for people and there's like a tension </v>
<v Speaker 1>around like you,</v>

542
00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't mind if a few people drop off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no.</v>

543
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.041
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

544
00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a balance in size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife's from Cologne,</v>

545
00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:04.454
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about a 1 million people and </v>

546
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:07.660
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about as big as you want to get.</v>

547
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a big enough city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of action,</v>

548
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:11.720
<v Speaker 1>could do all sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

549
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:15.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's not 6 million or 10 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just like La.</v>

550
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:16.184
<v Speaker 1>It's just too many of you ever seen that</v>
<v Speaker 1>study that they did where they set up a </v>

551
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:19.244
<v Speaker 1>camera on one end of the street and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera on the other end of the street </v>

552
00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 1>and they timed people walking through </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in those,</v>

553
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.750
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

554
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.583
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the footage of those people walking </v>

555
00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:30.014
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were able to determine by how fast </v>

556
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:33.350
<v Speaker 1>these people walked.</v>

557
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 1>They got an average of which was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate of how many people lived in the</v>

558
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:39.374
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

559
00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.253
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

560
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.113
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scale.</v>

561
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that book that physicist a West </v>

562
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Jeff G,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e o f f West I think is his name,</v>

563
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:50.510
<v Speaker 1>wrote that book and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the bigger the city,</v>

564
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 1>the more efficient and faster things </v>
<v Speaker 1>become including dialogue,</v>

565
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.830
<v Speaker 1>the way people communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk a little faster and faster.</v>

566
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.310
<v Speaker 1>And he had a formula showing how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants per one,</v>

567
00:25:02.311 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand gas stations per </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand you'll get as you scale</v>

568
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:06.614
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need as many restaurants and </v>

569
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:09.343
<v Speaker 1>gas stations as populations increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's more efficiency in the </v>

570
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.040
<v Speaker 1>flow of traffic and people throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>the city,</v>

571
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.550
<v Speaker 1>whereas smaller towns are less efficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that was the theory,</v>

572
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:20.863
<v Speaker 1>but it's just fascinating that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings adjust because of all of these </v>

573
00:25:24.771 --> 00:25:27.890
<v Speaker 1>other human beings around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They changed the way they walk,</v>

574
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 1>they walk faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk faster.</v>

575
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.063
<v Speaker 1>So it's a right here scale scale the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal laws of life and death in the </v>

576
00:25:34.421 --> 00:25:35.254
<v Speaker 1>organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cities and companies listening to it </v>

577
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:40.190
<v Speaker 1>right now actually coincidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could winky dinky.</v>

578
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

579
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.730
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

580
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel it.</v>

581
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.753
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in boulder for a shorter </v>

582
00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:49.400
<v Speaker 1>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>

583
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boulder's small as well,</v>

584
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 100,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I came back here,</v>

585
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I realized is how fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's driving,</v>

586
00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's just cutting everybody off </v>

587
00:25:58.401 --> 00:25:59.830
<v Speaker 1>and zooming ahead and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

588
00:25:59.831 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 1>and people are really in a rush </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere they go.</v>

589
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:07.430
<v Speaker 1>And that has to be in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

590
00:26:07.431 --> 00:26:11.240
<v Speaker 1>It has to be influenced by all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around them and their energy.</v>

591
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

592
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.810
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that is though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

593
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.190
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all unconscious.</v>

594
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:17.024
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just mostly the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>overall pace you get that pushes </v>

595
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 1>everybody along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're slows them down.</v>

596
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I just started this book called a rule </v>
<v Speaker 1>makers and rule breakers.</v>

597
00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a by a woman who is a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

598
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget her name,</v>

599
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.153
<v Speaker 1>the rule makers rule breakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he talks about tight cultures versus </v>

600
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:41.150
<v Speaker 1>losing as fast as a fucking Michele </v>
<v Speaker 1>gelfand yet.</v>

601
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 1>So she talks about tight versus loose</v>

602
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.840
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like again,</v>

603
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:46.674
<v Speaker 2>my wife from Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tighter culture that the norm </v>

604
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.543
<v Speaker 2>that people are more likely to obey </v>
<v Speaker 2>norms and rules and there's a little </v>

605
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>more uncomfortableness and violating </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

606
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 2>California were a little loosey Goosey </v>
<v Speaker 2>about rules and,</v>

607
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.750
<v Speaker 2>and so my wife's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was giving me a hard time about,</v>

608
00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:01.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my idea of traffic laws is I'll just do </v>

609
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:04.104
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

610
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.710
<v Speaker 2>I feel like pretty much if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as it's safe and I kind of know,</v>

611
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:08.581
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

612
00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:12.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving up the one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I stay at a 79 or below,</v>

613
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

614
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:14.950
<v Speaker 2>but the 65,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

615
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.163
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

616
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where the cops park.</v>

617
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I know everybody else is going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

618
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:24.900
<v Speaker 2>turn into our street is a left Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course my wife,</v>

619
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 2>she's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we got to wait.</v>

620
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's midnight.</v>

621
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go.</v>

622
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.761
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

623
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:30.810
<v Speaker 2>this California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going</v>

624
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.353
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a tight culture versus loose </v>

625
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:39.570
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess she's going to talk about how</v>

626
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.290
<v Speaker 2>norms that affect laws and how then </v>
<v Speaker 2>people change their behavior.</v>

627
00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:44.640
<v Speaker 2>You're not even aware that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

628
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you're just kind of unconsciously </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorbing the cultures.</v>

629
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:48.743
<v Speaker 2>But what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a difference between west </v>

630
00:27:52.561 --> 00:27:53.394
<v Speaker 2>coast tight culture like la or large </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups rather an east coast large </v>

631
00:27:57.631 --> 00:27:58.464
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's influenced by </v>

632
00:27:59.371 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 2>whether it's one of the things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been thinking about a lot,</v>

633
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.753
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aggression of east coasters is very </v>

634
00:28:05.161 --> 00:28:08.020
<v Speaker 2>different than the aggression of West </v>
<v Speaker 2>coasters and I always wonder,</v>

635
00:28:08.021 --> 00:28:08.854
<v Speaker 2>it's like how much of that is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to deal with shit whether for </v>

636
00:28:10.731 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 2>five months out of the year it could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

637
00:28:13.261 --> 00:28:13.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

638
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm a and the influence of immigrants as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

639
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:18.960
<v Speaker 2>like because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

640
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.310
<v Speaker 2>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents,</v>

641
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.173
<v Speaker 2>my grandparents were immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all came over from England and </v>

642
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Ireland and Italy and they were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>savages.</v>

643
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 2>They were all people that were willing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get on a boat and cross the ocean.</v>

644
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:30.361
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

645
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 2>those are aggressive people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

646
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:33.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

647
00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.480
<v Speaker 2>And then the landlord Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're higher risk takers.</v>

648
00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

649
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

650
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:39.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a random population that </v>

651
00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:42.330
<v Speaker 2>came to America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor with Australia,</v>

652
00:28:42.331 --> 00:28:44.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you send all these converts on fixed.</v>

653
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.750
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to be a typical gene </v>
<v Speaker 2>pool there.</v>

654
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.480
<v Speaker 2>So meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good did that work out?</v>

655
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Those are the nicest people ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

656
00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:52.460
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

657
00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.290
<v Speaker 2>Germans after World War One and World </v>
<v Speaker 2>War Two,</v>

658
00:28:55.291 --> 00:28:56.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are bellicose people,</v>

659
00:28:56.551 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 2>but there are national character now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the nicest people in the world.</v>

660
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.400
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to fight anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

661
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.410
<v Speaker 2>That generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

662
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:04.763
<v Speaker 2>More than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have massive war guilt and </v>

663
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:08.770
<v Speaker 2>guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

664
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.683
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are all raised in taking </v>

665
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.310
<v Speaker 2>tons of classes in school about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

666
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.290
<v Speaker 2>why we're never going to do this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what we did at the Jew,</v>

667
00:29:18.291 --> 00:29:19.124
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still paying Israel reparations </v>

668
00:29:20.521 --> 00:29:21.354
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are these little stumbling stones </v>

669
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:24.923
<v Speaker 2>that are the sort of brass square cubes </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over Germany of the name and year </v>

670
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 2>that that person was murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are all Jews in front of the house</v>

671
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:38.100
<v Speaker 2>where they used to live there all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the place.</v>

672
00:29:38.101 --> 00:29:38.934
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a picture of him and the moral </v>

673
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:40.801
<v Speaker 2>arc here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you.</v>

674
00:29:40.801 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really dramatic.</v>

675
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.083
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you literally stumbled across </v>

676
00:29:45.521 --> 00:29:45.911
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

677
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 2>they're just there in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

678
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 2>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you google stumbling stones,</v>

679
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 2>you can see that they're better in four </v>
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>

680
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.613
<v Speaker 2>Another interesting thing about Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>is they won't let scientology and </v>

681
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 2>sensitive about cults and cult behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

682
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another reason for that and that</v>

683
00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 2>is in the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm in Germany.</v>

684
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a religious studios.</v>

685
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

686
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:09.701
<v Speaker 2>There they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

687
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:12.030
<v Speaker 2>so that's what they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're actually above ground.</v>

688
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 2>So you're just walking along and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look down and some of them,</v>

689
00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:16.780
<v Speaker 2>those are not the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not like that,</v>

690
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:17.614
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not like little bricks on the </v>

691
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:19.354
<v Speaker 2>ground and they're like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just said there in the ground and </v>

692
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:25.930
<v Speaker 2>the ground persons and they're in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the house where they used to live the</v>

693
00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:26.764
<v Speaker 2>date that they were departed in the date</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were murdered and where they </v>

694
00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:32.740
<v Speaker 2>were murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Auschwitz or a tribe triplink or dominic</v>

695
00:30:32.741 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

696
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:35.770
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty moving.</v>

697
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.870
<v Speaker 2>It's and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a reminder,</v>

698
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 2>this is what we did and we were not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do this again.</v>

699
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's changing norms.</v>

700
00:30:45.101 --> 00:30:46.120
<v Speaker 2>How does this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

701
00:30:46.121 --> 00:30:49.270
<v Speaker 2>It's that you can do it through the law </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the top down,</v>

702
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:51.280
<v Speaker 2>but really it's more a culture from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom up.</v>

703
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.670
<v Speaker 2>You were saying that there's another </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason besides that,</v>

704
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:58.150
<v Speaker 2>besides the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're sensitive to scientology.</v>

705
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in Germany they have a religious</v>

706
00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:05.950
<v Speaker 2>withholding tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you get your first job,</v>

707
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:06.963
<v Speaker 2>they do a withholding for your religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they give a percentage of your </v>

708
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:10.474
<v Speaker 2>paycheck to your religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the religion you were born into </v>

709
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:13.660
<v Speaker 2>baptized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

710
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.613
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly Catholic and Protestant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but others want to get in on that </v>

711
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:19.970
<v Speaker 2>because that's cumulative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

712
00:31:19.971 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 2>you can make some money doing this as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

713
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 2>The humanists of Germany get a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of this action.</v>

714
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.970
<v Speaker 2>It's considered a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So scientology when they saw that,</v>

715
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:28.540
<v Speaker 2>they went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

716
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.890
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free government money,</v>

717
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 2>tax money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

718
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 2>the Germans got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

719
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you're not a real religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting in on this.</v>

720
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:36.850
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

721
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:38.640
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

722
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.340
<v Speaker 2>when my wife came here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before she came here,</v>

723
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:45.610
<v Speaker 2>she quit church and you literally have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go down to the courthouse,</v>

724
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 2>fill out a form and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am leaving the church.</v>

725
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Please don't take my money anymore out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my paycheck.</v>

726
00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:52.624
<v Speaker 2>So you have to opt out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will be giving money to your </v>

727
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:56.020
<v Speaker 2>religion unless you fill out the form </v>
<v Speaker 2>and opt out.</v>

728
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

729
00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:58.923
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in this case it was kind of a funny </v>

730
00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:01.241
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

731
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:03.220
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just to make sure you know,</v>

732
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:04.054
<v Speaker 2>now if you sign this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get married in the Catholic </v>

733
00:32:05.711 --> 00:32:07.570
<v Speaker 2>church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get buried in the Catholic church.</v>

734
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't go to the ceremonies and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

735
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.470
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

736
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way I want it.</v>

737
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:14.580
<v Speaker 2>And she went down there with her four </v>
<v Speaker 2>horsemen,</v>

738
00:32:14.581 --> 00:32:16.240
<v Speaker 2>tee-shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said Dawkins,</v>

739
00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitchins.</v>

740
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:19.800
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's this?</v>

741
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they set up,</v>

742
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:24.730
<v Speaker 2>but now the moment you signed it starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective today.</v>

743
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.440
<v Speaker 2>But there's a three month lag for us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>not take the money out of your paycheck.</v>

744
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 2>My wife is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

745
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.140
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

746
00:32:32.141 --> 00:32:32.974
<v Speaker 2>It went up in a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it contract ends at ANZ for both </v>

747
00:32:35.201 --> 00:32:36.034
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go like,</v>

748
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.053
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just get to steal money for three </v>

749
00:32:37.991 --> 00:32:38.801
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three more months.</v>

750
00:32:38.801 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a weird thing</v>

751
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>that you have to opt out like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it has to be so definitive that you</v>

752
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:49.451
<v Speaker 1>have to sign papers and go someplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does fucking shady law it is?</v>

753
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:51.740
<v Speaker 1>It's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's gotta change.</v>

754
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:56.540
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of us are trying to talk people</v>
<v Speaker 1>into opting out quit church.</v>

755
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:57.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is amazing that in this country I </v>

756
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.183
<v Speaker 1>would like to know what the number is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>the churches in this country had to pay </v>

757
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:05.534
<v Speaker 1>taxes didn't mean clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you look at the </v>

758
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.163
<v Speaker 1>televangelist that are driving rolls </v>
<v Speaker 1>royces and flying around in private </v>

759
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:12.194
<v Speaker 1>jets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's profit is extreme amount </v>

760
00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:14.984
<v Speaker 1>of profit and it's discretionary income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can do whatever they want with it </v>

761
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with massive,</v>

762
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:22.010
<v Speaker 1>massive sums of money and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute.</v>

763
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.963
<v Speaker 1>So these people are clearly personally </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefiting from the contributions of </v>

764
00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>

765
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:27.643
<v Speaker 1>And then they don't pay taxes on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the case of like ministers who </v>

766
00:33:30.351 --> 00:33:33.380
<v Speaker 1>live in a church owned home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to pay property tax.</v>

767
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of hidden benefits there.</v>

768
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.140
<v Speaker 1>It's dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is dirty.</v>

769
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.090
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that it's still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

770
00:33:41.091 --> 00:33:43.730
<v Speaker 1>especially when you deal with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like scientology will,</v>

771
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:47.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who wrote it like it's,</v>

772
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.080
<v Speaker 1>this is not some ancient texts that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>handed down from,</v>

773
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:52.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy and the guy was a terrible </v>

774
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:55.640
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

775
00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:57.830
<v Speaker 1>he was a terrible science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>author.</v>

776
00:33:57.831 --> 00:34:01.580
<v Speaker 1>He just wrote every fucking thing he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote was a first draft,</v>

777
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 1>just boom gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

778
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:04.784
<v Speaker 1>it's just the most nonsensical nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing and yet they don't have to pay </v>

779
00:34:08.001 --> 00:34:10.820
<v Speaker 1>taxes because it's considered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate religion.</v>

780
00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.003
<v Speaker 1>Hurl is Harlan Ellison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great science fiction writer this </v>

781
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:14.870
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

782
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:15.703
<v Speaker 1>told me the story of what the famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>story where l Ron Hubbard allegedly </v>

783
00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go start a religion.</v>

784
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.590
<v Speaker 1>He said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

785
00:34:21.591 --> 00:34:22.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were but,</v>

786
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.630
<v Speaker 1>but it was just a bunch of science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction writers sitting around like this</v>

787
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.210
<v Speaker 1>chatting and complaining about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly paid they are.</v>

788
00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:30.800
<v Speaker 1>They have to crank out by the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

789
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Kenny at word kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somebody said,</v>

790
00:34:33.681 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should just start a religion and make</v>

791
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:37.070
<v Speaker 1>shit up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>

792
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:37.971
<v Speaker 1>Ron Hubbard says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

793
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:39.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good idea,</v>

794
00:34:39.051 --> 00:34:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I might do that.</v>

795
00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And then he went out and wrote dianetics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that became the founding document of</v>

796
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.490
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch the,</v>

797
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the HBO series on it?</v>

798
00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.520
<v Speaker 1>The documentary rather?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

799
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.370
<v Speaker 1>going clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

800
00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:53.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the best documentary on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

801
00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:58.901
<v Speaker 1>I've seen AALIYAH's show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got a big guts to go after.</v>

802
00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:00.783
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she's got good lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 1>are a and he has good lawyers or </v>

803
00:35:03.231 --> 00:35:03.860
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

804
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they've stopped suing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

805
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I think the climate has shifted and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think people were more,</v>

806
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.000
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the longest time,</v>

807
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.430
<v Speaker 1>all we thought of when you thought about</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology,</v>

808
00:35:13.431 --> 00:35:16.350
<v Speaker 1>thought about positive thinking and John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travolta,</v>

809
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise and they're all super </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>

810
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're getting things done and </v>

811
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:22.244
<v Speaker 1>there's auditing and they're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking care of their mind and thinking </v>

812
00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:29.000
<v Speaker 1>clearly and eliminating all the negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>influences.</v>

813
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 1>But then once there was a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors I think.</v>

814
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:36.830
<v Speaker 1>But once the Internet opened up these </v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctrines and you've got a chance to</v>

815
00:35:36.831 --> 00:35:37.664
<v Speaker 1>read it and people got a chance to mock </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then South Park did that whole </v>

816
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:43.590
<v Speaker 1>series on it where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what they actually believe.</v>

817
00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And you see like when south park did </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

818
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:47.370
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

819
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:48.270
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that real?</v>

820
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And then people started googling it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then looking into it and then it started</v>

821
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:52.320
<v Speaker 1>to unravel.</v>

822
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely people started leaving</v>
<v Speaker 1>the church,</v>

823
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:55.854
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence Wright wrote the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things are happening and now </v>

824
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Leah is coming in and Leah was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

825
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I knew her but I mean I'm friends with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin James from the king and Queen.</v>

826
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:05.004
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known Leah for 20 plus years and </v>

827
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.340
<v Speaker 1>when I first met her she was just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this hard ass beautiful woman who's just</v>

828
00:36:13.561 --> 00:36:15.920
<v Speaker 1>like driven and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she's a scientologist,</v>

829
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.490
<v Speaker 1>like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get the fuck out of her way.</v>

830
00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.620
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like that.</v>

831
00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.453
<v Speaker 1>She's just like super active and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting things done and just being </v>

832
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:25.830
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

833
00:36:25.831 --> 00:36:28.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what you thought about when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about scientology,</v>

834
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but now what you think about it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

835
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just foolishness and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once going clear area and you've got</v>

836
00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:39.801
<v Speaker 1>to see l Ron Hubbard and listened to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk and you see the captain's outfit he</v>

837
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:43.500
<v Speaker 1>had on with the medals that he gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

838
00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who would buy this test?</v>

839
00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Cell Dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

840
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:53.630
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that it's so effective and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so financially successful.</v>

841
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:55.351
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

842
00:36:55.351 --> 00:36:57.270
<v Speaker 1>I think their membership roles are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty low,</v>

843
00:36:57.271 --> 00:37:00.390
<v Speaker 1>but their property holdings I think are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty extensive.</v>

844
00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're the second biggest real </v>

845
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:05.010
<v Speaker 1>estate owner in Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

846
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least they were.</v>

847
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.633
<v Speaker 1>There were some Japanese folks that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one and then it was a number two </v>

848
00:37:11.841 --> 00:37:14.490
<v Speaker 1>was scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's not true anymore.</v>

849
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Might be oil barons now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

850
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:20.820
<v Speaker 1>back in the nineties when the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>first got cranked up,</v>

851
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:22.263
<v Speaker 1>we were doing articles on scientology is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when some of these ex members started </v>

852
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:26.724
<v Speaker 1>posting the secret doctrines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news story and the going clear at </v>

853
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.920
<v Speaker 1>level eight or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you find out the the,</v>

854
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inside story,</v>

855
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:35.483
<v Speaker 1>and they got raided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the scientologists went to court </v>

856
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.483
<v Speaker 1>to court to judges and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is copyrighted material and it's </v>

857
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:43.650
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

858
00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:46.470
<v Speaker 1>wait your religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you copyright of religious?</v>

859
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they somehow got around that.</v>

860
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:49.584
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be like the Catholic church </v>

861
00:37:50.161 --> 00:37:50.994
<v Speaker 1>not telling you about Jesus and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resurrection until level eight after </v>

862
00:37:53.851 --> 00:37:55.860
<v Speaker 1>you've paid $100,000 or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

863
00:37:55.861 --> 00:37:56.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

864
00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:01.620
<v Speaker 1>what's amazing is that the irs caved in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that happened,</v>

865
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I remember when that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

866
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck with these guys.</v>

867
00:38:04.711 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'd beat the irs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nobody.</v>

868
00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.900
<v Speaker 1>How am I going to defend myself again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe they've stopped suing people.</v>

869
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:10.734
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're not going after Leah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like la real estate here goes portfolio </v>

870
00:38:14.341 --> 00:38:18.270
<v Speaker 1>properties reported at $400,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars in Hollywood alone,</v>

871
00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:19.560
<v Speaker 1>paid for in cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No less.</v>

872
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:20.394
<v Speaker 1>The Church of Scientology is undeniably </v>
<v Speaker 1>a formidable player in the real estate </v>

873
00:38:23.611 --> 00:38:26.340
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you got.</v>

874
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.920
<v Speaker 1>They have some beautiful properties to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

875
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

876
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.173
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

877
00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.370
<v Speaker 1>my skyping friends like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

878
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.340
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go out of anytime soon.</v>

879
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.061
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

880
00:38:37.061 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I think they could have practically no </v>
<v Speaker 1>members instilled.</v>

881
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 1>They have all this real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

882
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 1>even though it's nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

883
00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 1>so is most religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just be honest.</v>

884
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:50.794
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you want to talk about guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back from the dead after being </v>

885
00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:53.464
<v Speaker 1>burned for three days or Adam and eve </v>
<v Speaker 1>being the only two people and they have </v>

886
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:57.394
<v Speaker 1>kids and their kids just started having </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex with each other and that makes all </v>

887
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 1>the people in the world or Moses parting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Red Sea and Jesus walking on water.</v>

888
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at horse shit everywhere.</v>

889
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just older horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

890
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:08.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's based on some real </v>

891
00:39:10.211 --> 00:39:12.250
<v Speaker 1>events or some real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

892
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's all nonsense.</v>

893
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard a giulia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweeney's monologue letting go of God?</v>

894
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:19.683
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Julia from Saturday night </v>

895
00:39:20.561 --> 00:39:20.830
<v Speaker 1>live?</v>

896
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I know who she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know her.</v>

897
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.820
<v Speaker 1>She just moved back to La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should have her on the show.</v>

898
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:25.840
<v Speaker 1>She's terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love to,</v>

899
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.033
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was born and raised Catholic love </v>

900
00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.320
<v Speaker 1>being a Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole culture and you all.</v>

901
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:34.030
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she started reading Dawkins and</v>

902
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:34.864
<v Speaker 1>me and Harris and so on and then kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>let all that go and then she wrote a </v>

903
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 1>monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very moving.</v>

904
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:39.934
<v Speaker 1>So the model like opens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's in her house in Hollywood and the </v>

905
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:44.494
<v Speaker 1>Mormon boys come by and she invites them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and they want to tell the story and </v>

906
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.650
<v Speaker 1>she's thinking this is like a Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitch story.</v>

907
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 1>You're going to pitch the story and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>get back to you later.</v>

908
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Tell you to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

909
00:39:54.671 --> 00:39:55.504
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted it to actually press to see </v>

910
00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:58.900
<v Speaker 1>if she could join right then and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

911
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.110
<v Speaker 1>they're on their two year mission that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>

912
00:40:01.111 --> 00:40:01.944
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a picture of these 2:18 year olds with </v>

913
00:40:03.341 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 1>their white starch shirts and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>bicycles.</v>

914
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 1>And so Julia starts pressing him a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

915
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:11.170
<v Speaker 1>So what's the story here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well see this guy,</v>

916
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

917
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.253
<v Speaker 1>he found these gold plates in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard and he translated to them from </v>

918
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.373
<v Speaker 1>ancient hieroglyphics into English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with these magic stones and they're </v>

919
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:22.024
<v Speaker 1>going on and then Jesus came to America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was the good Indians and the </v>

920
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Julie's like,</v>

921
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I just want to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

922
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.120
<v Speaker 1>don't start with this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a bad pitch story.</v>

923
00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Even the scientologists no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell them about new until way down</v>

924
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:37.870
<v Speaker 1>the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then she says,</v>

925
00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:38.950
<v Speaker 1>reflecting on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

926
00:40:38.951 --> 00:40:41.560
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I told somebody my Catholic story who</v>

927
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:42.394
<v Speaker 1>never heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would sound just as wacky because </v>

928
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:48.490
<v Speaker 1>it's virgin and the resurrection will </v>
<v Speaker 1>let all of its wacky.</v>

929
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.720
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

930
00:40:49.721 --> 00:40:51.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like we were talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you die,</v>

931
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.950
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

932
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is,</v>

933
00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:58.630
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there is an afterlife.</v>

934
00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.493
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when we stopped living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happens and our essential </v>

935
00:41:04.841 --> 00:41:08.440
<v Speaker 1>energy goes into another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>

936
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.750
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

937
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.000
<v Speaker 1>being alive is so titanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee Bizarre.</v>

938
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.233
<v Speaker 1>Just being a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking through eyeballs at each other </v>

939
00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:17.434
<v Speaker 1>across from this wooden table that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut down from living organisms that </v>

940
00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:25.810
<v Speaker 1>turned into hearts or surfaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sand them and saw him.</v>

941
00:41:25.811 --> 00:41:26.644
<v Speaker 1>And then he put it in a building and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got electricity's rolling through </v>

942
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:31.180
<v Speaker 1>the walls and if you stuck a fork in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

943
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of it is the fact that we're on a</v>

944
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.770
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fact that the universe is,</v>

945
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:39.650
<v Speaker 2>at least as far as we can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite,</v>

946
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.723
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that your essential energy </v>

947
00:41:43.941 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Speaker 2>doesn't transfer into some other state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

948
00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.540
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know.</v>

949
00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

950
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know to you.</v>

951
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you say something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not sure of and you say,</v>

952
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.660
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't really know.</v>

953
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.070
<v Speaker 2>You're a huckster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

954
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

955
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Speaker 2>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows.</v>

956
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's the conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heavens on earth.</v>

957
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't either.</v>

958
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.960
<v Speaker 2>I saw a bumper sticker that said </v>
<v Speaker 2>militant agnostic.</v>

959
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't either.</v>

960
00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean we have to.</v>

961
00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's my bottom line on this yet.</v>

962
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:15.621
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

963
00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:16.454
<v Speaker 2>No one knows for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to wake up and some great </v>

964
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.700
<v Speaker 2>place and there's a lot of my friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be awesome unless.</v>

965
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.813
<v Speaker 2>Unless it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God was mad that you didn't follow the </v>

966
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:25.240
<v Speaker 2>rules and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

967
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Christopher hitchens called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian Heaven Celestial North Korea.</v>

968
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:30.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's this dictator.</v>

969
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Then knows everything you do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls everything forever.</v>

970
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Celestial North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't tell you any more.</v>

971
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.093
<v Speaker 2>I told you already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you 2000 years ago this dude </v>

972
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 2>wrote it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pay attention to that,</v>

973
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.280
<v Speaker 2>but then it's not even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

974
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like one guy might've write it down</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago,</v>

975
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.960
<v Speaker 2>but then a bunch of other dudes got </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and how to revise it.</v>

976
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 2>They had like a new draft and the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug,</v>

977
00:42:56.691 --> 00:42:57.524
<v Speaker 2>they get to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People got to decide what goes in and </v>

978
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:00.644
<v Speaker 2>what doesn't go in and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories are based on accounts from </v>

979
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:07.370
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of years after Jesus's death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the Bible is a Wiki.</v>

980
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.593
<v Speaker 2>It is like a wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People contributed to over the years </v>

981
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:15.010
<v Speaker 2>until hitchens a at a great analogy with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

982
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:15.973
<v Speaker 2>When he was dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a series of essays for Vanity </v>

983
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his column a,</v>

984
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.973
<v Speaker 2>which you can get as a book now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called mortality or </v>

985
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:23.030
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

986
00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:23.864
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was people think dying is </v>

987
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:29.690
<v Speaker 2>like you're at a party and someone taps </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on the shoulder and says,</v>

988
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:30.830
<v Speaker 2>you have to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

989
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.770
<v Speaker 2>At worst the party is going to go on </v>
<v Speaker 2>without you.</v>

990
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:34.663
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

991
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.481
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

992
00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:36.314
<v Speaker 2>so let's play this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're at the party and you get tapped </v>

993
00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:42.140
<v Speaker 2>on the shoulder and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

994
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:46.160
<v Speaker 2>you can never leave the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to stay here forever with these</v>

995
00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:48.250
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when it,</v>

996
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Julie is funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines is Mormon.</v>

997
00:43:50.181 --> 00:43:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Boys were telling her like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in heaven,</v>

998
00:43:51.591 --> 00:43:53.560
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

999
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1000
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:55.903
<v Speaker 2>you're made whole again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the blind shall see and the deaf </v>

1001
00:43:57.531 --> 00:43:59.740
<v Speaker 2>shall hear again in the crippled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll be holding in.</v>

1002
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.863
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1003
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had uterine cancer and I had my uterus</v>

1004
00:44:03.951 --> 00:44:05.630
<v Speaker 2>taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I get my uterus back?</v>

1005
00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.210
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine these 18 year old,</v>

1006
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.350
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the uterus again?</v>

1007
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:11.211
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1008
00:44:11.211 --> 00:44:12.350
<v Speaker 2>you get your uterus back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

1009
00:44:12.351 --> 00:44:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she said,</v>

1010
00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:16.130
<v Speaker 2>what if he had a nose job and you liked </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1011
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Do I have to have my old nose back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven?</v>

1012
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.280
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1014
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.153
<v Speaker 2>and then they said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get to spend the rest of </v>

1015
00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:24.740
<v Speaker 2>eternity with your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she went,</v>

1016
00:44:24.741 --> 00:44:26.990
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would not be good in my case.</v>

1017
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:27.973
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there'll be cured though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll realize the errors of their </v>

1018
00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be all enlightened.</v>

1019
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the product.</v>

1020
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:34.560
<v Speaker 2>So this is called the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

1021
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1022
00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the theseus is shipped,</v>

1023
00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Greek men Atar slayer,</v>

1024
00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:43.350
<v Speaker 2>theseus comes back and is a hero and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1025
00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.140
<v Speaker 2>and they preserve his ship and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>museum forever,</v>

1026
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.660
<v Speaker 2>but the wood rots and they replaced the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ship.</v>

1027
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.270
<v Speaker 2>And over the centuries there's no wood </v>
<v Speaker 2>left from the original,</v>

1028
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:52.104
<v Speaker 2>but it's still cherished as if I call </v>
<v Speaker 2>this termers Mustang because my first </v>

1029
00:44:55.501 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 2>car was a 66 Ford Mustang classic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had that for 19 years.</v>

1030
00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Those cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it was a great car,</v>

1031
00:45:00.671 --> 00:45:03.090
<v Speaker 2>but I banged it up so much I replaced </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and that,</v>

1032
00:45:03.091 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every pretty much.</v>

1033
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:04.943
<v Speaker 2>By the time I sold it as a classic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>made a nice little chunk of change on </v>

1034
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:08.724
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was very little of the original </v>

1035
00:45:09.571 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's the pattern,</v>

1036
00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:12.624
<v Speaker 2>not the material that counts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this whole debate about when you're </v>

1037
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:19.230
<v Speaker 2>resurrected in heaven with Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up there?</v>

1038
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Is that your physical body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

1039
00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.830
<v Speaker 2>because some Christian sects say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1040
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.551
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1041
00:45:23.551 --> 00:45:26.160
<v Speaker 2>how old are you when you're in heaven </v>
<v Speaker 2>30.</v>

1042
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.083
<v Speaker 2>This is the year they came up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the year age Jesus was </v>

1043
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:31.500
<v Speaker 2>when he was crucified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1044
00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 2>But if Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't held 40 something.</v>

1045
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Fifty 1:51.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1046
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:36.234
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a resurrected at 30 year old </v>

1047
00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:38.874
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to the last 21 years of </v>

1048
00:45:40.261 --> 00:45:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan's body memories?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go back to that dude.</v>

1049
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.920
<v Speaker 2>That dude was down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

1050
00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.560
<v Speaker 2>You're happy where you are in your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>at this for sure.</v>

1051
00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1052
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1053
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:52.224
<v Speaker 2>that means you're a well lived life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what's up there with Jesus a or </v>

1054
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:59.680
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't mind having that body 30 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old body problems?</v>

1055
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.403
<v Speaker 2>I've been beating on it</v>

1056
00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.273
<v Speaker 3>21 years since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I was 13 when I got hardcore </v>

1057
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:10.480
<v Speaker 3>into Jitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's 20 years of getting choked.</v>

1058
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Of course the Christian would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well God makes you whole again,</v>

1059
00:46:14.481 --> 00:46:17.960
<v Speaker 2>you'll have no injuries but that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really part of you.</v>

1060
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Part of you is your injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your muscles know</v>

1061
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.610
<v Speaker 3>to say those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all those,</v>

1062
00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:26.520
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff that I did that hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also learned from that's right.</v>

1063
00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Make you stronger but not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like learned the story.</v>

1064
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:32.283
<v Speaker 3>I think through incremental struggle </v>
<v Speaker 3>with whether it's rigorous exercise or </v>

1065
00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:36.963
<v Speaker 3>learning something or a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think everything that I do that's </v>

1066
00:46:40.151 --> 00:46:42.880
<v Speaker 3>difficult makes me just a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>more aware,</v>

1067
00:46:42.881 --> 00:46:45.610
<v Speaker 3>a little bit better at other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a little bit,</v>

1068
00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.060
<v Speaker 3>a little bit better to talk to a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit easier to deal with,</v>

1069
00:46:49.061 --> 00:46:51.910
<v Speaker 3>a little more friendly and all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1070
00:46:51.911 --> 00:46:52.744
<v Speaker 3>I think I wouldn't give up for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's more important than </v>

1071
00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.570
<v Speaker 3>whatever injuries I've got with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1072
00:46:59.460 --> 00:46:59.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1073
00:46:59.901 --> 00:47:01.750
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how you're going to feel when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 80.</v>

1074
00:47:01.751 --> 00:47:04.780
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if you feel like that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to be a point of diminishing returns</v>

1075
00:47:04.781 --> 00:47:05.614
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be stupid and 40 than to be </v>

1076
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.630
<v Speaker 3>enlightened and can't get out of bed </v>
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>

1077
00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.350
<v Speaker 2>My older athletic friend is telling me </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about mid eighties when things drop</v>

1078
00:47:15.351 --> 00:47:19.460
<v Speaker 2>off fairly quickly and they could stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty fit into their seventies,</v>

1079
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.530
<v Speaker 2>maybe still racing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bike racing at 80,</v>

1080
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.680
<v Speaker 2>but 85 or so things drop off pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

1081
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.740
<v Speaker 2>That's where you've got to go to hormone</v>
<v Speaker 2>replacement or whatever.</v>

1082
00:47:27.741 --> 00:47:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or the ice pledges or the.</v>

1083
00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1084
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the young person's blood or something.</v>

1085
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I deal with it,</v>

1086
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no breakthrough miracles yet,</v>

1087
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:37.563
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against any of these things </v>

1088
00:47:38.621 --> 00:47:39.221
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1089
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:40.054
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone like Jeff Bezos puts </v>

1090
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:45.040
<v Speaker 2>$100,000,000 into an aging company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope he's successful.</v>

1091
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Does he have $100,000,000 in an aging </v>
<v Speaker 2>company?</v>

1092
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:47.943
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and Peter thiel and the Google guys </v>

1093
00:47:50.921 --> 00:47:51.754
<v Speaker 2>through Calico and a few others have </v>
<v Speaker 2>invested many hundreds of millions of </v>

1094
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.560
<v Speaker 2>dollars into cup like Calico for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

1095
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:57.963
<v Speaker 2>These are companies that are trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their big goal is to defeat aging </v>

1096
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:06.100
<v Speaker 2>through reengineering cells and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1097
00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.213
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of philosophical goal </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind it is we have to defeat aging so </v>

1098
00:48:10.031 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 2>people can live for centuries or forever</v>
<v Speaker 2>to which I say,</v>

1099
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.090
<v Speaker 2>let's not worry about living 500 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1100
00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.053
<v Speaker 2>let's worry about prostate cancer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>breast cancer and Alzheimer's and </v>

1101
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 2>dementia.</v>

1102
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 2>And so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little incremental medical problem,</v>

1103
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.050
<v Speaker 2>quality of life things were the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that take people out young.</v>

1104
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that you can live a longer,</v>

1105
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:35.260
<v Speaker 2>higher quality life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Imagine Michael Shermer at 300 years</v>

1106
00:48:35.261 --> 00:48:35.890
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not,</v>

1107
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:36.723
<v Speaker 2>keep this body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can keep the body that you have </v>

1108
00:48:37.901 --> 00:48:38.860
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're moving around,</v>

1109
00:48:38.861 --> 00:48:39.641
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's well.</v>

1110
00:48:39.641 --> 00:48:42.130
<v Speaker 2>You look really healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How smart would you be?</v>

1111
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.400
<v Speaker 2>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much more enlightened or wise?</v>

1112
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against that.</v>

1113
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to live as long as I possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

1114
00:48:50.411 --> 00:48:51.790
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people that go,</v>

1115
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:53.410
<v Speaker 2>well that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not natural.</v>

1116
00:48:53.411 --> 00:48:54.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1117
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:54.843
<v Speaker 2>what's natural?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's surveys on this people and </v>

1118
00:48:56.981 --> 00:48:59.620
<v Speaker 2>people's answer is whatever the current </v>
<v Speaker 2>average lifespan is.</v>

1119
00:48:59.621 --> 00:48:59.981
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1120
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 2>80 seems about right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1121
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1122
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.860
<v Speaker 2>the day before your 80th birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow you're going to go.</v>

1123
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 2>You want another week?</v>

1124
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take another week.</v>

1125
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then fast forward six days a,</v>

1126
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.360
<v Speaker 2>would you like another month?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take another month.</v>

1127
00:49:13.361 --> 00:49:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1128
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:17.920
<v Speaker 2>and that would never end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So of course if you're healthy and happy</v>

1129
00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:20.490
<v Speaker 2>and you don't want it off yourself or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever because you're super,</v>

1130
00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.510
<v Speaker 2>super depressed or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1131
00:49:22.511 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 2>You're just gonna want to keep going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with that.</v>

1132
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.940
<v Speaker 2>If we can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if you die and it's way better.</v>

1133
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.700
<v Speaker 2>What if you die and you really do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you leave your physical body.</v>

1134
00:49:33.701 --> 00:49:38.650
<v Speaker 2>There's no need for emotions and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entanglements of human existence and you</v>

1135
00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:39.484
<v Speaker 2>go to this beautiful place of bliss and </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and love and it's just pure love </v>

1136
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.220
<v Speaker 2>without a body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1137
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:49.420
<v Speaker 2>And embodied an unhindered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what.</v>

1138
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:50.860
<v Speaker 2>That'd be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's.</v>

1139
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Is that what we're here for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're here for fun.</v>

1140
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.510
<v Speaker 2>We're doing a shitty job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chatty going crazy right now.</v>

1141
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Should be in a party van on the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>

1142
00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.013
<v Speaker 2>I had a college professor when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my Christian days who asked me when I </v>

1143
00:50:02.351 --> 00:50:06.010
<v Speaker 2>was pitching him the Christian story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1144
00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.013
<v Speaker 2>are there golf courses and tennis courts</v>
<v Speaker 2>in heaven because I like physical </v>

1145
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:10.924
<v Speaker 2>challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to get out there and push </v>

1146
00:50:11.981 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 2>myself like I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1147
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.080
<v Speaker 2>so I mean we'd haven't been no </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges,</v>

1148
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 2>no working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no physical,</v>

1149
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tensions and true,</v>

1150
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:22.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:22.933
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you don't need it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'd have to remove that part of </v>

1152
00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 2>humanity that we'd no longer</v>

1153
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 1>want challenges and to be pushed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>better ourselves.</v>

1154
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Do they play chess in heaven</v>
<v Speaker 1>when</v>

1155
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you get to win in heaven or is everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>a winner?</v>

1156
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets a gold medal and a Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 1>prize and whatever.</v>

1157
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:44.130
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a problem.</v>

1158
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Are the things that we're attracted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we enjoy,</v>

1159
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:50.750
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments and achievements and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things that they exist only inside</v>

1160
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:54.770
<v Speaker 1>of the civilization inside of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this realm that we've created.</v>

1161
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:55.873
<v Speaker 1>The significance of them is entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on our own agreements that it's </v>

1162
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.600
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you take the king right now,</v>

1163
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.460
<v Speaker 1>it's important when the ball goes into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the net,</v>

1164
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:05.323
<v Speaker 1>these we've agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when someone shoots a three </v>

1165
00:51:06.801 --> 00:51:08.870
<v Speaker 1>pointer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that big a deal.</v>

1166
00:51:08.871 --> 00:51:11.920
<v Speaker 1>You just throwing a ball into a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really significant happens,</v>

1167
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.020
<v Speaker 1>but because we've attached all of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to that,</v>

1168
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.920
<v Speaker 1>then it's something that we really want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see and everybody score the goal went</v>

1169
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:20.360
<v Speaker 1>in the Puck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went in the net.</v>

1170
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes this giant thing if they just</v>

1171
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.630
<v Speaker 1>have no good answer for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he said,</v>

1172
00:51:25.631 --> 00:51:26.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's heaven like?</v>

1173
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Psychics will tell you it's a bliss and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lever would.</v>

1174
00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:30.860
<v Speaker 1>But what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds again,</v>

1175
00:51:30.861 --> 00:51:32.300
<v Speaker 1>back to hitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds boring.</v>

1176
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I have to stay at this party forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds boring.</v>

1177
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the guy who took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>photo of himself in heaven?</v>

1178
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.700
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever saw that</v>

1179
00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:46.050
<v Speaker 1>he used the Samsung Galaxy phone to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1180
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:46.933
<v Speaker 1>to take a picture of himself in heaven?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there what clouds are white is </v>

1181
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:54.440
<v Speaker 1>smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is one of the funniest fucking photos</v>

1182
00:51:54.441 --> 00:51:55.274
<v Speaker 1>you're ever going to find on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet just because of the context of </v>

1183
00:51:56.841 --> 00:51:57.561
<v Speaker 1>it and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:51:57.561 --> 00:52:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was an African gentleman </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a.</v>

1185
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.160
<v Speaker 1>either he's telling the truth or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilariously full of shit.</v>

1186
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.233
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if he really did go to heaven </v>

1187
00:52:06.021 --> 00:52:08.150
<v Speaker 1>and took a picture and we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>mocking them.</v>

1188
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be going to him for advice.</v>

1189
00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.800
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is it really found it.</v>

1190
00:52:12.801 --> 00:52:14.780
<v Speaker 1>You see the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mocking,</v>

1191
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.570
<v Speaker 1>the memes of making fun of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

1192
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.810
<v Speaker 1>The actual picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find the original.</v>

1193
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Just Google man takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1194
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what everyone wants to make fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1195
00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:30.230
<v Speaker 1>The edit is so overwhelmingly mocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

1196
00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got to be playing a large part.</v>

1197
00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is.</v>

1198
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's saying this same this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1199
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.880
<v Speaker 1>it was all white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that.</v>

1200
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:41.953
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like that picture of him </v>

1201
00:52:45.741 --> 00:52:46.574
<v Speaker 1>holding his hand up like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just the background wasn't </v>

1202
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 1>rainbows and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could find it,</v>

1203
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:53.330
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have faith in you.</v>

1204
00:52:53.331 --> 00:52:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I found it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1205
00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.460
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1206
00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:00.803
<v Speaker 1>it's just hilarious that someone would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be so confident to put that picture </v>

1207
00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:06.464
<v Speaker 1>online knowing full well that the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to see that picture and start </v>

1208
00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:12.110
<v Speaker 1>rubbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who sold his soul on Ebay.</v>

1209
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what he got for it,</v>

1210
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:16.760
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of religious people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>offended by this.</v>

1211
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.170
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell your soul why not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sold your soul to your religion.</v>

1212
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Did he get a good price?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1213
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a theater bucks or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

1214
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.620
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to go to dinner with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1215
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.673
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1216
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 1>But my concern about all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession with the afterlife,</v>

1217
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from his page.</v>

1218
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up this morning and saw this.</v>

1219
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Had to take a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1220
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll start with devin.</v>

1221
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.520
<v Speaker 1>That's not the actual photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That photo of him and having his.</v>

1222
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.260
<v Speaker 1>What's hilarious is that picture with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him that far left,</v>

1223
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Speaker 1>far left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1224
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:48.840
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the photo.</v>

1225
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 1>That is him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the photo.</v>

1226
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Went to heaven and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the exact photo he took.</v>

1227
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who took the puddle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1228
00:53:55.951 --> 00:53:56.784
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angel,</v>

1229
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 1>do me a solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1230
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 1>not a selfie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his one hand is down so he's not.</v>

1231
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 1>He's not taking it with that hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other hand is up,</v>

1232
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.870
<v Speaker 1>lets him in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

1233
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is so good for mocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>things though.</v>

1234
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:13.523
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best things ever in </v>

1235
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:16.614
<v Speaker 1>terms of like there's so many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are paying attention and so many </v>

1236
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:22.950
<v Speaker 1>people that are funny that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians per se.</v>

1237
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:23.783
<v Speaker 1>They just might work in an office </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and they've got a little bit </v>

1238
00:54:25.051 --> 00:54:25.884
<v Speaker 1>of free time and they'll make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious meme about something and then </v>

1239
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.260
<v Speaker 1>everybody runs with it and things just </v>
<v Speaker 1>get mocked mercilessly.</v>

1240
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:32.453
<v Speaker 1>Remember the the video of the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was having an interview and his kids </v>

1241
00:54:35.061 --> 00:54:35.894
<v Speaker 1>started walking in behind him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to talk about foreign relations </v>

1242
00:54:38.701 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 1>in Poland or something and the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid is back here and then somebody.</v>

1243
00:54:41.521 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 1>The life rushes in and so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of funny spoof videos on</v>

1244
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:46.134
<v Speaker 1>that where it says some woman is sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>there talking about nuclear strategy or </v>

1245
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the kid comes in,</v>

1246
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:52.043
<v Speaker 1>she's ironing the shirt and then she </v>
<v Speaker 1>diffuses a bomb and then she cleans up </v>

1247
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:58.110
<v Speaker 1>the socks or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>

1248
00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's we,</v>

1249
00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.043
<v Speaker 1>we were always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of our information was distributed </v>

1250
00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:07.380
<v Speaker 1>to us through these very controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>networks,</v>

1251
00:55:07.381 --> 00:55:12.381
<v Speaker 1>whether it's CBS or NBC or ABC and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was very cut and dry and very</v>

1252
00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:15.720
<v Speaker 1>professional in the way people talk.</v>

1253
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.840
<v Speaker 1>The way information was presented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's just,</v>

1254
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:22.270
<v Speaker 1>it's open and loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as soon as I find out about some,</v>

1255
00:55:22.271 --> 00:55:24.990
<v Speaker 1>something happened in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I google it.</v>

1256
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

1257
00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:26.641
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1258
00:55:26.641 --> 00:55:27.474
<v Speaker 1>I Google it and then I'll go to twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when I go to twitter it's all </v>

1259
00:55:30.121 --> 00:55:33.750
<v Speaker 1>pictures and memes and it's the dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the question marks.</v>

1260
00:55:33.751 --> 00:55:35.130
<v Speaker 1>You know that guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1261
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.033
<v Speaker 1>there's so many memes that people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw up when anything crazy happens in </v>

1262
00:55:39.661 --> 00:55:40.494
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes so interesting to hear the </v>

1263
00:55:42.811 --> 00:55:47.550
<v Speaker 1>news and hear commentary on the news </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this just gigantic,</v>

1264
00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:48.384
<v Speaker 1>massive humans and it's what's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny or most interesting or most </v>

1265
00:55:52.591 --> 00:55:55.350
<v Speaker 1>succinct or poignant that rises to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>

1266
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1267
00:55:57.211 --> 00:56:02.211
<v Speaker 1>There's endless content to entertain a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>also just a high quality content.</v>

1268
00:56:02.461 --> 00:56:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a content producer,</v>

1269
00:56:04.071 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I write and so on and but I am a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer.</v>

1270
00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the people I follow on twitter,</v>

1271
00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 1>post articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them I want to read.</v>

1272
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:13.910
<v Speaker 1>So in the course of a couple of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my little window popups,</v>

1273
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just spread across the top of the </v>

1274
00:56:15.961 --> 00:56:18.120
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to read all of these articles and</v>

1275
00:56:18.121 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I plow through as many as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty much like the Atlantic or</v>

1276
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 1>vanity time,</v>

1277
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty high quality,</v>

1278
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.093
<v Speaker 2>well written articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is as a content producer </v>

1279
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:31.603
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the half life of these articles </v>

1280
00:56:34.151 --> 00:56:35.680
<v Speaker 2>is so short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1281
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 2>like when I post one of my scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>American columns,</v>

1282
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I put a lot of work into it and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1283
00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:43.600
<v Speaker 2>like a couple of hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe days later gone.</v>

1284
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:47.530
<v Speaker 2>No one's talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I put a lot of work into that,</v>

1285
00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:49.623
<v Speaker 2>but it takes me out of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the New York Times did that huge </v>

1286
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:53.523
<v Speaker 2>New York Times Sunday magazine article </v>
<v Speaker 2>on trump's business going all the way </v>

1287
00:56:56.921 --> 00:56:58.700
<v Speaker 2>back to the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1288
00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:00.670
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spent like a year working on this,</v>

1289
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:01.504
<v Speaker 2>like 10 journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This would have been a pulitzer prize </v>

1290
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:06.880
<v Speaker 2>winning piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This would have done in anybody else put</v>

1291
00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:07.820
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1292
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:11.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean they had his own business </v>
<v Speaker 2>contracts and lawsuits and you know,</v>

1293
00:57:11.781 --> 00:57:16.781
<v Speaker 2>all the shady stuff going on and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>got huge media attention for about a day</v>

1294
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:20.500
<v Speaker 2>and a half and by Sunday morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Tuesday,</v>

1295
00:57:20.501 --> 00:57:21.334
<v Speaker 2>no one's talking about this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like these guys spent a year </v>

1296
00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:24.220
<v Speaker 2>working on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1297
00:57:24.221 --> 00:57:25.054
<v Speaker 2>what did it take to get that lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 2>paperwork from the Court House and they </v>

1298
00:57:29.411 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 2>had hundreds of things like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone like,</v>

1299
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:32.550
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1300
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:33.383
<v Speaker 3>Well and trump in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many scandals that I think </v>

1301
00:57:36.481 --> 00:57:38.520
<v Speaker 3>we've all become numb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1302
00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:39.510
<v Speaker 3>there is that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1303
00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:43.140
<v Speaker 3>There's so many that you just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get numb to it and it doesn't.</v>

1304
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:44.670
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't affect you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just go like,</v>

1305
00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he paid off at woman,</v>

1306
00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:48.340
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:51.330
<v Speaker 3>Those are the tiny ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big ones are the lawsuits,</v>

1308
00:57:51.331 --> 00:57:52.620
<v Speaker 3>the businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1309
00:57:52.621 --> 00:57:56.040
<v Speaker 3>the construction businesses where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't pay small companies.</v>

1310
00:57:56.041 --> 00:57:56.874
<v Speaker 3>You didn't pay him like a tsunami.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then these companies went under like </v>

1311
00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:00.053
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of the unethical business </v>

1312
00:58:03.031 --> 00:58:03.540
<v Speaker 3>practices.</v>

1313
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:06.270
<v Speaker 2>That's all in that article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1314
00:58:06.271 --> 00:58:09.390
<v Speaker 2>anybody else would be done in by </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1315
00:58:09.391 --> 00:58:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Any politician except him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just amazing.</v>

1316
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.073
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also what he represents to those </v>

1317
00:58:14.221 --> 00:58:15.054
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't necessarily have to be what </v>

1318
00:58:16.411 --> 00:58:18.300
<v Speaker 3>he really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what he represents.</v>

1319
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.253
<v Speaker 3>What he represents is like the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>flag and eagles and so like they have </v>

1320
00:58:22.891 --> 00:58:27.060
<v Speaker 3>this like really juvenile sense some </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks do.</v>

1321
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Of what he is and what he represents </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1322
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.550
<v Speaker 3>despite all the evidence to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>contrary,</v>

1323
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.413
<v Speaker 3>they have him in this category that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to drain the swamp and these </v>

1324
00:58:37.321 --> 00:58:40.530
<v Speaker 3>liberals are just going to cry and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to make America better.</v>

1325
00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's just,</v>

1326
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.010
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the side that they're on.</v>

1327
00:58:44.011 --> 00:58:47.640
<v Speaker 3>They're on the make America better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's also people don't have</v>

1328
00:58:47.641 --> 00:58:51.330
<v Speaker 3>the time to really look into this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who could fact check these things?</v>

1329
00:58:51.331 --> 00:58:52.164
<v Speaker 3>It's not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you work eight hours a day </v>

1330
00:58:53.761 --> 00:58:54.594
<v Speaker 3>and you have children and hobbies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how much time are you really paying </v>

1331
00:58:56.791 --> 00:58:58.930
<v Speaker 3>attention to trump's ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>

1332
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:02.250
<v Speaker 3>really looking into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really considering it before you vote,</v>

1333
00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:03.323
<v Speaker 3>are you really taking into consideration</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of a person he is and what </v>

1334
00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:09.150
<v Speaker 3>ripple effect it would have with any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>his policies take place?</v>

1335
00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People vote by their team.</v>

1336
00:59:11.741 --> 00:59:13.230
<v Speaker 2>This is my team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sticking to it.</v>

1337
00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he won the primary.</v>

1338
00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:15.100
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

1339
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 2>That's our guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're sticking with them no matter what.</v>

1340
00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a huge element of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure,</v>

1341
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:20.083
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also people love to argue too </v>

1342
00:59:21.501 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 3>and as soon</v>

1343
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 1>as they find someone as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they believe in,</v>

1344
00:59:24.951 --> 00:59:26.930
<v Speaker 1>they stick to their guns and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold strong.</v>

1345
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Despite all that mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take so much for people to turn</v>

1346
00:59:30.411 --> 00:59:31.244
<v Speaker 1>on trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real hardcore trump believers would </v>

1347
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:35.510
<v Speaker 1>take so much for them to decide enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>is enough.</v>

1348
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.620
<v Speaker 1>That'll be interesting to see if members</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his own party do something in 2020,</v>

1349
00:59:39.621 --> 00:59:40.454
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it seem like with Fox that Fox </v>

1350
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:47.080
<v Speaker 1>is slowly starting to shift their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their coverage a little bit,</v>

1351
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:49.760
<v Speaker 1>criticizing him a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pushing back a little bit.</v>

1352
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Shepard Smith is pretty good on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always been that way.</v>

1353
00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:53.530
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1354
00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:56.060
<v Speaker 1>he's always been great at that entity </v>
<v Speaker 1>will probably be last to go.</v>

1355
00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:57.310
<v Speaker 1>He's never going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never gone.</v>

1356
00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 1>He's never gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the same fucking lawyer.</v>

1357
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that that didn't say Canada.</v>

1358
01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1359
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.650
<v Speaker 1>You know that he had Michael Cohen was </v>
<v Speaker 1>his lawyer like,</v>

1360
01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:08.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1361
01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing we can have an immediate </v>

1362
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>is that there's lots of sources and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just have to just cross check as many as</v>

1363
01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't take on any one channel.</v>

1364
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:18.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish there was a really truly </v>

1365
01:00:21.621 --> 01:00:22.454
<v Speaker 1>objective service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it would be wonderful if there was </v>

1366
01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>people that were dedicated to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>editorial slant whatsoever.</v>

1367
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:30.583
<v Speaker 1>Just 100 percent fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how we know the facts </v>

1368
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:35.270
<v Speaker 1>regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Left,</v>

1369
01:00:35.271 --> 01:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No ideological curve to it at all.</v>

1370
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be fair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's got to be a market to that?</v>

1371
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Of course they all say that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do now.</v>

1372
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Politifact is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1373
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>they're the fact checking organization </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not reporting news.</v>

1374
01:00:50.371 --> 01:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>They're reporting on politics on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts said by politicians,</v>

1375
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:55.873
<v Speaker 1>so that's useful and I think there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>market competition amongst those people </v>

1376
01:00:58.611 --> 01:00:59.444
<v Speaker 1>to get more hits like we're fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>checking more than the other guys are </v>

1377
01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:02.504
<v Speaker 1>fact checking.</v>

1378
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Although there is two different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was aim accuracy in media and then</v>

1379
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:09.074
<v Speaker 1>there was another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the name and one was left </v>

1380
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:12.500
<v Speaker 1>leaning and one was right leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1381
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>can I have one without a wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing or left wing?</v>

1382
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that.</v>

1383
01:01:19.101 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading Jonathan hates book,</v>

1384
01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:26.450
<v Speaker 1>the two books that I've been reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

1385
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.730
<v Speaker 1>One of them we discussed on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>we did on Monday,</v>

1386
01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>but the other one is the coddling of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American mind.</v>

1387
01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:33.370
<v Speaker 1>That's good book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm into that now and it's,</v>

1388
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1389
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.780
<v Speaker 1>he covers this quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1390
01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1391
01:01:39.361 --> 01:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan is onto something good there </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Heterodox Academy,</v>

1392
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.513
<v Speaker 1>which I'm a member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor at Chapman University </v>

1393
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>and so I was the first member there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our university is pretty centrist.</v>

1394
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't get a lot of these protests and</v>

1395
01:01:52.311 --> 01:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>microaggressions and safe space stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1396
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.633
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jonathan's point is that it's more </v>

1397
01:01:57.711 --> 01:01:58.544
<v Speaker 1>of a sort of east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west coast public university thing or </v>

1398
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

1399
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Middle of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see as much of that.</v>

1400
01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1401
01:02:06.441 --> 01:02:08.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the polarization thing has gotten worse.</v>

1402
01:02:08.621 --> 01:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>You can see the polls since like 1990 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 of,</v>

1403
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask people how,</v>

1404
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>how evil are the Democrats or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans and you know,</v>

1405
01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>used to be tiny little differences</v>

1406
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.700
<v Speaker 2>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1407
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:24.060
<v Speaker 2>they diverge like that now where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side is not just wrong,</v>

1408
01:02:24.061 --> 01:02:24.894
<v Speaker 2>but they're immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are people I do think talk radio </v>

1409
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:34.431
<v Speaker 2>and television feeds into that or now </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media and in the bubble there.</v>

1410
01:02:34.651 --> 01:02:36.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>

1411
01:02:36.901 --> 01:02:37.734
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the heterodox academy as 2000 </v>

1412
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>members now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professors that said,</v>

1413
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:43.014
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stand up against this </v>

1414
01:02:44.401 --> 01:02:47.340
<v Speaker 2>censorship on college campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1415
01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:48.174
<v Speaker 2>you were talking to Jonathan about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people go and you had peed on and I've </v>

1416
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:52.434
<v Speaker 2>known pete for many years before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hoax papers and I think they've had it </v>

1417
01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:59.210
<v Speaker 2>in for him for a long before the hoax </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>

1418
01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.380
<v Speaker 2>But let's explain that to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this can be standalone.</v>

1419
01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:05.430
<v Speaker 2>People goes in a James Lindsey and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the Long Island pluck rose.</v>

1420
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.800
<v Speaker 2>And she wasn't on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get to meet her,</v>

1421
01:03:07.801 --> 01:03:08.640
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1422
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:09.503
<v Speaker 2>she's in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe they published a bunch of </v>

1423
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:16.740
<v Speaker 2>preposterous papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really ridiculous,</v>

1424
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:18.990
<v Speaker 2>like on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1425
01:03:18.991 --> 01:03:20.310
<v Speaker 2>a homeowner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

1426
01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:21.143
<v Speaker 2>The dog park one dog rape culture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Park and the reach translation of a </v>

1427
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:30.780
<v Speaker 2>chapter from mine comp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>replacing fem males with Jews,</v>

1428
01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:34.860
<v Speaker 2>eliminate the males that kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they did one before.</v>

1429
01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:37.710
<v Speaker 2>They actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pete and James Lindsey did one two years</v>

1430
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:38.544
<v Speaker 2>ago on the conceptual penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called and that the penis is a </v>

1431
01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:43.780
<v Speaker 2>concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>

1432
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:45.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1433
01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:47.430
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a hilarious paper.</v>

1434
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.713
<v Speaker 2>And the same month that came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was published in a kind of a third </v>

1435
01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:55.740
<v Speaker 2>tier feminist studies journals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they get criticized like,</v>

1436
01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:57.310
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not one of the big ones.</v>

1437
01:03:57.311 --> 01:04:01.380
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't really post anything but </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same week or that came out,</v>

1438
01:04:01.381 --> 01:04:06.330
<v Speaker 2>there was another paper published on </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist glaciology and I thought,</v>

1439
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:08.340
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone beat pete to the hoax.</v>

1440
01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is totally.</v>

1441
01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:11.650
<v Speaker 2>And I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is what's hot or bulleted</v>

1442
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 2>glaciology know study of glaciers.</v>

1443
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.753
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1444
01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.930
<v Speaker 2>And that glaciers are very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1445
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.411
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1446
01:04:18.411 --> 01:04:19.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racked and you know,</v>

1447
01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 2>it's all masculine and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1448
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.124
<v Speaker 2>so I called the university that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>affiliated with the lead author and I </v>

1449
01:04:27.181 --> 01:04:28.160
<v Speaker 2>said this is a hoax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1450
01:04:28.161 --> 01:04:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just before I say anything,</v>

1451
01:04:29.881 --> 01:04:31.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a hoax,</v>

1452
01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:31.761
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1453
01:04:31.761 --> 01:04:32.940
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>

1454
01:04:32.941 --> 01:04:36.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like I can't tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the conceptual penis paper,</v>

1455
01:04:36.511 --> 01:04:37.344
<v Speaker 2>which I know is a hoax because Pete </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote it and the feminist glaciology </v>

1456
01:04:40.111 --> 01:04:41.520
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

1457
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.473
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's explain what's happening to pete </v>

1458
01:04:43.201 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 2>now because pete was brought before a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland State University.</v>

1459
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:51.210
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be charged with,</v>

1460
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>

1461
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:55.480
<v Speaker 2>with faking data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fraudulent data,</v>

1462
01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.573
<v Speaker 2>fraudulent research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faking data that he didn't go through </v>

1463
01:04:59.281 --> 01:05:00.114
<v Speaker 2>the Institutional Research Board which </v>
<v Speaker 2>approves experiments that professors </v>

1464
01:05:04.411 --> 01:05:05.880
<v Speaker 2>want to run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>

1465
01:05:05.881 --> 01:05:09.630
<v Speaker 2>you could not do milgram's shock </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments where you hook people up and</v>

1466
01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:12.000
<v Speaker 2>tell them that you're going to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>electric shocks to somebody.</v>

1467
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.133
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't approve that or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or filled Zimbardo's fake jail who were </v>

1468
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:17.883
<v Speaker 2>randomly assign students to be prisoners</v>
<v Speaker 2>and guards and they end up beating each </v>

1469
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:22.240
<v Speaker 2>other up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would never approve that.</v>

1470
01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So since those sort of guerrilla theater</v>

1471
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.350
<v Speaker 2>experiments of the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universities have tightened up,</v>

1472
01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:30.184
<v Speaker 2>the kind of research are allowed to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>even like the kinds of questions you </v>

1473
01:05:32.321 --> 01:05:34.960
<v Speaker 2>would ask in a survey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to approve all of that.</v>

1474
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:40.510
<v Speaker 2>So of course Peter and James and Helen </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do that because first of all,</v>

1475
01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:41.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James was the primary director of this </v>

1476
01:05:43.121 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not affiliated with the university.</v>

1477
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:48.730
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have to answer to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pete was affiliated with it,</v>

1478
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:50.290
<v Speaker 2>so they're getting them on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1479
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>and that he didn't go through the IRB </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get approval.</v>

1480
01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to tell people,</v>

1481
01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.093
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to fake something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell them ahead of time that </v>

1482
01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:00.790
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna fake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1483
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:01.750
<v Speaker 2>because it's going to get out.</v>

1484
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:02.583
<v Speaker 2>And then the Gig is up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The analogy I made a the other day was </v>

1485
01:06:05.951 --> 01:06:06.784
<v Speaker 2>in 1971,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stanford psychologist named David </v>

1486
01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.970
<v Speaker 2>Rosen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a clinical psychologist,</v>

1487
01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:12.843
<v Speaker 2>sent a bunch of his graduate students </v>
<v Speaker 2>into mental hospitals all over the </v>

1488
01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:16.804
<v Speaker 2>country and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just tell him you're feeling kind of </v>

1489
01:06:19.631 --> 01:06:23.770
<v Speaker 2>blue and that you're kind of hear this </v>
<v Speaker 2>inner voice and that,</v>

1490
01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1491
01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:27.490
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of don't feel right and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need some help.</v>

1492
01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.533
<v Speaker 2>So they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all get themselves checked in and </v>

1493
01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 2>then from there on out they acted </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly normal and then the goal was,</v>

1494
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:36.550
<v Speaker 2>let's see how long it takes you to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1495
01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.133
<v Speaker 2>And so it was a study and how mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospitals treat people who are </v>

1496
01:06:41.111 --> 01:06:41.944
<v Speaker 2>completely sane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the title of his famous paper is </v>

1497
01:06:44.471 --> 01:06:48.700
<v Speaker 2>called being sane in insane places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>

1498
01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:51.310
<v Speaker 2>the Grad students report it's incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>boring.</v>

1499
01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.360
<v Speaker 2>So one of them would sit there and write</v>
<v Speaker 2>essays and take notes.</v>

1500
01:06:54.361 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so in the psychiatrist evaluation of</v>

1501
01:06:57.791 --> 01:06:59.080
<v Speaker 2>this patient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patient is,</v>

1502
01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patient exhibits,</v>

1503
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.013
<v Speaker 2>excessive writing behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is clearly an example of his </v>

1504
01:07:04.991 --> 01:07:09.991
<v Speaker 2>erupting had bitten libidinal impulses </v>
<v Speaker 2>from his childhood and Blah,</v>

1505
01:07:10.101 --> 01:07:10.410
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1506
01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Another one was a painter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she's doing paintings,</v>

1507
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:14.560
<v Speaker 2>but landscapes and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1508
01:07:14.561 --> 01:07:15.394
<v Speaker 2>patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see in the paintings the </v>

1509
01:07:16.391 --> 01:07:19.360
<v Speaker 2>erupting emotions and they conflicts in </v>
<v Speaker 2>her personality.</v>

1510
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:21.850
<v Speaker 2>They're just acting normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1511
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:23.043
<v Speaker 2>So the point of this hoax was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with our mental </v>

1512
01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:26.494
<v Speaker 2>institutions that they can't tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between a sane and insane </v>

1513
01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.160
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>

1514
01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.120
<v Speaker 2>So of course the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1515
01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.013
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the industry got pretty upset about </v>

1516
01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 2>being hoaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Rosanna and came back and said,</v>

1517
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:38.374
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the next year I'm going to send in </v>

1518
01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:41.560
<v Speaker 2>some more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if you can find him.</v>

1519
01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't send anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1520
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:45.641
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1521
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:46.474
<v Speaker 2>we think this guy's fake again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't tell the difference in </v>

1522
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.700
<v Speaker 2>their own patients and no one was even </v>
<v Speaker 2>faking.</v>

1523
01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:52.534
<v Speaker 2>So in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of what Pete and James and </v>

1524
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Helen did is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're sending these papers out,</v>

1525
01:07:57.401 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 2>if you can't tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what are you doing in this field?</v>

1526
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

1527
01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are.</v>

1528
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Some people I should say are drawn to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these nonsense ideas.</v>

1529
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:14.500
<v Speaker 2>And one of the papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dog park paper got it,</v>

1530
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:17.000
<v Speaker 2>got lauded for its excellent </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarship,</v>

1531
01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.693
<v Speaker 2>got praised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the weirder ones that they </v>

1532
01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:25.440
<v Speaker 2>hoaxed I mean because it's so obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous when you're reading it,</v>

1533
01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:28.190
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the fat bodybuilding one.</v>

1534
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:29.024
<v Speaker 2>They get another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I won an award for the best </v>

1535
01:08:31.461 --> 01:08:32.510
<v Speaker 2>paper we've ever had.</v>

1536
01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1537
01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Peter and James and Helen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1538
01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:42.990
<v Speaker 2>they are like professional scholars in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the grievance studies because it's.</v>

1539
01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:45.110
<v Speaker 2>If you read those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to write like that.</v>

1540
01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:45.973
<v Speaker 2>I mean it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took them a lot of practice to get </v>

1541
01:08:47.841 --> 01:08:50.150
<v Speaker 2>the jargon in the style then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1542
01:08:50.151 --> 01:08:50.984
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the options for someone like </v>

1543
01:08:52.581 --> 01:08:53.414
<v Speaker 2>Pete?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if he does get fired from the </v>

1544
01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:56.230
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1545
01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:57.980
<v Speaker 2>what could he possibly do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1546
01:08:57.981 --> 01:08:59.840
<v Speaker 2>what Jordan has done is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary.</v>

1547
01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:00.674
<v Speaker 2>He's essentially left teaching at </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the controversies that he </v>

1548
01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 2>went through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he became famous.</v>

1549
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.453
<v Speaker 2>He became famous for doing podcasts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing things and then his youtube </v>

1550
01:09:11.721 --> 01:09:14.630
<v Speaker 2>videos are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so insightful and,</v>

1551
01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.870
<v Speaker 2>and wonderful that people just got drawn</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>

1552
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:22.220
<v Speaker 2>And then they go to see him speak live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've made him into a monster,</v>

1553
01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 2>but bite censoring him by attacking him.</v>

1554
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:29.660
<v Speaker 2>They've essentially turned him into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>global international star.</v>

1555
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:30.913
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the best arguments </v>

1556
01:09:32.271 --> 01:09:34.850
<v Speaker 2>against censorship is going to have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite effect.</v>

1557
01:09:34.851 --> 01:09:36.340
<v Speaker 2>You wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone is a.</v>

1558
01:09:36.341 --> 01:09:38.020
<v Speaker 2>The quality of Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter says,</v>

1559
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:39.770
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty rare.</v>

1560
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:40.923
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to pete about this as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>as Bret Weinstein because he had </v>

1561
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.920
<v Speaker 2>suffered the same thing at evergreen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's out,</v>

1562
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:51.020
<v Speaker 2>at least he and his wife Heather got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>payout so they have a little cushion.</v>

1563
01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 2>But this model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say I'm on Patrion or Dave Rubin,</v>

1564
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 2>especially Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rare.</v>

1565
01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.293
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare to be able to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>living as a public intellectual on your </v>

1566
01:10:02.061 --> 01:10:02.894
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most public intellectuals that are not </v>

1567
01:10:04.551 --> 01:10:07.280
<v Speaker 2>in academia there with a think tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1568
01:10:07.281 --> 01:10:09.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cato Institute or reason magazine or</v>

1569
01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 2>any of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a left wing right wing.</v>

1570
01:10:12.081 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 2>They're all over the board.</v>

1571
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:14.323
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1572
01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.253
<v Speaker 2>it's possible they could get jobs there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually have a paycheck and those </v>

1573
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.473
<v Speaker 2>groups are usually funded by wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporters that we like the cause and </v>

1574
01:10:25.941 --> 01:10:28.700
<v Speaker 2>here's a pile of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not through Patrion.</v>

1575
01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.573
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible that pete say bread could </v>

1576
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:35.210
<v Speaker 2>do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a tough road to hoe.</v>

1577
01:10:35.211 --> 01:10:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan is very rare.</v>

1578
01:10:36.981 --> 01:10:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I've watched this through my whole life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1579
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:43.820
<v Speaker 2>this idea of making $10,000 talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>$50,000,</v>

1580
01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:47.330
<v Speaker 2>$100,000 a talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost nobody gets that kind of money.</v>

1581
01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:50.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>

1582
01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Carl Sagan back in the day,</v>

1583
01:10:54.231 --> 01:10:56.300
<v Speaker 2>whatever the equivalent of that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been in the eighties.</v>

1584
01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.970
<v Speaker 2>But that's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1585
01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's thousands of scientists that</v>

1586
01:11:00.561 --> 01:11:01.490
<v Speaker 2>would love to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1587
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:02.324
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go that.</v>

1588
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not entertaining.</v>

1589
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.140
<v Speaker 2>The thing about Jordan is he's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging,</v>

1590
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:10.880
<v Speaker 2>like he's in his words are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just their wise,</v>

1591
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.250
<v Speaker 2>it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a very articulate.</v>

1592
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:18.000
<v Speaker 2>There's something engaging about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>style in which he presents these things.</v>

1593
01:11:18.001 --> 01:11:20.580
<v Speaker 2>It's very captivating because very </v>
<v Speaker 2>charismatic.</v>

1594
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.950
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People discount that.</v>

1595
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.053
<v Speaker 2>Or I know a lot of scientists who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of jealous of Neil degrasse Tyson </v>

1596
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.190
<v Speaker 2>or say Bill Nye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1597
01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:30.024
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>

1598
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt that you can.</v>

1599
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil and bill are really entertaining.</v>

1600
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:36.870
<v Speaker 2>They are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are engaging.</v>

1601
01:11:36.871 --> 01:11:39.690
<v Speaker 2>You can't take your eyes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they're so much fun to watch.</v>

1602
01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.553
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect example is people are not like </v>

1603
01:11:41.341 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sean Carroll's brilliant.</v>

1604
01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.200
<v Speaker 2>He's really brilliant and I'm glad that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing a podcast now,</v>

1605
01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.290
<v Speaker 2>but when you listen to him talk and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to neil talk,</v>

1606
01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:50.124
<v Speaker 2>Neil just has this booming presence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sense of drama and energy and </v>

1607
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.930
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to be.</v>

1608
01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:58.900
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1609
01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:02.880
<v Speaker 2>he knows how to deliver it in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>just catches you.</v>

1610
01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.713
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did a public event in Australia </v>

1611
01:12:07.711 --> 01:12:08.544
<v Speaker 2>and in Melbourne or Sydney and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately I went before him and </v>

1612
01:12:13.171 --> 01:12:16.650
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's actually good a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a pretty good public speaker.</v>

1613
01:12:16.651 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I have a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1614
01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.520
<v Speaker 2>my value as a public speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good.</v>

1615
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I never seen him speak and I,</v>

1616
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:26.310
<v Speaker 2>and I did my talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my pretty much like my ted talk you</v>

1617
01:12:26.311 --> 01:12:27.690
<v Speaker 2>can watch online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty entertaining.</v>

1618
01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get up and I'm done.</v>

1619
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:29.904
<v Speaker 2>I get a nice applause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling pretty good and then neil </v>

1620
01:12:31.231 --> 01:12:32.340
<v Speaker 2>gets up and he starts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1621
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.353
<v Speaker 2>Oh crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is fucking good and you don't </v>

1622
01:12:35.491 --> 01:12:37.100
<v Speaker 2>want to follow that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1623
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad I already went and got so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much energy.</v>

1624
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1625
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:42.303
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also has that sort of charisma </v>

1626
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.230
<v Speaker 2>connection with the audience.</v>

1627
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:49.860
<v Speaker 2>A captures them and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could tell afterwards,</v>

1628
01:12:49.861 --> 01:12:50.694
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrongs of people around him and you </v>

1629
01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:52.643
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there and not very many people had </v>

1630
01:12:54.301 --> 01:12:56.310
<v Speaker 2>that and I don't think it's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just learn.</v>

1631
01:12:56.311 --> 01:12:58.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1632
01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.153
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can hone it and refine it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he can't just sort of naturally be </v>

1633
01:13:01.951 --> 01:13:04.890
<v Speaker 2>funny and engaging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's personality that comes out.</v>

1634
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I think you could certainly improve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you're right.</v>

1635
01:13:07.621 --> 01:13:12.621
<v Speaker 2>I think whatever personality you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he has that kind of engaging,</v>

1636
01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:13.734
<v Speaker 2>fun personality and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it translates very well to doing those </v>

1637
01:13:17.581 --> 01:13:19.710
<v Speaker 2>public speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since I was here a year ago,</v>

1638
01:13:19.711 --> 01:13:20.544
<v Speaker 2>I saw Jordan's event at a in thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>oaks at the Kavli theater there in 2000 </v>

1639
01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:29.010
<v Speaker 2>seats sold out standing room only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was good.</v>

1640
01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:31.530
<v Speaker 2>He was like different than Neil of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

1641
01:13:31.531 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 2>but just as engaging wasn't political.</v>

1642
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:36.830
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people there I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1643
01:13:36.831 --> 01:13:39.030
<v Speaker 2>recognized me and I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1644
01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.180
<v Speaker 2>these aren't like right wing nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these aren't young mailed,</v>

1645
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.870
<v Speaker 2>angry males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't like this at all.</v>

1646
01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:47.543
<v Speaker 2>And his message was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>straightforward and get your life in </v>

1647
01:13:50.341 --> 01:13:51.090
<v Speaker 2>order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1648
01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:53.010
<v Speaker 2>this is the way life is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

1649
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:55.710
<v Speaker 2>And he kind of went through his thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

1650
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:57.720
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

1651
01:13:57.721 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 2>And people loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very almost no politics in it.</v>

1652
01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Dave Rubin tells me he doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>get political on stage,</v>

1653
01:14:04.561 --> 01:14:07.260
<v Speaker 2>so that's not the motive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1654
01:14:07.261 --> 01:14:08.041
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1655
01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:10.020
<v Speaker 2>life is hard enough for most people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1656
01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 2>they like back to the self help thing.</v>

1657
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.323
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to be reminded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are a few simple things you could </v>

1658
01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:17.860
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get your life in order is like,</v>

1659
01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:18.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1660
01:14:18.181 --> 01:14:19.014
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda knew that I'm going to go back </v>

1661
01:14:20.231 --> 01:14:23.340
<v Speaker 1>out and do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His principles are very effective to.</v>

1662
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.130
<v Speaker 1>So they're very straightforward as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1663
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but what the guy like people goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1664
01:14:27.221 --> 01:14:28.360
<v Speaker 1>to bring it back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1665
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.253
<v Speaker 1>what could he do if he does get fired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be very difficult for him </v>

1666
01:14:32.171 --> 01:14:35.770
<v Speaker 1>to get a job at another university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously got roots in Portland.</v>

1667
01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:36.604
<v Speaker 1>He lives there now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole thing is he's pretty </v>

1668
01:14:39.761 --> 01:14:40.594
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he's a closeted </v>

1669
01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 1>conservative and thereafter him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely more liberal than me and</v>

1670
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I could tell even years ago that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1671
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.590
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna go after him.</v>

1672
01:14:50.591 --> 01:14:51.424
<v Speaker 1>I can tell mainly because he's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He puts truth and free speech ahead of </v>

1673
01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.400
<v Speaker 1>political positions.</v>

1674
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:58.211
<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might say,</v>

1675
01:14:58.211 --> 01:15:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm a liberal and these are my political</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>

1676
01:15:00.311 --> 01:15:03.460
<v Speaker 1>but more important to me is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1677
01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:04.803
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not as Jonathan make point </v>

1678
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:07.953
<v Speaker 1>points out in his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Universities are now at this divide </v>

1679
01:15:10.691 --> 01:15:11.524
<v Speaker 1>between are we here for social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>or are we here for truth and they're </v>

1680
01:15:15.191 --> 01:15:17.440
<v Speaker 1>having to make a decision and too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them are going for it.</v>

1681
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:18.303
<v Speaker 1>We're here for social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then just be honest about it </v>

1682
01:15:21.491 --> 01:15:23.860
<v Speaker 1>because that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't bury it.</v>

1683
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just that.</v>

1684
01:15:25.151 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's an effective way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue so social justice.</v>

1685
01:15:28.421 --> 01:15:29.254
<v Speaker 1>If you're ignoring the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you undermine your message because then </v>

1686
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:33.183
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's hidden somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like people can't read into it </v>

1687
01:15:36.191 --> 01:15:37.024
<v Speaker 1>and see exactly what you've said and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've supported certain causes and </v>

1688
01:15:40.331 --> 01:15:43.180
<v Speaker 1>denied the reality of others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

1689
01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.010
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Google memo thing.</v>

1690
01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:45.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Google memo thing was a gigantic </v>

1691
01:15:46.991 --> 01:15:47.860
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1692
01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:48.873
<v Speaker 1>because ideologically people jumped on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>side and argued and and I heard the CEO </v>

1693
01:15:53.861 --> 01:15:56.820
<v Speaker 1>of Youtube talk about how damaging it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was to women.</v>

1694
01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

1695
01:15:58.001 --> 01:15:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1696
01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:02.890
<v Speaker 1>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just talking about preferences that</v>

1697
01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.400
<v Speaker 1>are described by tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1698
01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:06.243
<v Speaker 1>this has all been peer reviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>studied papers on the differences </v>

1699
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:12.640
<v Speaker 1>between the preferences of males versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>females.</v>

1700
01:16:12.641 --> 01:16:13.474
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a value assessment at all </v>

1701
01:16:16.751 --> 01:16:17.584
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that he put into his paper a </v>

1702
01:16:20.861 --> 01:16:21.694
<v Speaker 1>page and a half of recommendations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get certain women interested in </v>

1703
01:16:25.271 --> 01:16:26.104
<v Speaker 1>tech and perhaps you could recruit </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way and make it more palatable </v>

1704
01:16:30.131 --> 01:16:34.870
<v Speaker 1>or exciting to them and that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist screened at all.</v>

1705
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:35.381
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1706
01:16:35.381 --> 01:16:35.860
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1707
01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.740
<v Speaker 1>There's online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a really good debate with Steve.</v>

1708
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Steven pinker in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1709
01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.110
<v Speaker 1>in a feminist scholar at Harvard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve has all his slides up there and he</v>

1710
01:16:44.111 --> 01:16:47.260
<v Speaker 1>just goes all through all the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are in that Google memo.</v>

1711
01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.860
<v Speaker 1>This is before the Google memo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>May,</v>

1712
01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:52.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe James more gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that from pinker's lecture,</v>

1713
01:16:52.151 --> 01:16:52.984
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1714
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:53.823
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty solid stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing in inflammatory about </v>

1715
01:16:56.921 --> 01:16:57.754
<v Speaker 1>the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of normal scientific </v>

1716
01:16:59.111 --> 01:16:59.771
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1717
01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:00.604
<v Speaker 1>here's a study that shows this well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this other study and then </v>

1718
01:17:03.071 --> 01:17:04.720
<v Speaker 1>they go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1719
01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:06.520
<v Speaker 1>And to story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not saying women are better,</v>

1720
01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 1>men are better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen.</v>

1721
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

1722
01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:12.590
<v Speaker 3>The here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was [inaudible] boss,</v>

1723
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:13.723
<v Speaker 3>here's what I would do because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us have written letters in support of </v>

1724
01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Pete and you can kind of see what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>about to happen.</v>

1725
01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Let's just drop this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let him keep his job,</v>

1726
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 3>keep our mouths shut because this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to backfire on us.</v>

1727
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Big Time lag did with evergreens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1728
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:30.900
<v Speaker 3>Or with the Google memo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I would do.</v>

1729
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Backfire on the Google memo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've realized that they've got a</v>

1730
01:17:34.341 --> 01:17:37.880
<v Speaker 3>preposterous ideology over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we know that maybe their stock price</v>

1731
01:17:37.881 --> 01:17:40.760
<v Speaker 3>hasn't gone down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually it affected them very much and,</v>

1732
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.580
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and many more people support it.</v>

1733
01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:44.414
<v Speaker 3>Many more people who.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things where you hear </v>

1734
01:17:47.181 --> 01:17:50.270
<v Speaker 3>one version of it and that version </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticks,</v>

1735
01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1736
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the version is he's a sexist,</v>

1737
01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:56.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sex is Google memo and then that's </v>

1738
01:17:58.491 --> 01:17:59.324
<v Speaker 3>all I need.</v>

1739
01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:03.110
<v Speaker 3>The Google memo is very sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very anti female.</v>

1740
01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.480
<v Speaker 3>And being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's many,</v>

1741
01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:06.314
<v Speaker 3>many people who support the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that was sexist was removed </v>

1742
01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:10.934
<v Speaker 3>from Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've made it a safer environment for </v>

1743
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:13.214
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1744
01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But did they idle,</v>

1745
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:17.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what this doesn't seem like</v>

1746
01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:18.614
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like they made it an </v>

1747
01:18:20.061 --> 01:18:22.270
<v Speaker 3>environment where you have to be careful</v>
<v Speaker 3>about facts.</v>

1748
01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because again,</v>

1749
01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:24.704
<v Speaker 3>it's not a value assessment of women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If women choose to go into the medical </v>

1750
01:18:28.521 --> 01:18:31.580
<v Speaker 3>fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more women are physicians,</v>

1751
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:32.414
<v Speaker 3>more women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's many fields that like </v>

1752
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:38.390
<v Speaker 3>disproportionately attract women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a negative value assessment.</v>

1753
01:18:38.391 --> 01:18:40.430
<v Speaker 3>That's just people are different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1754
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:41.323
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do with certain people </v>

1755
01:18:42.981 --> 01:18:44.870
<v Speaker 3>do because I'm different than them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1756
01:18:44.871 --> 01:18:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm not attracted to those fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1757
01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:47.653
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to find out why people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are attracted and when you see that </v>

1758
01:18:50.841 --> 01:18:51.800
<v Speaker 3>there's actual.</v>

1759
01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.080
<v Speaker 3>There's just actual statistics in terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what fields men are more attracted to</v>

1760
01:18:57.081 --> 01:18:58.520
<v Speaker 3>or what fields women are more attracted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1761
01:18:58.670 --> 01:18:59.503
<v Speaker 3>Now on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a reason why women aren't </v>

1762
01:19:02.061 --> 01:19:05.150
<v Speaker 3>attracted those fields because they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>harassed when they go into them,</v>

1763
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.980
<v Speaker 3>well that should be demonstrated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an APP,</v>

1764
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.590
<v Speaker 3>obviously a bad thing and that should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>addressed.</v>

1765
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1766
01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what he's talking about.</v>

1767
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:17.570
<v Speaker 3>And James Demore is like a very kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soft spoken.</v>

1768
01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.010
<v Speaker 3>He's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>

1769
01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:24.950
<v Speaker 3>He's very introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a kind guy and he's on the spectrum</v>

1770
01:19:24.951 --> 01:19:25.784
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you'd look at James </v>

1771
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Amaury got fares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The patriarchy.</v>

1772
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a nice guy and they said to him,</v>

1773
01:19:31.671 --> 01:19:35.690
<v Speaker 3>if you have any input on these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and feel like you can help,</v>

1774
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:37.100
<v Speaker 3>please contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1775
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:38.330
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's.</v>

1776
01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.430
<v Speaker 3>That's what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

1777
01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.240
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking software engineer.</v>

1778
01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:46.340
<v Speaker 3>He sat down and looked at all the data </v>
<v Speaker 3>and compiled it and he's saying,</v>

1779
01:19:46.341 --> 01:19:47.174
<v Speaker 3>well actually it seems like this is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why women are more attracted to </v>

1780
01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:50.084
<v Speaker 3>other jobs and this is the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>men are more attracted to these fields </v>

1781
01:19:52.671 --> 01:19:54.860
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist lead.</v>

1782
01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:55.331
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1783
01:19:55.331 --> 01:19:55.551
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1784
01:19:55.551 --> 01:19:55.801
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1785
01:19:55.801 --> 01:19:56.960
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the studies.</v>

1786
01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.033
<v Speaker 3>This is what you're asking me to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the concern that if the science </v>

1787
01:20:01.491 --> 01:20:02.324
<v Speaker 3>doesn't come out a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people won't be treated equally is </v>

1788
01:20:05.151 --> 01:20:08.640
<v Speaker 3>a bad idea because then you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>force the science to be distorted</v>

1789
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.160
<v Speaker 2>if it doesn't match your political </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>

1790
01:20:11.161 --> 01:20:11.994
<v Speaker 2>and that's so whether trans is natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever percentages or how old you </v>

1791
01:20:16.231 --> 01:20:19.540
<v Speaker 2>have to be before you get trans surgery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the hormones or whatever that.</v>

1792
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a raging debate right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but under,</v>

1793
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:23.303
<v Speaker 2>under underlying that debate is like we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to make it come out in a way that </v>

1794
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.010
<v Speaker 2>trans people are treated equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1795
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.700
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1796
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.750
<v Speaker 2>They should be treated equally anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of what the science says,</v>

1797
01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:35.580
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1798
01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:36.360
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1799
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.260
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the problem for people,</v>

1800
01:20:39.261 --> 01:20:44.261
<v Speaker 2>a peed and Brett like joining a think </v>
<v Speaker 2>tank is almost all these think tanks are</v>

1801
01:20:44.461 --> 01:20:45.294
<v Speaker 2>politically affiliated left or right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to bet and therefore you have </v>

1802
01:20:48.691 --> 01:20:49.524
<v Speaker 2>to kind of tow the political line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is our ideology in this thing tank </v>

1803
01:20:53.311 --> 01:20:54.144
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to write white papers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and op eds and send them out with our </v>

1804
01:20:57.121 --> 01:20:59.130
<v Speaker 2>kind of slant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that as well,</v>

1805
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but what if I disagree with this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and this here?</v>

1806
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Well then you can't work here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

1807
01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's the problem with those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that</v>

1808
01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:09.490
<v Speaker 3>the only option today when you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1809
01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:13.600
<v Speaker 3>I know he's not Jordan and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's very few people like Jordan,</v>

1810
01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:16.900
<v Speaker 3>but Sam Harris is also able to do these </v>
<v Speaker 3>species very compelling as well.</v>

1811
01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.440
<v Speaker 3>He's doing a lot of public speeches and </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing these big,</v>

1812
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:21.303
<v Speaker 3>big events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more opportunity to do </v>

1813
01:21:24.191 --> 01:21:25.024
<v Speaker 3>alternative things now than they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever been before and I would hope that </v>

1814
01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:31.630
<v Speaker 3>that becomes available to look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope Pete just keeps his job,</v>

1815
01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:35.020
<v Speaker 3>but if he can't keep his job at Portland</v>
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>

1816
01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:39.130
<v Speaker 3>I would hope that some other avenue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some other,</v>

1817
01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:41.020
<v Speaker 3>some other path as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1818
01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:42.530
<v Speaker 2>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1819
01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:44.000
<v Speaker 2>you never know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1820
01:21:44.001 --> 01:21:46.130
<v Speaker 2>you put a date on the calendar and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell the world,</v>

1821
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.560
<v Speaker 2>did they come?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they pay 10 bucks a ticket,</v>

1822
01:21:48.561 --> 01:21:50.300
<v Speaker 2>50 bucks a ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$100 a ticket.</v>

1823
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Not many people can fill a 3000 seat </v>
<v Speaker 2>auditorium or a 500 seat auditorium in</v>

1824
01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:57.413
<v Speaker 3>do is do a lecture series on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Grievance Studies and have the three of </v>

1825
01:22:03.181 --> 01:22:06.180
<v Speaker 3>them onstage talk about how silly these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things were.</v>

1826
01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they could put that together as a </v>

1827
01:22:07.961 --> 01:22:11.170
<v Speaker 2>theatrical presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would really be funny because there's</v>

1828
01:22:11.171 --> 01:22:14.040
<v Speaker 2>some hot alaria subjects covered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1829
01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:15.580
<v Speaker 2>they have to do is just read with </v>
<v Speaker 2>porcelain</v>

1830
01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:18.690
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] and we're in here and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about these things.</v>

1831
01:22:18.691 --> 01:22:21.000
<v Speaker 3>We were crying laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really,</v>

1832
01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:21.834
<v Speaker 3>really funny stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually probably the best path </v>

1833
01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:24.520
<v Speaker 3>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1834
01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Is to put together some sort of a public</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1835
01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.890
<v Speaker 2>They should do a book and then have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book to show.</v>

1836
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe even a TV documentary </v>

1837
01:22:33.161 --> 01:22:33.611
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1838
01:22:33.611 --> 01:22:36.070
<v Speaker 2>if they have somebody making a document,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good start.</v>

1839
01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:36.973
<v Speaker 2>And when I was in College at Pepperdine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>g Gordon Liddy and Timothy leary did a </v>

1840
01:22:42.161 --> 01:22:43.870
<v Speaker 2>stage show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1841
01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:44.753
<v Speaker 2>And they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were touring the country doing </v>

1842
01:22:46.511 --> 01:22:47.200
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1843
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:51.400
<v Speaker 2>And it was at Ucla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I drove down and saw it and it was so</v>

1844
01:22:51.401 --> 01:22:52.570
<v Speaker 2>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1845
01:22:52.571 --> 01:22:53.404
<v Speaker 2>g dot Gordon Liddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the man there with his three piece </v>

1846
01:22:55.631 --> 01:22:56.464
<v Speaker 2>suit and he's got his gun and Timothy </v>
<v Speaker 2>leary comes out in his boat shoes and </v>

1847
01:23:00.191 --> 01:23:03.490
<v Speaker 2>his flower shirt and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had it kind of scripted,</v>

1848
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>but it was well scripted in a way that</v>

1849
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.843
<v Speaker 1>seemed kind of spontaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really funny and educational </v>

1850
01:23:10.181 --> 01:23:13.990
<v Speaker 1>about how the government works and </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom versus security and rights.</v>

1851
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was brilliant and I think</v>

1852
01:23:17.141 --> 01:23:17.750
<v Speaker 1>they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1853
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:20.980
<v Speaker 1>like a 50 city tour of that g Gordon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Liddy was on fear factor.</v>

1854
01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.240
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1855
01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1856
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Did he hold his hand above a flame?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1857
01:23:25.241 --> 01:23:26.074
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we did hang him by his ankles and </v>

1858
01:23:28.031 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 1>slam them into a pool like over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

1859
01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the stunt was,</v>

1860
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:33.311
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1861
01:23:33.311 --> 01:23:35.830
<v Speaker 1>this guy's old to be doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1862
01:23:35.831 --> 01:23:36.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did,</v>

1863
01:23:36.731 --> 01:23:38.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some physical challenges.</v>

1864
01:23:38.891 --> 01:23:43.891
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking like this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more fit and more active than most young</v>

1865
01:23:44.741 --> 01:23:45.574
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was deep into his sixties at the </v>

1866
01:23:46.481 --> 01:23:47.314
<v Speaker 1>time when we had them on fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that screwed them up was </v>

1867
01:23:49.751 --> 01:23:50.584
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final stunt was a driving stunt and </v>

1868
01:23:53.321 --> 01:23:54.154
<v Speaker 1>it was at night and unfortunately his </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes are not that good and he just </v>

1869
01:23:57.521 --> 01:23:58.354
<v Speaker 1>couldn't see well without glasses and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he was driving the car slammed into </v>

1870
01:24:01.841 --> 01:24:02.674
<v Speaker 1>something or something.</v>

1871
01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:03.733
<v Speaker 1>You know what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you got them there now it's all </v>

1872
01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:06.913
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a chance to talk to him for a few </v>

1873
01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.950
<v Speaker 1>days hanging out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting guy.</v>

1874
01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:14.410
<v Speaker 1>You have a strong mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

1875
01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:16.720
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a talk show back in the nineties.</v>

1876
01:24:16.721 --> 01:24:17.554
<v Speaker 1>I was on when my first book came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White people believe weird things and I </v>

1877
01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:23.140
<v Speaker 1>talked about conspiracies there and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he asked me,</v>

1878
01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me about conspiracies.</v>

1879
01:24:24.311 --> 01:24:24.641
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1880
01:24:24.641 --> 01:24:27.010
<v Speaker 1>you tell me about conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know more than I do.</v>

1881
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.810
<v Speaker 1>He knows about real ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real ones.</v>

1882
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:29.644
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is my number one beef with </v>

1883
01:24:31.271 --> 01:24:33.340
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when you,</v>

1884
01:24:33.710 --> 01:24:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them that are so preposterous,</v>

1885
01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:39.220
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's flatter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if or what were the really dumb ones,</v>

1886
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:40.054
<v Speaker 1>there's a base on the opposite side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon and Nasa knows about all the </v>

1887
01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:45.210
<v Speaker 1>aliens are living in New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lizard people.</v>

1888
01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:50.250
<v Speaker 1>The problem with those is they undermine</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual conspiracies when you,</v>

1889
01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:54.430
<v Speaker 1>when you hear about preposterous things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they they get,</v>

1890
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:57.370
<v Speaker 1>they get categorized as conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

1891
01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Then when someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1892
01:24:58.931 --> 01:25:00.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a conspiracy about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1893
01:25:00.851 --> 01:25:01.684
<v Speaker 1>it's already a tainted idea because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word conspiracy is connected to </v>

1894
01:25:04.841 --> 01:25:05.850
<v Speaker 1>nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1895
01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Because there's so many nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theories.</v>

1896
01:25:08.831 --> 01:25:10.510
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1897
01:25:10.511 --> 01:25:12.490
<v Speaker 1>something like Enron that really did </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1898
01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Like there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the northwoods papers,</v>

1899
01:25:14.951 --> 01:25:17.320
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of like legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies.</v>

1900
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:18.071
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1901
01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:19.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out about the Gulf of Tonkin.</v>

1902
01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:20.180
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1903
01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:21.590
<v Speaker 1>they really did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

1904
01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1905
01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing a paper now and white people</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe conspiracies and so I go through</v>

1906
01:25:26.801 --> 01:25:28.600
<v Speaker 1>the whole list of all the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1907
01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:33.040
<v Speaker 1>but I am with the whole second half is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of them are true and there</v>

1908
01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:35.800
<v Speaker 1>are reasons we should be suspicious that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think of,</v>

1909
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wiki leaks or the Panama papers,</v>

1910
01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:41.043
<v Speaker 1>the Panama papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's all these billionaires opening </v>

1911
01:25:42.521 --> 01:25:44.350
<v Speaker 1>these shell corporations keeping their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

1912
01:25:44.351 --> 01:25:46.240
<v Speaker 1>They're not paying tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a conspiracy,</v>

1913
01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:48.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by definition to them are people meeting</v>

1914
01:25:48.581 --> 01:25:52.510
<v Speaker 1>in secret to conspire to benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves that harms the public good or</v>

1915
01:25:52.511 --> 01:25:56.530
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens a lot and the US government</v>

1916
01:25:56.531 --> 01:25:57.364
<v Speaker 1>in corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason we should be </v>

1917
01:25:59.741 --> 01:26:01.450
<v Speaker 1>suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>

1918
01:26:01.451 --> 01:26:04.000
<v Speaker 1>But what is it about people want to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>for</v>

1919
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.500
<v Speaker 2>a conspiracy and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's,</v>

1920
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to see,</v>

1921
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:09.643
<v Speaker 2>they want to see contreras behind jets </v>
<v Speaker 2>as evidence of the government spraying </v>

1922
01:26:12.741 --> 01:26:16.730
<v Speaker 2>things in the sky to control our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1923
01:26:16.731 --> 01:26:21.050
<v Speaker 2>So the sort of Baloney detection tools </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not too finely tuned.</v>

1924
01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is,</v>

1925
01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:25.640
<v Speaker 2>is that we're a tendency is to look for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some global,</v>

1926
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:30.770
<v Speaker 2>simple explanation for complex systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So while we all kind of recognize,</v>

1927
01:26:30.771 --> 01:26:31.604
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know corporations cheat and stock </v>

1928
01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:37.790
<v Speaker 2>traders trade with insight information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's kind of small and mundane.</v>

1929
01:26:37.791 --> 01:26:42.791
<v Speaker 2>It's not very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Global domination of the world know this</v>

1930
01:26:42.891 --> 01:26:43.581
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1931
01:26:43.581 --> 01:26:44.430
<v Speaker 2>who's doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1932
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:46.700
<v Speaker 2>so then it becomes like a Dan Brown </v>
<v Speaker 2>novel.</v>

1933
01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:50.810
<v Speaker 2>It's more compelling as a narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>story about how the world works.</v>

1934
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:51.663
<v Speaker 2>It's super simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's these 12 guys in London called </v>

1935
01:26:53.061 --> 01:26:55.840
<v Speaker 2>the Illuminati and they're calling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shots and they're,</v>

1936
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:57.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're controlling Oldenburg,</v>

1937
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:59.440
<v Speaker 2>the builder Burgers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Rockefellers,</v>

1938
01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:00.283
<v Speaker 2>the last child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Illuminati CFR new world order </v>

1939
01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:05.600
<v Speaker 2>towards Soros is doing it.</v>

1940
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.690
<v Speaker 2>He's a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1941
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:11.240
<v Speaker 2>It's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's number 13 in the Illuminati.</v>

1942
01:27:11.241 --> 01:27:14.850
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different competing </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories to so,</v>

1943
01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:16.910
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a couple of criteria.</v>

1944
01:27:16.911 --> 01:27:18.380
<v Speaker 2>The more people that have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved,</v>

1945
01:27:18.381 --> 01:27:21.920
<v Speaker 2>the less likely it is to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Gordon Liddy that told me this,</v>

1946
01:27:21.921 --> 01:27:22.560
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1947
01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.600
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1948
01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:24.493
<v Speaker 2>Three people can keep a secret if two of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them are dead now people can't keep </v>

1949
01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:29.930
<v Speaker 2>their mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also he would know because he worked</v>

1950
01:27:29.931 --> 01:27:32.000
<v Speaker 2>in government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are pretty incompetent.</v>

1951
01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.133
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that you can orchestrate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand people to and each of them is </v>

1952
01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:36.374
<v Speaker 2>going to go out and do this one thing at</v>
<v Speaker 2>9:00 Tuesday and it's all gonna come </v>

1953
01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:43.010
<v Speaker 2>together just perfect because impossible</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he should know.</v>

1954
01:27:43.011 --> 01:27:43.844
<v Speaker 2>I mean they couldn't even break into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watergate hotel room to get these </v>

1955
01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:48.290
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's also,</v>

1956
01:27:48.291 --> 01:27:50.330
<v Speaker 2>who is getting into government the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>place?</v>

1957
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Are they the geniuses of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heads of their field?</v>

1958
01:27:53.391 --> 01:27:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Or are they people that just decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into a job?</v>

1959
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:57.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

1960
01:27:57.690 --> 01:28:00.560
<v Speaker 2>this is a good percentage of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are involved in government.</v>

1961
01:28:00.561 --> 01:28:01.394
<v Speaker 2>If those people know as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these unexceptional folks that are just </v>

1962
01:28:04.001 --> 01:28:05.960
<v Speaker 2>like uninspired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were also,</v>

1963
01:28:05.961 --> 01:28:08.120
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1964
01:28:08.370 --> 01:28:09.203
<v Speaker 2>that's the air quotes day that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>really have the kind of wherewithal to </v>

1965
01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.760
<v Speaker 2>control the whole world mind control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite mind control psyops.</v>

1966
01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:20.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that,</v>

1967
01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:20.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1968
01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 2>operatives went into the World Trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>Center buildings,</v>

1969
01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.073
<v Speaker 2>both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two of the most tightly controlled and </v>

1970
01:28:26.811 --> 01:28:27.644
<v Speaker 2>secure buildings in the world and under </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pretense of working on the </v>

1971
01:28:30.891 --> 01:28:33.950
<v Speaker 2>elevators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to get into a breakthrough,</v>

1972
01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:38.150
<v Speaker 2>the drywall to get into the main beams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wrap them up in explosive devices.</v>

1973
01:28:38.151 --> 01:28:41.110
<v Speaker 2>This thermite stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this would,</v>

1974
01:28:41.170 --> 01:28:43.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know how long it takes to demolish a,</v>

1975
01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:45.920
<v Speaker 2>like a stadium or a big building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that they work,</v>

1976
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:49.550
<v Speaker 2>they're there for weeks or months </v>
<v Speaker 2>preparing all the explosive devices.</v>

1977
01:28:49.551 --> 01:28:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Somehow they did this in the World Trade</v>
<v Speaker 2>Center building without anyone noticing.</v>

1978
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention all the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked on this,</v>

1979
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:56.683
<v Speaker 2>they never told their spouses are </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends or buddies or what they were </v>

1980
01:28:59.811 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 2>doing or they didn't mention it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

1981
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.843
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to go on CNN or 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes ago I saw something and here's </v>

1982
01:29:06.301 --> 01:29:07.590
<v Speaker 1>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

1983
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:08.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you have a gigantic catastrophe </v>

1984
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:13.350
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a gigantic,</v>

1985
01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:16.710
<v Speaker 1>horrific event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many emotions.</v>

1986
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:17.753
<v Speaker 1>There's so much chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much going on that you're </v>

1987
01:29:20.251 --> 01:29:21.084
<v Speaker 1>going to get a bunch of really wacky eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>witness accounts because people just </v>

1988
01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:24.324
<v Speaker 1>aren't good at remembering things when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're under extreme duress and </v>

1989
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:31.560
<v Speaker 1>mrs fact they hear things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they remember explosions,</v>

1990
01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:32.543
<v Speaker 1>they see things that aren't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>what was really in front of them and </v>

1991
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.193
<v Speaker 1>that's just the human memory is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most flawed ways of gathering </v>

1992
01:29:41.881 --> 01:29:42.930
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1993
01:29:43.290 --> 01:29:45.510
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have terrible memories,</v>

1994
01:29:46.130 --> 01:29:46.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everything.</v>

1995
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:47.993
<v Speaker 1>Once something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you back up and look for all the </v>

1996
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:50.923
<v Speaker 1>sort of pregnant moments leading up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that otherwise would have been a </v>

1997
01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:55.120
<v Speaker 1>noticeable like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1998
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:57.030
<v Speaker 1>at the JFK assassination.</v>

1999
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:58.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a famous story about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>umbrella man.</v>

2000
01:29:59.060 --> 01:29:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2001
01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 1>So there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a clear sunny day.</v>

2002
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Why does he have an umbrella?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for decades there you go online,</v>

2003
01:30:05.611 --> 01:30:06.444
<v Speaker 1>you can see these examples of how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>umbrella could have been turned into a </v>

2004
01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:12.050
<v Speaker 1>rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he shot like that and,</v>

2005
01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.401
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2006
01:30:13.401 --> 01:30:15.990
<v Speaker 1>somebody finally tracked this guy down </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades later and he said,</v>

2007
01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I was out there protesting Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The umbrella was a protest.</v>

2008
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:21.223
<v Speaker 1>And that stems back to Neville </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chamberlain coming back after meeting </v>

2009
01:30:24.121 --> 01:30:27.690
<v Speaker 1>with Hitler before Hitler annexed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the sedate and land.</v>

2010
01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:29.740
<v Speaker 1>And he came back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2011
01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:30.653
<v Speaker 1>holding his umbrella here I had here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler sign this paper and promised he </v>

2012
01:30:33.241 --> 01:30:34.074
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do anything more bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the umbrella became a symbol of </v>

2013
01:30:38.710 --> 01:30:39.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2014
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:43.210
<v Speaker 1>sort of caving into evil people or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2015
01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the word for it?</v>

2016
01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:45.671
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2017
01:30:45.671 --> 01:30:46.504
<v Speaker 1>appeasement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How convoluted do you think people are </v>

2018
01:30:48.121 --> 01:30:49.590
<v Speaker 1>going to get that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I dunno,</v>

2019
01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:50.483
<v Speaker 1>he's out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what he said I had my </v>

2020
01:30:51.511 --> 01:30:53.850
<v Speaker 1>umbrella to because I didn't like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy was dealing with,</v>

2021
01:30:53.851 --> 01:30:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Castro and the Cubans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2022
01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:57.384
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the umbrella meant nothing in terms of </v>

2023
01:31:00.181 --> 01:31:01.330
<v Speaker 1>the assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2024
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:03.840
<v Speaker 1>And this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like nine slash 11.</v>

2025
01:31:03.841 --> 01:31:04.674
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this little puff of smoke or </v>

2026
01:31:06.031 --> 01:31:08.100
<v Speaker 1>somebody found this passport over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little thing.</v>

2027
01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:10.080
<v Speaker 1>All those little things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2028
01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:11.550
<v Speaker 1>It's just randomness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2029
01:31:11.551 --> 01:31:15.720
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is the people that want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think that the windows blowing out or</v>

2030
01:31:15.721 --> 01:31:16.554
<v Speaker 1>indicative of some sort of a controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>demolition or the building's caving in </v>

2031
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.883
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the floor pancaking it pushes the air </v>

2032
01:31:23.161 --> 01:31:24.070
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2033
01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:25.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2034
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.213
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a controlled </v>

2035
01:31:26.971 --> 01:31:30.600
<v Speaker 1>demolition that went from the top down </v>
<v Speaker 1>either like the way they did it.</v>

2036
01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.590
<v Speaker 1>They all go from the bottom up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2037
01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:34.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one that looks crazy as a </v>

2038
01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.970
<v Speaker 1>building seven tower seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one looks crazy.</v>

2039
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:39.833
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it burned for like eight hours or </v>

2040
01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:45.270
<v Speaker 1>something and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one's just slightly fuzzier,</v>

2041
01:31:45.271 --> 01:31:50.040
<v Speaker 1>but explosive experts tell me that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully explicable by burning all day.</v>

2042
01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Well also when you see the images of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsing,</v>

2043
01:31:53.131 --> 01:31:53.964
<v Speaker 1>what you don't see is the interior </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure had collapsed previously and </v>

2044
01:31:57.901 --> 01:31:58.734
<v Speaker 1>there's video of that when you watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>the interior cave in and that as this </v>

2045
01:32:02.291 --> 01:32:05.260
<v Speaker 1>fire was burning because apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was obviously,</v>

2046
01:32:05.261 --> 01:32:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what really what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was diesel tanks apparently in</v>

2047
01:32:08.471 --> 01:32:10.960
<v Speaker 1>the basement and the diesel fuel at </v>
<v Speaker 1>burn,</v>

2048
01:32:10.961 --> 01:32:13.840
<v Speaker 1>incredibly hot in the whole inside of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2049
01:32:13.841 --> 01:32:14.674
<v Speaker 1>The structure had been completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakened and then as it collapsed it </v>

2050
01:32:17.861 --> 01:32:22.450
<v Speaker 1>just all gave out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just happened to be a shit design.</v>

2051
01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:26.080
<v Speaker 1>If I was the guy who owned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

2052
01:32:26.081 --> 01:32:26.914
<v Speaker 1>I would sue everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he got his money back I guess </v>

2053
01:32:29.441 --> 01:32:32.830
<v Speaker 1>because there's some insurance money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that what a terrible design.</v>

2054
01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.233
<v Speaker 1>There was some issue with the legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance payout to the owner of the </v>

2055
01:32:39.130 --> 01:32:39.963
<v Speaker 1>World Trade Center buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether this was like one event or two </v>

2056
01:32:42.521 --> 01:32:47.521
<v Speaker 1>events are one building or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the difference was between like</v>

2057
01:32:47.801 --> 01:32:50.170
<v Speaker 1>8 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$16,000,000,000 payout or something like</v>

2058
01:32:50.171 --> 01:32:51.004
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they get people to get into that </v>

2059
01:32:53.441 --> 01:32:55.000
<v Speaker 1>new building?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2060
01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:56.110
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

2061
01:32:56.170 --> 01:32:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not renting an office in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

2062
01:32:57.971 --> 01:32:59.800
<v Speaker 1>this building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They blew it up in [inaudible] 93.</v>

2063
01:32:59.801 --> 01:33:03.250
<v Speaker 1>They blew it up again in 2001 get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>here with this shit.</v>

2064
01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking chances of this new ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

2065
01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:06.664
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The freedom tower or something like </v>

2066
01:33:07.361 --> 01:33:09.610
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a big old bullseye.</v>

2067
01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2068
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been in it yet.</v>

2069
01:33:11.501 --> 01:33:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I've been around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even that big.</v>

2070
01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2071
01:33:15.010 --> 01:33:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's taller than the.</v>

2072
01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:20.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as big as the original towers.</v>

2073
01:33:20.831 --> 01:33:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is as tall it isn't.</v>

2074
01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2075
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was shorter.</v>

2076
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:26.620
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not as big as the one in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dubai.</v>

2077
01:33:26.621 --> 01:33:28.450
<v Speaker 1>The Dubai ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a half a mile,</v>

2078
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:30.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't something crazy like that.</v>

2079
01:33:30.490 --> 01:33:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how tall is the tallest </v>
<v Speaker 1>building?</v>

2080
01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:34.800
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went to their,</v>

2081
01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.370
<v Speaker 1>the one world trade center leasing page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says at 1,776 feet.</v>

2082
01:33:39.371 --> 01:33:40.204
<v Speaker 1>One World Trade Center is the tallest l,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e e d gold certified building in the </v>

2083
01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Western Hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good enough.</v>

2084
01:33:46.211 --> 01:33:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Whatever America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to believe,</v>

2085
01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:50.290
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to go straight to the moon.</v>

2086
01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.440
<v Speaker 1>In the solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2087
01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:53.920
<v Speaker 1>We need to take an elevator right to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking moon.</v>

2088
01:33:55.690 --> 01:33:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outside of space.</v>

2089
01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.250
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can they build a building that's so high</v>

2090
01:34:00.251 --> 01:34:02.820
<v Speaker 1>that it goes into space one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2091
01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so because structurally it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't hold,</v>

2092
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:07.450
<v Speaker 1>went up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can shape of a pyramid.</v>

2093
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like why are trees 100 feet tall?</v>

2094
01:34:11.051 --> 01:34:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Because the material would just </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse.</v>

2095
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he could have it strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd have to be so fat.</v>

2096
01:34:15.970 --> 01:34:16.541
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2097
01:34:16.541 --> 01:34:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Japan was going to build that space </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator.</v>

2098
01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:19.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

2099
01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:19.954
<v Speaker 1>You Got Jack with the popups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan takes tiny first step towards </v>

2100
01:34:23.191 --> 01:34:24.024
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elevator.</v>

2101
01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fuck off.</v>

2102
01:34:25.421 --> 01:34:26.254
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would take a few years before I'm </v>

2103
01:34:28.961 --> 01:34:31.720
<v Speaker 1>willing to climate or that soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2104
01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:33.273
<v Speaker 1>so the other problem with conspiracies </v>
<v Speaker 1>just get back there for a moment is the </v>

2105
01:34:35.381 --> 01:34:37.300
<v Speaker 1>problem of anomalies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with anomalies?</v>

2106
01:34:37.301 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 1>This is true in all science.</v>

2107
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:43.330
<v Speaker 1>No theory explains every single thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's out there that we want to study.</v>

2108
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:44.583
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be some quirky </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that the main theory here that </v>

2109
01:34:47.501 --> 01:34:49.930
<v Speaker 1>explains all these things here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't account for that.</v>

2110
01:34:50.490 --> 01:34:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did we do with that?</v>

2111
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:52.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my joke is you assign it to a Grad </v>

2112
01:34:53.591 --> 01:34:55.420
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They let them figure it out.</v>

2113
01:34:56.050 --> 01:35:00.770
<v Speaker 1>But what outsiders mistake is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well my theory explains this,</v>

2114
01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:01.604
<v Speaker 1>a little anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so therefore it should replace this </v>

2115
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:06.860
<v Speaker 1>theory and so people like Neil and Sean </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carroll,</v>

2116
01:35:06.861 --> 01:35:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence Krauss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michio Kaku has to web pages.</v>

2117
01:35:10.341 --> 01:35:11.174
<v Speaker 1>One is a link on his webpage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have an alternative theory of </v>

2118
01:35:14.241 --> 01:35:15.470
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to this page.</v>

2119
01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.633
<v Speaker 1>So they go there and it has your theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to explain all of these things over </v>

2120
01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:24.881
<v Speaker 1>here that are theory currently explains </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your whatever your said anomaly is.</v>

2121
01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:26.920
<v Speaker 1>And of course they can't.</v>

2122
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:27.763
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that scientists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogmatically closed minded to the </v>

2123
01:35:31.221 --> 01:35:32.054
<v Speaker 1>anomalies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that we can't explain everything </v>

2124
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:36.470
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have to do anything with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2125
01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:37.333
<v Speaker 1>Just just leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe eventually they'll pile up and </v>

2126
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:44.090
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a new theory like with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein's relativity.</v>

2127
01:35:44.091 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was enough anomalies here like the</v>

2128
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.313
<v Speaker 1>orbit of mercury and a few other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we have to modify Newtonian </v>

2129
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:53.510
<v Speaker 1>physics a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2130
01:35:53.511 --> 01:35:55.880
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part.</v>

2131
01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:58.340
<v Speaker 1>And so conspiracies are filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

2132
01:35:58.341 --> 01:36:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Like the moment something big happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go back and okay,</v>

2133
01:36:01.821 --> 01:36:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but there was this weird thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How he explained that,</v>

2134
01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to explain everything.</v>

2135
01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:08.653
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that there's a growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement that think that the space is </v>

2136
01:36:11.811 --> 01:36:14.250
<v Speaker 1>fake spaces fake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2137
01:36:14.251 --> 01:36:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Is this different than the flat earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule?</v>

2138
01:36:16.230 --> 01:36:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag [inaudible] basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fake Hashtag spaces.</v>

2139
01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Fave is people that are so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

2140
01:36:21.681 --> 01:36:24.560
<v Speaker 1>The flat earthers kicked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2141
01:36:24.710 --> 01:36:27.030
<v Speaker 1>For real flat earthers kicked out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

2142
01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Fake people spaces fake is like God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the most skeptical.</v>

2143
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:33.710
<v Speaker 1>So what would be the upper atmosphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the edge.</v>

2144
01:36:33.711 --> 01:36:35.180
<v Speaker 1>It's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fake.</v>

2145
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.030
<v Speaker 1>It's the end and it's tied in some weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to religion,</v>

2146
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:41.000
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting because even</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flat earth people,</v>

2147
01:36:41.001 --> 01:36:41.834
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous amount of them that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are extremely religious and they talk </v>

2148
01:36:44.511 --> 01:36:47.270
<v Speaker 1>about the firmament and the Bible book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible,</v>

2149
01:36:47.271 --> 01:36:48.104
<v Speaker 1>and that this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what's really going on is that </v>

2150
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:54.290
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to keep us from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that God has created.</v>

2151
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:59.291
<v Speaker 1>This place is a very special place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so by pretending that it's round,</v>

2152
01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.470
<v Speaker 1>they somehow or another are controlling </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2153
01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:05.960
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptional and we're not lucky.</v>

2154
01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.113
<v Speaker 1>Space is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're using a video from Ryan </v>

2155
01:37:09.930 --> 01:37:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Gosling's movie he just made about Neil </v>
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong.</v>

2156
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:13.900
<v Speaker 1>First Man on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just be like this.</v>

2157
01:37:13.930 --> 01:37:14.411
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

2158
01:37:14.411 --> 01:37:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Here's proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fake everything.</v>

2159
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:19.960
<v Speaker 1>They are making a movie because </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally the way they made the movie is</v>

2160
01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:22.660
<v Speaker 1>that's evidence that it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That because he's wearing it.</v>

2161
01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:23.733
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if maybe this person </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't recognize that as being Ryan </v>

2162
01:37:25.751 --> 01:37:28.740
<v Speaker 1>gosling right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott got NASA suit on.</v>

2163
01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just a troll account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how NASA fix everything.</v>

2164
01:37:32.681 --> 01:37:35.410
<v Speaker 1>This is the video I was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

2165
01:37:35.770 --> 01:37:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Now you know it's all a big act tab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click on spaces fake though.</v>

2166
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.133
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the whole click on it because </v>

2167
01:37:43.721 --> 01:37:45.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of other mom on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thread.</v>

2168
01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:49.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a tremendous amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that literally believe that space is not</v>

2169
01:37:49.991 --> 01:37:50.824
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google a video of a buzz Aldrin and how </v>

2170
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>deals with the</v>

2171
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:57.930
<v Speaker 3>no Mooney's that we never went to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moon.</v>

2172
01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 3>There's a video buzz Aldrin punching a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2173
01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:03.030
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had dinner with that guy.</v>

2174
01:38:03.150 --> 01:38:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Did the guy who punched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2175
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I was a firm believer that we never went</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the moon.</v>

2176
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:09.630
<v Speaker 3>This is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched that.</v>

2177
01:38:09.631 --> 01:38:13.530
<v Speaker 3>A Fox documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon conspiracy theory did we go and</v>

2178
01:38:13.531 --> 01:38:14.610
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2179
01:38:14.850 --> 01:38:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Because it was on television and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was</v>

2180
01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:21.270
<v Speaker 3>96,</v>
<v Speaker 3>97.</v>

2181
01:38:21.271 --> 01:38:23.070
<v Speaker 3>I remember I went to work and I told </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

2182
01:38:23.071 --> 01:38:24.690
<v Speaker 3>you got to see this documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It crazy.</v>

2183
01:38:24.691 --> 01:38:26.580
<v Speaker 3>We never went to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2184
01:38:26.581 --> 01:38:30.380
<v Speaker 3>I have watched that one and I watched </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guys.</v>

2185
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.630
<v Speaker 3>What is his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artsy fartsy liberal.</v>

2186
01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:34.973
<v Speaker 3>So I had dinner with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He absolutely believes that we never </v>

2187
01:38:36.781 --> 01:38:38.730
<v Speaker 3>went to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not 100 percent believes it.</v>

2188
01:38:38.731 --> 01:38:39.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he still believes it.</v>

2189
01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.030
<v Speaker 3>I think he's like a cab driver or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2190
01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:42.864
<v Speaker 3>Now he got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was involved in the news or local </v>

2191
01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.273
<v Speaker 3>television or something like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>backwards from then he released a </v>

2192
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.980
<v Speaker 3>documentary called the funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a funny thing happened on the way to the</v>

2193
01:38:52.981 --> 01:38:55.110
<v Speaker 3>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in his documentary,</v>

2194
01:38:55.111 --> 01:38:55.944
<v Speaker 3>one of the things he did have his really</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting footage of the lunar module </v>

2195
01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:05.780
<v Speaker 3>where it looks like they're faking a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot of them being really far out,</v>

2196
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:09.720
<v Speaker 3>but then when they remove this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cover,</v>

2197
01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:12.000
<v Speaker 3>the covers from all the windows that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were inside the,</v>

2198
01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.310
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lunar,</v>

2199
01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.950
<v Speaker 3>not the lunar module.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the one that the orbiter,</v>

2200
01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:18.683
<v Speaker 3>it really looks like they're in low </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth orbit and this is like the main </v>

2201
01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:22.883
<v Speaker 3>thing pointing to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they couldn't get out of low earth </v>

2202
01:39:25.210 --> 01:39:26.043
<v Speaker 3>orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there was also the fact that they </v>

2203
01:39:28.501 --> 01:39:29.334
<v Speaker 3>lost all of the telemetry data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the binary ones and zeroes </v>

2204
01:39:34.801 --> 01:39:37.500
<v Speaker 3>that show the position of the lunar </v>
<v Speaker 3>module at every stage.</v>

2205
01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:40.620
<v Speaker 3>There was a bunch of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that no one wanted,</v>

2206
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:43.920
<v Speaker 3>especially Neil Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he became a recluse.</v>

2207
01:39:43.921 --> 01:39:47.820
<v Speaker 3>Never wanted to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go and watch the press conference,</v>

2208
01:39:47.821 --> 01:39:49.650
<v Speaker 3>the press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look very shady,</v>

2209
01:39:49.651 --> 01:39:51.990
<v Speaker 3>look like they're completely not like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2210
01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.510
<v Speaker 3>He talks to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a drunk for a long time though.</v>

2211
01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.493
<v Speaker 3>He was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very depressed and had when he </v>

2212
01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:59.310
<v Speaker 3>became an alcoholic after the moon </v>
<v Speaker 3>landing.</v>

2213
01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:03.360
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is that in conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>circles from talking as them,</v>

2214
01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.510
<v Speaker 3>the idea is that he got over it after </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile and needed to make a living.</v>

2215
01:40:06.511 --> 01:40:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Now talks about it constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Neil Armstrong never did.</v>

2216
01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:13.440
<v Speaker 3>The thing that's compelling is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

2217
01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:17.010
<v Speaker 3>there were some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some faking going on.</v>

2218
01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:21.210
<v Speaker 3>If you look at Gemini was in Gemini </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen,</v>

2219
01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Michael Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an image of Michael Collins when</v>

2220
01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:26.800
<v Speaker 3>they were testing some of the space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2221
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.250
<v Speaker 3>walking stuff and some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2222
01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.170
<v Speaker 3>some of the things that they would do </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2223
01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:33.780
<v Speaker 3>to walk outside of a spaceship.</v>

2224
01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2225
01:40:34.930 --> 01:40:35.763
<v Speaker 3>they had them all strapped up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>cables and they're just experimented </v>

2226
01:40:38.131 --> 01:40:38.964
<v Speaker 3>with these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took that photograph and then </v>

2227
01:40:41.371 --> 01:40:45.240
<v Speaker 3>blacked out the background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably some overzealous pr agent.</v>

2228
01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.330
<v Speaker 3>And they were like in the pool right </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2229
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:49.890
<v Speaker 3>So what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>

2230
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:52.740
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first one is clearly he's,</v>

2231
01:40:52.741 --> 01:40:53.574
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a studio and they're working on </v>

2232
01:40:54.791 --> 01:40:58.090
<v Speaker 3>things and just trying to understand how</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff works.</v>

2233
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:59.103
<v Speaker 3>And the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took the exact same photo and just </v>

2234
01:41:00.341 --> 01:41:04.100
<v Speaker 3>reversed it and blacked out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background and they put.</v>

2235
01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:06.700
<v Speaker 3>This just doesn't mean that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the moon.</v>

2236
01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:07.713
<v Speaker 3>That just means that someone got ahold </v>
<v Speaker 3>of some photographs and faked it and </v>

2237
01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:16.980
<v Speaker 3>it's way more likely that there was more</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that going on then that people didn't</v>

2238
01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:18.760
<v Speaker 3>actually go to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2239
01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:21.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2240
01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:22.173
<v Speaker 3>The thing about going to the moon that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting is if they can go </v>

2241
01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:30.450
<v Speaker 3>again and they do go again and they find</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff there,</v>

2242
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:32.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then everybody has to just go,</v>

2243
01:41:32.441 --> 01:41:34.090
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we were all this stuff is.</v>

2244
01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:34.993
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's instruments on there that we </v>

2245
01:41:36.761 --> 01:41:39.730
<v Speaker 3>still monitor that the Apollo astronauts</v>
<v Speaker 3>left there.</v>

2246
01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Well then we monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we monitor,</v>

2247
01:41:41.591 --> 01:41:43.480
<v Speaker 3>we shoot a laser up there and bounces </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

2248
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:44.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2249
01:41:44.201 --> 01:41:46.360
<v Speaker 3>a laser will also bounce off the surface</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the moon.</v>

2250
01:41:46.730 --> 01:41:47.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think like they're not as </v>

2251
01:41:48.341 --> 01:41:49.150
<v Speaker 3>precise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2252
01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:49.900
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2253
01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:52.210
<v Speaker 3>But the Russians did that too with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lunker hood.</v>

2254
01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.073
<v Speaker 3>One and two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe they left a solar roof or </v>

2255
01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:56.633
<v Speaker 3>laser reflectors up there as well with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the unmanned Mr Japan has a video </v>

2256
01:41:59.891 --> 01:42:01.930
<v Speaker 3>footage as far as of like last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2257
01:42:01.931 --> 01:42:04.140
<v Speaker 3>First out of the dark side of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's all fake too.</v>

2258
01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.900
<v Speaker 3>They will spaces fake dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no space.</v>

2259
01:42:07.901 --> 01:42:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moon's not even.</v>

2260
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:10.420
<v Speaker 3>What is the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If space is fake,</v>

2261
01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:13.380
<v Speaker 3>how did they explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The images.</v>

2262
01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.253
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is the images of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark side of the moon look exactly like </v>

2263
01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:17.763
<v Speaker 3>even like the landing and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>setup looks very similar to the Apollo </v>

2264
01:42:21.671 --> 01:42:22.504
<v Speaker 3>missions.</v>

2265
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:23.433
<v Speaker 3>So they would have to either be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>cahoots or have worked together with </v>

2266
01:42:26.891 --> 01:42:28.030
<v Speaker 3>NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sound Studio?</v>

2267
01:42:28.031 --> 01:42:30.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To figure that he the old stuff.</v>

2268
01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:31.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it.</v>

2269
01:42:31.121 --> 01:42:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the footage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2270
01:42:32.711 --> 01:42:33.544
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks eerily similar to what you </v>

2271
01:42:36.611 --> 01:42:39.940
<v Speaker 3>saw when the Apollo astronauts were </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2272
01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:43.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it is entirely possible that </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the,</v>

2273
01:42:43.710 --> 01:42:44.543
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the practice film footage of </v>

2274
01:42:47.441 --> 01:42:48.340
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2275
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:49.263
<v Speaker 3>on the surface or doing things turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>out to be pushed out as actual footage </v>

2276
01:42:55.210 --> 01:42:56.043
<v Speaker 3>of moon landings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was no television back </v>

2277
01:43:00.251 --> 01:43:01.270
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no internet,</v>

2278
01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.313
<v Speaker 3>there was no vcrs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no ability to review things </v>

2279
01:43:05.111 --> 01:43:05.944
<v Speaker 3>and watched them over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They projected something on television </v>

2280
01:43:08.321 --> 01:43:09.154
<v Speaker 3>one time and that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they released pressed releases </v>

2281
01:43:13.601 --> 01:43:14.434
<v Speaker 3>and videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's entirely possible that some of </v>

2282
01:43:15.821 --> 01:43:19.000
<v Speaker 3>those videos that got through were </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually just tests.</v>

2283
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:20.223
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the Michael Collins photos </v>

2284
01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:23.763
<v Speaker 3>that there was some fuckery going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with so many human </v>

2285
01:43:25.811 --> 01:43:27.010
<v Speaker 3>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with.</v>

2286
01:43:27.011 --> 01:43:27.844
<v Speaker 3>So many people see an estimated 530 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million people watch Armstrong's </v>

2287
01:43:31.961 --> 01:43:33.970
<v Speaker 3>televised image and heard his voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>describe.</v>

2288
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:35.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that.</v>

2289
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:37.630
<v Speaker 3>It was broadcasted live like six hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>that day.</v>

2290
01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:38.470
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2291
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:42.310
<v Speaker 3>It was actually broadcasted live on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>projection screen.</v>

2292
01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:45.370
<v Speaker 3>What they did was they didn't get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight feed.</v>

2293
01:43:45.610 --> 01:43:49.720
<v Speaker 3>They were filming the footage that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a projection screen.</v>

2294
01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 3>That's how they did it and there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonky</v>

2295
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.813
<v Speaker 1>shit that looks like they fall down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they get pulled back up by wires </v>

2296
01:43:55.881 --> 01:43:58.100
<v Speaker 1>when they're on the surface of the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

2297
01:43:58.130 --> 01:44:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I think how much of that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>

2298
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.053
<v Speaker 1>how much of that is actual footage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them being on the moon and how much of </v>

2299
01:44:04.431 --> 01:44:06.290
<v Speaker 1>that is just test footage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2300
01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2301
01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about that,</v>

2302
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.210
<v Speaker 1>but I think also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2303
01:44:12.211 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Jack Shit about space </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel.</v>

2304
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>astrophysics.</v>

2305
01:44:16.641 --> 01:44:17.474
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about like what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes to land on the moon and come back </v>

2306
01:44:21.291 --> 01:44:22.124
<v Speaker 1>and whether or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the people that talk about </v>

2307
01:44:24.231 --> 01:44:27.600
<v Speaker 1>this don't know that mythbusters did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice episode on did you know,</v>

2308
01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:28.453
<v Speaker 1>did we fake going to the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they showed a bunch of little </v>

2309
01:44:30.051 --> 01:44:31.220
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

2310
01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:32.593
<v Speaker 1>on the moon with its gravity when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes something like that into the </v>

2311
01:44:35.661 --> 01:44:36.740
<v Speaker 1>dust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2312
01:44:36.741 --> 01:44:37.574
<v Speaker 1>the particles come up and they arch back</v>
<v Speaker 1>down in a certain way that it would be </v>

2313
01:44:39.861 --> 01:44:42.560
<v Speaker 1>different than if you are on earth so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gravity is different.</v>

2314
01:44:42.650 --> 01:44:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Causes the dust to settle a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2315
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:48.320
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of things like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that proves we were there.</v>

2316
01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly proved that what took place</v>

2317
01:44:51.381 --> 01:44:53.500
<v Speaker 1>took place in a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

2318
01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:56.810
<v Speaker 1>not yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a gravitational pull the same as the</v>

2319
01:44:56.811 --> 01:44:58.190
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only,</v>

2320
01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:59.033
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably seen the feather in the </v>

2321
01:44:59.721 --> 01:45:01.430
<v Speaker 1>hammered drunk yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2322
01:45:01.431 --> 01:45:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you can do that here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2323
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.510
<v Speaker 1>a yes in a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2324
01:45:05.511 --> 01:45:06.340
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2325
01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:06.890
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2326
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:10.160
<v Speaker 1>but even a feather in a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's,</v>

2327
01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:12.200
<v Speaker 1>it depends upon what kind of feather it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2328
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:13.603
<v Speaker 1>but a feather and a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you just held them here and </v>

2329
01:45:16.131 --> 01:45:16.964
<v Speaker 1>dropped him on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably would landed a very </v>

2330
01:45:18.321 --> 01:45:19.990
<v Speaker 1>similar pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Favorite.</v>

2331
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:22.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a spoof video about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never went to the moon,</v>

2332
01:45:22.911 --> 01:45:23.744
<v Speaker 1>but couple of British comedians that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Kubrick thing is that with the </v>

2333
01:45:27.171 --> 01:45:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no appeal.</v>

2334
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's their name?</v>

2335
01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I forget key and Peele key and Peele.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2336
01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:32.990
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2337
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:34.490
<v Speaker 1>the three of them are talking and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2338
01:45:34.491 --> 01:45:35.910
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to fake this whole thing.</v>

2339
01:45:35.911 --> 01:45:36.930
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2340
01:45:36.931 --> 01:45:38.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the troubleshooters,</v>

2341
01:45:38.391 --> 01:45:39.350
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2342
01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2343
01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:43.130
<v Speaker 1>people are going to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how did we go to the moon?</v>

2344
01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:44.750
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2345
01:45:44.751 --> 01:45:46.550
<v Speaker 1>build a big rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can say,</v>

2346
01:45:46.551 --> 01:45:48.500
<v Speaker 1>well we went into that big rocket and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2347
01:45:48.501 --> 01:45:50.330
<v Speaker 1>well how much would it cost to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>that big rocket?</v>

2348
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be really expensive.</v>

2349
01:45:51.771 --> 01:45:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean we might as well just go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moon and then they started talking about</v>

2350
01:45:54.711 --> 01:45:55.544
<v Speaker 1>the expenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we only have to feed three of them </v>

2351
01:45:56.601 --> 01:45:57.434
<v Speaker 1>if we go to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we shoot it as a shoot here in </v>

2352
01:45:59.301 --> 01:46:00.134
<v Speaker 1>the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna have to have catering for </v>

2353
01:46:01.131 --> 01:46:02.660
<v Speaker 1>everybody to be super expensive.</v>

2354
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:04.400
<v Speaker 1>It kind of goes on like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very funny.</v>

2355
01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:07.190
<v Speaker 1>That is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the conspiracy theorists would say,</v>

2356
01:46:07.191 --> 01:46:10.780
<v Speaker 1>well they couldn't send someone to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moon so they had to fake it.</v>

2357
01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:12.340
<v Speaker 1>That's why they haven't been back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2358
01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.490
<v Speaker 1>They went from 1969 to 1973.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>

2359
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Six successful missions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven attempts.</v>

2360
01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Apollo 13 being the one that didn't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2361
01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:24.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun theory.</v>

2362
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:29.920
<v Speaker 1>And what happened with me is I got way </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at spotting bullshit and learning</v>

2363
01:46:30.591 --> 01:46:34.490
<v Speaker 1>critical thinking skills and then paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to all sides.</v>

2364
01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.700
<v Speaker 1>And I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2365
01:46:35.701 --> 01:46:36.534
<v Speaker 1>the real issue with something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is if someone could prove definitively </v>

2366
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:43.423
<v Speaker 1>beyond a shadow of a doubt that not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it impossible that no one ever went </v>

2367
01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:49.320
<v Speaker 1>to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely prove it.</v>

2368
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:50.940
<v Speaker 1>That would be giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2369
01:46:51.150 --> 01:46:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean really would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2370
01:46:53.011 --> 01:46:55.080
<v Speaker 1>it would be a huge story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Ken,</v>

2371
01:46:55.110 --> 01:46:56.730
<v Speaker 1>is it even possible to do that?</v>

2372
01:46:56.970 --> 01:46:57.803
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other analogy I use with the Wiki </v>

2373
01:47:00.471 --> 01:47:03.390
<v Speaker 1>leaks is there of all those tens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand,</v>

2374
01:47:03.391 --> 01:47:04.224
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of memos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers and letters and government </v>

2375
01:47:06.301 --> 01:47:08.700
<v Speaker 1>documents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not one mention anywhere of nine</v>

2376
01:47:08.701 --> 01:47:10.260
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 was an inside job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2377
01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:11.453
<v Speaker 1>and we had to allocate these funds to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this construction company who was </v>

2378
01:47:14.431 --> 01:47:17.090
<v Speaker 1>then seen working at the World Trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>Center.</v>

2379
01:47:17.091 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 1>But nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that in this case,</v>

2380
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:23.490
<v Speaker 1>the absence of evidence is evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence didn't happen.</v>

2381
01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:24.773
<v Speaker 1>Not an inside job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the sign 11 one and something like </v>

2382
01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:29.730
<v Speaker 1>that would be true for the moon landing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2383
01:47:29.731 --> 01:47:30.564
<v Speaker 1>all those people that worked on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one of them saw anything and wanted </v>

2384
01:47:33.511 --> 01:47:34.344
<v Speaker 1>to write a book on 60 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea would be that there was </v>

2385
01:47:37.141 --> 01:47:37.974
<v Speaker 1>compartmentalized and that everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you're working on theo </v>

2386
01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:42.450
<v Speaker 1>rings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have access to the people that</v>

2387
01:47:42.451 --> 01:47:43.620
<v Speaker 1>are working on the thrusters.</v>

2388
01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:45.900
<v Speaker 1>If you have access to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have access to that.</v>

2389
01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:47.093
<v Speaker 1>And that there was only a very small </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people that controlled </v>

2390
01:47:49.741 --> 01:47:51.480
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also 19,</v>

2391
01:47:51.481 --> 01:47:55.140
<v Speaker 1>69 was a very different environment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like what you get away with and</v>

2392
01:47:55.141 --> 01:47:57.270
<v Speaker 1>not get away with what you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2393
01:47:57.570 --> 01:47:58.403
<v Speaker 1>it was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really fun to believe that they </v>

2394
01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:03.150
<v Speaker 1>fake going into the bone and I spent an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inordinate amount of time,</v>

2395
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:04.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it,</v>

2396
01:48:04.651 --> 01:48:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but I completely dropped it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dropped it after.</v>

2397
01:48:07.081 --> 01:48:07.914
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid attention to what I actually </v>

2398
01:48:10.381 --> 01:48:11.700
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2399
01:48:11.701 --> 01:48:15.980
<v Speaker 1>but now you can kind of empathize with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who do believe theories because.</v>

2400
01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want to hear a dumber one?</v>

2401
01:48:18.210 --> 01:48:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a dumber one.</v>

2402
01:48:19.650 --> 01:48:21.510
<v Speaker 1>For the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like months,</v>

2403
01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I believed in a thing called rods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the tiny little insects?</v>

2404
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they would it this guy put out this</v>

2405
01:48:30.331 --> 01:48:31.164
<v Speaker 1>duck is documentary that there was these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things flying so fast we couldn't see </v>

2406
01:48:35.311 --> 01:48:38.930
<v Speaker 1>them with the naked eye and that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like jellyfish,</v>

2407
01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:43.940
<v Speaker 1>like creatures that lived amongst us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had all this video footage of the.</v>

2408
01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Especially these people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping.</v>

2409
01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:47.313
<v Speaker 1>There were sky diving into this enormous</v>
<v Speaker 1>cave in Mexico and has there been sky </v>

2410
01:48:51.771 --> 01:48:52.604
<v Speaker 1>diving into this cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see those things flying back and </v>

2411
01:48:54.151 --> 01:48:56.610
<v Speaker 1>forth and I was hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>line and sinker.</v>

2412
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2413
01:48:57.931 --> 01:48:58.764
<v Speaker 1>these things are around us all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going outside and looking up </v>

2414
01:49:00.961 --> 01:49:01.794
<v Speaker 1>trying to spot them like imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these beings that are flying so fast so </v>

2415
01:49:05.301 --> 01:49:06.630
<v Speaker 1>we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't see them.</v>

2416
01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:07.733
<v Speaker 1>The only way you capture it was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera and then a show called monster </v>

2417
01:49:10.561 --> 01:49:12.350
<v Speaker 1>quest cracked the riddle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2418
01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.553
<v Speaker 1>They show that it's an a video artifact </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you have really high speed </v>

2419
01:49:16.501 --> 01:49:18.180
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just see the insect,</v>

2420
01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.410
<v Speaker 1>but if you have low speed standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition video cameras,</v>

2421
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:26.880
<v Speaker 1>it creates this artifact as these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass by very close to the lens at a high</v>

2422
01:49:26.881 --> 01:49:27.714
<v Speaker 1>rate of speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it elongates their video signal and it </v>

2423
01:49:30.271 --> 01:49:33.540
<v Speaker 1>makes them look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this jellyfish type thing,</v>

2424
01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just a video artifact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2425
01:49:36.521 --> 01:49:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good example of anomalies.</v>

2426
01:49:38.101 --> 01:49:40.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's this weird video anomaly.</v>

2427
01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:42.600
<v Speaker 1>What is it about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just say,</v>

2428
01:49:42.810 --> 01:49:43.591
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2429
01:49:43.591 --> 01:49:47.250
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know anything about video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way easier.</v>

2430
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2431
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.400
<v Speaker 3>that's the capture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2432
01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2433
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.370
<v Speaker 3>take a camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it outside.</v>

2434
01:49:51.371 --> 01:49:53.330
<v Speaker 3>You will capture these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing,</v>

2435
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:54.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2436
01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:55.733
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other aspect of conspiracy theories </v>

2437
01:49:58.051 --> 01:50:01.500
<v Speaker 2>is cognitive dissonance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is we want the size of the event to</v>

2438
01:50:01.501 --> 01:50:05.370
<v Speaker 2>be matched by a cause that's equally </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that size.</v>

2439
01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:08.580
<v Speaker 2>So the analogy I use is you know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust,</v>

2440
01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:12.360
<v Speaker 2>the worst genocide and human history </v>
<v Speaker 2>caused by the Nazis,</v>

2441
01:50:12.361 --> 01:50:15.090
<v Speaker 2>the worst bridge iem political regime </v>
<v Speaker 2>and human history.</v>

2442
01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:17.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a match there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you say something like,</v>

2443
01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:18.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2444
01:50:18.510 --> 01:50:19.343
<v Speaker 2>jfk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leader of the free world brought </v>

2445
01:50:20.851 --> 01:50:23.040
<v Speaker 2>down by who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Harvey Oswald.</v>

2446
01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Just some nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2447
01:50:24.211 --> 01:50:25.044
<v Speaker 2>there's this mismatch or nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>is huge thing by 19 guys with box </v>

2448
01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:29.340
<v Speaker 2>cutters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that.</v>

2449
01:50:29.341 --> 01:50:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't Harvey Oswald acted alone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:32.633
<v Speaker 2>What makes you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the evidence and not none of the </v>

2451
01:50:34.891 --> 01:50:38.730
<v Speaker 2>evidence against anybody else and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence against particularly him,</v>

2452
01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:43.810
<v Speaker 2>the general posner's book case closed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the attorney.</v>

2453
01:50:43.831 --> 01:50:45.150
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>

2454
01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:45.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2455
01:50:46.650 --> 01:50:47.483
<v Speaker 3>attorney</v>

2456
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:49.390
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name.</v>

2457
01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:54.330
<v Speaker 2>He has a massive book where he lines up </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single one of the arguments by the</v>

2458
01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:55.393
<v Speaker 2>JFK conspiracy for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because just make a big deal about how </v>

2459
01:50:58.730 --> 01:51:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Oswaldo got a job at the book depository</v>
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>

2460
01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:02.653
<v Speaker 2>which just happened to be where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parade just happened to be where the </v>

2461
01:51:05.211 --> 01:51:07.580
<v Speaker 2>parade route was going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get to have a clear shot.</v>

2462
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:08.833
<v Speaker 2>So it was positive that track down when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the White House determined even when </v>

2463
01:51:12.201 --> 01:51:13.034
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy was going to Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone what the parade route would </v>

2464
01:51:14.871 --> 01:51:17.180
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An oswell already had the job there.</v>

2465
01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:20.840
<v Speaker 2>That's just chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he knew it advanced bro.</v>

2466
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:23.480
<v Speaker 2>He knew that you needed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or do you think it's possible?</v>

2467
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Oswald was in cahoots?</v>

2468
01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:27.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2469
01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:28.920
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that?</v>

2470
01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:30.570
<v Speaker 3>What about the magic bullet theory?</v>

2471
01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been settled by the fact that the</v>

2472
01:51:33.911 --> 01:51:34.744
<v Speaker 2>way it showed in the videos is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two seats are like this and at the </v>

2473
01:51:37.781 --> 01:51:39.070
<v Speaker 2>bullet has to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

2474
01:51:39.071 --> 01:51:42.120
<v Speaker 2>In fact the seats were like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that connolly was.</v>

2475
01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.113
<v Speaker 3>You're explaining this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in audio form just when you're </v>

2476
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:45.911
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2477
01:51:45.911 --> 01:51:48.650
<v Speaker 3>so it's like stadium seating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One's elevated above the other.</v>

2478
01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:49.200
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2479
01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:50.033
<v Speaker 2>So the bullet actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it passes through the neck through </v>

2480
01:51:52.771 --> 01:51:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy's neck and then hits Connolly's </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder it,</v>

2481
01:51:56.130 --> 01:51:57.460
<v Speaker 2>it is already moving.</v>

2482
01:51:57.730 --> 01:51:59.700
<v Speaker 3>We get to his wrist at fraction is </v>
<v Speaker 3>roasted,</v>

2483
01:51:59.750 --> 01:52:01.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

2484
01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:03.280
<v Speaker 3>This has been tested and tested and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tested.</v>

2485
01:52:03.370 --> 01:52:04.203
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

2486
01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's my issue with it.</v>

2487
01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.470
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One on the,</v>

2488
01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:08.463
<v Speaker 3>on the pro side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that bullets we'll take a </v>

2489
01:52:10.721 --> 01:52:12.740
<v Speaker 3>straight path is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2490
01:52:12.810 --> 01:52:13.643
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to hunters that have shot </v>

2491
01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:20.280
<v Speaker 3>animals in the front and had a bullet </v>
<v Speaker 3>come out the same side.</v>

2492
01:52:20.321 --> 01:52:21.154
<v Speaker 3>They shot it and it ricocheted off bones</v>
<v Speaker 3>and came out like the front of the </v>

2493
01:52:23.981 --> 01:52:24.814
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like bullets take weird paths when they </v>

2494
01:52:26.981 --> 01:52:28.600
<v Speaker 3>hit things in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2495
01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:33.630
<v Speaker 3>so to arrows they take as a person who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>well versed in firearms and shot animals</v>

2496
01:52:36.371 --> 01:52:38.590
<v Speaker 3>and hunted this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

2497
01:52:39.130 --> 01:52:39.963
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the bullet goes straight </v>
<v Speaker 3>through and sometimes it hits bones and </v>

2498
01:52:42.851 --> 01:52:44.860
<v Speaker 3>wacky things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things deflect.</v>

2499
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:48.560
<v Speaker 3>But on the negative side they always </v>
<v Speaker 3>distort.</v>

2500
01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:51.290
<v Speaker 3>Bullets always distort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly when they hit bone,</v>

2501
01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:55.700
<v Speaker 3>but bothered me was that they found that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet in Connolly's Gurney.</v>

2502
01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:57.163
<v Speaker 3>When they brought him to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just conveniently found this </v>

2503
01:52:59.301 --> 01:53:00.050
<v Speaker 3>bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aha,</v>

2504
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:02.660
<v Speaker 3>we have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the bullet that matches the same</v>

2505
01:53:02.661 --> 01:53:06.170
<v Speaker 3>rifle and but it wasn't pristine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was flattened.</v>

2506
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at that bullet,</v>

2507
01:53:08.871 --> 01:53:11.810
<v Speaker 3>that bullet does nothing like a bullet </v>
<v Speaker 3>that hit bone.</v>

2508
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:14.060
<v Speaker 3>When bullets hit bone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they mushroom,</v>

2509
01:53:14.061 --> 01:53:15.290
<v Speaker 3>they balloon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they bend,</v>

2510
01:53:15.291 --> 01:53:17.930
<v Speaker 3>they distort wildly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't come out looking like that.</v>

2511
01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:18.913
<v Speaker 3>They come out looking like that when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot them into water or when you shoot </v>

2512
01:53:21.141 --> 01:53:21.974
<v Speaker 3>them into like feathers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't come out looking like that </v>

2513
01:53:24.651 --> 01:53:25.484
<v Speaker 3>under normal circumstances when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>shattered the bone of two different </v>

2514
01:53:27.771 --> 01:53:29.990
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well to you know that for sure.</v>

2515
01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:31.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not know that for sure.</v>

2516
01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:32.233
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing I do know a lot about is I </v>

2517
01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:38.750
<v Speaker 3>know quite a bit about what bullets look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when they hit things.</v>

2518
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:39.583
<v Speaker 3>I've looked into this pretty extensively</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've talked to a lot of people in </v>

2519
01:53:42.111 --> 01:53:44.900
<v Speaker 3>law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>military hunters,</v>

2520
01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:48.440
<v Speaker 3>and none of them believed that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet hit bones,</v>

2521
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:50.420
<v Speaker 3>shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bones came out looking like that.</v>

2522
01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:51.433
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that that bullet was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>only bullet ever in the history of the </v>

2523
01:53:54.231 --> 01:53:55.450
<v Speaker 3>world that did do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2524
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:57.280
<v Speaker 3>it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2525
01:53:57.290 --> 01:54:00.560
<v Speaker 3>So we're getting kind of caught up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the weeds of the anomalies.</v>

2526
01:54:00.561 --> 01:54:01.670
<v Speaker 3>What about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a bullet.</v>

2527
01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:03.463
<v Speaker 3>Oswald himself had attempted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>assassinate a general name Walker six </v>

2528
01:54:07.371 --> 01:54:11.960
<v Speaker 3>months before with his rifle and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>handgun and he went over to the house.</v>

2529
01:54:11.961 --> 01:54:14.810
<v Speaker 3>He took a shot through the guys when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw him at the desk,</v>

2530
01:54:14.811 --> 01:54:15.830
<v Speaker 3>took a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>missed him.</v>

2531
01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:19.670
<v Speaker 3>He told his wife about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a revolutionary.</v>

2532
01:54:19.671 --> 01:54:21.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to start stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong.</v>

2533
01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:23.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that Oswald was innocent.</v>

2534
01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:24.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2535
01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:28.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very possible that Oswald </v>
<v Speaker 3>did shoot at the president.</v>

2536
01:54:28.521 --> 01:54:29.354
<v Speaker 3>He might've even hit the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very possibly that some other </v>

2537
01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:33.800
<v Speaker 3>people were involved as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

2538
01:54:34.150 --> 01:54:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say this is the problem,</v>

2539
01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:36.463
<v Speaker 3>but wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it a problem if you don't know </v>

2540
01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:39.350
<v Speaker 3>who they are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because you don't know who they are</v>

2541
01:54:39.351 --> 01:54:40.184
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean it didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why do we need to postulate extra </v>

2542
01:54:42.891 --> 01:54:43.724
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of all the gunshots that </v>

2543
01:54:44.691 --> 01:54:45.524
<v Speaker 3>happened in a short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that the reason why they came </v>

2544
01:54:47.661 --> 01:54:50.090
<v Speaker 3>up with the theory of the magic bullet </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first place,</v>

2545
01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:54.140
<v Speaker 3>because they had to account for a bullet</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hit a curb underneath the overpass.</v>

2546
01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2547
01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:55.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2548
01:54:55.611 --> 01:54:57.270
<v Speaker 3>There's three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's okay.</v>

2549
01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:59.590
<v Speaker 3>If you know why they came out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2550
01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been there.</v>

2551
01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you know why they came up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's short.</v>

2552
01:55:01.971 --> 01:55:02.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right there.</v>

2553
01:55:02.841 --> 01:55:06.890
<v Speaker 3>You could not miss the point was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of true.</v>

2554
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a far shot.</v>

2555
01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:11.150
<v Speaker 3>And he was a pretty good marksman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A positive track down is.</v>

2556
01:55:11.151 --> 01:55:11.984
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about the reason why they </v>

2557
01:55:13.311 --> 01:55:15.260
<v Speaker 3>came up with the magic bullet theory in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>

2558
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2559
01:55:16.191 --> 01:55:17.610
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2560
01:55:17.611 --> 01:55:19.850
<v Speaker 3>of the alignment of the seats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2561
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:23.030
<v Speaker 3>because they had to attribute three </v>
<v Speaker 3>shots.</v>

2562
01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:25.770
<v Speaker 3>They had to figure out in one of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

2563
01:55:25.771 --> 01:55:26.601
<v Speaker 3>they were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2564
01:55:26.601 --> 01:55:28.580
<v Speaker 3>they all have these wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Came from three bullets,</v>

2565
01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:29.653
<v Speaker 3>but then they found a bullet that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the curb on the underside and got </v>

2566
01:55:32.301 --> 01:55:34.280
<v Speaker 3>checked into a hospital because he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting the ricochet.</v>

2567
01:55:34.810 --> 01:55:38.720
<v Speaker 3>So there's a curb that they proved was </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit with a bullet.</v>

2568
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:39.583
<v Speaker 3>There was a bullet hole in the granite </v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the fuck the curbs made out </v>

2569
01:55:42.231 --> 01:55:43.830
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit this guy.</v>

2570
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.950
<v Speaker 1>He went to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was hit with a ricochet.</v>

2571
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:51.330
<v Speaker 1>So they knew that one bullet had not hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president,</v>

2572
01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:55.410
<v Speaker 1>and so they had to attribute all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these wounds to one bullet.</v>

2573
01:55:55.411 --> 01:55:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Now they had one bullet that landed into</v>
<v Speaker 1>his neck,</v>

2574
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.823
<v Speaker 1>another bullet that hit him in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do these three bullets cause a </v>

2575
01:56:02.541 --> 01:56:05.540
<v Speaker 1>wound timely as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they came up with the map.</v>

2576
01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:07.620
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the bullet look at that bullet,</v>

2577
01:56:07.621 --> 01:56:10.110
<v Speaker 1>but you have to look at this at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's flattened.</v>

2578
01:56:10.111 --> 01:56:12.090
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it from the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2579
01:56:12.091 --> 01:56:12.924
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

2580
01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:13.973
<v Speaker 1>Under no circumstances do I feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this bullet could hit a risks and still </v>

2581
01:56:16.531 --> 01:56:19.230
<v Speaker 1>not be deformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We proved that by experiments as a chief</v>

2582
01:56:19.231 --> 01:56:20.064
<v Speaker 1>consultant in wound ballistics for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>US army who supervised tests for the </v>

2583
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Warren Commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

2584
01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:26.093
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2585
01:56:26.190 --> 01:56:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>some grand conspiracy,</v>

2586
01:56:31.291 --> 01:56:35.520
<v Speaker 1>but I do think it's entirely possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone took that posthumously,</v>

2587
01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:39.630
<v Speaker 1>took that rifle and wanting to pin it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee Harvey Oswald definitively.</v>

2588
01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:40.733
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that do things when they </v>

2589
01:56:41.341 --> 01:56:43.530
<v Speaker 1>know someone's guilty and they plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

2590
01:56:43.531 --> 01:56:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Mark Furhman did that with Oj Simpson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found his glove and they,</v>

2591
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:47.663
<v Speaker 1>they planted evidence and there was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why Oj got off because </v>

2592
01:56:50.461 --> 01:56:54.270
<v Speaker 1>there was some sort of conspiring to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it look like he was,</v>

2593
01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:55.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the.</v>

2594
01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:56.083
<v Speaker 1>The evidence was a clear path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have just taken that rifle </v>

2595
01:56:58.741 --> 01:57:01.770
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could've been that Oswald did it alone.</v>

2596
01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:03.770
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also could have been this.</v>

2597
01:57:03.771 --> 01:57:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Some other people were shooting at them </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2598
01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:06.473
<v Speaker 1>It could have been that they had decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have oswald be a part of this and </v>

2599
01:57:09.331 --> 01:57:13.110
<v Speaker 1>when Jack Ruby ran in and shot them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't look a little suspicious at</v>

2600
01:57:13.111 --> 01:57:13.944
<v Speaker 1>some guy with ties to the mob gets right</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to this guy who just shot the </v>

2601
01:57:16.771 --> 01:57:18.900
<v Speaker 1>president and shoots him like why?</v>

2602
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 1>That's never shot before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it publicly.</v>

2603
01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Posner talks about Ruby's character and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who he was,</v>

2604
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:28.710
<v Speaker 1>major kennedy supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a running with some bad dudes,</v>

2605
01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:32.700
<v Speaker 1>some bread bad andres there in Texas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a gun owner.</v>

2606
01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:35.550
<v Speaker 1>A security wasn't anything like it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2607
01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:38.580
<v Speaker 1>He really could just walk right in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

2608
01:57:38.610 --> 01:57:39.443
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also possible that that guy </v>

2609
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:44.350
<v Speaker 1>owed something to the mob and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they told them to do.</v>

2610
01:57:44.351 --> 01:57:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to get rid of that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to care.</v>

2611
01:57:46.051 --> 01:57:47.010
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2612
01:57:47.011 --> 01:57:52.011
<v Speaker 1>that guy just shot the president who </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems so it seems like people want it to</v>

2613
01:57:54.091 --> 01:57:54.924
<v Speaker 1>be one way or the other and they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want this case closed and be that </v>

2614
01:57:59.401 --> 01:57:59.731
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2615
01:57:59.731 --> 01:58:00.564
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was evident pretty quickly </v>

2616
01:58:03.211 --> 01:58:05.250
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and they rounded them up.</v>

2617
01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2618
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:07.223
<v Speaker 1>World War One was launched by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy with the assassination of </v>

2619
01:58:09.481 --> 01:58:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian group of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the black hand,</v>

2620
01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:13.913
<v Speaker 1>the group of nationalists while we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the Vietnam War to the </v>

2621
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Gulf of Tonkin incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>False flag.</v>

2622
01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:21.090
<v Speaker 1>So these things do happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all false legs.</v>

2623
01:58:21.091 --> 01:58:23.340
<v Speaker 1>There are conspiracies to assassinate </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign leaders.</v>

2624
01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2625
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:25.651
<v Speaker 1>hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote this book.</v>

2626
01:58:25.651 --> 01:58:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm Kissinger as a war criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2627
01:58:28.771 --> 01:58:29.221
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2628
01:58:29.221 --> 01:58:30.054
<v Speaker 1>all the shenanigans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were doing it in South America with </v>

2629
01:58:32.011 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Speaker 1>dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were back in this take Taylor,</v>

2630
01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:34.913
<v Speaker 1>because he's the son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's our son of a bitch versus this </v>

2631
01:58:36.691 --> 01:58:41.691
<v Speaker 1>guy and we're going to sas and a Castro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the stuff that came out that Johnson</v>

2632
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:42.993
<v Speaker 2>tried to cover up that came out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pentagon papers about Kennedy plotting </v>

2633
01:58:47.831 --> 01:58:52.150
<v Speaker 2>to have Castro assassinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a kind of conspiracies that this.</v>

2634
01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely this does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

2635
01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:58.840
<v Speaker 2>did it happen in that particular case or</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one or a year and the evidence,</v>

2636
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:03.010
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after reading particularly Gerald Posner</v>

2637
01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:05.950
<v Speaker 2>is booked a case closed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

2638
01:59:05.951 --> 01:59:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Internet meme that went around last week</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a guy who dies,</v>

2639
01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:09.573
<v Speaker 2>goes to heaven and God says you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been such a good fellow your </v>

2640
01:59:12.131 --> 01:59:13.940
<v Speaker 2>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll grant you one wish.</v>

2641
01:59:13.941 --> 01:59:15.340
<v Speaker 2>She can ask me anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2642
01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:16.480
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who killed Kennedy?</v>

2643
01:59:17.090 --> 01:59:17.923
<v Speaker 2>And God said it was Lee Harvey Oswald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting alone using his own Kokona rifle </v>

2644
01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:24.220
<v Speaker 2>and the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this goes higher up than I thought.</v>

2645
01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:28.820
<v Speaker 3>That's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2646
01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever read David Lifton's novel </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a book about it rather?</v>

2647
01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Best evidence.</v>

2648
01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Best evidence.</v>

2649
01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:36.193
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't read the whole book when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was researching this back in the </v>

2650
01:59:39.531 --> 01:59:43.460
<v Speaker 2>nineties when after the Oliver Stone </v>
<v Speaker 2>film came out,</v>

2651
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:45.320
<v Speaker 2>because after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that came out,</v>

2652
01:59:45.321 --> 01:59:45.891
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2653
01:59:45.891 --> 01:59:48.020
<v Speaker 2>if only half of this or 10 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is true,</v>

2654
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:51.620
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there are websites dedicated to</v>

2655
01:59:51.621 --> 01:59:53.050
<v Speaker 2>everything he got wrong there.</v>

2656
01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:54.273
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made people up like the General </v>

2657
01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Donald Sutherland character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy doesn't even exist.</v>

2658
01:59:58.630 --> 02:00:02.660
<v Speaker 3>He just used him as a theatrical tool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very distorting film.</v>

2659
02:00:02.661 --> 02:00:06.500
<v Speaker 3>And that film is such a powerful medium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to overcome that.</v>

2660
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that movie in particular,</v>

2661
02:00:07.770 --> 02:00:09.800
<v Speaker 3>you've got Kevin Costner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the good guy.</v>

2662
02:00:09.801 --> 02:00:12.120
<v Speaker 3>Everybody loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2663
02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is a Jack Lemmon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walter Matthau too.</v>

2664
02:00:15.651 --> 02:00:16.484
<v Speaker 3>Crazy movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it really has you believing that </v>

2665
02:00:18.441 --> 02:00:21.740
<v Speaker 3>there's some sort of a continuous into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lip back into the left people.</v>

2666
02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:23.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing about that though.</v>

2667
02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at that over and over again.</v>

2668
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:26.833
<v Speaker 3>Yes it is back into the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the spray kind of comes out the </v>

2669
02:00:31.041 --> 02:00:31.850
<v Speaker 3>front.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2670
02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:32.620
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2671
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kinda comes out the front.</v>

2672
02:00:34.250 --> 02:00:35.083
<v Speaker 3>And one thing that does happen when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people or things get shot is you have </v>

2673
02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:43.850
<v Speaker 3>nerves and nerves react and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things do weird,</v>

2674
02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:48.230
<v Speaker 3>weird results in your body when if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get hit by something,</v>

2675
02:00:48.231 --> 02:00:51.890
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't get his hands come up like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2676
02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's grabbing his neck.</v>

2677
02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the other thing was there was a</v>

2678
02:00:55.431 --> 02:00:57.560
<v Speaker 3>difference in the autopsy results from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bethesda,</v>

2679
02:00:57.561 --> 02:00:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Maryland versus in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas,</v>

2680
02:00:59.181 --> 02:01:00.014
<v Speaker 3>Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>

2681
02:01:00.590 --> 02:01:05.590
<v Speaker 3>They attributed the throat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wound to a frontal shot at something.</v>

2682
02:01:06.081 --> 02:01:08.690
<v Speaker 3>Hit him in the front.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the Bethesda,</v>

2683
02:01:08.691 --> 02:01:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said that it was a trait wound.</v>

2684
02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:12.410
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2685
02:01:12.410 --> 02:01:14.640
<v Speaker 3>they opened them up to clear his </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing pathway.</v>

2686
02:01:14.641 --> 02:01:16.400
<v Speaker 3>And then the conspiracy theorists will </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2687
02:01:16.401 --> 02:01:17.234
<v Speaker 3>why would you clear the breathing </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathway of a guy who doesn't have a </v>

2688
02:01:18.741 --> 02:01:20.750
<v Speaker 3>brain spraying was shot out of his head.</v>

2689
02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:25.310
<v Speaker 3>I just don't like when people say they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know one way or another,</v>

2690
02:01:25.650 --> 02:01:27.800
<v Speaker 3>we harvey Oswald acted alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2691
02:01:27.801 --> 02:01:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Could you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a bunch of bull.</v>

2692
02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:30.553
<v Speaker 3>There was also bullet fragments and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Connolly's wrist that weren't missing </v>

2693
02:01:33.291 --> 02:01:35.660
<v Speaker 3>from the bullet itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bullet itself,</v>

2694
02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:38.460
<v Speaker 3>whether you think it's pristine or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still,</v>

2695
02:01:38.461 --> 02:01:39.294
<v Speaker 3>it's not missing a lot of fragments and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's fragments in Connolly's body </v>

2696
02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:44.680
<v Speaker 3>that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could detect an x ray,</v>

2697
02:01:44.690 --> 02:01:47.740
<v Speaker 3>there's x rays in his wrist and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could see the little pieces of the.</v>

2698
02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the explanation for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2699
02:01:50.650 --> 02:01:51.950
<v Speaker 3>The fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2700
02:01:51.951 --> 02:01:53.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the world's expert on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2701
02:01:53.630 --> 02:01:55.790
<v Speaker 3>People want to clean it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I don't like.</v>

2702
02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:56.653
<v Speaker 3>They want to clean it up or they want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>muddy it up instead of like looking at </v>

2703
02:01:59.271 --> 02:02:02.150
<v Speaker 3>it a hundred percent objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want one thing or another.</v>

2704
02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's entirely possible that Lee </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Oswald,</v>

2705
02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:08.390
<v Speaker 3>it's either to me they want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the.</v>

2706
02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:11.360
<v Speaker 3>These are the two narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy.</v>

2707
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:14.690
<v Speaker 3>He had nothing to do with the government</v>
<v Speaker 3>set him up or he acted alone,</v>

2708
02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:17.390
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why couldn't he have been evolved in it?</v>

2709
02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:18.493
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he obviously was involved in some shady </v>

2710
02:02:19.791 --> 02:02:22.730
<v Speaker 3>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy spent a ton of time in Russia,</v>

2711
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:26.270
<v Speaker 3>came back over here very easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though the Cold War was going on.</v>

2712
02:02:26.271 --> 02:02:27.104
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might've very well been some sort of </v>

2713
02:02:29.541 --> 02:02:30.374
<v Speaker 3>a government informant or working in </v>
<v Speaker 3>cahoots with the government if that's </v>

2714
02:02:33.891 --> 02:02:34.724
<v Speaker 3>the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he did shoot candidate or shoot at </v>

2715
02:02:36.861 --> 02:02:37.694
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's to say that he wasn't with other </v>

2716
02:02:39.291 --> 02:02:40.124
<v Speaker 3>people and they killed him because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy was going to go to jail and he was </v>

2717
02:02:42.681 --> 02:02:44.810
<v Speaker 3>going to start talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they arrested him,</v>

2718
02:02:44.811 --> 02:02:46.040
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Patsy,</v>

2719
02:02:46.650 --> 02:02:48.200
<v Speaker 3>patsy and then blam.</v>

2720
02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.060
<v Speaker 3>He's dead up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got them and that's it.</v>

2721
02:02:50.061 --> 02:02:50.894
<v Speaker 3>Wrap it up tight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't until the Zapruder film that </v>

2722
02:02:52.371 --> 02:02:55.580
<v Speaker 3>people really started to question and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that was.</v>

2723
02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:58.390
<v Speaker 3>It might've been 10 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2724
02:02:58.400 --> 02:02:59.750
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2725
02:02:59.751 --> 02:03:02.210
<v Speaker 3>the whole history of the Zapruder film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it was released.</v>

2726
02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:04.810
<v Speaker 3>The Geraldo Rivera show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2727
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2728
02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:06.913
<v Speaker 3>Dick Gregory comedian brought the film </v>
<v Speaker 3>footage to the Geraldo Rivera show and </v>

2729
02:03:12.111 --> 02:03:14.300
<v Speaker 3>showed it on television for the First </v>
<v Speaker 3>Time magazine,</v>

2730
02:03:14.301 --> 02:03:17.510
<v Speaker 3>but the rights to life magazine had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights and didn't do anything with it.</v>

2731
02:03:17.511 --> 02:03:18.344
<v Speaker 3>They kept it for more than a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Gregory got ahold of the actual </v>

2732
02:03:22.191 --> 02:03:23.024
<v Speaker 3>film footage and premiered it on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Geraldo Rivera shall I want to say it </v>

2733
02:03:27.471 --> 02:03:31.610
<v Speaker 3>was like 1971 or 72 or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2734
02:03:31.611 --> 02:03:32.444
<v Speaker 3>so it was way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way after the assassination that the </v>

2735
02:03:35.031 --> 02:03:35.960
<v Speaker 3>American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>

2736
02:03:35.961 --> 02:03:38.150
<v Speaker 3>Seventy five is 12 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2737
02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Seventy five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all those years later and then people</v>

2738
02:03:42.021 --> 02:03:43.730
<v Speaker 3>got a chance to see the footage and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

2739
02:03:43.731 --> 02:03:44.564
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not how it was described to us </v>

2740
02:03:45.501 --> 02:03:47.300
<v Speaker 3>at all and it made people skeptical.</v>

2741
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:48.703
<v Speaker 3>There's a good Nova show on ballistics </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the head and testing the rifle and </v>

2742
02:03:52.251 --> 02:03:55.040
<v Speaker 3>could you shoot that many times and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>many seconds and so on,</v>

2743
02:03:55.041 --> 02:03:56.270
<v Speaker 3>and it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

2744
02:03:56.271 --> 02:03:57.104
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with me is I know too much </v>

2745
02:03:59.481 --> 02:04:01.550
<v Speaker 3>about what happens when bullets hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>bones.</v>

2746
02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the bullet I do.</v>

2747
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:04.623
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they could've just dropped that </v>

2748
02:04:05.841 --> 02:04:06.674
<v Speaker 3>bullet off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that Lee Harvey Oswald </v>

2749
02:04:08.301 --> 02:04:10.570
<v Speaker 3>didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about that bullet though,</v>

2750
02:04:10.571 --> 02:04:14.660
<v Speaker 3>is that there might be some fuckery </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved and the David Liftin book was.</v>

2751
02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:17.630
<v Speaker 3>That was the book that got me into </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies.</v>

2752
02:04:17.631 --> 02:04:19.510
<v Speaker 3>That fucking book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

2753
02:04:19.670 --> 02:04:20.503
<v Speaker 3>If I could go back and not read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bombed on stage because of that book </v>

2754
02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:24.120
<v Speaker 3>you did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2755
02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:24.953
<v Speaker 3>Well it was my fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've read that book the day I was </v>

2756
02:04:28.671 --> 02:04:29.504
<v Speaker 3>performing and I was freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like 24 or something like </v>

2757
02:04:32.931 --> 02:04:33.291
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2758
02:04:33.291 --> 02:04:34.280
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

2759
02:04:34.610 --> 02:04:37.500
<v Speaker 3>They killed the president and I was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>naive and</v>

2760
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I was like really bummed out when I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage and then I realized like,</v>

2761
02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:43.220
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

2762
02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:44.053
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only been doing comedy for three </v>

2763
02:04:45.301 --> 02:04:46.134
<v Speaker 1>years and you can't go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bombed out if you've got to get your </v>

2764
02:04:48.301 --> 02:04:49.134
<v Speaker 1>head together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just say the jokes and not </v>

2765
02:04:50.251 --> 02:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>have some emotional attachment to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that book highlights what it was was</v>

2766
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:58.320
<v Speaker 1>lifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a bookkeeper and an accountant,</v>

2767
02:04:58.321 --> 02:04:59.154
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was hired to do something with </v>

2768
02:05:01.621 --> 02:05:06.510
<v Speaker 1>the Warren Commission report and in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he found some contradictions and</v>

2769
02:05:06.511 --> 02:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>he went over the entire Warren </v>
<v Speaker 1>Commission report,</v>

2770
02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:11.250
<v Speaker 1>which is an enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous publication,</v>

2771
02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:12.473
<v Speaker 1>and he found all of these problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these problems in the Warren </v>

2772
02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Commission report and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions.</v>

2773
02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:23.070
<v Speaker 1>And it was his determination after </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading everything in writing his book,</v>

2774
02:05:23.490 --> 02:05:26.340
<v Speaker 1>he thought that the conclusion they </v>
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

2775
02:05:26.341 --> 02:05:27.174
<v Speaker 1>they made before the fact and that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote all this stuff to sort of Vr the </v>

2776
02:05:31.561 --> 02:05:32.394
<v Speaker 1>backup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their conclusion that it wasn't based </v>

2777
02:05:34.111 --> 02:05:38.400
<v Speaker 1>entirely on an objective version of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts of the event itself.</v>

2778
02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:40.320
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his take was,</v>

2779
02:05:40.321 --> 02:05:42.690
<v Speaker 1>there was a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2780
02:05:42.691 --> 02:05:45.260
<v Speaker 1>it's launched a mini industry of books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2781
02:05:45.710 --> 02:05:46.543
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about all the money that's been </v>

2782
02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:50.910
<v Speaker 1>made off of the Kennedy assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go down the rabbit hole with this</v>

2783
02:05:50.911 --> 02:05:51.744
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever see the Jesse Ventura </v>

2784
02:05:53.791 --> 02:05:55.430
<v Speaker 1>version of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2785
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:59.880
<v Speaker 1>he believes that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the best.</v>

2786
02:05:59.881 --> 02:06:02.370
<v Speaker 1>It was on his computer spirits he show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2787
02:06:02.371 --> 02:06:03.540
<v Speaker 1>he's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2788
02:06:03.541 --> 02:06:05.040
<v Speaker 1>He believes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2789
02:06:05.041 --> 02:06:07.500
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one could have made shocked.</v>

2790
02:06:08.010 --> 02:06:09.300
<v Speaker 1>They definitely could have made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

2791
02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:11.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that far.</v>

2792
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Just because someone gets lucky doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean they can't get lucky.</v>

2793
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Like people get lucky all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People flip a coin and it lands on heads</v>

2794
02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:20.600
<v Speaker 1>a mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2795
02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could throw a coin,</v>

2796
02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:23.363
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could throw a coin out of a </v>

2797
02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2798
02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:31.290
<v Speaker 1>you could say this is going to be heads </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it lands and it can be heads.</v>

2799
02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:32.520
<v Speaker 1>You can get lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2800
02:06:32.521 --> 02:06:33.354
<v Speaker 1>It really is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this assassination of Franz </v>

2801
02:06:36.090 --> 02:06:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Ferdinand that triggered the first world</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

2802
02:06:37.410 --> 02:06:38.243
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2803
02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2804
02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 1>they messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like seven of them and they met in</v>

2805
02:06:43.171 --> 02:06:45.780
<v Speaker 1>secret and they got their weapons that </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and so on.</v>

2806
02:06:45.781 --> 02:06:46.950
<v Speaker 1>And a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken,</v>

2807
02:06:46.951 --> 02:06:48.310
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else cut last.</v>

2808
02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just like three of them there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody threw a hand grenade,</v>

2809
02:06:51.211 --> 02:06:52.044
<v Speaker 1>missed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolled into the car behind the friends </v>

2810
02:06:54.970 --> 02:06:58.260
<v Speaker 1>for non and and they got hurt and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the hospital and he's like,</v>

2811
02:06:58.290 --> 02:07:00.330
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not giving my speech,</v>

2812
02:07:00.331 --> 02:07:02.550
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the hospital and visit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how he's doing.</v>

2813
02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:03.593
<v Speaker 1>So they double back like half an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>later they doubled back and come back </v>

2814
02:07:06.541 --> 02:07:08.790
<v Speaker 1>down the same route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who had missed,</v>

2815
02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:10.440
<v Speaker 1>he was just sitting there on the curb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2816
02:07:10.530 --> 02:07:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here they are.</v>

2817
02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2818
02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:14.130
<v Speaker 1>pure luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pure luck.</v>

2819
02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2820
02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:15.990
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2821
02:07:16.050 --> 02:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2822
02:07:17.190 --> 02:07:19.710
<v Speaker 1>that history turns more on that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2823
02:07:19.711 --> 02:07:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Then on carefully orchestrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly executed plot.</v>

2824
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly can.</v>

2825
02:07:25.650 --> 02:07:26.660
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2826
02:07:26.661 --> 02:07:27.760
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2827
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:28.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2828
02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always found it offensive.</v>

2829
02:07:30.091 --> 02:07:32.400
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's no way Oswald </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have hit him.</v>

2830
02:07:32.610 --> 02:07:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Like people say that like there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2831
02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're out of your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never</v>

2832
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:38.020
<v Speaker 3>shot anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2833
02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I can make that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

2834
02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:41.360
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

2835
02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:42.213
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a rifle with a scope and a </v>

2836
02:07:44.081 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 3>guy is a hundred yards away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell them you can't shoot him.</v>

2837
02:07:46.890 --> 02:07:48.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy time.</v>

2838
02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:50.670
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk or the rifle was out of La.</v>

2839
02:07:50.710 --> 02:07:51.543
<v Speaker 3>That was the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said the scope wasn't lined up </v>

2840
02:07:53.441 --> 02:07:55.030
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

2841
02:07:55.031 --> 02:07:57.190
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a rifle,</v>

2842
02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:59.170
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this has happened to me before,</v>

2843
02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:01.930
<v Speaker 3>and you drop the rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scope gets damaged,</v>

2844
02:08:01.931 --> 02:08:04.420
<v Speaker 3>it gets moved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very sensitive thing,</v>

2845
02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:08.950
<v Speaker 3>like when you're talking about something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that goes faster than the speed of sound</v>

2846
02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:10.150
<v Speaker 3>of bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2847
02:08:10.151 --> 02:08:12.700
<v Speaker 3>firing out of a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have that.</v>

2848
02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:13.593
<v Speaker 3>That is going incredibly fast and to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to get that radical exactly on </v>

2849
02:08:17.411 --> 02:08:20.410
<v Speaker 3>where you think that bullet's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit requires a lot of adjustments.</v>

2850
02:08:20.411 --> 02:08:23.020
<v Speaker 3>When you go to the range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they set up a lead sled.</v>

2851
02:08:23.230 --> 02:08:26.560
<v Speaker 3>You put your rifle down on this sled so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not holding the rifle,</v>

2852
02:08:26.890 --> 02:08:29.050
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we oddball wasn't holding it either.</v>

2853
02:08:29.051 --> 02:08:31.060
<v Speaker 3>The idea was that he had it rested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2854
02:08:31.090 --> 02:08:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Which makes it much more steady and much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more easier to make an accurate shot.</v>

2855
02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:35.433
<v Speaker 3>So you set up this rifle on the lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>sled and it's usually 100 yards or 200 </v>

2856
02:08:39.011 --> 02:08:39.550
<v Speaker 3>yards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2857
02:08:39.550 --> 02:08:43.270
<v Speaker 3>however farther distances to the target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you squeeze,</v>

2858
02:08:43.271 --> 02:08:44.051
<v Speaker 3>squeeze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>squeeze,</v>

2859
02:08:44.051 --> 02:08:44.884
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That trigger goes off and you see that </v>

2860
02:08:46.301 --> 02:08:49.300
<v Speaker 3>the bullet is low and to the left by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of inches,</v>

2861
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:52.510
<v Speaker 3>you make an adjustment on the scope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you drop that rifle,</v>

2862
02:08:52.511 --> 02:08:55.240
<v Speaker 3>that scope gets knocked the adjustments </v>
<v Speaker 3>out the window.</v>

2863
02:08:55.570 --> 02:08:56.403
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that there's like a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 3>chain of command between Lee Harvey </v>

2864
02:08:59.080 --> 02:08:59.913
<v Speaker 3>Oswald,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling that trigger and that scope </v>

2865
02:09:00.611 --> 02:09:02.790
<v Speaker 3>never got rattled at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2866
02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:03.633
<v Speaker 3>but the conspiracy theorists want you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think there's no way he could've made </v>

2867
02:09:06.881 --> 02:09:07.540
<v Speaker 3>that shot.</v>

2868
02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:09.430
<v Speaker 3>That scope wasn't even lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

2869
02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:11.290
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2870
02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:12.513
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like anybody who knows anything about </v>

2871
02:09:13.601 --> 02:09:15.460
<v Speaker 3>rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows there's no way you could know,</v>

2872
02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:18.220
<v Speaker 3>because if all you'd have to do is whack</v>
<v Speaker 3>it here,</v>

2873
02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to bring you the rifle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just bump it with your elbow funny.</v>

2874
02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:22.713
<v Speaker 3>Knock it into a wall when you're handing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to someone and that scope's going to </v>

2875
02:09:24.851 --> 02:09:25.600
<v Speaker 3>be off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2876
02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:26.433
<v Speaker 3>So you then you take it to a range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to prove definitively that </v>

2877
02:09:28.541 --> 02:09:30.820
<v Speaker 3>he could have never made this shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>because this scope is off.</v>

2878
02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's six inches to the left.</v>

2879
02:09:33.370 --> 02:09:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Case closed right now.</v>

2880
02:09:37.090 --> 02:09:37.923
<v Speaker 3>There's no way people know whether or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not that scope was on when he was </v>

2881
02:09:41.711 --> 02:09:43.120
<v Speaker 3>pulling that trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

2882
02:09:43.121 --> 02:09:45.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I went to Dealey Plaza,</v>

2883
02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:47.980
<v Speaker 3>it's so big and our public imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

2884
02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:51.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not like this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tiny and so small.</v>

2885
02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:53.840
<v Speaker 3>And then you go up to the museum and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on the sixth floor,</v>

2886
02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:55.360
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the book depository,</v>

2887
02:09:55.361 --> 02:09:58.120
<v Speaker 3>and you look down and they have an x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two xs in the street.</v>

2888
02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:00.790
<v Speaker 3>And you think that's just right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2889
02:10:00.791 --> 02:10:03.160
<v Speaker 3>I can shoot that with an arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you could.</v>

2890
02:10:03.190 --> 02:10:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2891
02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:04.953
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee if you give me some time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give me some time if you put a </v>

2892
02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:11.680
<v Speaker 3>target right where that thing was right </v>
<v Speaker 3>where that a lincoln was and,</v>

2893
02:10:11.710 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 3>and you put me in that window,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you I hit that target with a</v>

2894
02:10:14.981 --> 02:10:16.030
<v Speaker 3>bow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2895
02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea that you couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm holding it.</v>

2896
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:19.363
<v Speaker 3>No rest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you couldn't do that with </v>

2897
02:10:21.291 --> 02:10:22.600
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a rifle,</v>

2898
02:10:22.630 --> 02:10:24.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You turn it certainly could.</v>

2899
02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:26.170
<v Speaker 3>Lee Harvey Oswald certainly could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>done it.</v>

2900
02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:28.780
<v Speaker 3>He certainly couldn't have shot at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy.</v>

2901
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:29.703
<v Speaker 3>He was a crazy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in a lot </v>

2902
02:10:32.021 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 3>of shady shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like he was just</v>

2903
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:34.933
<v Speaker 1>some dentists somewhere toward the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second reading depositary he scored the </v>

2904
02:10:38.601 --> 02:10:40.380
<v Speaker 1>second highest marksmanship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

2905
02:10:40.381 --> 02:10:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right here to here.</v>

2906
02:10:41.250 --> 02:10:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2907
02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:44.120
<v Speaker 1>that's so small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was such a short distance.</v>

2908
02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:45.553
<v Speaker 1>Then the other question I had when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're coming up Houston street and </v>

2909
02:10:47.361 --> 02:10:48.194
<v Speaker 1>going left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wondered why he didn't shoot </v>

2910
02:10:50.421 --> 02:10:53.150
<v Speaker 1>him there when the car's coming right at</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2911
02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:54.873
<v Speaker 1>What was the other window?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in the window on the left hand </v>

2912
02:10:56.511 --> 02:10:57.530
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was over there.</v>

2913
02:10:57.770 --> 02:10:58.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2914
02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:58.830
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2915
02:10:58.830 --> 02:11:00.740
<v Speaker 1>It's over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2916
02:11:00.741 --> 02:11:01.574
<v Speaker 1>it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where he shot them from that </v>

2917
02:11:02.601 --> 02:11:03.590
<v Speaker 1>window there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2918
02:11:04.070 --> 02:11:04.903
<v Speaker 1>So I always wondered why he didn't shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>him when the car was coming right at </v>

2919
02:11:06.891 --> 02:11:07.724
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that would have been a cleaner </v>

2920
02:11:08.061 --> 02:11:10.050
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me head on you mean?</v>

2921
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2922
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:13.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you want to shoot him in the back </v>

2923
02:11:13.791 --> 02:11:14.050
<v Speaker 1>of the head.</v>

2924
02:11:14.050 --> 02:11:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Does it have like a sniper?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe panic.</v>

2925
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.270
<v Speaker 1>It's that upper right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2926
02:11:18.730 --> 02:11:19.580
<v Speaker 1>at that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2927
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:21.381
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2928
02:11:21.381 --> 02:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>When we drove through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the last time,</v>

2929
02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:25.370
<v Speaker 1>not last time was in Dallas a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>times ago,</v>

2930
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:26.900
<v Speaker 1>but when we drove through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2931
02:11:26.901 --> 02:11:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it's eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2932
02:11:27.831 --> 02:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

2933
02:11:29.101 --> 02:11:31.460
<v Speaker 1>It all happened right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been twice there and there's always</v>

2934
02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:34.630
<v Speaker 1>a conspiracy people walking around there</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for a tip.</v>

2935
02:11:34.710 --> 02:11:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I gave this guy 10 bucks and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2936
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:37.450
<v Speaker 1>give me the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Oh,</v>

2937
02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:39.500
<v Speaker 1>he was very entertaining here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the Grassy Knoll,</v>

2938
02:11:39.501 --> 02:11:42.030
<v Speaker 1>the picket fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had another one about this man.</v>

2939
02:11:42.050 --> 02:11:42.883
<v Speaker 1>He took the manhole cover off because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was somebody down here in the </v>

2940
02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:45.600
<v Speaker 1>manhole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2941
02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:46.790
<v Speaker 1>lopped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

2942
02:11:46.791 --> 02:11:47.624
<v Speaker 1>Shot him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went back down to the metal favorite DM </v>

2943
02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:52.140
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy is they believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>driver turnaround shot.</v>

2944
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:53.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way.</v>

2945
02:11:54.130 --> 02:11:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the spaces.</v>

2946
02:11:55.521 --> 02:11:56.354
<v Speaker 1>Fake people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to get a bunch of </v>

2947
02:11:58.701 --> 02:12:02.360
<v Speaker 1>really wacky conspiracies whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything happens in the news,</v>

2948
02:12:02.361 --> 02:12:04.040
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2949
02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:06.350
<v Speaker 1>anything and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly if it's big and famous.</v>

2950
02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:07.184
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to this cognitive dissonance like </v>

2951
02:12:08.571 --> 02:12:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Princess Di,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2952
02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:12.290
<v Speaker 1>cause of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk driving,</v>

2953
02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:13.250
<v Speaker 1>speeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No seatbelt.</v>

2954
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:14.583
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of people died that </v>

2955
02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:16.633
<v Speaker 1>was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was drunk yet the driver of her car </v>

2956
02:12:18.981 --> 02:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

2957
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:23.630
<v Speaker 1>He was partially drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was tipsy drunk.</v>

2958
02:12:24.250 --> 02:12:25.041
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

2959
02:12:25.041 --> 02:12:25.631
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2960
02:12:25.631 --> 02:12:27.020
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So drunk driving,</v>

2961
02:12:27.021 --> 02:12:27.801
<v Speaker 1>speeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2962
02:12:27.801 --> 02:12:30.380
<v Speaker 1>and she wasn't wearing a seatbelt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wasn't she wearing a seatbelt?</v>

2963
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.881
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2964
02:12:31.881 --> 02:12:34.200
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't feel like print.</v>

2965
02:12:34.230 --> 02:12:35.063
<v Speaker 1>Someone like Princess Di should die the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way tens of thousands of Americans die </v>

2966
02:12:37.801 --> 02:12:40.940
<v Speaker 1>in automobiles every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there should be,</v>

2967
02:12:40.941 --> 02:12:43.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] and the royal family,</v>

2968
02:12:43.731 --> 02:12:44.564
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arabs and the Palestinians that </v>

2969
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:48.050
<v Speaker 1>everybody was involved.</v>

2970
02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:49.453
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example of an absolute </v>

2971
02:12:50.481 --> 02:12:53.210
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy that we know is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a conspiracy.</v>

2972
02:12:53.370 --> 02:12:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Jamal Sogi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2973
02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2974
02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:58.280
<v Speaker 1>A good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of stuff does happen.</v>

2975
02:12:58.310 --> 02:13:00.830
<v Speaker 1>This is a real case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was murdered,</v>

2976
02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:05.780
<v Speaker 1>he went to the Saudi embassy in Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had him set up,</v>

2977
02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:09.800
<v Speaker 1>they flew in 15 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a guy who was a,</v>

2978
02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:15.150
<v Speaker 1>he was a forensics expert and he was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert in forensics,</v>

2979
02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:17.960
<v Speaker 1>forensics evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think that he was there to make</v>

2980
02:13:17.961 --> 02:13:20.470
<v Speaker 1>sure that there was nothing left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2981
02:13:20.710 --> 02:13:24.410
<v Speaker 1>this is the official story is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangled him,</v>

2982
02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:27.230
<v Speaker 1>caught him up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2983
02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:28.093
<v Speaker 1>there's even recordings apparent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes all the way to the listen to the </v>

2984
02:13:30.261 --> 02:13:31.680
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia.</v>

2985
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:33.233
<v Speaker 1>What does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2986
02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:36.390
<v Speaker 1>that's the last video seeing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2987
02:13:36.391 --> 02:13:39.840
<v Speaker 1>the body double video of him walking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's the last time you've seen.</v>

2988
02:13:40.230 --> 02:13:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2989
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:42.183
<v Speaker 1>he entered into there and there's 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>different dudes that were waiting for </v>

2990
02:13:45.811 --> 02:13:46.260
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2991
02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:48.480
<v Speaker 1>They killed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chopped him up.</v>

2992
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:49.343
<v Speaker 1>And there's videos of those guys leaving</v>
<v Speaker 1>with suitcases and they say that the </v>

2993
02:13:52.711 --> 02:13:55.260
<v Speaker 1>suitcases had his body in them chopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2994
02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

2995
02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:00.330
<v Speaker 1>it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also,</v>

2996
02:14:00.331 --> 02:14:01.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>

2997
02:14:01.831 --> 02:14:05.520
<v Speaker 1>they can get away with some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>sketchy shit and it seems like nothing's</v>

2998
02:14:05.521 --> 02:14:06.354
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2999
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Like people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>few people got fired.</v>

3000
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:09.143
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say on this that I'm Michael </v>

3001
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Moore's film on nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made the point,</v>

3002
02:14:15.481 --> 02:14:16.314
<v Speaker 1>I was the first I'd seen make the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Saudi Arabia family got out of </v>

3003
02:14:20.250 --> 02:14:21.083
<v Speaker 1>the United States on 9:12 when all </v>
<v Speaker 1>flights were canceled and that Bush let </v>

3004
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.863
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now here we see that trump doesn't </v>

3005
02:14:29.281 --> 02:14:32.070
<v Speaker 1>want to condemn the Saudis because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're our allies.</v>

3006
02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:33.733
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of shit in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes all the way back to nine slash </v>

3007
02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:39.030
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know the Saudis support,</v>

3008
02:14:39.031 --> 02:14:39.864
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3009
02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:43.290
<v Speaker 1>bankrolled most of the 19 hijackers.</v>

3010
02:14:44.010 --> 02:14:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind of conspiracy that we</v>

3011
02:14:46.831 --> 02:14:47.664
<v Speaker 1>should be paying attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that Bush was involved and made it </v>

3012
02:14:49.921 --> 02:14:50.754
<v Speaker 1>happen in the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the kind of shit that really </v>

3013
02:14:53.611 --> 02:14:54.960
<v Speaker 1>happens in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3014
02:14:54.961 --> 02:14:55.794
<v Speaker 1>people are our banking each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have to be nice to each other and </v>

3015
02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:00.661
<v Speaker 1>overlook it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3016
02:15:00.661 --> 02:15:01.800
<v Speaker 1>like when trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3017
02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin murders people,</v>

3018
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:06.810
<v Speaker 1>oh well everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

3019
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:10.740
<v Speaker 1>we do some terrible things to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3020
02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:12.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's true.</v>

3021
02:15:12.190 --> 02:15:14.240
<v Speaker 1>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3022
02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's got a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

3023
02:15:16.590 --> 02:15:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so there's so much money,</v>

3024
02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:21.510
<v Speaker 1>so much money involved with Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabia.</v>

3025
02:15:21.511 --> 02:15:24.380
<v Speaker 1>In this article I was writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cited a criminologist,</v>

3026
02:15:24.381 --> 02:15:29.381
<v Speaker 1>manual eisner in a study of 1500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchs in 45 monarchies across Europe.</v>

3027
02:15:31.381 --> 02:15:32.214
<v Speaker 1>Between add 600 and 1800,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found that about 15 percent of them 227 </v>

3028
02:15:37.501 --> 02:15:38.334
<v Speaker 1>were assassinated chorus punting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>homicide rate of about a thousand per </v>

3029
02:15:41.731 --> 02:15:44.400
<v Speaker 1>100,000 ruler years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 times the background rate.</v>

3030
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:45.833
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assassinations in history are pretty </v>

3031
02:15:47.431 --> 02:15:48.264
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how power often changes hands </v>

3032
02:15:49.801 --> 02:15:53.040
<v Speaker 1>before liberal democracies spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after 19 seventies,</v>

3033
02:15:53.250 --> 02:15:57.090
<v Speaker 1>this was not uncommon though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we shouldn't be surprised that people</v>

3034
02:15:57.091 --> 02:16:01.110
<v Speaker 1>believe this kind of stuff because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know there's some truth to that thing is</v>

3035
02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:05.010
<v Speaker 1>unsettling to folks because what he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed for,</v>

3036
02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:06.530
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's.</v>

3037
02:16:06.570 --> 02:16:08.430
<v Speaker 1>There's two different versions of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3038
02:16:08.490 --> 02:16:09.323
<v Speaker 1>There's this film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was killed for criticizing the Saudi </v>

3039
02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Arabian government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also.</v>

3040
02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:15.594
<v Speaker 1>There was also that he was criticized </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was aware or he was killed </v>

3041
02:16:19.111 --> 02:16:19.944
<v Speaker 1>rather because he was aware of some spy </v>
<v Speaker 1>software that's being utilized and that </v>

3042
02:16:25.951 --> 02:16:26.784
<v Speaker 1>if he wrote a story about this spy </v>
<v Speaker 1>software being utilized by the Saudi </v>

3043
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Arabian</v>

3044
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:33.070
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would be a huge disaster.</v>

3045
02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be.</v>

3046
02:16:35.490 --> 02:16:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3047
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

3048
02:16:37.710 --> 02:16:39.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a lot we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's my,</v>

3049
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:43.270
<v Speaker 2>a concession to conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get elected president,</v>

3050
02:16:43.271 --> 02:16:44.530
<v Speaker 2>they take you in the back room and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

3051
02:16:44.590 --> 02:16:46.180
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what's actually going on.</v>

3052
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

3053
02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:48.094
<v Speaker 2>I can't close Gitmo close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get bumped because no one will take </v>

3054
02:16:49.931 --> 02:16:50.890
<v Speaker 2>those bed dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3055
02:16:50.891 --> 02:16:51.724
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but pull the troops out of Afghanistan </v>

3056
02:16:53.290 --> 02:16:55.330
<v Speaker 2>can't pull the troops out of Afghanistan</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we do that.</v>

3057
02:16:55.510 --> 02:16:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Here's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

3058
02:16:57.430 --> 02:16:59.590
<v Speaker 2>But we don't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know this.</v>

3059
02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:02.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think that something like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>does go on,</v>

3060
02:17:02.021 --> 02:17:04.910
<v Speaker 2>maybe not quite so secretly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just that you know,</v>

3061
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:08.110
<v Speaker 2>you and I don't need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things need to know basis.</v>

3062
02:17:08.111 --> 02:17:09.880
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the president does.</v>

3063
02:17:10.690 --> 02:17:11.840
<v Speaker 2>When their candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

3064
02:17:11.841 --> 02:17:13.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they say to get elected,</v>

3065
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:14.920
<v Speaker 2>and then they get in there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3066
02:17:14.921 --> 02:17:15.754
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that the Saudis are </v>

3067
02:17:16.961 --> 02:17:21.070
<v Speaker 2>doing this and this and this and we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>them for these six reasons over here.</v>

3068
02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:22.353
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did this bad thing and if we </v>

3069
02:17:23.111 --> 02:17:25.690
<v Speaker 2>condemn them then they're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do these things over here,</v>

3070
02:17:25.691 --> 02:17:29.800
<v Speaker 2>so I better lay off the condemnation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of stuff I suspect does happen</v>

3071
02:17:29.801 --> 02:17:30.970
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're correct.</v>

3072
02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I think I suspect the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what's fascinating to me about trump</v>

3073
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:36.063
<v Speaker 2>is that he doesn't seem to care at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about violating protocol or about </v>

3074
02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>releasing information that he probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be there.</v>

3075
02:17:44.890 --> 02:17:48.770
<v Speaker 2>He's already accidentally released top </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret information.</v>

3076
02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:54.190
<v Speaker 2>I would just feel like if he knew for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure some,</v>

3077
02:17:54.250 --> 02:17:55.083
<v Speaker 2>some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he would be the last guy you would </v>

3078
02:17:57.311 --> 02:17:59.110
<v Speaker 2>want to trust with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3079
02:18:00.190 --> 02:18:01.023
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know this thing about him </v>

3080
02:18:02.111 --> 02:18:05.980
<v Speaker 2>wanting to pull the troops out of Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be another story behind.</v>

3081
02:18:05.981 --> 02:18:06.814
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3082
02:18:06.850 --> 02:18:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Putin maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3083
02:18:07.721 --> 02:18:08.554
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta take care of our business here </v>

3084
02:18:09.671 --> 02:18:10.504
<v Speaker 2>in Syria.</v>

3085
02:18:10.630 --> 02:18:11.463
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take care of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>over here and you get your trump tower </v>

3086
02:18:15.161 --> 02:18:17.830
<v Speaker 2>in red square when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm gone or whatever,</v>

3087
02:18:17.831 --> 02:18:18.664
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some kind of.</v>

3088
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:19.833
<v Speaker 2>That kind of stuff is the sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will come out in a equivalent of a </v>

3089
02:18:22.571 --> 02:18:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Wiki leaks in 20 years will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3090
02:18:24.581 --> 02:18:26.140
<v Speaker 2>like the Gulf of Tonkin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3091
02:18:26.141 --> 02:18:27.280
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

3092
02:18:27.281 --> 02:18:28.114
<v Speaker 2>What do you think conspiracy theory that</v>
<v Speaker 2>says that trump has some video of trump </v>

3093
02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:37.320
<v Speaker 2>getting peed on or people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was published in like some serious</v>

3094
02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:40.880
<v Speaker 2>newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3095
02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:42.033
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much of this stuff that I </v>

3096
02:18:43.481 --> 02:18:44.810
<v Speaker 2>just can't keep track of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3097
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:46.570
<v Speaker 2>don't you think with him though too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll,</v>

3098
02:18:46.590 --> 02:18:49.900
<v Speaker 2>they'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read more than willing to put stuff like</v>

3099
02:18:49.901 --> 02:18:51.460
<v Speaker 2>that out there because they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3100
02:18:51.461 --> 02:18:53.680
<v Speaker 2>So they'll pull that trigger a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit quicker maybe.</v>

3101
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3102
02:18:55.241 --> 02:18:58.470
<v Speaker 2>during the Bush administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people hated George W dot Bush and hated</v>

3103
02:18:58.500 --> 02:18:59.500
<v Speaker 2>him as much as they hate trump.</v>

3104
02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:00.071
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3105
02:19:00.071 --> 02:19:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I think now they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3106
02:19:02.081 --> 02:19:03.830
<v Speaker 2>we would love to have George W Bush </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

3107
02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they just thought he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>incompetent.</v>

3108
02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:07.193
<v Speaker 2>Although directly Putin does not deny </v>
<v Speaker 2>possessing compromising material on </v>

3109
02:19:10.811 --> 02:19:12.960
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3110
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.650
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what did he actually say?</v>

3111
02:19:14.651 --> 02:19:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3112
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:16.833
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is about the pee tape says Matthew </v>

3113
02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Yglesias voc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it from Volvo?</v>

3114
02:19:22.361 --> 02:19:26.900
<v Speaker 2>It's vox moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean a.</v>

3115
02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:29.030
<v Speaker 2>He probably didn't understand what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying.</v>

3116
02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Speaks Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3117
02:19:30.890 --> 02:19:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3118
02:19:32.510 --> 02:19:37.510
<v Speaker 2>do you find it odd that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these conspiracies not only do,</v>

3119
02:19:38.630 --> 02:19:42.860
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it's a part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mind,</v>

3120
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:44.023
<v Speaker 2>the way our brains work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our collective mindset is that we tend </v>

3121
02:19:47.781 --> 02:19:48.614
<v Speaker 2>to be attracted to conspiracies and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to hope that those or true more </v>

3122
02:19:55.251 --> 02:19:58.010
<v Speaker 2>than we hope a simple explanation </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>

3123
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3124
02:19:59.090 --> 02:19:59.923
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on who your group is and do </v>

3125
02:20:03.261 --> 02:20:04.430
<v Speaker 2>they have power or not.</v>

3126
02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:08.250
<v Speaker 2>So we know from studies that people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are out of power tend to consume,</v>

3127
02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:11.510
<v Speaker 2>can concoct conspiracy theories about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3128
02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:13.850
<v Speaker 2>those in power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the moment they get empowered,</v>

3129
02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:15.860
<v Speaker 2>they drop the conspiracy theories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that are out.</v>

3130
02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:17.413
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to get more conspiracy </v>

3131
02:20:18.681 --> 02:20:19.514
<v Speaker 2>theories about Republicans when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats are out of power from left </v>

3132
02:20:22.251 --> 02:20:23.084
<v Speaker 2>leaning people and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It blacks are more likely to think that </v>

3133
02:20:25.791 --> 02:20:28.980
<v Speaker 2>the CIA planted crack cocaine in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inner cities and,</v>

3134
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:30.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those sorts of things.</v>

3135
02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives are more likely to fear </v>
<v Speaker 2>big government conspiracies.</v>

3136
02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Liberals are more likely to fear big </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate conspiracies.</v>

3137
02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:39.230
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there may be elements of truth in all of</v>

3138
02:20:39.231 --> 02:20:40.064
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ones your latch onto have to do </v>

3139
02:20:43.161 --> 02:20:43.994
<v Speaker 2>with how much power you perceive the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other guy has that you don't have and </v>

3140
02:20:48.231 --> 02:20:50.390
<v Speaker 2>therefore they must be doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get that,</v>

3141
02:20:50.391 --> 02:20:51.320
<v Speaker 2>that I can't do.</v>

3142
02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:52.153
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the outside and so we tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>misperceive how much control and power </v>

3143
02:20:56.691 --> 02:20:59.030
<v Speaker 2>people really have in positions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

3144
02:20:59.031 --> 02:21:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Ceos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians and so on.</v>

3145
02:21:01.311 --> 02:21:06.311
<v Speaker 2>Usually they don't have as much control </v>
<v Speaker 2>and power as we think they do and people</v>

3146
02:21:06.711 --> 02:21:07.550
<v Speaker 2>that get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

3147
02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:08.413
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

3148
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:09.283
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have this kind of controller </v>

3149
02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:11.870
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I would when I got here,</v>

3150
02:21:11.871 --> 02:21:15.500
<v Speaker 2>but obviously I don't do too many things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have to do checks.</v>

3151
02:21:15.501 --> 02:21:16.334
<v Speaker 2>And balances that are in place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can't do these things on your </v>

3152
02:21:19.041 --> 02:21:19.874
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really need a group of people to </v>

3153
02:21:20.991 --> 02:21:21.824
<v Speaker 2>conspire along with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you mean to have these frank </v>

3154
02:21:23.781 --> 02:21:28.781
<v Speaker 2>discussions with some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding that you have to keep this</v>

3155
02:21:30.081 --> 02:21:31.010
<v Speaker 2>a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3156
02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Maura?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3157
02:21:33.150 --> 02:21:33.983
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 12 guys in London are going to </v>

3158
02:21:35.691 --> 02:21:36.800
<v Speaker 2>control the world's economy.</v>

3159
02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:38.480
<v Speaker 2>How are they going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3160
02:21:38.481 --> 02:21:42.710
<v Speaker 2>who do you call to start a war and cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflation or whatever.</v>

3161
02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:43.873
<v Speaker 2>More likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like in the Cuban missile crisis </v>

3162
02:21:46.011 --> 02:21:48.740
<v Speaker 2>where you have jockeying back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth,</v>

3163
02:21:48.741 --> 02:21:49.940
<v Speaker 2>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3164
02:21:49.941 --> 02:21:50.774
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to give you the missiles in </v>

3165
02:21:52.131 --> 02:21:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take the missiles out of Cuba.</v>

3166
02:21:54.441 --> 02:21:59.240
<v Speaker 2>And it just ends up being some boring </v>
<v Speaker 2>little thing that dissolves the tension.</v>

3167
02:21:59.241 --> 02:22:01.820
<v Speaker 2>That could have been world war three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like wow,</v>

3168
02:22:01.850 --> 02:22:02.683
<v Speaker 2>just this little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so much of history turns on those </v>

3169
02:22:05.541 --> 02:22:06.110
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3170
02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:09.650
<v Speaker 2>So in a way we got lucky there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not just luck.</v>

3171
02:22:09.651 --> 02:22:10.484
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy and Khrushchev both wanted to </v>

3172
02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:14.570
<v Speaker 2>untie the knot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3173
02:22:14.610 --> 02:22:15.443
<v Speaker 2>crew shift sent a memo to Kennedy saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have pulled on this rope and I have </v>

3174
02:22:19.011 --> 02:22:21.740
<v Speaker 2>pulled on this rope and I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 2>either of us can untie it,</v>

3175
02:22:21.741 --> 02:22:24.200
<v Speaker 2>but here's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when he floated the,</v>

3176
02:22:24.470 --> 02:22:25.860
<v Speaker 2>you take the out of Turkey</v>

3177
02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:27.153
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was just watching this netflix </v>

3178
02:22:28.621 --> 02:22:29.454
<v Speaker 1>documentary on this and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about Castro Santa memo to crew </v>

3179
02:22:33.051 --> 02:22:35.910
<v Speaker 1>chef saying light them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3180
02:22:35.911 --> 02:22:38.430
<v Speaker 1>comrade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are ready to die for the cause.</v>

3181
02:22:38.431 --> 02:22:41.040
<v Speaker 1>You can just nuke all of Cuba and nuke </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

3182
02:22:41.041 --> 02:22:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're ready to die.</v>

3183
02:22:42.271 --> 02:22:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And Khrushchev Khrushchev apparently was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3184
02:22:45.151 --> 02:22:46.770
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a madman.</v>

3185
02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:51.530
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's true.</v>

3186
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:53.390
<v Speaker 1>He's ready to new Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3187
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's that memo?</v>

3188
02:22:56.930 --> 02:22:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3189
02:22:57.450 --> 02:23:00.330
<v Speaker 1>they talked about this in this duck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The netflix.</v>

3190
02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:01.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3191
02:23:01.561 --> 02:23:02.394
<v Speaker 1>so this was during the times of </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation northwoods when they were </v>

3192
02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:08.500
<v Speaker 1>gonna blow up a drone jetliner and blame</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on the Cubans arm,</v>

3193
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Cuban friendlies to attack Montana Mo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bay.</v>

3194
02:23:11.281 --> 02:23:14.280
<v Speaker 1>And use it as a motivation to get us </v>
<v Speaker 1>into war.</v>

3195
02:23:14.690 --> 02:23:15.523
<v Speaker 1>That Castro is a fascinating case </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that guy kept that place 90 </v>

3196
02:23:19.231 --> 02:23:20.670
<v Speaker 1>miles away from Miami.</v>

3197
02:23:20.670 --> 02:23:24.090
<v Speaker 1>He kept that place running on his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>until he died.</v>

3198
02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:26.850
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

3199
02:23:26.851 --> 02:23:28.830
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that he was able to pull that</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

3200
02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a lot of support,</v>

3201
02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:34.740
<v Speaker 1>economic support from Russia otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would not have succeeded,</v>

3202
02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:36.113
<v Speaker 1>but still it's so nuts that he was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>close and he was running a military </v>

3203
02:23:39.751 --> 02:23:42.150
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially a boat ride away.</v>

3204
02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:43.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just in Moscow a few months ago </v>

3205
02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:47.910
<v Speaker 1>for a conference since I went to visit </v>
<v Speaker 1>their world war two museum,</v>

3206
02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:49.650
<v Speaker 1>what we would call a world war two </v>
<v Speaker 1>museum,</v>

3207
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:54.710
<v Speaker 1>just massive building it and they call </v>
<v Speaker 1>it the Great Patriotic War Museum.</v>

3208
02:23:56.100 --> 02:23:56.933
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing is kind of attribute</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Russia liberated Europe from the </v>

3209
02:24:02.050 --> 02:24:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3210
02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:05.190
<v Speaker 1>This is current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3211
02:24:05.191 --> 02:24:07.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is from their perspective,</v>

3212
02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:11.070
<v Speaker 1>they lost 27 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Americans,</v>

3213
02:24:11.071 --> 02:24:12.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500,000 nothing.</v>

3214
02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from their perspective.</v>

3215
02:24:14.831 --> 02:24:19.110
<v Speaker 1>And you go to Berlin right next to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory museum.</v>

3216
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3217
02:24:20.610 --> 02:24:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It's called the victory museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3218
02:24:22.201 --> 02:24:24.810
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Museum of the Great Patriotic War is</v>

3219
02:24:24.811 --> 02:24:25.644
<v Speaker 1>a history museum located in Muskoka yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have this room with these </v>

3220
02:24:29.881 --> 02:24:30.714
<v Speaker 1>chains hanging down with little crystal </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls at the end of them that represent </v>

3221
02:24:33.961 --> 02:24:35.820
<v Speaker 1>the 27 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

3222
02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:37.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very moving.</v>

3223
02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That right there is good.</v>

3224
02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Look how beautiful that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite stunning.</v>

3225
02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:45.270
<v Speaker 1>And each of those rooms that you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

3226
02:24:45.271 --> 02:24:48.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like a diagram of some battle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they fought.</v>

3227
02:24:49.350 --> 02:24:51.750
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good for us to know this,</v>

3228
02:24:51.751 --> 02:24:54.540
<v Speaker 1>to recognize from their perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3229
02:24:54.810 --> 02:24:56.370
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won the war,</v>

3230
02:24:56.371 --> 02:24:57.204
<v Speaker 1>not the British American and French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a little bit from their </v>

3231
02:25:00.121 --> 02:25:00.954
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they lost so many </v>

3232
02:25:03.451 --> 02:25:04.560
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>27 million.</v>

3233
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:07.860
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with that picture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

3234
02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up looking at the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird picture.</v>

3235
02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:13.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have a point in terms of </v>

3236
02:25:15.181 --> 02:25:17.880
<v Speaker 1>their contribution in terms of the loss </v>
<v Speaker 1>of lives.</v>

3237
02:25:17.970 --> 02:25:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's A.</v>

3238
02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean every country has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives in that regard,</v>

3239
02:25:22.141 --> 02:25:24.250
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's good to some history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know</v>

3240
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:26.950
<v Speaker 2>what other people are thinking and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they went through.</v>

3241
02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's again though,</v>

3242
02:25:28.181 --> 02:25:29.014
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar to what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about earlier in terms of the </v>

3243
02:25:31.691 --> 02:25:32.524
<v Speaker 2>distribution of the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be very nice if there was one </v>

3244
02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:39.580
<v Speaker 2>absolute news source you can trust with </v>
<v Speaker 2>no slant on it whatsoever.</v>

3245
02:25:39.581 --> 02:25:42.070
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to the distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

3246
02:25:42.430 --> 02:25:43.263
<v Speaker 2>it's of course always written in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that favors the people that are writing </v>

3247
02:25:47.770 --> 02:25:48.430
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3248
02:25:48.430 --> 02:25:52.540
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking to Rachel Kleinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a podcast now,</v>

3249
02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:56.670
<v Speaker 2>a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's six months now.</v>

3250
02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:58.690
<v Speaker 2>It's science salon podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3251
02:25:58.930 --> 02:26:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Well it's sort of an extension of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>old caltech lecture series,</v>

3252
02:26:03.251 --> 02:26:04.084
<v Speaker 2>but instead of lectures we're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue you called so people can see </v>

3253
02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:08.560
<v Speaker 2>science salon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science salon.</v>

3254
02:26:08.561 --> 02:26:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just skeptic.com.</v>

3255
02:26:10.031 --> 02:26:10.864
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm interviewing are dialoguing with </v>

3256
02:26:13.090 --> 02:26:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Rachel Kleinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has a new book called a savage order</v>

3257
02:26:17.310 --> 02:26:18.143
<v Speaker 2>and it's about failed states and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to them and why corruption </v>

3258
02:26:21.191 --> 02:26:22.150
<v Speaker 2>spread so quickly.</v>

3259
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.983
<v Speaker 2>And then how to basically squelch that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like after the Soviet Union fell </v>

3260
02:26:26.471 --> 02:26:27.700
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3261
02:26:27.701 --> 02:26:31.510
<v Speaker 2>all these mobs basically took over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the Russian mafia,</v>

3262
02:26:31.710 --> 02:26:35.500
<v Speaker 2>the Republic of Georgia fell apart </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly quickly and then,</v>

3263
02:26:35.501 --> 02:26:36.334
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the reasons people apparently </v>

3264
02:26:37.691 --> 02:26:39.410
<v Speaker 2>like Putin is he kind of came in and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3265
02:26:39.411 --> 02:26:41.750
<v Speaker 2>and squelched all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3266
02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:42.673
<v Speaker 2>and maybe one of his points of </v>
<v Speaker 2>popularity is that at least we have one </v>

3267
02:26:46.361 --> 02:26:47.194
<v Speaker 2>bad guy who's got kind of keeping an </v>
<v Speaker 2>order instead of all these little </v>

3268
02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:52.200
<v Speaker 2>mafioso type gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3269
02:26:52.890 --> 02:26:55.390
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if he actually held an election,</v>

3270
02:26:55.391 --> 02:26:56.490
<v Speaker 2>he might win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3271
02:26:56.530 --> 02:26:57.363
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say because we don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good source of what the Russian people </v>

3272
02:26:59.921 --> 02:27:00.754
<v Speaker 2>really like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the Russian media saying the </v>

3273
02:27:02.921 --> 02:27:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Russian people love Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3274
02:27:06.810 --> 02:27:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Do we know that's an accurate survey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Pretty astonishing.</v>

3275
02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:13.720
<v Speaker 2>What kind of a control he has over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country though?</v>

3276
02:27:14.530 --> 02:27:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's powerful.</v>

3277
02:27:16.001 --> 02:27:16.834
<v Speaker 2>I went to visit a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw Lenin's tomb and the Mazda Liam </v>

3278
02:27:18.911 --> 02:27:21.190
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still still looking pretty waxy,</v>

3279
02:27:21.250 --> 02:27:22.083
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

3280
02:27:22.330 --> 02:27:22.901
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

3281
02:27:22.901 --> 02:27:25.680
<v Speaker 2>You can actually see his body or what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

3282
02:27:25.810 --> 02:27:26.680
<v Speaker 2>His body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3283
02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:27.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's left of it yet another netflix </v>

3284
02:27:29.651 --> 02:27:31.930
<v Speaker 2>series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just binge watched Trotsky.</v>

3285
02:27:31.931 --> 02:27:35.020
<v Speaker 2>It's called Trotsky and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian made film.</v>

3286
02:27:35.021 --> 02:27:39.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a drama and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really good and it really shows.</v>

3287
02:27:39.730 --> 02:27:40.563
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trotsky was on the outs all the way </v>

3288
02:27:43.061 --> 02:27:43.894
<v Speaker 2>until just recently because Stalin had </v>
<v Speaker 2>him sas donated and then on had him </v>

3289
02:27:48.011 --> 02:27:48.844
<v Speaker 2>literally airbrushed out of photographs </v>
<v Speaker 2>because for awhile it was Lenin and </v>

3290
02:27:52.091 --> 02:27:52.924
<v Speaker 2>Stalin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trotsky is the big three and then when </v>

3291
02:27:56.261 --> 02:27:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Lenin had a stroke it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3292
02:27:58.121 --> 02:27:58.954
<v Speaker 2>so Stalin and Trotsky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to take over when the boss </v>

3293
02:28:01.931 --> 02:28:03.880
<v Speaker 2>is gone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3294
02:28:03.881 --> 02:28:05.560
<v Speaker 2>so they kind of showed how that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

3295
02:28:05.570 --> 02:28:06.910
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>

3296
02:28:06.911 --> 02:28:07.744
<v Speaker 2>It's all conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows what's really going on </v>

3297
02:28:09.791 --> 02:28:11.620
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been in this business,</v>

3298
02:28:11.650 --> 02:28:15.580
<v Speaker 2>this debunking conspiracy conspiracy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the skeptic business for quite a long</v>

3299
02:28:15.581 --> 02:28:16.414
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like there is any </v>

3300
02:28:18.730 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 2>improvement in the critical thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills of people and their ability</v>

3301
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:22.933
<v Speaker 1>to recognize the fallacies and the flaws</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way they're approaching these </v>

3302
02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:30.140
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard to say.</v>

3303
02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Confirmation bias there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less of that now than before,</v>

3304
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:38.210
<v Speaker 1>like to think we're having an influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some studies that show,</v>

3305
02:28:38.211 --> 02:28:39.044
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer people believe in these pseudo </v>

3306
02:28:40.570 --> 02:28:43.340
<v Speaker 1>sciences and quackery and paranormal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

3307
02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:47.270
<v Speaker 1>The declines are not that dramatic over </v>
<v Speaker 1>say the last few decades.</v>

3308
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:49.623
<v Speaker 1>There are deprogramming bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deprogramming studies and programs in </v>

3309
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:55.663
<v Speaker 1>which you can teach people about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias in the hindsight bias </v>

3310
02:28:57.861 --> 02:28:58.694
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with those is they work </v>

3311
02:29:00.021 --> 02:29:03.260
<v Speaker 1>really well to teach people how to spot </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biases and other people.</v>

3312
02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:05.310
<v Speaker 1>They're really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you say,</v>

3313
02:29:05.311 --> 02:29:05.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about you?</v>

3314
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunately I'm above all that.</v>

3315
02:29:09.410 --> 02:29:11.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a blind spot that's called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind spot bias.</v>

3316
02:29:11.541 --> 02:29:13.820
<v Speaker 1>You can't see your own bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see it in other people.</v>

3317
02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:15.381
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

3318
02:29:15.381 --> 02:29:16.214
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason these studies are done is </v>

3319
02:29:16.971 --> 02:29:20.000
<v Speaker 1>because we have a problem with climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

3320
02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:21.193
<v Speaker 1>We have climate deniers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we get people who don't know </v>

3321
02:29:22.851 --> 02:29:26.210
<v Speaker 1>anything about it to shift from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a skeptic too.</v>

3322
02:29:26.211 --> 02:29:27.044
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believer and it shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out just piling on facts isn't </v>

3323
02:29:31.521 --> 02:29:32.354
<v Speaker 1>going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No people's identity are trapped in </v>

3324
02:29:35.271 --> 02:29:36.104
<v Speaker 1>their initial initial statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they think that nine slash 11 was a </v>

3325
02:29:39.621 --> 02:29:40.454
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their identity is somehow inexorably </v>

3326
02:29:44.420 --> 02:29:46.850
<v Speaker 1>connected to this conspiracy being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

3327
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:50.090
<v Speaker 1>and then you argue it as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing your own value.</v>

3328
02:29:50.430 --> 02:29:54.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a really weird thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people start talking about ideas.</v>

3329
02:29:54.650 --> 02:29:56.630
<v Speaker 1>If the you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3330
02:29:56.640 --> 02:29:57.473
<v Speaker 1>you've very rarely find people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>disconnected from their ideas to the </v>

3331
02:30:01.041 --> 02:30:03.830
<v Speaker 1>point where you could point out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something's incorrect and they go,</v>

3332
02:30:03.890 --> 02:30:05.030
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

3333
02:30:05.031 --> 02:30:05.864
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

3334
02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Like most people aren't really that </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident now,</v>

3335
02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:12.710
<v Speaker 1>or are they just look at it the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a personal attack on them.</v>

3336
02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Also as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3337
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:14.323
<v Speaker 1>if it's a belief or claim or theory or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever affiliated with a political or </v>

3338
02:30:17.961 --> 02:30:18.794
<v Speaker 1>moral or religious value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people autocorrect in their brains </v>

3339
02:30:23.331 --> 02:30:26.090
<v Speaker 1>when they hear global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hear liberalism,</v>

3340
02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:28.010
<v Speaker 1>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>

3341
02:30:28.011 --> 02:30:29.960
<v Speaker 1>control of the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big government.</v>

3342
02:30:29.961 --> 02:30:33.440
<v Speaker 1>And I'm against those things so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>global warming things got to be faults.</v>

3343
02:30:34.100 --> 02:30:36.890
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the weirder aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribal thinking,</v>

3344
02:30:36.891 --> 02:30:38.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pink or makes the point that,</v>

3345
02:30:38.811 --> 02:30:40.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Gore's film an inconvenient truth was</v>

3346
02:30:40.971 --> 02:30:41.804
<v Speaker 1>a terrible thing for the environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement because at associated global </v>

3347
02:30:44.241 --> 02:30:48.770
<v Speaker 1>climate change with liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats and all that,</v>

3348
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:49.461
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3349
02:30:49.461 --> 02:30:51.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what's going on.</v>

3350
02:30:51.411 --> 02:30:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It's that Al Gore left liberal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3351
02:30:55.130 --> 02:30:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in,</v>

3352
02:30:57.040 --> 02:30:58.400
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense he's right.</v>

3353
02:30:58.460 --> 02:30:59.293
<v Speaker 1>And then in another sense it was also </v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of profit that alcor made </v>

3354
02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:04.800
<v Speaker 1>both from that and from some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavors that he has.</v>

3355
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:07.310
<v Speaker 1>They said that he's one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>green billionaires.</v>

3356
02:31:08.010 --> 02:31:09.380
<v Speaker 1>So God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

3357
02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:14.690
<v Speaker 1>what's his carbon footprint is around a </v>
<v Speaker 1>private jet everywhere.</v>

3358
02:31:14.691 --> 02:31:16.350
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3359
02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:18.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's screwy.</v>

3360
02:31:18.220 --> 02:31:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

3361
02:31:19.940 --> 02:31:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3362
02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:22.410
<v Speaker 1>everything's messy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are messy,</v>

3363
02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:24.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're very tribal.</v>

3364
02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:25.913
<v Speaker 1>We commit to political parties or </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious beliefs and we stick by them </v>

3365
02:31:28.681 --> 02:31:30.930
<v Speaker 1>pretty closely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty tightly.</v>

3366
02:31:31.650 --> 02:31:34.080
<v Speaker 1>And the facts get filtered through </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

3367
02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Understandably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3368
02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:37.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do about it,</v>

3369
02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3370
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.340
<v Speaker 1>that's under debate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with the atheist debating.</v>

3371
02:31:41.341 --> 02:31:44.510
<v Speaker 1>How do we get people to leave religion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3372
02:31:44.850 --> 02:31:48.840
<v Speaker 1>just there's 100 ways you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leah Remini on her show on scientology.</v>

3373
02:31:49.290 --> 02:31:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Anyone watching that would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3374
02:31:51.121 --> 02:31:51.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joining this church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you had a thousand of those </v>

3375
02:31:54.931 --> 02:31:58.290
<v Speaker 1>for bad beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we see that shift.</v>

3376
02:31:58.650 --> 02:32:03.390
<v Speaker 1>I would love it if there was some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a secular option of community driven,</v>

3377
02:32:03.450 --> 02:32:04.283
<v Speaker 1>ethics driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality driven friendship driven thing </v>

3378
02:32:08.791 --> 02:32:11.550
<v Speaker 1>where people could go and instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>worship,</v>

3379
02:32:11.610 --> 02:32:16.610
<v Speaker 1>maybe just appreciate life and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirm some of the best aspects of,</v>

3380
02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:20.063
<v Speaker 1>of community and culture and who we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do it in a place where it makes you </v>

3381
02:32:23.281 --> 02:32:25.440
<v Speaker 1>really conscious of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because I think there's,</v>

3382
02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:26.573
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some real benefit to people going to </v>

3383
02:32:28.801 --> 02:32:29.634
<v Speaker 1>church and everyone in the community </v>
<v Speaker 1>community dresses up nice and you sort </v>

3384
02:32:33.631 --> 02:32:34.470
<v Speaker 1>of agreeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3385
02:32:34.471 --> 02:32:35.304
<v Speaker 1>we're committed to being civil and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being kind and to worshiping and that </v>

3386
02:32:39.571 --> 02:32:42.890
<v Speaker 1>this belief in a higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it it,</v>

3387
02:32:42.910 --> 02:32:46.350
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it empowers people to think this way and</v>

3388
02:32:46.351 --> 02:32:47.184
<v Speaker 1>it gives people a motivation to be kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be nice if there was a </v>

3389
02:32:51.031 --> 02:32:53.700
<v Speaker 1>secular option like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is decentralized.</v>

3390
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:54.743
<v Speaker 1>It's not run by one person who winds up </v>
<v Speaker 1>banging everybody's wife and taken all </v>

3391
02:32:57.511 --> 02:32:59.560
<v Speaker 1>the money because that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always happens.</v>

3392
02:33:00.060 --> 02:33:02.850
<v Speaker 1>You can set your clock by these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

3393
02:33:04.220 --> 02:33:06.090
<v Speaker 1>The humanist movement is something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3394
02:33:06.180 --> 02:33:07.013
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not aware of secular humanist or </v>

3395
02:33:08.161 --> 02:33:08.994
<v Speaker 1>just humanists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's groups all over the world have </v>

3396
02:33:10.891 --> 02:33:12.060
<v Speaker 1>churches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3397
02:33:12.061 --> 02:33:14.100
<v Speaker 1>they have meeting places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would call them churches,</v>

3398
02:33:14.460 --> 02:33:15.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more broadly.</v>

3399
02:33:15.361 --> 02:33:19.740
<v Speaker 1>The kind of universalist unitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>church is a church and it's a religion,</v>

3400
02:33:19.741 --> 02:33:22.590
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty secular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like secular Jews,</v>

3401
02:33:22.591 --> 02:33:25.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believe in the culture and the,</v>

3402
02:33:25.470 --> 02:33:26.303
<v Speaker 1>and the ceremonies and the rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to a number of these humanist </v>

3403
02:33:29.191 --> 02:33:32.610
<v Speaker 1>and universalist unitarian churches </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceremonies.</v>

3404
02:33:32.611 --> 02:33:35.220
<v Speaker 1>They light candles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sing hymns to Newton.</v>

3405
02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:36.513
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have testimonials about how I lost </v>

3406
02:33:37.951 --> 02:33:40.290
<v Speaker 1>my religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>

3407
02:33:40.291 --> 02:33:41.124
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really like it that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was never crazy about church </v>

3408
02:33:43.351 --> 02:33:44.184
<v Speaker 1>in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people clearly get value </v>

3409
02:33:46.111 --> 02:33:50.850
<v Speaker 1>out of this atheists and humanists that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe in God.</v>

3410
02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:56.480
<v Speaker 1>The gathering together once a week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being with fellow likeminded people that</v>

3411
02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:01.590
<v Speaker 1>has a lot of psychological value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It connects people and that's one of the</v>

3412
02:34:01.591 --> 02:34:03.750
<v Speaker 1>great things about community centers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods,</v>

3413
02:34:03.751 --> 02:34:05.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just connects people and like,</v>

3414
02:34:05.521 --> 02:34:06.690
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all in this together.</v>

3415
02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:07.621
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob,</v>

3416
02:34:07.621 --> 02:34:10.230
<v Speaker 1>see you tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bye Mary social capital.</v>

3417
02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:11.453
<v Speaker 1>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something great about that with </v>

3418
02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:14.153
<v Speaker 1>Church that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was having this conversation </v>

3419
02:34:16.261 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 1>with bill burr about this recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking</v>

3420
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:20.530
<v Speaker 2>about it and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really want to go to church,</v>

3421
02:34:20.531 --> 02:34:24.100
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to that to go into a place and</v>

3422
02:34:24.730 --> 02:34:28.310
<v Speaker 2>putting your faith in all the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you and the,</v>

3423
02:34:28.311 --> 02:34:28.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3424
02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:33.240
<v Speaker 2>the higher values and morals and ethics </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're all agreeing to,</v>

3425
02:34:33.250 --> 02:34:34.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3426
02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:36.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's back to the self help thing is sort</v>

3427
02:34:36.791 --> 02:34:39.490
<v Speaker 2>of a reminder every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be a good person.</v>

3428
02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget to donate to charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's some local charities here.</v>

3429
02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:45.040
<v Speaker 2>These are our causes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Good,</v>

3430
02:34:45.430 --> 02:34:48.040
<v Speaker 2>be good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be nice to your spouse and your children</v>

3431
02:34:48.041 --> 02:34:48.874
<v Speaker 2>is on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people kind of leave a little </v>

3432
02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:52.990
<v Speaker 2>charged up for the week on Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to Monday.</v>

3433
02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:55.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably the main draw of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those big Tony Robbins things too.</v>

3434
02:34:56.380 --> 02:34:58.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a community of us together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all trying to do better.</v>

3435
02:34:59.050 --> 02:35:02.020
<v Speaker 2>We're all trying to better ourselves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimize our lives.</v>

3436
02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:03.280
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with it.</v>

3437
02:35:03.281 --> 02:35:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back to Jordan Peterson.</v>

3438
02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:05.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3439
02:35:05.650 --> 02:35:07.600
<v Speaker 2>he's given a message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like to hear that.</v>

3440
02:35:07.601 --> 02:35:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And okay.</v>

3441
02:35:08.921 --> 02:35:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that bad?</v>

3442
02:35:10.750 --> 02:35:11.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3443
02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Now of course people like Richard </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins will point out,</v>

3444
02:35:14.231 --> 02:35:14.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3445
02:35:14.590 --> 02:35:19.570
<v Speaker 2>but can we decouple all the supernatural</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense from the social community?</v>

3446
02:35:19.571 --> 02:35:20.404
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>

3447
02:35:20.890 --> 02:35:21.723
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that there's less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's less of an acceptance of the </v>

3448
02:35:24.281 --> 02:35:27.460
<v Speaker 2>supernatural nonsense than there was 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

3449
02:35:27.461 --> 02:35:29.410
<v Speaker 2>100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to be a trend.</v>

3450
02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Those members are getting bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secularism.</v>

3451
02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:32.613
<v Speaker 2>The number of the percentage of nones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people tick the box for no religious </v>

3452
02:35:35.021 --> 02:35:36.270
<v Speaker 2>affiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3453
02:35:36.490 --> 02:35:39.730
<v Speaker 2>that used to be in the single digits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's now 25 percent of all Americans.</v>

3454
02:35:39.731 --> 02:35:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Thirty three percent of millennials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those born after 1991.</v>

3455
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:44.343
<v Speaker 2>And it looks like probably with </v>
<v Speaker 2>identities can be closer to 50 percent </v>

3456
02:35:46.631 --> 02:35:48.160
<v Speaker 2>people born after 1995.</v>

3457
02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Now they're not necessarily atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agnostics,</v>

3458
02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:52.174
<v Speaker 2>skeptics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't affiliate with any </v>

3459
02:35:53.561 --> 02:35:54.394
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's good because in the sense </v>

3460
02:35:57.281 --> 02:35:58.120
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3461
02:35:58.580 --> 02:35:59.413
<v Speaker 2>it's religious behavior that causes some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these social problems that we are </v>

3462
02:36:03.430 --> 02:36:05.500
<v Speaker 2>encountering now with Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>

3463
02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3464
02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:10.720
<v Speaker 2>so if somebody privately believes in God</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever and they don't act on it,</v>

3465
02:36:10.930 --> 02:36:12.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I don't care.</v>

3466
02:36:12.460 --> 02:36:13.293
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the acting on your beliefs that </v>

3467
02:36:14.591 --> 02:36:15.780
<v Speaker 2>causes the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3468
02:36:15.781 --> 02:36:17.680
<v Speaker 2>when you enforce those beliefs on other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3469
02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:20.380
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it spills over into politics,</v>

3470
02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:22.360
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science education,</v>

3471
02:36:22.361 --> 02:36:23.140
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3472
02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:23.973
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the real problems they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>having in Europe when they're dealing </v>

3473
02:36:25.721 --> 02:36:26.554
<v Speaker 2>with people that are coming over from </v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries where they have a </v>

3474
02:36:28.481 --> 02:36:29.314
<v Speaker 2>different set of values and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing women in skirts and they're </v>

3475
02:36:30.971 --> 02:36:33.430
<v Speaker 2>calling them whores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

3476
02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:35.000
<v Speaker 2>You're in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3477
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Different set of rules over here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

3478
02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:42.850
<v Speaker 2>You won't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they think that God has,</v>

3479
02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:43.713
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God has dictated these rules are in </v>

3480
02:36:45.541 --> 02:36:47.470
<v Speaker 2>their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're seeing some horrible sin.</v>

3481
02:36:47.471 --> 02:36:50.800
<v Speaker 2>They're seeing the decay of the moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiber,</v>

3482
02:36:50.830 --> 02:36:55.240
<v Speaker 2>the moral fiber of their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are primitive beliefs having to do</v>

3483
02:36:55.241 --> 02:36:59.050
<v Speaker 2>with men wanting to control women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproductive rights.</v>

3484
02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:03.510
<v Speaker 2>There's evolutionary reasons for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had Brett and heather on here.</v>

3485
02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:06.130
<v Speaker 2>They get explained that beautifully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3486
02:37:06.270 --> 02:37:07.103
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we have to overcome that just </v>

3487
02:37:08.111 --> 02:37:08.944
<v Speaker 2>because it's an evolved tendency for men</v>
<v Speaker 2>to want to control women's reproduction </v>

3488
02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:14.740
<v Speaker 2>a doesn't mean we should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The opposite.</v>

3489
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3490
02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:17.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I make the case,</v>

3491
02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:20.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my scientific American columns on</v>

3492
02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:21.510
<v Speaker 2>abortion that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3493
02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:25.380
<v Speaker 2>if our mutual goal between pro lifers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and protracer is,</v>

3494
02:37:25.381 --> 02:37:28.970
<v Speaker 2>is to reduce the amount of abortions we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know the formula,</v>

3495
02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.730
<v Speaker 2>educate women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>empower women versus control,</v>

3496
02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:33.950
<v Speaker 2>birth control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to birth control,</v>

3497
02:37:34.310 --> 02:37:34.850
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

3498
02:37:34.850 --> 02:37:38.180
<v Speaker 2>It just happens automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pregnancy rates go down,</v>

3499
02:37:38.181 --> 02:37:40.010
<v Speaker 2>therefore abortion rates are going to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3500
02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:41.320
<v Speaker 2>We know how this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3501
02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:44.630
<v Speaker 2>do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still people that pro lifers,</v>

3502
02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:46.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start a glom on to it,</v>

3503
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's a moral issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

3504
02:37:48.771 --> 02:37:49.604
<v Speaker 2>Take the moral out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand it's a human life or </v>

3505
02:37:51.381 --> 02:37:53.030
<v Speaker 2>potential human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whatever you want to argue.</v>

3506
02:37:53.031 --> 02:37:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I get on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take that out.</v>

3507
02:37:54.860 --> 02:37:55.693
<v Speaker 2>Let's just work to the common goal of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reducing the number of unwanted </v>

3508
02:37:58.341 --> 02:37:59.174
<v Speaker 2>pregnancies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My favorite one that still exists is </v>

3509
02:38:01.431 --> 02:38:02.264
<v Speaker 2>abstinence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they're trying to push </v>

3510
02:38:03.951 --> 02:38:06.290
<v Speaker 2>this on these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially when you.</v>

3511
02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Especially we're talking about really </v>
<v Speaker 2>young people that are just getting horny</v>

3512
02:38:09.831 --> 02:38:10.700
<v Speaker 2>for the first time.</v>

3513
02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:12.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're on drugs.</v>

3514
02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:13.733
<v Speaker 3>Just say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you talking about you take the </v>

3515
02:38:16.741 --> 02:38:20.100
<v Speaker 3>average 17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 year old kids and you try to get them</v>

3516
02:38:20.101 --> 02:38:20.934
<v Speaker 3>together and no one's in the room and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're aging raging with hormones and </v>

3517
02:38:25.921 --> 02:38:28.020
<v Speaker 3>they're both supposed to keep their </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes on like,</v>

3518
02:38:28.021 --> 02:38:28.854
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3519
02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:32.070
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not going to happen.</v>

3520
02:38:32.071 --> 02:38:32.904
<v Speaker 3>You've got to let that go and this idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to tell them that God </v>

3521
02:38:35.521 --> 02:38:38.160
<v Speaker 3>wants them to be abstinent like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you sure?</v>

3522
02:38:38.670 --> 02:38:40.770
<v Speaker 3>Why did he give us these goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones?</v>

3523
02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:42.180
<v Speaker 3>What's happening here?</v>

3524
02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:43.453
<v Speaker 2>There studies on how effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstinence only programs or chastity </v>

3525
02:38:46.341 --> 02:38:48.340
<v Speaker 2>pledges and these sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how effective.</v>

3526
02:38:48.570 --> 02:38:49.403
<v Speaker 2>Not only are they not effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're worse because then people go </v>

3527
02:38:52.101 --> 02:38:55.700
<v Speaker 2>into like a date or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unprepared band,</v>

3528
02:38:55.701 --> 02:38:56.534
<v Speaker 2>the hormones kick in and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>going at it and then they don't have </v>

3529
02:38:59.631 --> 02:39:01.340
<v Speaker 2>protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3530
02:39:01.341 --> 02:39:02.930
<v Speaker 2>there's also the thing where</v>

3531
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Catholic schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I was a kid,</v>

3532
02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:10.400
<v Speaker 3>we always knew and like this is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about in the eighties,</v>

3533
02:39:10.730 --> 02:39:13.430
<v Speaker 3>everyone knew the girls who went to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>

3534
02:39:13.431 --> 02:39:14.264
<v Speaker 3>Catholic schools were freaks because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were never around boys because </v>

3535
02:39:18.050 --> 02:39:20.540
<v Speaker 3>they're all in just this school with </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls with they end there.</v>

3536
02:39:20.541 --> 02:39:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Everything is suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suppress,</v>

3537
02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:23.120
<v Speaker 3>suppress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suppress.</v>

3538
02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:27.560
<v Speaker 3>They just can't wait to get out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They find a boy and they go crazy.</v>

3539
02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3540
02:39:29.481 --> 02:39:30.314
<v Speaker 3>this is not something that I knew as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian or as a person who studies </v>

3541
02:39:33.081 --> 02:39:33.914
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something I knew as a 14 year </v>

3542
02:39:35.481 --> 02:39:38.810
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knew that girls who went to all</v>

3543
02:39:38.811 --> 02:39:41.540
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all girl Catholic schools were freaks,</v>

3544
02:39:41.570 --> 02:39:42.403
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just as the opposite intended </v>

3545
02:39:44.091 --> 02:39:44.924
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

3546
02:39:45.010 --> 02:39:45.843
<v Speaker 2>There was a study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a British study I found that found some </v>

3547
02:39:48.610 --> 02:39:49.443
<v Speaker 2>small part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like one and a half percent or </v>

3548
02:39:50.261 --> 02:39:54.790
<v Speaker 2>whatever of 10,000 women who said they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got pregnant without having sex.</v>

3549
02:39:55.140 --> 02:39:55.973
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>

3550
02:39:56.130 --> 02:39:57.610
<v Speaker 2>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that happen?</v>

3551
02:39:57.611 --> 02:40:01.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So immaculate conception.</v>

3552
02:40:01.271 --> 02:40:02.880
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

3553
02:40:02.890 --> 02:40:04.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or they do everything but.</v>

3554
02:40:05.350 --> 02:40:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Or they had anal or whatever and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3555
02:40:06.971 --> 02:40:08.160
<v Speaker 2>we didn't actually have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3556
02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:09.011
<v Speaker 2>like Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3557
02:40:09.011 --> 02:40:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by sex?</v>

3558
02:40:10.661 --> 02:40:14.080
<v Speaker 2>And have sexual as soon as he</v>

3559
02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:14.953
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not have sexual relations with </v>

3560
02:40:16.861 --> 02:40:19.980
<v Speaker 3>that woman is landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sex is intercourse,</v>

3561
02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:20.910
<v Speaker 3>penis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vagina.</v>

3562
02:40:20.911 --> 02:40:23.160
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything else is just hanging out.</v>

3563
02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:27.420
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3564
02:40:27.540 --> 02:40:29.100
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3565
02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:32.550
<v Speaker 3>the need for belief systems is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>

3566
02:40:32.730 --> 02:40:33.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3567
02:40:33.581 --> 02:40:34.414
<v Speaker 3>it helps people to have belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're positive and they're </v>

3568
02:40:36.871 --> 02:40:38.860
<v Speaker 3>objective and their well-reasoned in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3569
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:43.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are backed by facts and knowledge.</v>

3570
02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:44.513
<v Speaker 3>It helps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the need for belief systems is so </v>

3571
02:40:47.401 --> 02:40:51.960
<v Speaker 3>strong that will take a belief system </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's wonky because.</v>

3572
02:40:51.961 --> 02:40:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Because we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have that desire.</v>

3573
02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3574
02:40:55.171 --> 02:40:56.004
<v Speaker 2>The brain abhors a vacuum of belief is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I put it in and something's </v>

3575
02:41:00.711 --> 02:41:01.544
<v Speaker 2>going to be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's try to put in those brains </v>

3576
02:41:03.481 --> 02:41:07.890
<v Speaker 2>rational science based values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we had those,</v>

3577
02:41:07.891 --> 02:41:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanist values that,</v>

3578
02:41:09.181 --> 02:41:11.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the humanist movement is now about a,</v>

3579
02:41:11.061 --> 02:41:15.630
<v Speaker 2>sent almost a century old universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>human rights.</v>

3580
02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3581
02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:19.950
<v Speaker 2>the Universal Human Rights Declaration </v>
<v Speaker 2>just celebrated its 50th anniversary.</v>

3582
02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:22.080
<v Speaker 2>You can get diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do agree.</v>

3583
02:41:22.730 --> 02:41:23.563
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to have the correct </v>

3584
02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:26.600
<v Speaker 2>philosophical arguments to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3585
02:41:26.610 --> 02:41:28.890
<v Speaker 2>just everybody should be treated equally</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the law.</v>

3586
02:41:28.891 --> 02:41:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Can we at least agree on that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3587
02:41:30.571 --> 02:41:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3588
02:41:31.830 --> 02:41:32.663
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you start off with pinker makes this </v>

3589
02:41:33.751 --> 02:41:36.930
<v Speaker 2>point lightened manal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start off with Jesus died for our</v>

3590
02:41:36.931 --> 02:41:37.764
<v Speaker 2>sins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most important value built </v>

3591
02:41:39.380 --> 02:41:40.213
<v Speaker 2>value to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get agreement in a </v>

3592
02:41:41.491 --> 02:41:42.324
<v Speaker 2>room full of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3593
02:41:42.430 --> 02:41:43.263
<v Speaker 2>UN diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to start with something super </v>

3594
02:41:45.961 --> 02:41:49.560
<v Speaker 2>basic and general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's deserves equal rights.</v>

3595
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3596
02:41:50.250 --> 02:41:52.470
<v Speaker 2>And then you start to build from there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can do that.</v>

3597
02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:53.873
<v Speaker 3>Do you find you've been in this for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time and you've done some really </v>

3598
02:41:56.551 --> 02:41:57.730
<v Speaker 3>valuable work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been,</v>

3599
02:41:57.740 --> 02:41:58.573
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so nice that there's someone like </v>

3600
02:42:00.031 --> 02:42:04.860
<v Speaker 3>you that really has dedicated their life</v>
<v Speaker 3>to really illuminating truth,</v>

3601
02:42:04.890 --> 02:42:07.200
<v Speaker 3>exposing all the flaws and people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>

3602
02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.710
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like the reception of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is you're,</v>

3603
02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:15.600
<v Speaker 3>it's easier now or there's momentum </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind this kind of thinking?</v>

3604
02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3605
02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:19.200
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more open Po,</v>

3606
02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:21.450
<v Speaker 2>po part of my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a distorted view.</v>

3607
02:42:21.451 --> 02:42:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm from California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in southern California.</v>

3608
02:42:23.731 --> 02:42:24.564
<v Speaker 2>We're pretty liberal society here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm empathetic to people that write </v>

3609
02:42:27.721 --> 02:42:30.870
<v Speaker 2>me from Oklahoma or Arkansas and I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this little town.</v>

3610
02:42:30.871 --> 02:42:31.704
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only question is which Christian </v>

3611
02:42:33.331 --> 02:42:37.850
<v Speaker 2>church do you go to the Baptist or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presbytarian and you know,</v>

3612
02:42:37.890 --> 02:42:38.723
<v Speaker 2>everyone in his family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone at work is a believer and he's </v>

3613
02:42:41.521 --> 02:42:42.650
<v Speaker 2>an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

3614
02:42:42.690 --> 02:42:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't faced anything like that,</v>

3615
02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a middle aged white guy,</v>

3616
02:42:46.830 --> 02:42:47.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3617
02:42:47.730 --> 02:42:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I do have white privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3618
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I,</v>

3619
02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:52.453
<v Speaker 2>I am sympathetic to others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think across the board things </v>

3620
02:42:55.651 --> 02:42:57.330
<v Speaker 2>are more tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3621
02:42:57.331 --> 02:43:00.900
<v Speaker 2>we know this from studies on interracial</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage,</v>

3622
02:43:00.901 --> 02:43:02.910
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even an issue anymore.</v>

3623
02:43:02.911 --> 02:43:05.250
<v Speaker 2>The gay rights thing has changed very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly.</v>

3624
02:43:05.251 --> 02:43:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was stunning.</v>

3625
02:43:06.811 --> 02:43:09.570
<v Speaker 2>How quickly social attitudes changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the.</v>

3626
02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to remember in 2:13,</v>

3627
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton was still saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't believe in gay marriage.</v>

3628
02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Is there any standout because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political position.</v>

3629
02:43:16.631 --> 02:43:17.464
<v Speaker 2>That's right now Obama in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you never know when a </v>

3630
02:43:18.971 --> 02:43:21.730
<v Speaker 2>politician says live of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3631
02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:22.690
<v Speaker 2>but now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3632
02:43:22.750 --> 02:43:23.710
<v Speaker 2>so I predict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3633
02:43:23.711 --> 02:43:24.544
<v Speaker 2>like the gay marriage thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this no one will even be talking about </v>

3634
02:43:26.561 --> 02:43:27.394
<v Speaker 2>it in another year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll change so quickly and so across </v>

3635
02:43:30.251 --> 02:43:32.440
<v Speaker 2>the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the acceptance now of atheist,</v>

3636
02:43:32.590 --> 02:43:33.860
<v Speaker 2>humanist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secularists,</v>

3637
02:43:34.390 --> 02:43:36.130
<v Speaker 2>agnostics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever is become much,</v>

3638
02:43:36.340 --> 02:43:39.350
<v Speaker 2>much better in most places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still set,</v>

3639
02:43:39.380 --> 02:43:40.213
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic countries where not only would </v>

3640
02:43:42.671 --> 02:43:43.504
<v Speaker 2>they burn me and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd burned Catholics because they </v>

3641
02:43:45.761 --> 02:43:48.010
<v Speaker 2>picked the wrong religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's still that.</v>

3642
02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:48.873
<v Speaker 2>But I wonder if there's some improvement</v>
<v Speaker 2>there in those countries because the </v>

3643
02:43:50.921 --> 02:43:51.754
<v Speaker 2>Internet with younger people when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being exposed to these new </v>

3644
02:43:53.501 --> 02:43:55.420
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a,</v>

3645
02:43:55.421 --> 02:43:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure on that data.</v>

3646
02:43:57.050 --> 02:44:00.130
<v Speaker 2>The last time I saw a big pole was on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3647
02:44:00.190 --> 02:44:03.700
<v Speaker 2>how supportive you would be of Sharia </v>
<v Speaker 2>Law and these are pretty scary,</v>

3648
02:44:03.701 --> 02:44:04.534
<v Speaker 2>like a third to a half of Muslims living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Muslim countries that they would </v>

3649
02:44:07.841 --> 02:44:10.570
<v Speaker 2>support Sharia law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at Tria laws,</v>

3650
02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:11.691
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3651
02:44:11.691 --> 02:44:12.524
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty scary for very anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic liberal attitudes about </v>

3652
02:44:17.141 --> 02:44:20.470
<v Speaker 2>rights and women and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>

3653
02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:21.513
<v Speaker 2>I think the prediction would be yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a millennials and igeneration when they </v>

3654
02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:28.420
<v Speaker 2>get into power than maybe not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>political power,</v>

3655
02:44:28.421 --> 02:44:31.210
<v Speaker 2>but like controlling talk shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio shows,</v>

3656
02:44:31.211 --> 02:44:32.200
<v Speaker 2>tv shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scripts,</v>

3657
02:44:32.201 --> 02:44:33.430
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most,</v>

3658
02:44:33.431 --> 02:44:34.264
<v Speaker 2>I think most moral change happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's minds from inculcating it from </v>

3659
02:44:38.141 --> 02:44:41.590
<v Speaker 2>culture pop culture of just how you talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about other people.</v>

3660
02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:44.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Dawkins makes this point that you can</v>

3661
02:44:44.531 --> 02:44:47.410
<v Speaker 2>tell pretty much down to the decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3662
02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:48.453
<v Speaker 2>when a book was written by the way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about when like a novel talk about </v>

3663
02:44:51.791 --> 02:44:54.100
<v Speaker 2>women or blacks or whatever going back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a century,</v>

3664
02:44:54.101 --> 02:44:54.934
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was 19 thirties the way </v>

3665
02:44:56.051 --> 02:44:57.160
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about Jews.</v>

3666
02:44:58.510 --> 02:45:01.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's the kind of thing that shifts</v>
<v Speaker 2>very slowly,</v>

3667
02:45:01.270 --> 02:45:04.570
<v Speaker 2>you hardly notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from people like you comedians,</v>

3668
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:05.703
<v Speaker 2>you tell certain jokes or you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things and it becomes more </v>

3669
02:45:07.661 --> 02:45:12.661
<v Speaker 2>acceptable scripts for television shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>and films and all of us kind of watch it</v>

3670
02:45:13.721 --> 02:45:15.340
<v Speaker 2>and absorb it and just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3671
02:45:15.341 --> 02:45:16.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't be saying those kinds of </v>

3672
02:45:17.171 --> 02:45:19.210
<v Speaker 2>things about women and Jews and blacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

3673
02:45:19.570 --> 02:45:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Stopped doing that and that consciously </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of soak it in.</v>

3674
02:45:23.890 --> 02:45:24.723
<v Speaker 2>So I think you still need laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to sometimes change the law and </v>

3675
02:45:27.671 --> 02:45:28.271
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3676
02:45:28.271 --> 02:45:31.360
<v Speaker 2>it's now illegal to discriminate against</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews or whatever.</v>

3677
02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:34.450
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People may still want to do that.</v>

3678
02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:36.250
<v Speaker 2>How do we change their thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3679
02:45:36.251 --> 02:45:40.300
<v Speaker 2>if that's the bottom of thing that takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>the course of decades or maybe a century</v>

3680
02:45:40.450 --> 02:45:41.283
<v Speaker 2>and it takes generations sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the new young kids have to see </v>

3681
02:45:43.631 --> 02:45:45.990
<v Speaker 2>the flaws in the way their parents are </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and,</v>

3682
02:45:46.020 --> 02:45:46.853
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have access to this information and </v>

3683
02:45:49.180 --> 02:45:50.890
<v Speaker 2>form their own opinions on these things.</v>

3684
02:45:50.890 --> 02:45:51.723
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully bakes based on objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning and reality and and all the </v>

3685
02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:56.793
<v Speaker 2>awesome stuff that's available now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My stepdad was in the Pacific war and </v>

3686
02:46:01.361 --> 02:46:03.240
<v Speaker 2>the way he talked about Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3687
02:46:03.380 --> 02:46:07.840
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid and the 60th and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time I became an adult,</v>

3688
02:46:07.841 --> 02:46:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>

3689
02:46:08.650 --> 02:46:10.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't say the stuff.</v>

3690
02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't say it out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And think about 1947 to 1960.</v>

3691
02:46:13.971 --> 02:46:16.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a tiny period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3692
02:46:16.250 --> 02:46:17.440
<v Speaker 2>It's so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3693
02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3694
02:46:19.371 --> 02:46:21.260
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about the early two </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands,</v>

3695
02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:23.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if World War Two happened during</v>

3696
02:46:23.541 --> 02:46:25.620
<v Speaker 2>the early two thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3697
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

3698
02:46:26.631 --> 02:46:30.290
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to put it into perspective.</v>

3699
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I think pop culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>

3700
02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:35.540
<v Speaker 2>social media and so on is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to accelerate moral progress.</v>

3701
02:46:35.541 --> 02:46:36.374
<v Speaker 2>It'll happen faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it happened faster for women than </v>

3702
02:46:38.481 --> 02:46:39.380
<v Speaker 2>it did for blacks.</v>

3703
02:46:39.380 --> 02:46:41.570
<v Speaker 2>It happened faster for gays and it did </v>
<v Speaker 2>for women,</v>

3704
02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:43.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe whatever's next animal rights or </v>

3705
02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:46.940
<v Speaker 2>something like this will accelerate even</v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

3706
02:46:46.950 --> 02:46:47.783
<v Speaker 2>Maybe trans rights or something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the push back against this idea that we </v>

3707
02:46:51.111 --> 02:46:54.290
<v Speaker 2>are living in the safest time ever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is an absolute trend,</v>

3708
02:46:54.291 --> 02:46:57.080
<v Speaker 2>like pinker gets criticized about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people say,</v>

3709
02:46:57.081 --> 02:46:57.914
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is still not safe for these </v>

3710
02:46:59.181 --> 02:47:00.014
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this,</v>

3711
02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:01.640
<v Speaker 2>for this group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that group,</v>

3712
02:47:01.641 --> 02:47:05.470
<v Speaker 2>and for you saying that the world is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just shows your white privilege,</v>

3713
02:47:06.170 --> 02:47:10.070
<v Speaker 2>white male perspective and I'm on board </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3714
02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:12.080
<v Speaker 2>with Steve All across the board on these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3715
02:47:12.081 --> 02:47:12.914
<v Speaker 2>He's got the data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the question you're </v>

3716
02:47:14.661 --> 02:47:15.500
<v Speaker 2>asking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3717
02:47:15.501 --> 02:47:17.150
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3718
02:47:17.151 --> 02:47:18.840
<v Speaker 2>but my life is not better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3719
02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:20.780
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

3720
02:47:20.781 --> 02:47:22.370
<v Speaker 2>is society getting better?</v>

3721
02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:24.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course there's ups and downs and this</v>

3722
02:47:24.591 --> 02:47:27.050
<v Speaker 2>group is doing better than that group </v>
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>

3723
02:47:27.051 --> 02:47:29.150
<v Speaker 2>there's still some racial discrimination</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>

3724
02:47:29.151 --> 02:47:32.120
<v Speaker 2>there's still clearly antisemites as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen recently,</v>

3725
02:47:33.170 --> 02:47:36.320
<v Speaker 2>but across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take like the last 200 years,</v>

3726
02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:38.750
<v Speaker 2>which direction are the trend lines </v>
<v Speaker 2>going?</v>

3727
02:47:38.751 --> 02:47:40.220
<v Speaker 2>They're all going in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

3728
02:47:41.150 --> 02:47:42.350
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its scale.</v>

3729
02:47:42.351 --> 02:47:44.420
<v Speaker 2>The question is what's the scale we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about?</v>

3730
02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:46.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little unfair to pinker to say,</v>

3731
02:47:46.851 --> 02:47:48.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're blind to that thing over.</v>

3732
02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:50.710
<v Speaker 2>He's not talking about that one thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3733
02:47:50.940 --> 02:47:52.670
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about just across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>board.</v>

3734
02:47:53.090 --> 02:47:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3735
02:47:54.980 --> 02:47:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>
