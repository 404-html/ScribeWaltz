<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

10
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.640
<v Speaker 1>this is my version of the songs by the way,</v>

11
00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:11.290
<v Speaker 1>when I covered so many songs I just,</v>

12
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I just Kinda do what I think it is.</v>

13
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>That song was a song that I liked the first few times and it came out.</v>

14
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was interesting because I'd never heard a song like that and um,</v>

15
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.473
<v Speaker 1>I kind of grew up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>your version of it,</v>

18
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 1>it's very different.</v>

19
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit faster I think.</v>
