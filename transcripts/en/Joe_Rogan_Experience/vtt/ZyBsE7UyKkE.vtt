14
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 2>You can get tickets@ebiofficial.com.</v>

15
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 2>You can watch it on UFC fight pass.</v>

16
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 2>And you also have a choice now to watch it on paper view@inchbyinch.tv.</v>

17
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

18
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.883
<v Speaker 2>That's a great,</v>

19
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.691
<v Speaker 2>it's a good move.</v>

20
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't have fight pass you can still get it.</v>

21
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

22
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.121
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

23
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:48.954
<v Speaker 2>That's my company.</v>

24
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't have five paths,</v>

25
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 2>you usually get bypass.</v>

26
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Bypass is the shit.</v>

27
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 2>And we're watching this fight on fight pass right now.</v>

28
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not just saying five passes a shit cause I mean UFC employee,</v>

29
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 2>if you're a fan of the sport,</v>

30
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 2>there's fucking everything on fight pass.</v>

31
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 2>You will go down a God damn rabbit hole.</v>

32
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Pride fights for thing.</v>

33
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 2>If we could watch so many fights.</v>

34
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.810

37
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480

38
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 2>see if I ever just,</v>

39
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 2>that alone is worth it.</v>

40
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing live just that alone.</v>

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.131
<v Speaker 2>That alone.</v>

51
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even need anything else.</v>

52
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 2>We should do some,</v>

53
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

54
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.870

<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

62
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] question is how long after UFC do they put the individual fights on</v>

63
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.561
<v Speaker 2>bypass?</v>

64
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:53.394
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

65
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 2>And you were saying too,</v>

66
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 2>they upload them.</v>

67
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

68
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people on this before we,</v>

69
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 2>we can see this fight on fight pass.</v>

70
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Well this class,</v>

71
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 2>this is on fight pass right now.</v>

72
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean archived.</v>

73
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.261
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

74
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 2>there'll be I crop right afterwards.</v>

75
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 2>How long does it take?</v>

76
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 2>100% it's right afterwards.</v>

77
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Uploads right away.</v>

78
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so because I've tried to check fights out.</v>

79
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 2>That just happened.</v>

80
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they were Fox fights.</v>

81
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 2>If it's FX or f or Fox sports one or Fox sports two.</v>

82
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:19.644
<v Speaker 2>They own those.</v>

83
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 2>True or Fox.</v>

84
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.953
<v Speaker 2>They own those.</v>

85
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 2>They can't put those on bypass.</v>

86
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

87
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think so.</v>

88
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:26.041
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

89
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:26.874
<v Speaker 2>Joe Fox.</v>

90
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

91
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.223
<v Speaker 2>I think they do.</v>

92
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the,</v>

93
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 2>the sun.</v>

94
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't pay all that money on clothes or money.</v>

95
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to pay fuckloads of money.</v>

96
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 2>So you could just not have Fox and just watch it on fight pass.</v>

97
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 2>But the one,</v>

98
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean they should own it.</v>

99
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:37.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

100
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:38.101
<v Speaker 2>they're paying for,</v>

101
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing with it?</v>

102
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:39.864
<v Speaker 2>They ain't doing shit.</v>

103
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 2>They replay them all the time.</v>

104
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:41.910

<v Speaker 3>I had to go to the comedy store.</v>

299
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:46.904
<v Speaker 3>I missed it.</v>

300
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 3>He definitely won the first round.</v>

301
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>

302
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

303
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

306
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:52.911
<v Speaker 3>it's a tough one.</v>

307
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

308
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 3>What is his name?</v>

309
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.793
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>

310
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 3>She'll minko right.</v>

311
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Sly Manco Manco</v>

312
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.880
<v Speaker 3>he hit him with a,</v>

313
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

314
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 3>overhand left and closed up his ride.</v>

315
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:03.861
<v Speaker 3>I like his whole ride.</v>

316
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 3>I kind of like Etsy and then the sec,</v>

317
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 3>I thought she'll make a one the second round and the third.</v>

318
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.590
<v Speaker 3>But the gift of [inaudible] Resource,</v>

319
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 3>he did not look like a world beater.</v>

320
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

321
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.113
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

322
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.631
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

323
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're UFC got rid of them just in time.</v>

324
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 3>It's too bad because against Chris Weidman,</v>

325
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 3>he looked like a bad mother fucker.</v>

326
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.571
<v Speaker 3>That Joe,</v>

327
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Beltmore gets enough respect.</v>

328
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Their guys are fucking tough at the top level.</v>

329
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:24.821
<v Speaker 3>Like that's true.</v>

330
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 3>So Maaco hasn't lost the fight and how long yet spend for steroids,</v>

331
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 3>but he's won like six in a row.</v>

332
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 3>He's a motherfucker.</v>

333
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.063
<v Speaker 3>He is a motherfucker.</v>

334
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you see when you knocked out Melvin?</v>

335
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

336
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.673
<v Speaker 3>Like those,</v>

337
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.131
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

338
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 3>I boom Bella towards going to be a tough going for everybody.</v>

339
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I think that's true.</v>

340
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.771
<v Speaker 3>I think that's true.</v>

341
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 3>And that also highlights how fucking good Rory Macdonald actually is.</v>

342
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 3>Look at.</v>

343
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Look at Larkin not doing well.</v>

344
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

345
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:48.830
<v Speaker 3>well Lauren's got owed by Paul Daley is,</v>

346
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.760
<v Speaker 3>you know when you stand in front of Paul Daley,</v>

347
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Paul Daley throws bad.</v>

348
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 3>I talk in bombs.</v>

349
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 3>That left hand is just a ridiculous weapon.</v>

350
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 3>We'll look at Ben Henderson.</v>

351
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.090
<v Speaker 3>He's struggling.</v>

352
00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Ben Henderson was on down sod.</v>

353
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 3>He was on the downside when he went there though.</v>

354
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.181
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

355
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.430
<v Speaker 3>But the struggle city then.</v>

356
00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:04.264
<v Speaker 3>That's just rough.</v>

357
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Dave's trying to go one 70 ah,</v>

358
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.971
<v Speaker 3>that was not a gun.</v>

359
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 3>The guy fought nightmare.</v>

360
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Phil Davis did well,</v>

361
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 3>but you know a Ryan Bader beat him.</v>

362
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 3>You know Ryan Bader who was probably never going to be the champ in the UFC</v>

363
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 3>light heavyweight division.</v>

364
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 3>Now you never know.</v>

365
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 3>You never know.</v>

366
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones.</v>

367
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones in,</v>

368
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 3>he was really not.</v>

369
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.720
<v Speaker 3>It was everyone though.</v>

370
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Speaker 3>They nobody can.</v>

371
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:27.140
<v Speaker 3>That title John was there.</v>

372
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:27.771
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

373
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:28.770
<v Speaker 3>you gotta wonder man.</v>

374
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 3>You got to wonder what the fuck.</v>

375
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Actually happened when it came to this steroid stuff.</v>

376
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.290
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

377
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Novitsky like a lot of these,</v>

378
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:36.741
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

379
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

380
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:42.310
<v Speaker 3>websites were posting that if John Jones could provide a supplement that had</v>

381
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 3>that stuff in it,</v>

382
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.460
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't get a suspension.</v>

383
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 3>It is possible that he wouldn't get a suspension.</v>

384
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Novitsky said they just totally took me out of context and that's not what I</v>

385
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 3>said at all.</v>

386
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.221
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

387
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:57.221
<v Speaker 3>I listened to what he was actually is it is possible to have tainted supplements</v>

388
00:08:57.781 --> 00:08:59.740
<v Speaker 3>and people have proven in the past.</v>

389
00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 3>So there's something in a supplement and if you can prove that you took it</v>

390
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 3>completely accidentally,</v>

391
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 3>which guys have,</v>

392
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.410
<v Speaker 3>you know who did that is um,</v>

393
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

394
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.733
<v Speaker 3>10 means,</v>

395
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.011
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

396
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:08.731
<v Speaker 3>the dirty bird,</v>

397
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 3>but he got suspended for a few months even even though,</v>

398
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 3>but a few months for John would be a win.</v>

399
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

400
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.340
<v Speaker 3>That wouldn't be shit with him.</v>

401
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 3>With his history.</v>

402
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 3>It's tough to believe.</v>

403
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

404
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.631
<v Speaker 3>I want to believe,</v>

405
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 3>I want to believe too so bad.</v>

406
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I won't back so bad.</v>

407
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:22.510
<v Speaker 3>And I think the UFC needs them so,</v>

408
00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 3>so they need them so bad right now.</v>

409
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 3>What are you excited for these days?</v>

410
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.233
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.853
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead Eddie.</v>

413
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm finally saw that documentary.</v>

414
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:31.254
<v Speaker 3>ICARUS.</v>

415
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.501
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

416
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:32.031
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking him.</v>

417
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

418
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.571
<v Speaker 3>Fucking amazing.</v>

419
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

420
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 3>That's the Russian doping.</v>

421
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

422
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know anything about that movie.</v>

423
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 3>And let's say Alex Jones said the Russians,</v>

424
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.520
<v Speaker 3>they're sneaking into the laboratories there</v>

425
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of the night and they're switching the urine.</v>

426
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:47.461
<v Speaker 3>The Asian,</v>

427
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:47.851
<v Speaker 3>the beach.</v>

428
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:48.361
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

429
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:48.781
<v Speaker 3>I know this,</v>

430
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:50.230
<v Speaker 3>that I have an inside sources.</v>

431
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.021
<v Speaker 3>How could they do that?</v>

432
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

433
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

434
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I believe that would be the end of Alex Jones right there.</v>

435
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:01.783
<v Speaker 3>Maybe</v>

436
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 3>that sounds crazy that they were like breaking into the opposite.</v>

437
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Switching the pisses.</v>

438
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:09.061
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

439
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 3>they did it in Russia though.</v>

440
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.730
<v Speaker 3>It was in Sochi.</v>

441
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.560
<v Speaker 3>They won 13 gold medals,</v>

442
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 3>gold medals.</v>

443
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was dirty to do ted.</v>

444
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was dirty.</v>

445
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 3>That guy's in serious hiding right now.</v>

446
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.011

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

451
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

452
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.591
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

453
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 3>He was saying he has that he's had like depression before and then try to commit</v>

454
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 3>suicide before that scandal first broke out in Russia when he was freaking out.</v>

455
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.580
<v Speaker 3>He was in Russia and he was on the phone going,</v>

456
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.230
<v Speaker 3>they're going to kill it because I need to get,</v>

457
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 3>I need a plane ticket out here.</v>

458
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 3>I was shocked that he was able to leave the country.</v>

459
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

460
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 3>What did you think that they were like they would have someone on his ass.</v>

461
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:45.811
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

462
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Bryan Fogel,</v>

463
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 3>who was the director of it,</v>

464
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:51.420
<v Speaker 3>was on my podcast and he explained to me how they didn't think that he was a</v>

465
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:53.090
<v Speaker 3>flight risk and they,</v>

466
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 3>cause he was such the mastermind of the program,</v>

467
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.050
<v Speaker 3>they never thought that he was going to take off.</v>

468
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of reasons why he cited on the podcasts that I can't totally</v>

469
00:11:01.141 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 3>recall why they didn't think that he was going to take off,</v>

470
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 3>but obviously they fucked that one up.</v>

471
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Super fucked up.</v>

472
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.870
<v Speaker 3>He was all see CEO.</v>

473
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

474
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 3>you know what's crazy dude?</v>

475
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 3>How Wada the world antidoping agency and the International Olympic Committee are</v>

476
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 3>all in bed together.</v>

477
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:15.930
<v Speaker 3>They're not policing each other.</v>

478
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Why does not policing the IOC?</v>

479
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>

480
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.520
<v Speaker 3>That's why they let the Russians in.</v>

481
00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Even though they knew the Russians cheated in Sochi,</v>

482
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 3>they had irrefutable proof that they cheated like that.</v>

483
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 3>All the stuff that you've seen,</v>

484
00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 3>that Netflix documentary,</v>

485
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:29.610
<v Speaker 3>ICARUS is 100% true.</v>

486
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.890
<v Speaker 3>They still let him compete in Rio.</v>

487
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 3>All they did is they throw him a bone.</v>

488
00:11:33.481 --> 00:11:33.751
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

489
00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:33.961
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

490
00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:35.820
<v Speaker 3>we're going to take out the track and field team.</v>

491
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:36.030
<v Speaker 3>These.</v>

492
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.440
<v Speaker 3>This track and field team has to go,</v>

493
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.540
<v Speaker 3>so they took the track and field team out.</v>

494
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.590
<v Speaker 3>They left wrestling.</v>

495
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Gymnastics all is a dirty,</v>

496

<v Speaker 3>dirty athletes.</v>

498
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.250
<v Speaker 3>They probably rush,</v>

499
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.651

506
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.680
<v Speaker 3>We busted.</v>

507

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.623
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

592
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

593
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.621
<v Speaker 3>Why do they,</v>

594
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 3>why are they winning gold medals?</v>

595
00:13:55.031 --> 00:13:55.691
<v Speaker 3>Like what's happening?</v>

596
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:55.891
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

597
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you what's happening.</v>

598
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 3>They have a very sophisticated drug program.</v>

599
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Jamaica,</v>

600
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.330
<v Speaker 3>like they're not known for being,</v>

601
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.250
<v Speaker 3>they've never been known for being sprinters.</v>

602
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:04.031
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

603
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:05.140
<v Speaker 3>that's not their thing.</v>

604
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of knew that that's their thing and that the best ever at it do we</v>

605
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:12.430
<v Speaker 3>just think it's the fucking plantation?</v>

606
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:13.450
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you think it is?</v>

607
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:13.881
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

608
00:14:13.881 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 3>what do you think they're eating?</v>

609
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.080
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that Fogel pointed out,</v>

610
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:17.321
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

611
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 3>we remember when Ben Johnson got tested positive when he fought,</v>

612
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.101
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>

613
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

614
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 3>actually raced against Carl Lewis.</v>

615
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>

616
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of a big deal.</v>

617
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:26.800
<v Speaker 3>He was Super Jack Jack Gold chain.</v>

618
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Apparently Carl Lewis tested positive too.</v>

619
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.051
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

620
00:14:30.051 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 3>they're all doing it all over tested positive.</v>

621
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just that Ben Johnson's levels were so off the fucking charts.</v>

622
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.601
<v Speaker 3>They were like Jesus.</v>

623
00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:39.550
<v Speaker 3>But that was the first year that they were testing.</v>

624
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like pride data before,</v>

625
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.193
<v Speaker 3>it's like pride days.</v>

626
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

627
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.563
<v Speaker 3>like pride days.</v>

628
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.523
<v Speaker 3>And that makes you think,</v>

629
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:45.543
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say this,</v>

630
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.710
<v Speaker 3>but it really makes you think about fate.</v>

631
00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Or there's Ben Johnson back in the day sign.</v>

632
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.231
<v Speaker 3>That's a good picture.</v>

633
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 3>But get a picture of him mid sprint.</v>

634
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.551
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

635
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 2>you can see how fucking Jack,</v>

636
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fight.</v>

637
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:55.683
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

638
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 2>he was so fucking fast.</v>

639
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.453
<v Speaker 2>Look that</v>

640
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 2>he's so big.</v>

641
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.320
<v Speaker 2>It was so big for a track and field.</v>

642
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Carl Lewis looks he has aids back then.</v>

643
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Look at how jacked Ben John,</v>

644
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.970
<v Speaker 2>he looks like Melvin Manhoef.</v>

645
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.631
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

646
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

647
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of build.</v>

648
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Take Adrian Peterson.</v>

649
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>

650
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.253

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 2>these guys are all,</v>

652
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.350

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 2>They're all on something.</v>

654
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Every one of them's on something.</v>

655
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.250
<v Speaker 2>No white guys got ahold of some good shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The 100 meter dash.</v>

663
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.893
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard.</v>

664
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.560
<v Speaker 2>We get juice to the gills.</v>

665
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.563

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.180
<v Speaker 2>we're not spraying.</v>

670
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Guys aren't willing to go that deep.</v>

671
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 2>We just don't know what we got to go full bane.</v>

672
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.671
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>

673
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what it is and get his eyes.</v>

674
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

675
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck was he taking over his eyes turn yellow.</v>

676
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what they had said.</v>

677
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 2>That his liver was struggling to deal with all the steroids in the system and it</v>

678
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 2>was making the whites of his eyes yellow.</v>

679
00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:58.761
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

680
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:01.250
<v Speaker 2>He still beat the record with that Timex watch on.</v>

681
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.160
<v Speaker 2>That's some powerful shit.</v>

682
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Why is it a Timex slow you down that heavy ass basic.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Watch that though.</v>

684
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 2>But that wouldn't really hold your aerodynamics.</v>

685
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 2>My man's not a bad pen.</v>

00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:00.641
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

895
00:21:00.641 --> 00:21:01.710
<v Speaker 3>And he was so dark.</v>

896
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 3>He was dark black.</v>

897
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

898
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.430
<v Speaker 3>He was out with a Tan.</v>

899
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you got it was in the tanning.</v>

900
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

901
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:06.601
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

902
00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:06.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

903
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.781
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

904
00:21:06.781 --> 00:21:07.614
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

905
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Everything's changed.</v>

906
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.833
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

907
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.010
<v Speaker 3>There is cream.</v>

908
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.460
<v Speaker 3>There's cream that uh,</v>

909
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.450
<v Speaker 3>some women do use to lighten their skin.</v>

910
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.141
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

911
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:17.831
<v Speaker 3>he had his over.</v>

912
00:21:17.831 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

913
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.230
<v Speaker 3>He admits he bleaches the skin.</v>

914
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

915
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 3>humidity bleaches the skin.</v>

916
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

917
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

918
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.390
<v Speaker 3>I wonder why he wants to do that too.</v>

919
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.320
<v Speaker 3>That's really just the second Michael Jackson.</v>

920
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.551
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

921
00:21:29.551 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

922
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:29.831
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

923
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.450
<v Speaker 3>because Michael Jackson had what I have.</v>

924
00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:32.500
<v Speaker 3>He had to his condition,</v>

925
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.880
<v Speaker 3>but he did bleach your skin though.</v>

926
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:34.743
<v Speaker 3>He did</v>

927
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.400
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>

928
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

929
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.070
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what Sammy Sosa's doing.</v>

930
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Sammy Sosa just decided to be able to wipes to be white.</v>

931
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.633
<v Speaker 3>People have done that.</v>

932
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe Michael Jackson's just wanting to be white,</v>

933
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:46.700
<v Speaker 3>but he used that as an excuse.</v>

934
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

935
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 3>he legit and had like a skin thing and it started to spread and he's like,</v>

936
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:49.751
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

937
00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to look like this.</v>

938
00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:52.120
<v Speaker 3>And just went full spectrum.</v>

939
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen some models who have it?</v>

940
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:56.080
<v Speaker 3>They're gorgeous and they're just rocket that.</v>

941
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.120
<v Speaker 3>I think it's sexiest.</v>

942
00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:58.923
<v Speaker 3>Harlow.</v>

943
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 3>I called the zebra models.</v>

944
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.950
<v Speaker 3>They're sexy as fuck.</v>

945
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.333
<v Speaker 3>They got like a cool,</v>

946
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:04.470
<v Speaker 3>can we see them Jamie?</v>

947
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:05.261
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

948
00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:07.980
<v Speaker 3>it's only one role model is there's any Harlow,</v>

00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:12.010
<v Speaker 3>But this is not the end of the fight.</v>

953

<v Speaker 3>like how did this fight end?</v>

955
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he gave up at the corner and the car was the last round.</v>

956
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that was the third to decision homeboy.</v>

957
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.670
<v Speaker 3>We're doing the worst job of paying attention to this fight.</v>

1001
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:20.621
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

<v Speaker 3>really wants to be black.</v>

00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a white woman who,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And they're just baring.</v>

1008
00:23:28.681 --> 00:23:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Or is that the home girl who got fired from her job?</v>

1009
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:31.511
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1010
00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:32.590
<v Speaker 3>What Sammy Sosa says.</v>

1011
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.400
<v Speaker 3>What happened was that I had been using the cream for a long time and that</v>

1012
00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:40.210
<v Speaker 3>combined with the bright TV lights made my face look wider than it really is.</v>

1013
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I look like Michael Jackson.</v>

1014
00:23:42.191 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 3>He added,</v>

1015
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.710
<v Speaker 3>apparently Sosa has kept up,</v>

1016
00:23:44.711 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 3>has used cream over the years,</v>

1017
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:51.140
<v Speaker 3>which has led him to appear even wider than he did in 2009 so he's been just</v>

1018
00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:53.750
<v Speaker 3>getting wider and wider and wider.</v>

1019
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1020
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.580
<v Speaker 3>Go higher there.</v>

1021
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.450
<v Speaker 3>It's a bleaching cream that I applied before going to bed and widens my skin</v>

1022
00:23:59.451 --> 00:23:59.781
<v Speaker 3>tone.</v>

1023
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Social said during the appearance of Univision's,</v>

1024
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:01.701
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1025
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:01.821
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1026
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:01.941
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1027
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:02.061
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1028
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:02.690
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

1029
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a cream that I have that it used to soften my skin,</v>

1030
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 3>but it has bleached me some.</v>

1031
00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:08.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a racist.</v>

1032
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.770
<v Speaker 3>I live my life happily.</v>

1033
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.390
<v Speaker 3>What bleached me some sir,</v>

1034
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 3>you were completely a light man.</v>

1035
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:14.781
<v Speaker 3>Racist.</v>

1036
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:15.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a racist.</v>

1037
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like there was like a super racist white check that he was trying to fuck</v>

1038
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.991
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

1039
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 3>there's only one way and say,</v>

1040
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:23.040
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>

1041
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.420

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.170
<v Speaker 3>you never know you never go full white unless she was just bad.</v>

1043
00:24:27.171 --> 00:24:28.004
<v Speaker 3>She just was like,</v>

1044
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:33.200
<v Speaker 3>like Taj Tennessee racist but with big old titties,</v>

1045
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.850
<v Speaker 3>big plump pink titties and now he's just flocked to take any little waist.</v>

1046
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 3>But I just put on a bleaching cream.</v>

1047
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that Michael Jackson cream.</v>

1048
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:44.511
<v Speaker 3>It's no big deal.</v>

1049
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:46.760
<v Speaker 3>I put a little bit on before I go to sleep at night.</v>

1050
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bleaching cream.</v>

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile he said he's even lighter than he was in 2009 I mean he's talking</v>

1053
00:24:54.501 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 3>about something that happened eight years ago.</v>

1054
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 3>He's lied to than that now.</v>

1055
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.090
<v Speaker 3>He's also a little mentally unstable cause he also has white man here now he's</v>

1061
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 3>but you wouldn't confuse him for being black.</v>

1062
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.930
<v Speaker 3>Well you would if he had black features and black hair.</v>

1063
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1065
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:20.090
<v Speaker 3>If he had an Afro,</v>

1066
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:21.770
<v Speaker 3>you would say that's a light skinned black guy.</v>

1067
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.430

1140
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 2>but you deal these things out like these popular memes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>ma'am.</v>

1144
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Probably Damien Maia versus Colby Covington.</v>

1145
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.281
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1147
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.220
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting fight.</v>

1148
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:32.851
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

1149
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:33.031
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1150
00:27:33.031 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I just switched Damien.</v>

1151
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Why Maya was younger because without this sauce,</v>

1152
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 2>without the special sauce,</v>

1153
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.310
<v Speaker 2>you know he's like 40 years old now.</v>

1154
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:41.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1155
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:44.160
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he said even when he was young,</v>

1156
00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:44.994
<v Speaker 2>he was a beast.</v>

1157
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:45.840
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast,</v>

1158
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.320
<v Speaker 2>like to remember he went on the whole kind of tear and then fly to Anderson.</v>

1159
00:27:49.321 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Terrible fight back down,</v>

1160
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 2>cut to 79 he's a beast again.</v>

1161
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.410
<v Speaker 2>He's still a beat.</v>

1162
00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:53.880
<v Speaker 2>He's still,</v>

1163
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.410
<v Speaker 2>he's 100% of beach when she was young.</v>

1164
00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1165
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Because I love the idea of a specialist.</v>

1166
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm always fascinated by a specialist,</v>

1167
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.390
<v Speaker 2>by a guy who just does one thing better than everybody else.</v>

1168
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Can he do it to somebody that's been Estrin the fight I would do.</v>

1169
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.390
<v Speaker 2>It's been asking Damien Maia,</v>

1170
00:28:08.391 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I wish Ben didn't retire because I want that fight.</v>

1171
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Ben's never going to get in the UFC.</v>

1172
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 2>He talked way too much shit about,</v>

1173
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.500
<v Speaker 2>about Dana white like that.</v>

1174
00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Those are those days still there.</v>

1175
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Dana White didn't give a fuck anymore that much money.</v>

1176
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Like what Ben asking me,</v>

1177
00:28:20.931 --> 00:28:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I let them know don't give a fuck.</v>

1178
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

1179
00:28:22.831 --> 00:28:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Why have a men then what if he talks more shit about you?</v>

1180
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:26.270
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1181
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.103
<v Speaker 2>we need ratings.</v>

1182
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Ben Asked her and doesn't give a f uh,</v>

1183
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:30.140
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1184
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.901
<v Speaker 2>he's retiring,</v>

1185
00:28:30.901 --> 00:28:31.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1186
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.611
<v Speaker 2>It's a bummer.</v>

1188
00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:33.444
<v Speaker 2>Undefeated,</v>

1189
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.351
<v Speaker 2>retiring,</v>

1190
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:34.950
<v Speaker 2>undefeated.</v>

1191
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.950
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting because the only one who gave them any problems really was</v>

1192
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:45.081
<v Speaker 2>a j here on j Iran got him to a split decision a long time ago though.</v>

1193
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.561
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't matter.</v>

1195
00:28:46.561 --> 00:28:50.610
<v Speaker 2>It was like a wrestler who could strike a guy who was good enough to keep you</v>

1196
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:51.444
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

1197
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1198
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.750
<v Speaker 2>good enough wrestling to keep it from being a wrestling match and he could</v>

1199
00:28:54.751 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 2>strike.</v>

1200
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.390
<v Speaker 2>But Ben evolved from there cause Ben with,</v>

1201
00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.201
<v Speaker 2>with Woodley,</v>

1202
00:28:58.201 --> 00:28:59.340
<v Speaker 2>with all these old guys,</v>

1203
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:00.600
<v Speaker 2>like he evolved his game.</v>

1204
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:01.800
<v Speaker 2>So he talked to people and they're like,</v>

1205
00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:02.011
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1206
00:29:02.011 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 2>he's dead.</v>

1207
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.450
<v Speaker 2>We can handle the stress.</v>

1208
00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 2>One guy that gave us some trouble,</v>

1209
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:09.861
<v Speaker 2>some Russian Daggett Stan type of wrestler guy who claimed it was on one FC,</v>

1210
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.590
<v Speaker 2>he was calling Ben outside.</v>

1211
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:12.351
<v Speaker 2>I could out Russell,</v>

1212
00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:12.441
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1213
00:29:12.441 --> 00:29:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna take you down real.</v>

1214
00:29:13.871 --> 00:29:15.870
<v Speaker 2>And he did and he was on them for awhile,</v>

1215
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.980
<v Speaker 2>but Ben still beat him.</v>

1216
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:17.641
<v Speaker 2>He got him an arm.</v>

1217
00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:18.361
<v Speaker 2>Such a shame.</v>

1218
00:29:18.361 --> 00:29:21.930
<v Speaker 2>He never gotten the UFC man fucking judge track except for that guy.</v>

1219
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that he gets his mitts on as soon as Ben like holds you or grabs you,</v>

1220
00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:31.890
<v Speaker 2>his clinch is so high level that you just can't break free of his,</v>

1221
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.860
<v Speaker 2>his clan,</v>

1222
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1223
00:29:33.031 --> 00:29:34.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a bummer is one of the reasons,</v>

1224
00:29:34.381 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 2>obviously you talk shit to Dana,</v>

1225
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 2>but that style for a lot of people isn't going to sell paper views or get</v>

1226
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.980
<v Speaker 2>ratings because of that on wrestling,</v>

1227
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.380
<v Speaker 2>holding,</v>

1228
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.213
<v Speaker 2>holding people down.</v>

1229
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.670
<v Speaker 2>He hears he's getting good at summit.</v>

1230
00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 2>So many guys now too.</v>

1231
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.121
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't care,</v>

1232
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:46.954
<v Speaker 2>but they're not going to.</v>

1233
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem with that logic.</v>

1234
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Floyd Mayweather style of boxing is not fan friendly either,</v>

1235
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.050
<v Speaker 2>but Floyd,</v>

1236
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 2>major superstar before that he did knock people out,</v>

1237
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:58.870
<v Speaker 2>became the guy you'd either pay to watch him lose or win.</v>

1238
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Huge draw [inaudible] not a big draw.</v>

1239
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Introduce him wasn't,</v>

1240
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 2>he was not a huge drop before he started talking shit to people.</v>

1241
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a huge draw until he became money Mayweather.</v>

1242
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.630
<v Speaker 2>I became the bad guy.</v>

1243
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:11.880
<v Speaker 2>That's when he became a huge drum.</v>

1244
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:12.431
<v Speaker 2>A bad guy,</v>

1245
00:30:12.431 --> 00:30:13.600
<v Speaker 2>but also fought Oscar,</v>

1246
00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:14.381
<v Speaker 2>Dela Hoya,</v>

1247
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:14.741
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

1248
00:30:14.741 --> 00:30:17.670
<v Speaker 2>all the superstars spend Africans that come in the UFC and then go night.</v>

1249
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>

1250
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.090
<v Speaker 2>here's Connor Mcgregor,</v>

1251
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:20.480
<v Speaker 2>some superstar there.</v>

1252
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 2>The UFC is not going to do that.</v>

1253
00:30:21.671 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have the style either,</v>

1254
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.880
<v Speaker 2>but if he did that would be very,</v>

1255
00:30:24.881 --> 00:30:25.780
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>

1256
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1257
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 2>but but what I'm saying is that's the only way that this guy could become famous</v>

1258
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 2>is by shit talking.</v>

1259
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:35.410
<v Speaker 2>The shit talking is what's going to make them famous.</v>

1260
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Like people wanting to see him lose.</v>

1261
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.350
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes a guy like that famous because his style is very appealing to</v>

1262
00:30:41.351 --> 00:30:42.520
<v Speaker 2>guys like us that are like,</v>

1263
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I want to see if he can do is,</v>

1264
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1265
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 2>It takes a while to evolve and and be a good finisher.</v>

1266
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.400
<v Speaker 2>And at first for awhile they were just taking people down and just owning them</v>

1267
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:52.340
<v Speaker 2>and controlling of John.</v>

1268
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 2>But he's good at submitting people now he gets,</v>

1269
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:56.830
<v Speaker 2>he gets a great grappler overall.</v>

1270
00:30:56.831 --> 00:30:57.251
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

1271
00:30:57.251 --> 00:30:57.911
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>

1272
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:00.860
<v Speaker 2>so now the w the Ben asks,</v>

1273
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:02.910
<v Speaker 2>can we have now you can't compare them to the Ben.</v>

1274
00:31:02.911 --> 00:31:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Ask him from five years ago.</v>

1275
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.290
<v Speaker 2>That's gone.</v>

1276
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.333
<v Speaker 2>That's gone.</v>

1277
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.580
<v Speaker 2>There's a Ben ass grin that's going to take you down and choke you out.</v>

1278
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.121
<v Speaker 2>Now Eddie,</v>

1279
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:10.960
<v Speaker 2>that whole different,</v>

1280
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 2>that's gone.</v>

1281
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.030
<v Speaker 2>He's retired and money will be,</v>

1282
00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:14.230
<v Speaker 2>there's also the other,</v>

1283
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.190
<v Speaker 2>nobody's really return fc allowing him to use knees to the head on the ground.</v>

1284
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:18.820
<v Speaker 2>What'd you say?</v>

1285
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.160
<v Speaker 2>One FC allowed him to use knees to the head on the ground.</v>

1286
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1287
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.941
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>

1288
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1289
00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:23.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a big weapon and didn't kicks.</v>

1290
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:24.470
<v Speaker 2>You see Brett,</v>

1291
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 2>what Brandon and bear did over there?</v>

1292
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Kicking dudes in the face,</v>

1293
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 2>kick him in the back of the head and they're down.</v>

1294
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like a champion.</v>

1295
00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:32.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1296
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.753
<v Speaker 2>You think he's on the Jews?</v>

1297
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:35.410
<v Speaker 2>They took off.</v>

1298
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 2>They took out the soccer kicks.</v>

1299
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Now you have seen,</v>

1300
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:38.740
<v Speaker 2>well the,</v>

1301
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.551
<v Speaker 2>did you see,</v>

1302
00:31:39.551 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1303
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:44.630
<v Speaker 2>a homeboy Roger Huerto get SAS that was raw.</v>

1304
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 2>That's why you can't have soccer kicks.</v>

1305
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:51.190
<v Speaker 2>He was fighting a Brazilian who was a big fella who was cutting to make one 70</v>

1306
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:52.570
<v Speaker 2>and Roger's not really a one seven.</v>

1307
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:56.950
<v Speaker 2>He was one 55 in the UFC decided to fight one 70 and he was getting beat up and</v>

1308
00:31:56.951 --> 00:32:00.790
<v Speaker 2>then you went down and this dude's soccer kicked him into the next fucking can't</v>

1309
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 2>have that and be a professional sport.</v>

1310
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:04.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just too,</v>

1311
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.023
<v Speaker 2>it's too brutal.</v>

1312
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.771
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1313
00:32:05.771 --> 00:32:06.160
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1314
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1315
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:07.930
<v Speaker 2>he hasn't really,</v>

1316
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.710
<v Speaker 2>he didn't go back on the trial.</v>

1317
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:10.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a brutal,</v>

1319
00:32:12.491 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 2>brutal knockout.</v>

1320
00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.230
<v Speaker 2>They're tough to watch.</v>

1321
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.470
<v Speaker 2>That one was particularly that you see when cro,</v>

1322
00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:18.730
<v Speaker 2>cop kicked run waterman.</v>

1323
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:19.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1324
00:32:19.481 --> 00:32:20.281
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking hard.</v>

1325
00:32:20.281 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to watch.</v>

1326
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:23.470
<v Speaker 2>But why is it harder to watch than a regular head kick?</v>

1327
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.580
<v Speaker 2>That's my question.</v>

1328
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Is it because there's a lot of head kick,</v>

1329
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:31.870
<v Speaker 2>you kind of move more with it and the soccer kick you lying down already Carter</v>

1330
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.610
<v Speaker 2>to defend when you're lower.</v>

1331
00:32:33.611 --> 00:32:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it can generate power,</v>

1332
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1333
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1334
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.493
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1335
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Like Charlie Brown kick someone in</v>

1336
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.840
<v Speaker 3>the face.</v>

1337
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.870
<v Speaker 3>I think I could kick someone just as hard to the body.</v>

1338
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1339
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be surprised.</v>

1340
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 3>You mean Dan kick harder on the ground?</v>

1341
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.690
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yes.</v>

1342
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Like think about an NFL kicker.</v>

1343
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1344
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 3>I like kicking like straight like that.</v>

1345
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.451
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1346
00:32:56.451 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so dude.</v>

1347
00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that I could kick just as hard to the body as I could to the,</v>

1348
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 3>to the ground.</v>

1349
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:01.761
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1350
00:33:01.761 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

1351
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I think just kept question is up high.</v>

1352
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:04.641
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1353
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 3>I think up high would lose something.</v>

1354
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I lose a little bit up high just from like the leverage,</v>

1355
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 3>but I think I did because I think your leg going straight like this and low.</v>

1356
00:33:14.121 --> 00:33:16.400
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where the most of the power is going to be.</v>

1357
00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.413
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1358
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 3>And guaranteed all shit and guaranteed all shit.</v>

1359
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Depends on what kind of kick,</v>

1360
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:23.330
<v Speaker 3>cause here's the thing you could spinning back,</v>

1361
00:33:23.331 --> 00:33:25.070
<v Speaker 3>kick someone in the face when they're down too.</v>

1362
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.450
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing to think about.</v>

1363
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.943
<v Speaker 3>Think about</v>

1364
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.810
<v Speaker 3>God attorney sign yours.</v>

1365
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.661
<v Speaker 3>Not all of them,</v>

1366
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:34.330
<v Speaker 3>but think about that like a dude gets hit.</v>

1367
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.860
<v Speaker 3>He goes down on one knee and you flogging Jj.</v>

1368
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Gay People are gonna die.</v>

1369
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:41.301
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna die.</v>

1370
00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1371
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean if your face is right there and you took a full power turning side kick</v>

1372
00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:45.674
<v Speaker 3>to the face,</v>

1373
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:46.730
<v Speaker 3>he'll get Brandon.</v>

1374
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:47.930
<v Speaker 3>He's so jack now.</v>

1375
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 3>He's so thick.</v>

1376
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.460
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

1377
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.450
<v Speaker 3>this is the one when he came the dude and kicked him to the head when he was on</v>

1378
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:54.260
<v Speaker 3>the ground,</v>

1379
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 3>remember when he beat frank man,</v>

1380
00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:55.491
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1381
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:57.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking light heavyweight and heavyweight over.</v>

1382
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.080
<v Speaker 3>Well you know what happened with him?</v>

1383
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh beautiful.</v>

1384
00:34:00.261 --> 00:34:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Straight left.</v>

1385
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:04.430
<v Speaker 3>He's looking at this soccer kicks to the back of the head.</v>

1386
00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.390
<v Speaker 3>That's shit's rough.</v>

1387
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Those kind of kicks to the back of the header.</v>

1388
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Forget that noise.</v>

1389
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.791
<v Speaker 3>Brandon Pharaoh,</v>

1390
00:34:10.791 --> 00:34:11.451
<v Speaker 3>he's a good guy,</v>

1391
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:11.750
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1392
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.841
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1393
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:12.820
<v Speaker 3>he's a good guy.</v>

1394
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Great Guy.</v>

1395
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.393
<v Speaker 3>Good guy.</v>

1396
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.800
<v Speaker 3>I was always a fan of his,</v>

1397
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.491
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1398
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:19.640
<v Speaker 3>he started out as a heavyweight and then dropped down the light heavyweight with</v>

1399
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:23.300
<v Speaker 3>the big thing that happened to him in the UFC was he went to this big prolonged</v>

1400
00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:25.190
<v Speaker 3>contract negotiation wanting to get paid.</v>

1401
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.280
<v Speaker 3>He wants to get paid and when he came back to tremendous amount of pressure on</v>

1402
00:34:28.281 --> 00:34:28.401
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

1403
00:34:28.401 --> 00:34:30.500
<v Speaker 3>he just didn't perform the same as he did before.</v>

1404
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Then he fought Fabricio for breeze over doom,</v>

1405
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:36.650
<v Speaker 3>got on top of him and put the squished down on him and beat the shit out of him.</v>

1406
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.090
<v Speaker 3>Fabrizio was Mount,</v>

1407
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.143
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1408
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:41.720
<v Speaker 3>this should be interesting.</v>

1409
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Like yawn,</v>

1487
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.730
<v Speaker 4>I went cold.</v>

1488
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:32.160
<v Speaker 4>I went there.</v>

1489
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.820
<v Speaker 4>Did you?</v>

1490
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.280
<v Speaker 4>A couple of weeks ago you had a meeting there about fight pass,</v>

1491
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:37.640
<v Speaker 4>right about a ebi and combat Jujitsu.</v>

1492
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.023
<v Speaker 4>How'd that go?</v>

1493
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.870
<v Speaker 4>Good,</v>

1494
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:40.703
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>

1495
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.543
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

1496
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.950
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1497
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:42.783
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1498
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.483
<v Speaker 4>did it or</v>

1499
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.450
<v Speaker 4>we're still in the code for negotiations about</v>

1500
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.850
<v Speaker 4>Combat Jujitsu,</v>

1501
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 4>which is in three in three weeks.</v>

1502
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.843
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1503
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1504
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.860
<v Speaker 4>it's looking good.</v>

1505
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.430
<v Speaker 4>And so then it's like they've been doing a lot of promotion.</v>

1506
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.040
<v Speaker 4>I know of Ebi on fight pass,</v>

1507
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.110
<v Speaker 4>like during the fights total,</v>

1508
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:08.610
<v Speaker 4>we've had some tough times promotion.</v>

1509
00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:09.480
<v Speaker 4>They sat us down,</v>

1510
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.130
<v Speaker 4>they sat us down and said,</v>

1511
00:37:11.131 --> 00:37:11.490
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1512
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:11.700
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1513
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.720
<v Speaker 4>well look what we do for you.</v>

1514
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 4>They put all the presentation goes every time we mentioned you guys on this show</v>

1515
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:19.080
<v Speaker 4>or that show up when you know how much that's worth,</v>

1516
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.760
<v Speaker 4>they broke it down for us.</v>

1517
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:21.091
<v Speaker 4>And we're like,</v>

1518
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:21.924
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

1519
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty bad ass</v>

1520
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 4>contract negotiations with them.</v>

1521
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:26.844
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going on.</v>

1522
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.570
<v Speaker 4>Could Combat Jiu Jitsu is a new,</v>

1523
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.483
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1524
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.450
<v Speaker 4>it's an offshoot.</v>

1525
00:37:30.451 --> 00:37:32.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a spin off from Ebi.</v>

1526
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.840
<v Speaker 4>It's a hundred percent combat.</v>

1527
00:37:33.841 --> 00:37:37.640
<v Speaker 4>You get to two strikes and you're trying to sell that to we're,</v>

1528
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 4>we're putting on the show and the UFC wants to be part of it.</v>

1529
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.180
<v Speaker 4>And I just really can't explain exactly how,</v>

1530
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.021
<v Speaker 4>but we're,</v>

1531
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:47.790
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna figure it out within the next week.</v>

1532
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.450
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>

1533
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1534
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.423
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1535
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:52.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1536
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:53.790
<v Speaker 4>if you don't know what combat get is,</v>

1537
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.600
<v Speaker 4>it's basically in between sub only Jujitsu and MMA.</v>

1538
00:37:57.601 --> 00:37:58.021
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1539
00:37:58.021 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm in May,</v>

1540
00:37:58.770 --> 00:37:59.910
<v Speaker 4>but it's not sub only.</v>

1541
00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:00.511
<v Speaker 4>It's right there.</v>

1542
00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:00.900
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1543
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.260
<v Speaker 4>it's for Jujitsu fanatics who are just interested in seeing,</v>

1544
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:04.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1545
00:38:04.831 --> 00:38:05.070
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1546
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:08.790
<v Speaker 4>there's like guys that are really into kickboxing and they know everything about</v>

1547
00:38:08.791 --> 00:38:09.301
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing,</v>

1548
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:10.710
<v Speaker 4>but they'll watch MMA a little bit,</v>

1549
00:38:10.711 --> 00:38:11.220
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1550
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.020
<v Speaker 4>But they're there.</v>

1551
00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.800
<v Speaker 4>They're in the kickboxing there in the business.</v>

1552
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.660
<v Speaker 4>And then there's guys like that unboxing.</v>

1553
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:15.880
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1554
00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.070
<v Speaker 4>We'll watch a little lemon mag.</v>

1555
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.430
<v Speaker 4>Well there's guys like that and Jujitsu to a lot of guys in Jujitsu.</v>

1556
00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:21.840
<v Speaker 4>Do not watch the UFC.</v>

1557
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:22.711
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

1558
00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:23.790
<v Speaker 4>Because they're showing,</v>

1559
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.490
<v Speaker 4>did you do,</v>

1560
00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.830
<v Speaker 4>did they want to see Jujitsu?</v>

1561
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.540
<v Speaker 4>The watch did Jujitsu again,</v>

1562
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 4>but they're not interested in kickboxing.</v>

1563
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.000
<v Speaker 4>Just like a kickboxing guy's not interested in watching digital matches.</v>

1564
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.460
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot of different genres and um,</v>

1565
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.061
<v Speaker 4>combat.</v>

1566
00:38:37.061 --> 00:38:37.894
<v Speaker 4>You'd get this for the,</v>

1567
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.960
<v Speaker 4>the Jujitsu freak that wants to watch Jujitsu.</v>

1568
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 4>Competition with a little more realism,</v>

1569
00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:45.820
<v Speaker 4>a little bit closer to MMA.</v>

1570
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.200
<v Speaker 4>When you add palm strikes,</v>

1571
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.980
<v Speaker 4>the importance of each position changes tremendously.</v>

1572
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.910
<v Speaker 4>Like in the suburban gangs in this way.</v>

1573
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1574
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:53.950
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1575
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 4>in the sub only game,</v>

1576
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:55.571
<v Speaker 4>that's one aspect.</v>

1577
00:38:55.571 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 4>And the sub only game.</v>

1578
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1579
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 4>the full guard is not important at all.</v>

1580
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:02.830
<v Speaker 4>If you never want to play full guard,</v>

1581
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.551
<v Speaker 4>that's on you.</v>

1582
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:04.061
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to,</v>

1583
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:07.630
<v Speaker 4>you could win Abu Dhabi in the point system without ever playing full guard.</v>

1584
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.613
<v Speaker 4>You could win.</v>

1585
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.650
<v Speaker 4>Full guard is so not important in some the only,</v>

1586
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.000
<v Speaker 4>and in point grappling,</v>

1587
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.150
<v Speaker 4>he supplied what you're allowed to do when you allowed to do and come back.</v>

1588
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:18.400
<v Speaker 4>He tries,</v>

1589
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.233
<v Speaker 4>he punched it all.</v>

1590
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.011
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1591
00:39:20.011 --> 00:39:20.890
<v Speaker 4>yet it's palm strikes.</v>

1592
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.380
<v Speaker 4>It's aunt when standing,</v>

1593
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.430
<v Speaker 4>it's just wrestling.</v>

1594
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:25.923
<v Speaker 4>It's not MMA.</v>

1595
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.123
<v Speaker 4>It's not a mimic.</v>

1596
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.660
<v Speaker 4>It's extreme Jujitsu.</v>

1597
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.500
<v Speaker 4>You got to look at it.</v>

1598
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 4>So wrestling is just standing.</v>

1599
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:31.571
<v Speaker 4>It's just wrestling.</v>

1600
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 4>But as soon as someone hits the ground,</v>

1601
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.660
<v Speaker 4>you can start throwing palm strikes.</v>

1602
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1603
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:35.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1604
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:37.240
<v Speaker 4>but no elbows to the body,</v>

1605
00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:38.074
<v Speaker 4>no elbows,</v>

1606
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.831
<v Speaker 4>no punches.</v>

1607
00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:39.341
<v Speaker 4>Just pause.</v>

1608
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 4>Helps rights to the body's,</v>

1609
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.260
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

1610
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.011
<v Speaker 4>Just palm strikes.</v>

1611
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:42.844
<v Speaker 4>And so it's like,</v>

1612
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.650
<v Speaker 4>remember the old Gracie in action videos?</v>

1613
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.200
<v Speaker 4>All those challenge matches in Brazil.</v>

1614
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:47.881
<v Speaker 4>They had rules.</v>

1615
00:39:47.881 --> 00:39:48.340
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1616
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.810
<v Speaker 4>they were just palm strikes in Jujitsu.</v>

1617
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Those were rules.</v>

1618
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 4>So after we did the first combat Jujitsu tournament at Ebi 11 that's when I</v>

1619
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:56.080
<v Speaker 4>first introduced it.</v>

1620
00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Horian Gracie calls me,</v>

1621
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.580
<v Speaker 4>I never talked to Horian Gracie,</v>

1622
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>

1623
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.400
<v Speaker 4>he called Rhodes Gracie to get my number.</v>

1624
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.370
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to call me and Pam on the phone with Horian Gracie and he's thanking</v>

1625
00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 4>me for putting together combat.</v>

1626
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:08.830
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu is Eddie.</v>

1627
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:10.480
<v Speaker 4>This is how we used to do it in Brazil.</v>

1628
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 4>I wanted had it to do this,</v>

1629
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:12.021
<v Speaker 4>but hell,</v>

1630
00:40:12.021 --> 00:40:12.791
<v Speaker 4>he could not do this.</v>

1631
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:14.170
<v Speaker 4>This is what we want to thank you.</v>

1632
00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.700
<v Speaker 4>This is the real Jujitsu,</v>

1633
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.241
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1634
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:16.541
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

1635
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:17.351
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1636
00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:19.700
<v Speaker 4>The guy who invented the UFC correct.</v>

1637
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.840
<v Speaker 4>Calls me up.</v>

1638
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.190
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is when God consequently makes a fifth,</v>

1639
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.233
<v Speaker 4>it's a foul.</v>

1640
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like a foul and get taken away.</v>

1641
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:27.930
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1642
00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:28.950
<v Speaker 4>like how many can fulfill?</v>

1643
00:40:28.951 --> 00:40:29.501
<v Speaker 4>It's still,</v>

1644
00:40:29.501 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 4>it's still no points.</v>

1645
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.850
<v Speaker 4>We call this finish only because in the first 10 minutes,</v>

1646
00:40:33.851 --> 00:40:36.100
<v Speaker 4>if there's not a submission or a Tko,</v>

1647
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1648
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:37.750
<v Speaker 4>or the,</v>

1649
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:38.740
<v Speaker 4>that's the only way he could finish.</v>

1650
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:39.730
<v Speaker 4>Then we go into overtime,</v>

1651
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:40.780
<v Speaker 4>like Ebi overtime,</v>

1652
00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.730
<v Speaker 4>but there has to be a finish.</v>

1653
00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:43.590
<v Speaker 4>So we call it finished.</v>

1654
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:44.950
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't get knocked out.</v>

1655
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.990
<v Speaker 4>People can not done yet.</v>

1656
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:47.620
<v Speaker 4>We did two,</v>

1657
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.270
<v Speaker 4>we did two four man tournament.</v>

1658
00:40:49.271 --> 00:40:53.860
<v Speaker 4>We did a girl won the last show and we did a at Ebi 11 like six months ago.</v>

1659
00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:54.551
<v Speaker 4>We did the first one.</v>

1660
00:40:54.551 --> 00:40:57.310
<v Speaker 4>Now we're doing a whole show combat.</v>

1661
00:40:57.311 --> 00:40:58.270
<v Speaker 4>You did two worlds.</v>

1662
00:40:58.271 --> 00:40:59.860
<v Speaker 4>One a whole show.</v>

1663
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:00.821
<v Speaker 4>Jay and Gary.</v>

1664
00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:01.840
<v Speaker 4>Tony is going to be in it.</v>

1665
00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.240
<v Speaker 4>Vagner Rocha is going to be in it.</v>

1666
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 4>So tomorrow you're going to see Gary Tone and in Vagner Rocha going at at Ebi</v>

1667
00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.080
<v Speaker 4>Style and then three weeks later you're going to see them going at it with palm</v>

1668
00:41:11.081 --> 00:41:11.650
<v Speaker 4>strikes.</v>

1669
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.070
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1670
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:12.903
<v Speaker 4>How cool is that?</v>

1671
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Palm strikes is interesting because you remember when boss Rutan burst onto the</v>

1672
00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:20.680
<v Speaker 4>scene and in pancreas was lightened motherfuckers on firewood.</v>

1673
00:41:20.681 --> 00:41:21.311
<v Speaker 4>Palm strikes.</v>

1674
00:41:21.311 --> 00:41:21.930
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1675
00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.630
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1676
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.610
<v Speaker 4>Instead of swinging like a bitch,</v>

1677
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:28.360
<v Speaker 4>when he figured out it's you pull the palm strikes and throw punches,</v>

1678
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.740
<v Speaker 4>just you throwing punches,</v>

1679
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:30.730
<v Speaker 4>all that hand.</v>

1680
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:32.780
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it.</v>

1681
00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 4>So no,</v>

1682
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.011
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1683
00:41:34.011 --> 00:41:34.970
<v Speaker 4>That was the rules.</v>

1684
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:35.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1685
00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:35.690
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1686
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.961
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1687
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:36.590
<v Speaker 4>But he was saying,</v>

1688
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.790
<v Speaker 4>but even when he went to MMA,</v>

1689
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 4>he said he would keep the same thing even if it was a rule or not.</v>

1690
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Consider you wouldn't break his hand.</v>

1691
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 4>Well you definitely can keep through a lot of punches for sure.</v>

1692
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:47.780
<v Speaker 4>But he would still throw hooks and stuff with open hand.</v>

1693
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:48.411
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1694
00:41:48.411 --> 00:41:48.680
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1695
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1696
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:53.980
<v Speaker 4>it's the thing about the palm is it's not much softer and punching somebody.</v>

1697
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.940
<v Speaker 4>But you don't hurt your hand at all.</v>

1698
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.810
<v Speaker 4>Like if you got a guy like Bas Rutten who really knows how to do it well,</v>

1699
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.760
<v Speaker 4>like boss has weird wrists.</v>

1700
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.070
<v Speaker 4>He could pull his hand way further than I can.</v>

1701
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 4>Like he pulls his hand way back,</v>

1702
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 4>like he gets his hand like back there.</v>

1703
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.150
<v Speaker 4>So he's basically just fucking palm some words on it.</v>

1704
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.410
<v Speaker 4>I bet he does.</v>

1705
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:14.210
<v Speaker 4>That's embarrassing.</v>

1706
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:15.043
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1707
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:20.710
<v Speaker 4>So what happens with college Jujitsu is the importance of the positions change.</v>

1708
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.290
<v Speaker 4>Like all of a sudden when there's palm strikes,</v>

1709
00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.810
<v Speaker 4>full guard is garde.</v>

1710
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:26.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1711
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Garde would be trouble.</v>

1712
00:42:27.891 --> 00:42:30.170
<v Speaker 4>You can't be half card like necessary.</v>

1713
00:42:30.171 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 4>And all of Jiu Jitsu.</v>

1714
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 4>There's guys that when Abu Dhabi multiple times never put anybody in there full</v>

1715
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:35.480
<v Speaker 4>guard.</v>

1716
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.680
<v Speaker 4>It's so unnecessary.</v>

1717
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 4>But when there's palm strikes,</v>

1718
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.550
<v Speaker 4>it's the most important.</v>

1719
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 4>So it's better to prepare for MMA with that.</v>

1720
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:43.880
<v Speaker 4>That's what's,</v>

1721
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.930
<v Speaker 4>that's another reason.</v>

1722
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.960
<v Speaker 4>So aspiring grapplers that want to start working on like MMA type Jujitsu and</v>

1723
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.380
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu positions and focus on the positions that are going to translate to MMA.</v>

1724
00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 4>Better Combat Jujitsu.</v>

1725
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.070
<v Speaker 4>We'll get their fee sites,</v>

1726
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.140
<v Speaker 4>they'll get to practice,</v>

1727
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 4>you'll get to practice and then made Jujitsu without worrying about getting head</v>

1728
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:05.631
<v Speaker 4>kicked or something.</v>

1729
00:43:05.631 --> 00:43:06.200
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1730
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:06.980
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's for.</v>

1731
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:07.790
<v Speaker 4>It's for the,</v>

1732
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:09.500
<v Speaker 4>the Jujitsu fanatics.</v>

1733
00:43:09.501 --> 00:43:10.330
<v Speaker 4>Did they,</v>

1734
00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.800
<v Speaker 4>they like to see MMA when there's Jujitsu.</v>

1735
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.080
<v Speaker 4>Well with combat you did,</v>

1736
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be mostly Jujitsu.</v>

1737
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:16.423
<v Speaker 4>Well you know when,</v>

1738
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.980
<v Speaker 4>whenever they like move rules around and combat sports,</v>

1739
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:19.731
<v Speaker 4>it makes it interesting.</v>

1740
00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:23.030
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what they did with k one they took Moyie Thai and I said,</v>

1741

1754
00:43:40.731 --> 00:43:44.690
<v Speaker 4>Now we're going to get pure or animate style Jujitsu and we don't have to worry</v>

1755
00:43:44.691 --> 00:43:45.411
<v Speaker 4>about the striking.</v>

1759
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get some,</v>

1760
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 4>a lot of data on what leg lock positions are going to go out the door.</v>

1764
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.680
<v Speaker 4>but when they're striking,</v>

1765

1766
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.430
<v Speaker 4>Let's just stick with these right here and that's what we're going to find that</v>

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.753
<v Speaker 2>Jay here you,</v>

1884
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Heather's a monster.</v>

1885
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.700
<v Speaker 2>But her control of distance was what's important.</v>

1886
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And when she was standing in front of her,</v>

1887
00:47:22.201 --> 00:47:24.980
<v Speaker 2>she would kick and then she'd move to another angle and mix it up.</v>

1888
00:47:24.981 --> 00:47:25.621
<v Speaker 2>John Stop.</v>

1889
00:47:25.621 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 2>And Heather's wanted to kind of getting close and play that dirty boxing game.</v>

1890
00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1891
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.370
<v Speaker 2>big thing was the distance.</v>

1892
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:31.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1893
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Christina Williams was fighting completely outside.</v>

1894
00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you've got to close the distance and you can't throw kicks,</v>

1895
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a boxer and you can't throw kicks and the other person can box a</v>

1896
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:43.810
<v Speaker 3>little and they can kick good like his girl,</v>

1897
00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Ken,</v>

1898
00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.040
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked man.</v>

1899
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.130
<v Speaker 3>Those kicks hit you a couple of times and the arms and all of sudden those arms</v>

1900
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 3>don't work so good anymore.</v>

1901
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:49.871
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1902
00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:50.321
<v Speaker 3>and then you're,</v>

1903
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:51.330
<v Speaker 3>you're Super Turkey.</v>

1904
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:51.931
<v Speaker 3>No rhythm.</v>

1905
00:47:51.931 --> 00:47:52.721
<v Speaker 3>Then you see Heather,</v>

1906
00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:56.470
<v Speaker 3>then she tried rolling like you do from a left hook or something like that and</v>

1907
00:47:56.471 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 3>that fucking kick hit her so hard man Shin right to the face.</v>

1908
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:01.740
<v Speaker 3>And your nose is just destroyed.</v>

1909
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.880
<v Speaker 3>Like she's never going to look the same again.</v>

1910
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty girl to,</v>

1911
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:05.771
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1912
00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:06.790
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have to redo her.</v>

1913
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:10.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a bummer cause you know the or belters bank on her to kind of be the next</v>

1914
00:48:10.181 --> 00:48:13.690
<v Speaker 3>big thing to care that women's division kills her.</v>

1915
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:17.920
<v Speaker 3>But that kind of loss is a tough one because you get your face caved in again.</v>

1916
00:48:17.921 --> 00:48:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Your face cave did is not just loose on about cyborg style.</v>

1917
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:21.820
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bennett page.</v>

1918
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:22.600
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1919
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1920
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:25.960
<v Speaker 3>the face is so fucked up like that.</v>

1921
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:26.361
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>

1922
00:48:26.361 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 3>you just got to wonder like how long would it take before that girl could even</v>

1923
00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:29.680
<v Speaker 3>fight again?</v>

1924
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Did you see Michael Venom page professional boxing debut?</v>

1925
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Granted the fuck he fought was foreign 70 whatever.</v>

1926
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.500
<v Speaker 3>He murked that dude and he did it in a weird way.</v>

1927
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Hands Down,</v>

1928
00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.110
<v Speaker 3>leaped for the straight right,</v>

1929
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.990
<v Speaker 3>blasted him and then just stepped on the ropes and looked away.</v>

1930
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:44.910
<v Speaker 3>How exciting is that?</v>

1931
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.641
<v Speaker 3>He's fun,</v>

1932
00:48:45.641 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1933
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:51.360
<v Speaker 3>He would be a big star in the UFC and Bella Bella tour.</v>

1934
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:52.060
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

1935
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 3>they just do not get the credit that they deserve.</v>

1936
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:55.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1937
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:56.321
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1938
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 3>No one gets the credit they deserve,</v>

1939
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:58.600
<v Speaker 3>but you know he's a big star,</v>

1940
00:48:58.601 --> 00:48:59.440
<v Speaker 3>but they're like in London,</v>

1941
00:48:59.441 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 3>he's a big Kim and Paul Daley is going to happen.</v>

1942
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1943
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.610
<v Speaker 3>Well I hope it happens.</v>

1944
00:49:03.611 --> 00:49:04.444
<v Speaker 3>It's going to happen.</v>

1945
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.860
<v Speaker 3>It is a video.</v>

1946
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1947
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:08.690
<v Speaker 3>you find a video of the pumps.</v>

1948
00:49:08.691 --> 00:49:09.040
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1949
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.030
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of crazy.</v>

1950
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Watch how he does this,</v>

1951
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:14.591
<v Speaker 3>his style,</v>

1952
00:49:14.591 --> 00:49:14.980
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1953
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:16.030
<v Speaker 3>oh</v>

1954
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:20.681
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1955
00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:22.680
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of comical that.</v>

1956
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:27.250
<v Speaker 3>That's a serious right hand holds so much stepping into it.</v>

1957
00:49:27.251 --> 00:49:28.510
<v Speaker 3>So much momentum behind that.</v>

1958
00:49:28.511 --> 00:49:31.630
<v Speaker 3>Rory Macdonald's on my showtime at how you'd like to fight him eventually.</v>

1959
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1960
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:32.740
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a fun fight.</v>

1961
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Although if we're just taking the mantle him wrestling shoes with,</v>

1962
00:49:35.351 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 3>just pick them apart.</v>

1963
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.330
<v Speaker 3>He would dismantle them.</v>

1964
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.340
<v Speaker 3>The problem is Roy is not easy to hit.</v>

1965
00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:39.791
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1966
00:49:39.791 --> 00:49:40.210
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1967
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.380
<v Speaker 3>he's very good on his feet.</v>

1968
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Stay behind the jab if he wants it.</v>

1969
00:49:43.001 --> 00:49:44.920
<v Speaker 3>He got ahold of Michael and Michael's fucked,</v>

1970
00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.313
<v Speaker 3>which used to do.</v>

1971
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1972
00:49:46.571 --> 00:49:47.770
<v Speaker 3>he's just too high level.</v>

1973
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Rory has just one of the most comprehensive games,</v>

1974
00:49:50.651 --> 00:49:52.410
<v Speaker 3>the hundred 70 pound division in the world.</v>

1975
00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:53.530
<v Speaker 3>He's the best welterweight in the world.</v>

1976
00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.700
<v Speaker 3>He very well could be jail.</v>

1977
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:56.951
<v Speaker 3>He beat Woodley.</v>

1978
00:49:56.951 --> 00:49:57.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1979
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:58.330
<v Speaker 3>but then last,</v>

1980
00:49:58.330 --> 00:49:59.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1981
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.120
<v Speaker 3>I think you know what man?</v>

1982
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Hofeld dose on Joe's fighting Robbie Lawler.</v>

1983
00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.511
<v Speaker 3>God Damn,</v>

1984
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:05.410
<v Speaker 3>that's a good fight.</v>

1985
00:50:05.411 --> 00:50:06.010
<v Speaker 3>The good fight.</v>

1986
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:07.810
<v Speaker 3>They were going to learn a lot about dose on.</v>

1987
00:50:07.811 --> 00:50:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Joe said one 70 Dosantos at one 70 it looks like a fucking murderer.</v>

1988
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:16.090
<v Speaker 3>It looks like the same guy at one 55 I think when when he was making that mad</v>

1989
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Ron at one 55 you know when he got to the end and he lost the Alvarez,</v>

1990
00:50:19.751 --> 00:50:21.100
<v Speaker 3>he was just cutting too much way.</v>

1991
00:50:21.101 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't do it anymore.</v>

1992
00:50:22.121 --> 00:50:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Too much weight and now you see him at one 75 it looks more comfortable.</v>

1993
00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:28.850
<v Speaker 3>It's got more power and he's beating the fuck out of people.</v>

1994
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:30.770
<v Speaker 3>And then she ate Neil magni though.</v>

1995
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Fuck ate a mom.</v>

1996
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm a grand through him.</v>

1997
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:35.780
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like a world champion fighting a journeyman.</v>

1998
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:36.630
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was like.</v>

1999
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have been a journeyman.</v>

2000
00:50:37.881 --> 00:50:38.714
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2001
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.201
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2002
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:39.861
<v Speaker 3>I love you Neil.</v>

2003
00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:42.290
<v Speaker 3>But it looked like fucking amateur hour.</v>

2004
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.640
<v Speaker 3>He smashed him.</v>

2005
00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:44.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2006
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Neil's always going to have problems with the real elite guys on the ground.</v>

2007
00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Grapplers is just,</v>

2008
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:49.760
<v Speaker 3>that's his downfall.</v>

2009
00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:50.600
<v Speaker 3>That's an Achilles heel.</v>

2010
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Everyone else he influx with tell them gas slim.</v>

2011
00:50:53.401 --> 00:50:54.950
<v Speaker 3>He's beat top level guys,</v>

2012
00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:55.850
<v Speaker 3>but if they're really,</v>

2013
00:50:55.851 --> 00:50:56.750
<v Speaker 3>really good on the ground,</v>

2014
00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 3>but let's be honest about why beat Calvin.</v>

2015
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.850
<v Speaker 3>Calvin was overweight and he came in and he tried to cut too much weight and he</v>

2016
00:51:01.851 --> 00:51:02.810
<v Speaker 3>was just diminished.</v>

2017
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.320
<v Speaker 3>I think Calvin in shape is just way too much for him.</v>

2018
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.280
<v Speaker 3>That's my opinion.</v>

2019
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:08.990
<v Speaker 3>I just think Calvin's one of the best in the world.</v>

2020
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying he's not,</v>

2021
00:51:10.251 --> 00:51:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying but matchup lies that Stephanie's can be a tough fight for Calvin.</v>

2022
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Calvin can do things to him that he can't do to Calvin.</v>

2023
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Calvin knocks people dead and he doesn't.</v>

2024
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Neil is like got incredible cardio Longreach but he just kind of picks guys upon</v>

2025
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:25.363
<v Speaker 3>range.</v>

2026
00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Deep arounds.</v>

2027
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Most impressed with him was when he fought a tester.</v>

2028
00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.920
<v Speaker 3>Hector Lombard Lombard had him dead.</v>

2029
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:35.750
<v Speaker 3>He had in my queer streaming pizza.</v>

2030
00:51:35.751 --> 00:51:36.441
<v Speaker 3>What you want about Neil,</v>

2031
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:37.730
<v Speaker 3>but he'd be Tiger Lombard,</v>

2032
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.950
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Hendricks and Kelvin Gas.</v>

2033
00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2034
00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:40.900
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2035
00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 3>We're up class and he's definitely a world class fighter,</v>

2036
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 3>but that's how good dose Angelo says.</v>

2037
00:51:45.021 --> 00:51:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Dos Anjos kicked him one time to Alexis his legs when he took him for him to</v>

2038
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:51.350
<v Speaker 3>these fucking took them down with a leg,</v>

2039
00:51:51.351 --> 00:51:52.400
<v Speaker 3>kick his ass up.</v>

2040
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Hey leg kicked him to the ground.</v>

2041
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:56.740
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen a size of dulse?</v>

2042
00:51:56.741 --> 00:52:00.740
<v Speaker 3>San Angelo says legs at one 72 she shows so much bigger.</v>

2043
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.560
<v Speaker 3>It's just so much healthier for him to all these.</v>

2044
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.393
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2045
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Dina said something recently that he doesn't think that a more weight classes</v>

2046
00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:10.250
<v Speaker 3>are the solution to weight cutting.</v>

2047
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:11.370
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>

2048
00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:14.480
<v Speaker 3>The solution wherever we're doing is not working because there's no one misses</v>

2049
00:52:14.481 --> 00:52:15.171
<v Speaker 3>more weight than that.</v>

2050
00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 3>55 and 70 well how about Kevin Lee?</v>

2051
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:18.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2052
00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Kevin,</v>

2053
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.600
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2054
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.280
<v Speaker 3>if they're,</v>

2055
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.720
<v Speaker 3>if they've got everything locked down,</v>

2056
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:25.250
<v Speaker 3>how does Kevin Lee barely make it to one 55 it looks like he's on death's door</v>

2057
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.290
<v Speaker 3>and he's 19 pounds over two days.</v>

2058
00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Who has it locked down?</v>

2059
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:29.174
<v Speaker 3>You're saying?</v>

2060
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:31.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying they don't have it locked fuck sets.</v>

2061
00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 3>It's the biggest issue.</v>

2062
00:52:33.171 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Well besides some other things,</v>

2063
00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:37.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of the biggest issues in our sport and now Kevin has said,</v>

2064
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Kevin has said he can't do it anymore.</v>

2065
00:52:39.381 --> 00:52:39.830
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna,</v>

2066
00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:40.640
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna move up.</v>

2067
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.510
<v Speaker 3>He said this weight cut.</v>

2068
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:42.413
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

2069
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2070
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.220
<v Speaker 3>he's got to move up.</v>

2071
00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:44.180
<v Speaker 3>That's staffing helping.</v>

2072
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:45.803
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2073
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.750
<v Speaker 3>it's going to one seven.</v>

2074
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:47.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2075
00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:49.680
<v Speaker 3>You just got to do same day when yeah,</v>

2076
00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.290
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2077
00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:51.380
<v Speaker 3>nobody will take a chance.</v>

2078
00:52:51.381 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Speaker 3>No one would kill themselves if it's same day when they wouldn't take a chance.</v>

2079
00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:57.200
<v Speaker 3>That's why like Ibj Jab does that.</v>

2080
00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Ebi does that same day.</v>

2081
00:52:58.941 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 3>You're going to take a chance.</v>

2082
00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:00.741
<v Speaker 3>You can't take a chance.</v>

2083
00:53:00.741 --> 00:53:04.950
<v Speaker 3>You just got to compete at what you're really at all understanding covered.</v>

2084
00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:06.020
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>

2085
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:06.321

2087
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.840
<v Speaker 3>We can cut all this and kill myself.</v>

2088
00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:10.700
<v Speaker 3>I'll have 24 hours to recover.</v>

2089
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 3>And you don't have like I'd be dead jam.</v>

2090
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 3>They make you weigh in and then you fight.</v>

2091
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.823
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2092
00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.810
<v Speaker 3>Looking at him there,</v>

2093
00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:18.170
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2094
00:53:18.171 --> 00:53:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I love Kevin.</v>

2095
00:53:19.311 --> 00:53:19.701
<v Speaker 3>He knows,</v>

2096
00:53:19.701 --> 00:53:22.490
<v Speaker 3>but you know Tony cut a bunch of weight.</v>

2097
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.211
<v Speaker 3>He figured it out.</v>

2098
00:53:23.211 --> 00:53:23.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2099
00:53:23.391 --> 00:53:26.790
<v Speaker 3>But Tony was like three pounds over like a couple days out.</v>

2100
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:27.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2101
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:29.940
<v Speaker 3>But like two weeks before Tony and Tony goes down,</v>

2102
00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:31.090
<v Speaker 3>he has it down to us.</v>

2103
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 3>He's a soldier dude.</v>

2104
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:32.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2105
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:33.683
<v Speaker 3>but they don't fucking know.</v>

2106
00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 3>But it also,</v>

2112
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2113
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.690
<v Speaker 3>we can't put any money on them.</v>

2114
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.670
<v Speaker 3>You can congress never going fight him.</v>

2115
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:45.930
<v Speaker 3>He's not fighting Tony next.</v>

2116
00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Tony don't want to fight him.</v>

2117
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2118
00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.100

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:47.700
<v Speaker 3>you can't even make it.</v>

2120
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Wait.</v>

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Barboza maybe who's going to type our buzzer?</v>

2122
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Beep is,</v>

2123
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.213
<v Speaker 3>it can be</v>

2124
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:55.433
<v Speaker 3>a Bentley.</v>

2125
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:58.500
<v Speaker 3>He's got according to Cormier and he's got a new nutritionist and the</v>

2126
00:53:58.501 --> 00:53:59.760
<v Speaker 3>nutritionist has got him on point.</v>

2127
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2128
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a discipline issue.</v>

2129
00:54:01.501 --> 00:54:02.370
<v Speaker 3>It's got to keep the Tiramisu.</v>

2130
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.781
<v Speaker 3>Tiramisu.</v>

2131
00:54:03.781 --> 00:54:04.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck if,</v>

2132
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2133
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:06.810
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a discipline issue,</v>

2134
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:08.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's also a psychological issue.</v>

2135
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:09.510
<v Speaker 3>You think Tony is going to fight.</v>

2136
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Conor,</v>

2137
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 3>you think that's going down?</v>

2138
00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 3>I asked to make us host.</v>

2139
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:17.090
<v Speaker 3>Conor made that post to Tony Today.</v>

2140
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 3>He made an instrument.</v>

2141
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.630
<v Speaker 3>The GTA post.</v>

2142
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2143
00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Grand theft auto with him holding a gun or driving a boat.</v>

2144
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.433
<v Speaker 3>Cause Tony did it.</v>

2145
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Cause Tony had at first,</v>

2146
00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:24.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2147
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Well Tony was talking shit about him.</v>

2148
00:54:25.731 --> 00:54:27.110
<v Speaker 3>He called the mcnugget and all this stuff.</v>

2149
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Tony Post,</v>

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:28.523
<v Speaker 3>he's a shit,</v>

2151
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:33.060
<v Speaker 3>but didn't Tony originally posted the GTA meme and then Connor responded with</v>

2152
00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:34.380
<v Speaker 3>his or vice versa.</v>

2153
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:35.580
<v Speaker 3>I think it's vice versa.</v>

2154
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:36.930
<v Speaker 3>I think Connor went out.</v>

2155
00:54:36.931 --> 00:54:37.201

2159
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2164
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:54.180
<v Speaker 3>And Tony,</v>

2165
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:54.870
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2166
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Tony has the longest winning streak in the UFC,</v>

2167
00:54:57.221 --> 00:54:58.680
<v Speaker 3>has 155 pound division.</v>

2168
00:54:58.681 --> 00:55:01.620
<v Speaker 3>He is the interim champion and he's the logical one.</v>

2169
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:03.300
<v Speaker 3>10 in a row for God's sakes.</v>

2170
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.800
<v Speaker 3>And the toughest division in the world.</v>

2171
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.000
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2172
00:55:06.001 --> 00:55:06.450
<v Speaker 3>No doubt.</v>

2173
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem at champion.</v>

2174
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:08.663
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem with that,</v>

2175
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:09.503
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2176
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:12.630
<v Speaker 3>I 100% think Connor has to fight Tony next.</v>

2177
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.580
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be taken serious and your legacy,</v>

2178
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:15.810
<v Speaker 3>you have to fight Tony.</v>

2179
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.010
<v Speaker 3>But if you're tall,</v>

2180
00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 3>if you're Connor's business decision makers,</v>

2181
00:55:20.431 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 3>you're going look at Tony's draw for paper view though.</v>

2182
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 3>This can be tough for us to sell this thing.</v>

2183
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2184
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:25.351
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2185
00:55:25.351 --> 00:55:27.030
<v Speaker 3>but not with Connor.</v>

2186
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Like Connor cells,</v>

2187
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 3>like fucking crazy and controversies Tony cells because Tony's a legit threat.</v>

2188
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:34.920
<v Speaker 3>Connor versus my mom sells.</v>

2189
00:55:34.921 --> 00:55:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2190
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.560
<v Speaker 3>But Connor verses a legit threat.</v>

2191
00:55:37.561 --> 00:55:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Cells like Connor fighting,</v>

2192
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:39.744
<v Speaker 3>someone sells.</v>

2193
00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:43.290
<v Speaker 3>But Connor verses a legit threat is where it gets interesting is the big fight.</v>

2194
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.240
<v Speaker 3>That's the big fire.</v>

2195
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:44.690
<v Speaker 3>All.</v>

2196
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:45.181
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2197
00:55:45.181 --> 00:55:45.841
<v Speaker 3>It's only Julio.</v>

2198
00:55:45.841 --> 00:55:46.321
<v Speaker 3>You kidding?</v>

2199
00:55:46.321 --> 00:55:47.400
<v Speaker 3>He's arrived everybody.</v>

2200
00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:48.420
<v Speaker 3>He's a character.</v>

2201
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:49.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2202
00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:49.741
<v Speaker 3>but Eddie,</v>

2203
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:50.574
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

2204
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:52.860
<v Speaker 3>But the paper view numbers were fucking terrible.</v>

2205
00:55:52.861 --> 00:55:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Awful.</v>

2206
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.173
<v Speaker 3>They're terrible.</v>

2207
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2208
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:55.763
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2209
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.360
<v Speaker 3>but don't get me wrong.</v>

2210
00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:58.320
<v Speaker 3>It takes two to tango.</v>

2211
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:01.160
<v Speaker 3>It does Connor.</v>

2212
00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.390
<v Speaker 3>But you're Kevin within reason,</v>

2213
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.840
<v Speaker 3>the biggest name on the planet.</v>

2214
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:04.141
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2215
00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:06.480
<v Speaker 3>everybody respects him in the game because they know he's a beast.</v>

2216
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.890
<v Speaker 3>He's coming up fucking people up,</v>

2217
00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 3>choking people out left and right.</v>

2218
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:10.191
<v Speaker 3>They know he's a beast,</v>

2219
00:56:10.191 --> 00:56:12.210
<v Speaker 3>but the world really didn't know him yet.</v>

2220
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2221
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.230
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2222
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:14.340
<v Speaker 3>The world doesn't know either of them.</v>

2223
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.860
<v Speaker 3>And there was a lot of concerning.</v>

2224
00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Now the world knows Tony.</v>

2225
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.230
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of customers,</v>

2226
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.120
<v Speaker 3>a lot of controversy.</v>

2227
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.450
<v Speaker 3>Penn,</v>

2228
00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:20.283
<v Speaker 3>Kevin's,</v>

2229
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Tony for sure.</v>

2230
00:56:22.381 --> 00:56:23.680
<v Speaker 3>The whole world doesn't know Tony,</v>

2231
00:56:23.681 --> 00:56:25.660
<v Speaker 3>but the MMA world knows Tony for sure.</v>

2232
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.210
<v Speaker 3>But the regular people,</v>

2233
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 3>the people that you need to get ahold of,</v>

2234
00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 3>nor to really buy paper views because the world knows nay.</v>

2235
00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:32.111
<v Speaker 3>And that's where,</v>

2236
00:56:32.111 --> 00:56:33.190
<v Speaker 3>that's a businessman,</v>

2237
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Doug WMS go,</v>

2238
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:34.931
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2239
00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:35.651
<v Speaker 3>let's do Nate,</v>

2240
00:56:35.651 --> 00:56:37.210
<v Speaker 3>which if you look at any poll,</v>

2241
00:56:37.211 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 3>I did a poll or Hawaii to pull him away,</v>

2242
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:39.820
<v Speaker 3>junkie.</v>

2243
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.391
<v Speaker 3>Everyone goes,</v>

2244
00:56:40.391 --> 00:56:40.541
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2245
00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:41.121
<v Speaker 3>Tony First,</v>

2246
00:56:41.121 --> 00:56:41.980
<v Speaker 3>since the fucking fight,</v>

2247
00:56:41.981 --> 00:56:43.810
<v Speaker 3>you're talking hundreds of thousands of votes.</v>

2248
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:44.120
<v Speaker 3>People go,</v>

2249
00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Tony Ferguson,</v>

2250
00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:45.483
<v Speaker 3>the next fight.</v>

2251
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.420
<v Speaker 3>But WME is going,</v>

2252
00:56:46.421 --> 00:56:46.571
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2253
00:56:46.571 --> 00:56:47.950
<v Speaker 3>put the money's over here.</v>

2254
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.050
<v Speaker 3>But the nae fights not going anywhere.</v>

2255
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.340
<v Speaker 3>And how long are you gonna let Connor play this kind of weird makeup,</v>

2256
00:56:54.341 --> 00:56:56.080
<v Speaker 3>a fight game thing with Nate.</v>

2257
00:56:56.110 --> 00:57:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Nate made 4 million bucks over two fights and he don't give a fuck.</v>

2258
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:01.241
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2259
00:57:01.241 --> 00:57:02.680
<v Speaker 3>pay me.</v>

2260
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:03.730
<v Speaker 3>You gotta pay me.</v>

2261
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.940
<v Speaker 3>But he's gone pay for what you're,</v>

2262
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.480
<v Speaker 3>you've lost four the last seven.</v>

2263
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.470
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2264
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2265
00:57:08.771 --> 00:57:11.020
<v Speaker 3>But he beat Conner and then the second fight,</v>

2266
00:57:11.021 --> 00:57:13.030
<v Speaker 3>he arguably how to draw with Connor,</v>

2267
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.983
<v Speaker 3>but he lost.</v>

2268
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.200
<v Speaker 3>He lost a decision based on a couple of people's opinion,</v>

2269
00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.270
<v Speaker 3>but I think if you went and saw the attars Joe,</v>

2270
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:20.170
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2271
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

2272
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Public opinion means a lot.</v>

2273
00:57:22.361 --> 00:57:25.210
<v Speaker 3>If you went online and you ask people who you think won that fight,</v>

2274
00:57:25.211 --> 00:57:28.240
<v Speaker 3>I bet you would get very close to 50 58 versus Connor.</v>

2275
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter.</v>

2276
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:32.350
<v Speaker 3>But then when Lassi does matter in terms of how you sell the fight,</v>

2277
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.420
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't because to sell the fight,</v>

2278
00:57:34.421 --> 00:57:34.700
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2279
00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:36.190
<v Speaker 3>if Nate would have won,</v>

2280
00:57:36.191 --> 00:57:38.290
<v Speaker 3>if those three people and have a winning,</v>

2281
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.430
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a third fight</v>

2282
00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 3>fight after he beats twice in a row after you beat Eddie Alvarez,</v>

2283
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:48.580
<v Speaker 3>you absolutely could have a third fight.</v>

2284
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:49.721
<v Speaker 3>He absolutely,</v>

2285
00:57:49.721 --> 00:57:51.010
<v Speaker 3>especially not if they beat them twice.</v>

2286
00:57:51.011 --> 00:57:51.910
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

2287
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.721
<v Speaker 3>Not True.</v>

2288
00:57:52.721 --> 00:57:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Especially if he beat him by the same decision.</v>

2289
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:58.060
<v Speaker 3>If the had the exact same fight and Nate one that decision,</v>

2290
00:57:58.090 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 3>which was entirely feasible,</v>

2291
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:00.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2292
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:03.610
<v Speaker 3>The second fight was so close that you could easily have given it to Nate.</v>

2293
00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.590
<v Speaker 3>If Nate winds that second fight,</v>

2294
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 3>she's beaten them twice in a row,</v>

2295
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:07.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2296
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:10.780
<v Speaker 3>think to after condor knocks out Eddie Alvarez the way he did.</v>

2297
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:11.830
<v Speaker 3>If Connor fought Alvarez,</v>

2298
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:12.664
<v Speaker 3>knocked him out.</v>

2299
00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 3>You don't think you could sell a third fight because it was so god damn razor</v>

2300
00:58:15.881 --> 00:58:16.714
<v Speaker 3>close.</v>

2301
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:17.081
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

2302
00:58:17.081 --> 00:58:17.301
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2303
00:58:17.301 --> 00:58:17.891
<v Speaker 3>and to,</v>

2304
00:58:17.891 --> 00:58:20.070
<v Speaker 3>I guess here you're looking at the numbers.</v>

2305
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:24.340
<v Speaker 3>You see the problem with decisions is these decisions are solidified by three</v>

2306
00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:27.400
<v Speaker 3>people that oftentimes don't even have a fucking background in MMA.</v>

2307
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:29.620
<v Speaker 3>Correct decisions off all the time.</v>

2308
00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean a lot to me.</v>

2309
00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.760
<v Speaker 3>What it means a lot to me is how close to fight was.</v>

2310
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 3>That's what means a lot to me.</v>

2311
00:58:35.201 --> 00:58:36.580
<v Speaker 3>If a guy goes over to see me,</v>

2312
00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:37.600
<v Speaker 3>touch somebody on the trilogy,</v>

2313
00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:39.220
<v Speaker 3>what do we get more cards from that fight?</v>

2314
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.671
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2315
00:58:39.671 --> 00:58:44.671
<v Speaker 3>474748474847 that's his fucking close as it gets.</v>

2316
00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:46.270
<v Speaker 3>It's a majority decision.</v>

2317
00:58:46.271 --> 00:58:48.250
<v Speaker 3>One guy scored it a draw.</v>

2318
00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:49.570
<v Speaker 3>Glenn Trowbridge.</v>

2319
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.970
<v Speaker 3>I do not remember what I thought,</v>

2320
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.620
<v Speaker 3>whether I thought it was uh,</v>

2321
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:54.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2322
00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:56.170
<v Speaker 3>went to Connor or went to,</v>

2323
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:56.531
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2324
00:58:56.531 --> 00:58:58.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've watched it again.</v>

2325
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure I only watched that fight.</v>

2326
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.020
<v Speaker 3>It was a close fucking fight.</v>

2327
00:59:02.021 --> 00:59:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Very super razor close.</v>

2328
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:08.790
<v Speaker 3>We've seen decisions like in fights that weren't as close go to the other,</v>

2329
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.660
<v Speaker 3>but no one got robbed in that fight.</v>

2330
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:13.870
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say Nate got robbed.</v>

2331
00:59:13.871 --> 00:59:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I would say that it's a controversial decision because anytime you have a</v>

2332
00:59:17.201 --> 00:59:18.130
<v Speaker 3>majority decision,</v>

2333
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:20.110
<v Speaker 3>there's some controversy to it.</v>

2334
00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.990
<v Speaker 3>But my point is you could easily sell that fight,</v>

2335
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.010
<v Speaker 3>even if Connor,</v>

2336
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 3>even if needed one.</v>

2337
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I think there's other sites,</v>

2338
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.633
<v Speaker 3>bigger fights,</v>

2339
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.500
<v Speaker 3>if you know what is,</v>

2340
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 3>what does a bigger fight if Nate fought Conor,</v>

2341
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>

2342
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 3>You think there's a bigger fight than that.</v>

2343
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 3>If you're saying,</v>

2344
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.491
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

2345
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2346
00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 3>what do you say?</v>

2347
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.901
<v Speaker 3>Trying to fight you.</v>

2348
00:59:38.901 --> 00:59:40.880
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying if Nate beat them twice,</v>

2349
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.160
<v Speaker 3>the third fights can be the big fight.</v>

2350
00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Right now you see this beat?</v>

2351
00:59:44.811 --> 00:59:45.261
<v Speaker 3>I'm stuff.</v>

2352
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:46.460
<v Speaker 3>It's the same exact fight.</v>

2353
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.701
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2354
00:59:46.701 --> 00:59:48.170
<v Speaker 3>The same exact fight takes place.</v>

2355
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:48.981
<v Speaker 3>God Damn Man.</v>

2356
00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:51.200
<v Speaker 3>When they lose the same exact fight,</v>

2357
00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.610
<v Speaker 3>the same exact fight,</v>

2358
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.860
<v Speaker 3>those three random fucking people,</v>

2359
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:55.851
<v Speaker 3>they decide,</v>

2360
00:59:55.851 --> 00:59:56.301
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2361
00:59:56.301 --> 01:00:01.301
<v Speaker 3>this 47 47 I'm going to go 48 47 Diaz and then the 48 47 goes,</v>

2362
01:00:02.781 --> 01:00:03.350
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2363
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the opposite.</v>

2364
01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:09.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 48 it's not a make believe world cause it's entirely feasible that</v>

2365
01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:10.520
<v Speaker 3>that could have done that ever happen.</v>

2366
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:11.071
<v Speaker 3>And Tony,</v>

2367
01:00:11.071 --> 01:00:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ and you listening to me,</v>

2368
01:00:12.621 --> 01:00:15.950
<v Speaker 3>it's entirely possible that that could have happened in the exact same fight.</v>

2369
01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.330
<v Speaker 3>It's still the same fight.</v>

2370
01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.100
<v Speaker 3>The see the fight was very close.</v>

2371
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Those guys were rivals,</v>

2372
01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:23.160
<v Speaker 3>man in Nate choked him the fuck out and the correct,</v>

2373
01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2374
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 3>That's always going to be there.</v>

2375
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:28.800
<v Speaker 3>So even if Connor like got real close Connor,</v>

2376
01:00:28.801 --> 01:00:31.790
<v Speaker 3>such a superstar that if he lost a close decision,</v>

2377
01:00:31.791 --> 01:00:32.624
<v Speaker 3>the second fight,</v>

2378
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 3>you get absolutely make an argument for a third fight,</v>

2379
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:38.580
<v Speaker 3>especially with one or two spectacular performances like the Eddie Alvarez.</v>

2380
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.910
<v Speaker 3>So if we're going off that we can do any fight.</v>

2381
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

2382
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 3>let's do Joseph Aldo.</v>

2383
01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:43.041
<v Speaker 3>He could say,</v>

2384
01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh that was a freak accident.</v>

2385
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:44.841
<v Speaker 3>13 seconds.</v>

2386
01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:45.674
<v Speaker 3>Let's run that back.</v>

2387
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.340
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge aspect for sure.</v>

2388
01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:50.780
<v Speaker 3>And then that's when Eddie Alvarez back,</v>

2389
01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:53.590
<v Speaker 3>if you'd be stressing the thing about a yard and he stops,</v>

2390
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.940
<v Speaker 3>he beat the shit out of Eddie Alvarez and then knocked him out.</v>

2391
01:00:55.941 --> 01:00:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Eddie was never in that fight.</v>

2392
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.260
<v Speaker 3>All the spring Chatman is back cause he did it.</v>

2393
01:01:00.261 --> 01:01:01.580
<v Speaker 3>He took it on a six week,</v>

2394
01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.410
<v Speaker 3>six day notice on a bad idea.</v>

2395
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:06.230
<v Speaker 3>But Chad [inaudible] one 45 you know what I'm saying?</v>

2396
01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:07.010
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

2397
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:08.110
<v Speaker 3>you saying like why?</v>

2398
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>

2399
01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:10.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying and the,</v>

2400
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.601
<v Speaker 3>the Nate fight,</v>

2401
01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 3>it could've went either way but that it didn't happen.</v>

2402
01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:16.190
<v Speaker 3>So you can make common in any fights can be big,</v>

2403
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 3>but losing does matter.</v>

2404
01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:19.064
<v Speaker 3>It then today to the,</v>

2405
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.270
<v Speaker 3>to the general population,</v>

2406
01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:20.930
<v Speaker 3>it does matter.</v>

2407
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:21.681
<v Speaker 3>It does matter.</v>

2408
01:01:21.681 --> 01:01:25.040
<v Speaker 3>But when the fights are the exacts and you could easily see the,</v>

2409
01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:26.570
<v Speaker 3>the decision go one way or the other,</v>

2410
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2411
01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2412
01:01:27.381 --> 01:01:28.700
<v Speaker 3>there's fights that you've watched.</v>

2413
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.511
<v Speaker 3>We say,</v>

2414
01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:30.051
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2415
01:01:30.051 --> 01:01:31.070
<v Speaker 3>the guy got the decision,</v>

2416
01:01:31.071 --> 01:01:31.521
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

2417
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.211
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with it.</v>

2418
01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:34.630
<v Speaker 3>You just said that with Musashi for sure,</v>

2419
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.070
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2420
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:36.020
<v Speaker 3>It happens all the time.</v>

2421
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.250
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the game.</v>

2422
01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:37.971
<v Speaker 3>I look at that.</v>

2423
01:01:37.971 --> 01:01:38.271
<v Speaker 3>If I,</v>

2424
01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:39.410
<v Speaker 3>if I look at a fight like that,</v>

2425
01:01:39.411 --> 01:01:41.000
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely want to see that fight again.</v>

2426
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if one guy got a decision from three people that I don't agree</v>

2427
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:45.710
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2428
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:46.310
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

2429
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:47.143
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

2430
01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:52.280
<v Speaker 3>I guess we're kind of saying the same thing I'm saying Amy fight Conor does is</v>

2431
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:52.821
<v Speaker 3>going to be big.</v>

2432
01:01:52.821 --> 01:01:52.941
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2433
01:01:52.941 --> 01:01:53.330
<v Speaker 3>the heat,</v>

2434
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:54.920
<v Speaker 3>any fight contract and you can be big,</v>

2435
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:58.020
<v Speaker 3>but I think we both agree that the big money's in the Nate Diaz fight.</v>

2436
01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2437
01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 3>And I think the smart thing to do the big money would be in the Nate Diaz fight.</v>

2438
01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Even if they beat him in the second fight.</v>

2439
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:04.873
<v Speaker 3>I really think that,</v>

2440
01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.773
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with you.</v>

2441
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:08.330
<v Speaker 3>I do because I think Conor is a giant superstar.</v>

2442
01:02:08.331 --> 01:02:10.790
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to be less of a superstar and I think Nate would be a bigger</v>

2443
01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:11.150
<v Speaker 3>star.</v>

2444
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 3>How many times in calculus two worth more money if Nate beat him in the second</v>

2445
01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:15.944
<v Speaker 3>fight?</v>

2446
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:17.010
<v Speaker 3>I think Holly,</v>

2447
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I think Nate would be a bigger star.</v>

2448
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Tony and Conor is about as big biggest fight you can get in the lightweight</v>

2449
01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:24.600
<v Speaker 3>division in the UFC history,</v>

2450
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.780
<v Speaker 3>Tony in UFC history and UFC history.</v>

2451
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:31.490
<v Speaker 3>Tony Against Carter and that's like Duran vs Leonard.</v>

2452
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's the biggest fight,</v>

2453
01:02:32.971 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's not like it's up there.</v>

2454
01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:40.120
<v Speaker 3>It's what the among the best lightweight a unification.</v>

2455
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Connor's coming off of the Floyd Mayweather hundred people.</v>

2456
01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:43.773
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2457
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.813
<v Speaker 3>Let's say if Nate,</v>

2458
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.141
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2459
01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:47.520
<v Speaker 3>any before you rip my head off,</v>

2460
01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.450
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2461
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 3>Tony and Conor,</v>

2462
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.000
<v Speaker 3>100% on these topics.</v>

2463
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:52.800
<v Speaker 3>He's a star in our world,</v>

2464
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 3>in the pot,</v>

2465
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.960
<v Speaker 3>in the big world.</v>

2466
01:02:54.961 --> 01:02:55.560
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>

2467
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.710
<v Speaker 3>He's a star dog.</v>

2468
01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Let's say.</v>

2469
01:02:58.930 --> 01:02:59.610
<v Speaker 3>Hold on a second.</v>

2470
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:01.470
<v Speaker 3>You think you can go to the gas station right now and go,</v>

2471
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:02.304
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2472
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.420
<v Speaker 3>who's Tony Ferguson?</v>

2473
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Depends on the guy who's there.</v>

2474
01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:06.853
<v Speaker 3>They'll know</v>

2475
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.140
<v Speaker 3>WWE shirt,</v>

2476
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.590
<v Speaker 3>shirt on.</v>

2477
01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:12.423
<v Speaker 3>It all depends.</v>

2478
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 3>You go to the average person and asked them who?</v>

2479
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Nate Diaz is.</v>

2480
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Way more people going to know who he is.</v>

2481
01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:19.080
<v Speaker 3>Then Tony now,</v>

2482
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:19.681
<v Speaker 3>now hear me out.</v>

2483
01:03:19.681 --> 01:03:20.514
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

2484
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.790
<v Speaker 3>Nate Floyd Mayweather.</v>

2485
01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Is it still a bigger name?</v>

2486
01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.770
<v Speaker 3>Then they could do that.</v>

2487
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.410
<v Speaker 3>They could do a rematch and have another bid five bigger than Kukui,</v>

2488
01:03:28.411 --> 01:03:30.120
<v Speaker 3>but I'm talking about for the UFC.</v>

2489
01:03:30.121 --> 01:03:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Fuck everyone outside the UFC.</v>

2490
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:35.130
<v Speaker 3>UFC has millions and millions of fun dates of bigger name all over the world.</v>

2491
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.330
<v Speaker 3>All over the world.</v>

2492
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:38.050
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2493
01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:39.570
<v Speaker 3>he has the interim belt.</v>

2494
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.520
<v Speaker 3>He has to fight him.</v>

2495
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:42.700
<v Speaker 3>I know you're,</v>

2496
01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.890
<v Speaker 3>why is there a discussion?</v>

2497
01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:47.040
<v Speaker 3>There's a discussion in terms of like as a purist,</v>

2498
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:47.580
<v Speaker 3>correct,</v>

2499
01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:48.080
<v Speaker 3>but Joe,</v>

2500
01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.160
<v Speaker 3>what if this was another fight?</v>

2501
01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:50.941
<v Speaker 3>Ufc Fan?</v>

2502
01:03:50.941 --> 01:03:51.301
<v Speaker 3>I'm right.</v>

2503
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:52.730
<v Speaker 3>As your average UFC fan,</v>

2504
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:56.370
<v Speaker 3>what if Nate fought Barboza or Khabib and beat them?</v>

2505
01:03:56.371 --> 01:03:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Think how big that Nate fight would be with Connor.</v>

2506
01:03:58.681 --> 01:03:59.970
<v Speaker 3>Then that's a big if though,</v>

2507
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.520
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that is Nate's lost.</v>

2508
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:02.250
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about it.</v>

2509
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:02.731
<v Speaker 3>If world,</v>

2510
01:04:02.731 --> 01:04:04.690
<v Speaker 3>right now we're talking with Connor lost it,</v>

2511
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:07.770
<v Speaker 3>but we're not right now because we're talking about what the pieces are in play</v>

2512
01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:08.460
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2513
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:08.970
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2514
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:09.211
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

2515
01:04:09.211 --> 01:04:10.170
<v Speaker 3>what do we have right in front of,</v>

2516
01:04:10.171 --> 01:04:10.981
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to do right now.</v>

2517
01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:12.450
<v Speaker 3>So if you're doing it right now,</v>

2518
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:13.651
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2519
01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:15.840
<v Speaker 3>if you're going by what the fans have voted,</v>

2520
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Tony would be the fight that the purists want.</v>

2521
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.210
<v Speaker 3>But this is the fans that listen to Ariel Helwani or you.</v>

2522
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.970
<v Speaker 3>These are hardcore people do.</v>

2523
01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:24.360
<v Speaker 3>In order to make money,</v>

2524
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.750
<v Speaker 3>you have to get those people and then you've got to get the people who know it</v>

2525
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:28.440
<v Speaker 3>peripherally.</v>

2526
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.360
<v Speaker 3>Well then Nate Diaz,</v>

2527
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:31.110
<v Speaker 3>we polyman nauseas the next fight.</v>

2528
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.190
<v Speaker 3>They don't even know Paulie Mala noche here.</v>

2529
01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.370
<v Speaker 3>They don't until he fights it.</v>

2530
01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Unless Connor fights in boxing.</v>

2531
01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.013
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2532
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.830
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

2533
01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:41.540
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

2534
01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.370
<v Speaker 3>they've taken all that out of context.</v>

2535
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Nate is the bigger fight,</v>

2536
01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:47.100
<v Speaker 3>no matter how we paint this picture,</v>

2537
01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 3>the re the fight you should do.</v>

2538
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Is Tony though,</v>

2539
01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.570
<v Speaker 3>do you think that Paulie Malignaggi versus Conor is a big to get Tony new</v>

2540
01:04:54.571 --> 01:04:55.170
<v Speaker 3>sunglasses?</v>

2541
01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that Pauline mile and algae versus Connor is a bigger fight in</v>

2542
01:04:58.951 --> 01:05:02.700
<v Speaker 3>boxing then Nate versus Connor is an MMA?</v>

2543
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:08.580
<v Speaker 3>I think whatever Connor does is as big as big,</v>

2544
01:05:08.581 --> 01:05:09.510
<v Speaker 3>but I think doesn't matter.</v>

2545
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:14.460
<v Speaker 3>I think Nate versus Connor is bigger in MMA then Paulie versus Connor is in.</v>

2546
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2547
01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.850
<v Speaker 3>because cause Paul is not like a Floyd Mayweather</v>

2548
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.920
<v Speaker 2>where he's going to get all those boxing fans.</v>

2549
01:05:20.921 --> 01:05:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Paul was good and he's a big names on showtime,</v>

2550
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:24.670
<v Speaker 2>but he's not Floyd Mayweather a big,</v>

2551
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:25.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2552
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2553
01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.690
<v Speaker 2>The whole Nate fricking fan base.</v>

2554
01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:29.800
<v Speaker 2>You got the Connor fan base,</v>

2555
01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:33.040
<v Speaker 2>then you have dubby WME behind that with the hype machine.</v>

2556
01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2557
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:35.430
<v Speaker 2>And they've severely lightened that.</v>

2558
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:36.850
<v Speaker 2>What a sanctions on weed.</v>

2559
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2560
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.920
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2561
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.440
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2562
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>but if you're WME,</v>

2563
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:40.900
<v Speaker 2>you're going,</v>

2564
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:41.990
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to make the most?</v>

2565
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:42.581
<v Speaker 2>Or I'm sorry,</v>

2566
01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:42.750
<v Speaker 2>knife.</v>

2567
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:43.241
<v Speaker 2>You're WME.</v>

2568
01:05:43.241 --> 01:05:45.830
<v Speaker 2>If you're Connors business planners,</v>

2569
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 2>you're going,</v>

2570
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.620
<v Speaker 2>how do we make the most money?</v>

2571
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a McGregor promotion in boxing.</v>

2572
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:51.580
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna make more money doing that.</v>

2573
01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:52.414
<v Speaker 2>Fighting Polly.</v>

2574
01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 2>It's safer than fighting Nate.</v>

2575
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Refining.</v>

2576
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Totally true.</v>

2577
01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:58.630
<v Speaker 2>But if Connor loses two in a row and boxing,</v>

2578
01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:02.460
<v Speaker 2>that's severely diminished as a star in MMA come.</v>

2579
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:03.440
<v Speaker 2>What's mmn?</v>

2580
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:04.001
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

2581
01:06:04.001 --> 01:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>they'll strip him of his belt if he fights another and we got a strip,</v>

2582
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:08.740
<v Speaker 2>they ain't doing shit to him.</v>

2583
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:10.740
<v Speaker 2>He did the USC.</v>

2584
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:11.583
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to do it.</v>

2585
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.350
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want every once you might find it heavyweight,</v>

2586
01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:15.101
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do that,</v>

2587
01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:15.881
<v Speaker 2>I can do shit to him.</v>

2588
01:06:15.881 --> 01:06:16.750
<v Speaker 2>He's too much of a drawl.</v>

2589
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:20.320
<v Speaker 2>But Tony or Nate is a dangerous fight.</v>

2590
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:20.891
<v Speaker 2>Either fight.</v>

2591

<v Speaker 2>Is it Tony?</v>

2592
01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

2593
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Tony and Nate are more dangerous than fighting poly.</v>

2594
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Does it say anything?</v>

2599

2734
01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I forgot to enter the first round.</v>

2735
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:38.510
<v Speaker 2>He escaped though.</v>

2736
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2737
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Kevin's a talented fucking dude.</v>

2738
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Talented young.</v>

2739
01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of that staph infection though.</v>

2740
01:09:44.331 --> 01:09:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2741
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 2>We're stuff I've ever seen.</v>

2742
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:47.210
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge,</v>

2743
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:48.380
<v Speaker 2>huge pause.</v>

2744
01:09:48.381 --> 01:09:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Filled.</v>

2745
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:49.783
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Ho.</v>

2746
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.350
<v Speaker 2>How bodied up is that dude?</v>

2747
01:09:51.351 --> 01:09:52.130
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

2748
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.630
<v Speaker 2>For real jacked.</v>

2749
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:54.801
<v Speaker 2>How would a fuck,</v>

2750
01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:56.570
<v Speaker 2>did he make one 55 too?</v>

2751
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Cause he looks all of one night.</v>

2752
01:09:58.190 --> 01:09:59.810
<v Speaker 2>He looked dead on the scale.</v>

2753
01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:00.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2754
01:10:00.231 --> 01:10:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You look like the crypt keeper.</v>

2755
01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.840
<v Speaker 2>He looked very bad,</v>

2756
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.540
<v Speaker 2>but that's a terrible staph infection.</v>

2757
01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what a Tony Evers,</v>

2758
01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Connor's a fun match up man.</v>

2759
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:08.780
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2760
01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a great fight.</v>

2761
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Tony has survivability.</v>

2762
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.990
<v Speaker 2>He's got crazy and he's great.</v>

2763
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.610
<v Speaker 2>He has crazy and in a good way.</v>

2764
01:10:16.611 --> 01:10:17.271
<v Speaker 2>He was crazy.</v>

2765
01:10:17.271 --> 01:10:18.051
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going to have to kill him?</v>

2766
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:20.330
<v Speaker 2>He can get things off from everywhere.</v>

2767
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.980
<v Speaker 2>He can beat you from the ground.</v>

2768
01:10:21.981 --> 01:10:23.030
<v Speaker 2>He could beat you standing.</v>

2769
01:10:23.031 --> 01:10:23.900
<v Speaker 2>He knock you out.</v>

2770
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:26.390
<v Speaker 2>He throws these weird off angle punches.</v>

2771
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:27.680
<v Speaker 2>He's got a great chin.</v>

2772
01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.440
<v Speaker 2>The super durable elbows from the guard.</v>

2773
01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>That was what changed.</v>

2774
01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.253
<v Speaker 2>So town together.</v>

2775
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:33.800
<v Speaker 2>That's where Kevin was in trouble.</v>

2776
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Most fighters don't know this.</v>

2777
01:10:35.181 --> 01:10:36.014
<v Speaker 2>They think that,</v>

2778
01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.810
<v Speaker 2>you know in the mount 12 to six is illegal.</v>

2779
01:10:38.811 --> 01:10:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2780
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:40.250
<v Speaker 2>These straight down,</v>

2781
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.900
<v Speaker 2>but not in the upside.</v>

2782
01:10:41.901 --> 01:10:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Down Mountain is full guard.</v>

2783
01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Six to 12 there's still the 12 to six was a or on their back.</v>

2784
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Those are totally legal.</v>

2785
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Mullins fighters still don't know that.</v>

2786
01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:51.440
<v Speaker 2>And that'll drone,</v>

2787
01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.101
<v Speaker 2>which is strange.</v>

2788
01:10:52.101 --> 01:10:52.730
<v Speaker 2>They don't throw them.</v>

2789
01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:53.231
<v Speaker 2>But you know who,</v>

2790
01:10:53.231 --> 01:10:54.740
<v Speaker 2>who was the master of that shit?</v>

2791
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Jose Palae land be oh gee.</v>

2792
01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.780
<v Speaker 2>He was the first Anderson Silva at shoot box.</v>

2793
01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.680
<v Speaker 2>That was the first one.</v>

2794
01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva was like his little protege.</v>

2795
01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:04.203
<v Speaker 2>Holy pay.</v>

2796
01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2797
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Jose paid Landy when he [inaudible] back in the late nineties and valid Tuta</v>

2798
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Mecca and all that stuff here.</v>

2799
01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Knuckle in high school gyms,</v>

2800
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 2>they had a rivalry.</v>

2801
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:14.850
<v Speaker 4>Macaca was up.</v>

2802
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:16.560
<v Speaker 4>He still fights now a Macaca was,</v>

2803
01:11:16.561 --> 01:11:17.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2804
01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 4>a Jujitsu guy and Palae was the Muay Thai guy.</v>

2805
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.340
<v Speaker 4>But anytime a cocker would take him down and full guard Paly would put his feet</v>

2806
01:11:23.341 --> 01:11:27.870
<v Speaker 4>on his hips and throw those 12 to six from the guard and fucking would brutalize</v>

2807
01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:28.704
<v Speaker 4>mutts on power.</v>

2808
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:32.340
<v Speaker 4>It's like you didn't want to take this if that's all you focused on.</v>

2809
01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.870
<v Speaker 4>Isn't the full bars train a lot of it.</v>

2810
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.320
<v Speaker 4>W W W there's,</v>

2811
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:36.630
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to train those,</v>

2812
01:11:36.631 --> 01:11:37.110
<v Speaker 4>but we,</v>

2813
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2814
01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:38.340
<v Speaker 4>in full guard would say,</v>

2815
01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.210
<v Speaker 4>remembering always,</v>

2816
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:39.770
<v Speaker 4>always.</v>

2817
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:40.603
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at Benson,</v>

2818
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:41.663
<v Speaker 4>it's part of the game.</v>

2819
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:42.900
<v Speaker 4>Rubber guard and elbows.</v>

2820
01:11:42.901 --> 01:11:46.410
<v Speaker 4>They work hand in hand and Jason Day fought Alan Belcher.</v>

2821
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:47.244
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

2822
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.353
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2823
01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:50.610
<v Speaker 4>Jason Day versus Alan Belcher.</v>

2824
01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:55.050
<v Speaker 4>He threw like 22 elbows from mission control trucks.</v>

2825
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.520
<v Speaker 4>It's part of the system.</v>

2826
01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:57.720
<v Speaker 4>If you can't get,</v>

2827
01:11:58.390 --> 01:12:01.840
<v Speaker 4>you can't get them in a position where you want them just get to Michigan drone</v>

2828
01:12:01.841 --> 01:12:02.640
<v Speaker 4>and throw elbows.</v>

2829
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.730
<v Speaker 4>But in that situation in Tony's fight,</v>

2830
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.700
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Lee didn't want to stay on his,</v>

2831
01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:10.110
<v Speaker 4>but he wanted Tony on the ground.</v>

2832
01:12:10.111 --> 01:12:12.980
<v Speaker 4>So when you have a situation like that where Tony's winning the standup,</v>

2833
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.920
<v Speaker 4>he wants to stand up,</v>

2834
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:16.890
<v Speaker 4>but you got a restaurant topic now you can put your feet,</v>

2835
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:21.980
<v Speaker 4>you can put your feet on the hips because if Kevin wanted to keep the fight</v>

2836
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:22.951
<v Speaker 4>standing,</v>

2837
01:12:22.951 --> 01:12:24.780
<v Speaker 4>let's say he was beating Tony Standing,</v>

2838
01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:28.200
<v Speaker 4>then Tony putting his feet on the hips would be bad because then Kevin would</v>

2839
01:12:28.201 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 4>stand up and now we've got to drag them to the ground again.</v>

2840
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:32.040
<v Speaker 4>But since Kevin didn't want to stand,</v>

2841
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:36.480
<v Speaker 4>now you're free to throw those 12 to six from the bottom.</v>

2842
01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:38.610
<v Speaker 4>You put the feet on the hips and cause he,</v>

2843
01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.770
<v Speaker 4>cause Kevin has to put the pressure so it's perfect.</v>

2844
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:45.780
<v Speaker 4>You just hold yourself up and you can't even fire back when you got your feet on</v>

2845
01:12:45.781 --> 01:12:47.970
<v Speaker 4>the hip where your knees are blocking the shoulders.</v>

2846
01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.800
<v Speaker 4>So dudes can't even fire back.</v>

2847
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.870
<v Speaker 4>And if you set the pace first,</v>

2848
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 4>he's got a block he doesn't have time to throw cause you're coming straight with</v>

2849
01:12:54.961 --> 01:12:55.710
<v Speaker 4>those elbows.</v>

2850
01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:56.543
<v Speaker 4>You watch that fight.</v>

2851
01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2852
01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 4>Kevin was,</v>

2853
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:00.620
<v Speaker 4>he was confused with the elbows that threw everything else.</v>

2854
01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Let's set up the submission.</v>

2855
01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:05.970
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what's interesting is in the fight with Tony and Conor say that's</v>

2856
01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:06.690
<v Speaker 4>next.</v>

2857
01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:07.770
<v Speaker 4>If Tony Goes,</v>

2858
01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:08.401
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

2859
01:13:08.401 --> 01:13:09.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna do my weird movement,</v>

2860
01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.260
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just going to grapple the fuck out of here.</v>

2861
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how good of a fight you have.</v>

2862
01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Cause Tony's amazing wrestler.</v>

2863
01:13:15.901 --> 01:13:19.020
<v Speaker 4>People don't realize how good of a restless so he could fight for Conor.</v>

2864
01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:20.320
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you that if Todd,</v>

2865
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.020
<v Speaker 4>if Tony doesn't want to be good fight,</v>

2866
01:13:22.021 --> 01:13:22.561
<v Speaker 4>if Tony Goes,</v>

2867
01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:22.920
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2868
01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.000
<v Speaker 4>You think of the best standing up.</v>

2869
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:24.960
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm the best.</v>

2870
01:13:24.961 --> 01:13:25.794
<v Speaker 4>Watch this.</v>

2871
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.010
<v Speaker 4>You have a classic on,</v>

2872
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.260
<v Speaker 4>but if Tony Goes,</v>

2873
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going back to my wrestling days,</v>

2874
01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:30.354
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>

2875
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:31.990
<v Speaker 4>It's not great for Connor.</v>

2876
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:34.130
<v Speaker 4>I will say the finishes him.</v>

2877
01:13:34.131 --> 01:13:36.150
<v Speaker 4>It's great if he gets Connor to ground,</v>

2878
01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:38.520
<v Speaker 4>beats him up and striving for Conor,</v>

2879
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.451
<v Speaker 4>for Tony.</v>

2880
01:13:39.451 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

2881
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:39.960
<v Speaker 4>No matter.</v>

2882
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2883
01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.150
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a dangerous fight for Conor.</v>

2884
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:44.040
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a very early stage for both guys.</v>

2885
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.300
<v Speaker 4>Super Dangerous Rocana.</v>

2886
01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.920
<v Speaker 4>Tony's the most dangerous guy.</v>

2887
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean that division by far.</v>

2888
01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:50.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2889
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2890
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:53.670
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't do anything to add about judging about,</v>

2891
01:13:53.671 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about the arbitrary three people.</v>

2892
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.570
<v Speaker 4>I thought.</v>

2893
01:13:56.570 --> 01:14:00.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a very flawed system and I think it's completely unnecessary</v>

2894
01:14:00.241 --> 01:14:00.930
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

2895
01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:05.760
<v Speaker 4>I think today with access to voting and online and vote,</v>

2896
01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:06.900
<v Speaker 4>not a fan vote,</v>

2897
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 4>a vote of experts,</v>

2898
01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:09.780
<v Speaker 4>a panel of experts.</v>

2899
01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.730
<v Speaker 4>You get a bunch of Jujitsu,</v>

2900
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 4>black</v>

2901
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.030
<v Speaker 3>belts that are,</v>

2902
01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:13.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2903
01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:16.750
<v Speaker 3>also a MMA journalists,</v>

2904
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:20.980
<v Speaker 3>a different referees and judges have a panel of like,</v>

2905
01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:21.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2906
01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 3>I guess who know what's going on.</v>

2907
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:24.700
<v Speaker 3>How does the Academy Awards work?</v>

2908
01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:25.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it works,</v>

2909
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 3>but I would assume it's a bunch of people that are experts business.</v>

2910
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.351
<v Speaker 3>We're in the business.</v>

2911
01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:29.870

01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:24.450
<v Speaker 3>The way he had his contracts set up was like they had a certain amount of money</v>

3161
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:28.140
<v Speaker 3>that he would have to pay if he had a sexual harassment claim against him.</v>

3162
01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:29.041
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

3163
01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:29.874
<v Speaker 3>it was a thing for him.</v>

3164
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:33.900
<v Speaker 3>Like he had so many claims that's like first offense was a hundred thousand</v>

3165
01:21:33.901 --> 01:21:34.501
<v Speaker 3>second offense.</v>

3166

<v Speaker 3>My 250003rd offense with $750,000 for third,</v>

3167
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:40.050
<v Speaker 3>fourth offense was a million.</v>

3168
01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.630
<v Speaker 3>Who would get it written into his fucking contract?</v>

3169
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:43.623
<v Speaker 3>Miramax,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they're protecting themselves,</v>

3176
01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.691
<v Speaker 3>show Ras.</v>

3177
01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 3>When they sacked him,</v>

3178
01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:55.951

01:22:01.711 --> 01:22:02.760
<v Speaker 3>it was so prominent.</v>

3185
01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3186
01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:03.871
<v Speaker 3>It was such a,</v>

3187
01:22:03.871 --> 01:22:04.150
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:06.690
<v Speaker 3>it was so known of what he would do.</v>

3189
01:22:06.691 --> 01:22:07.081
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>

3190
01:22:07.081 --> 01:22:09.610
<v Speaker 3>even Quentin Tarantino said that he did it to his ex girlfriend.</v>

3191
01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Quiet Taryn.</v>

3192
01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Tito said he knew about it.</v>

3193
01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:11.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3194
01:22:11.881 --> 01:22:13.770
<v Speaker 3>he did it to Mira Sorvino dude,</v>

3195
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.620
<v Speaker 3>and could Harvey Weinstein get any fucking uglier?</v>

3196
01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:18.860
<v Speaker 3>He's a kid.</v>

3197
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:20.120
<v Speaker 3>He's got a young ass wise,</v>

3198
01:22:20.121 --> 01:22:21.480
<v Speaker 3>so he looks like a troll.</v>

3199
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:25.230
<v Speaker 3>He know what he looks like is a sexual Predator in a Harvey Weinstein movie.</v>

3200
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>

3201
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Like it was a shitty lifetime movie.</v>

3202
01:22:27.751 --> 01:22:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3203
01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:28.411
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

3204
01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:30.510
<v Speaker 3>let's do a little bit of that legs unrealistic.</v>

3205
01:22:30.511 --> 01:22:31.231
<v Speaker 3>He's hideous.</v>

3206
01:22:31.231 --> 01:22:31.551
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3207
01:22:31.551 --> 01:22:31.871
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3208
01:22:31.871 --> 01:22:35.910
<v Speaker 3>I think he's so bad looking at the girls that he's harassing them.</v>

3209
01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Most of them bitches are fucking trash anyways.</v>

3210
01:22:38.701 --> 01:22:39.160
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3211
01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:39.250
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3212
01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:39.361
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3213
01:22:39.361 --> 01:22:39.571
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3214
01:22:39.571 --> 01:22:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Here's the crisis and distracted.</v>

3215
01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:42.480
<v Speaker 3>What about the kids?</v>

3216
01:22:42.481 --> 01:22:43.350
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them bitches.</v>

3217
01:22:43.351 --> 01:22:44.470
<v Speaker 3>What about the kids that's going on?</v>

3218
01:22:44.471 --> 01:22:45.271
<v Speaker 3>I don't focus on that.</v>

3219
01:22:45.271 --> 01:22:46.104
<v Speaker 3>Those girls are trash,</v>

3220
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.951
<v Speaker 3>just actress.</v>

3221
01:22:46.951 --> 01:22:47.760
<v Speaker 3>But here's the question.</v>

3222
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem was what Whitney told me when he says yes,</v>

3223
01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:51.601
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

3224
01:22:51.601 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 3>she knows her shit.</v>

3225
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:53.710
<v Speaker 3>What she said is she,</v>

3226
01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:58.380
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of girls that aren't saying a word because they did fuck them and</v>

3227
01:22:58.381 --> 01:22:59.760
<v Speaker 3>they caught them for parts.</v>

3228
01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:01.710
<v Speaker 3>They fucked him for like editing,</v>

3229
01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:02.161
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

3230
01:23:02.161 --> 01:23:05.050
<v Speaker 3>fucked him for a lot of things that Donald Trump.</v>

3231
01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:11.860
<v Speaker 3>But that this is like a standard thing that Weinstein would do and women agreed</v>

3232
01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:15.810
<v Speaker 3>to it because he was a power from mother fucker that could get them the world</v>

3233
01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:16.673
<v Speaker 3>hold up.</v>

3234
01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:17.501
<v Speaker 3>However many,</v>

3235
01:23:17.501 --> 01:23:20.020
<v Speaker 3>whatever 50 girls are coming out with claims against him,</v>

3236
01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.560
<v Speaker 3>he's probably fucked 5,000 who aren't coming out.</v>

3237
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably a real number and ridiculously hot girls we all know</v>

3238
01:23:27.131 --> 01:23:28.030
<v Speaker 3>about now what?</v>

3239
01:23:28.031 --> 01:23:29.710
<v Speaker 3>I suck his dick to be the next Batman.</v>

3240
01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:30.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3241
01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:31.001
<v Speaker 3>probably,</v>

3242
01:23:31.001 --> 01:23:31.834
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3243
01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:33.011
<v Speaker 3>Donald's,</v>

3244
01:23:33.011 --> 01:23:33.281

<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

3247
01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.590
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

3248
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:37.423

3249
01:23:37.730 --> 01:23:40.990

01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Tell me it doesn't look like that.</v>

3303
01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:04.540
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

3304
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 3>That's party a brown</v>

3305
01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Jesus guys.</v>

3306
01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:10.450
<v Speaker 3>Are they all under age?</v>

3307
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.321
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3308
01:25:11.321 --> 01:25:12.160
<v Speaker 3>probably not.</v>

3309
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:13.660
<v Speaker 3>But nothing's wrong with if,</v>

3310
01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:15.010
<v Speaker 3>does anyone know how many of them were,</v>

3311
01:25:15.011 --> 01:25:16.680
<v Speaker 3>but some of them apparently were under age.</v>

3312
01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:17.740
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

3313
01:25:17.741 --> 01:25:19.660
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like that's a cock fest.</v>

3314
01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:24.310
<v Speaker 3>If you're a young boy and you're trying to be an actor in Hollywood or a singer,</v>

3315
01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:26.380
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to avoid that shit?</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3321
01:25:32.591 --> 01:25:37.591
<v Speaker 3>It's like a lot of gay guys like guys that look younger,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

3341
01:25:57.991 --> 01:26:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Twink is like a thin,</v>

3342
01:26:00.490 --> 01:26:01.420
<v Speaker 3>hairless,</v>

<v Speaker 3>skinny</v>

3346
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:05.070
<v Speaker 2>on Jake.</v>

3347
01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Sorry Darren till walking into the octagon.</v>

3348
01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's actually watch this fight cause he,</v>

3349
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.121
<v Speaker 2>I get creeped out.</v>

3350
01:26:11.121 --> 01:26:13.380
<v Speaker 2>We all have kids and I feel sick after all that.</v>

3351
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 2>It makes it makes me sick.</v>

3352
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

3353
01:26:16.011 --> 01:26:16.640
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3354
01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3355
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Well Corey Feldman apparently has been talking a lot about it too.</v>

3356
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:22.070
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy.</v>

3357
01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

3358
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 2>but the question is why is he crazy?</v>

3359
01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Is he crazy because he was molested.</v>

3360
01:26:27.930 --> 01:26:28.200
<v Speaker 2>He meet.</v>

3361
01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.890
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't say he doesn't name names,</v>

3362
01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:31.790
<v Speaker 2>but maybe he will.</v>

3363
01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:36.940
<v Speaker 2>If someone said 80% of kids in Hollywood or in the entertainment business have</v>

3364
01:26:37.881 --> 01:26:41.270
<v Speaker 2>had some kind of run in with someone trying to molest him,</v>

3365
01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.080
<v Speaker 2>would you believe it?</v>

3366
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3367
01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:43.370
<v Speaker 2>80% yes.</v>

3368
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:44.203
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

3369
01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3370
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give out crazy numbers.</v>

3371
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I would say a large number.</v>

3372
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:53.830
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be cycling Olympic team wrap up because I think there's legitimate</v>

3373
01:26:54.351 --> 01:26:58.160
<v Speaker 2>agents is the legitimate managers and I think Disney has a pretty great record.</v>

3374
01:26:59.770 --> 01:27:00.650
<v Speaker 2>They're probably legit,</v>

3375
01:27:00.651 --> 01:27:01.910
<v Speaker 2>but those ones don't get any work.</v>

3376
01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.310
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it celebrates,</v>

3377
01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.990
<v Speaker 2>like they just hook each other up and they're just looking for,</v>

3378
01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:06.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3379
01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.550
<v Speaker 2>they're only going to,</v>

3380
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.570
<v Speaker 2>some of them do.</v>

3381
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:10.760
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely predators that are organized.</v>

3382
01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Definitely no one ever made any advances that you,</v>

3383
01:27:13.341 --> 01:27:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

3384
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3385
01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:14.991
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

3386
01:27:14.991 --> 01:27:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

3387
01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:16.071
<v Speaker 2>Not like,</v>

3388
01:27:16.071 --> 01:27:16.251
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3389
01:27:16.251 --> 01:27:17.450
<v Speaker 2>come give me a better comic.</v>

3390
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Alex John said he got molested in Hollywood when the Alex Jones did.</v>

3391
01:27:21.481 --> 01:27:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones talked about that probably roofing himself walked into a party and I</v>

3392
01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:27.860
<v Speaker 2>remember he was in that movie with Keanu Reeves.</v>

3393
01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:30.050
<v Speaker 2>He was in the movie with Kiana re yes.</v>

3394
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3395
01:27:30.231 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

3396
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Animated Yay.</v>

3397
01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Wake or something.</v>

3398
01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:35.181
<v Speaker 2>Life.</v>

3399
01:27:35.181 --> 01:27:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Waking life.</v>

3400
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3401
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.870
<v Speaker 2>It was a great mood.</v>

3402
01:27:36.871 --> 01:27:38.270
<v Speaker 2>He was in that he was driving.</v>

3403
01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 2>This was before anybody knew who Alex was and I was friends with him even back</v>

3404
01:27:41.751 --> 01:27:42.350
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

3405
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.891
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

3406
01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:43.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3407
01:27:43.101 --> 01:27:44.900
<v Speaker 2>they animated him ranting,</v>

3408
01:27:44.901 --> 01:27:47.210
<v Speaker 2>driving down the street and see you play some of that place.</v>

3409
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:48.403
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

3410
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:53.320
<v Speaker 4>Rolling across the picket line,</v>

3411
01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.273
<v Speaker 4>lay down,</v>

3412
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:55.660
<v Speaker 4>lay down Gi.</v>

3413
01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.200
<v Speaker 4>We saw it all through the 20th century and now the 21st century.</v>

3414
01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:02.740
<v Speaker 4>It's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be</v>

3415
01:28:02.741 --> 01:28:04.180
<v Speaker 4>crammed into this rat maze.</v>

3416
01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.890
<v Speaker 4>We should not submit the him and I station.</v>

3417
01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about you,</v>

3418
01:28:08.201 --> 01:28:10.100
<v Speaker 4>but I'm concerned with what's happening.</v>

3419
01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned with the structure.</v>

3420
01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:14.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned with the systems of controls.</v>

3421
01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:18.640
<v Speaker 4>Oh my life and those to control it even more.</v>

3422
01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:20.170
<v Speaker 4>I want freedom.</v>

3423
01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:21.220
<v Speaker 4>That's what I want.</v>

3424
01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:21.851
<v Speaker 4>And that flips.</v>

3425
01:28:21.851 --> 01:28:22.684
<v Speaker 4>You should want</v>

3426
01:28:23.850 --> 01:28:24.930
<v Speaker 2>my favorite all time.</v>

3427
01:28:24.931 --> 01:28:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones Club,</v>

3428
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.930
<v Speaker 2>he keeps getting mad swearing and he says,</v>

3429
01:28:27.931 --> 01:28:28.764
<v Speaker 2>I apologize,</v>

3430
01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.313
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have said that.</v>

3431
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:31.800
<v Speaker 2>And he just can't easily like a hole,</v>

3432
01:28:31.801 --> 01:28:33.630
<v Speaker 2>but a compilation of him frequently.</v>

3433
01:28:33.631 --> 01:28:37.200
<v Speaker 2>So he did that one movie and got molested instantly.</v>

3434
01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Even even though he was animated,</v>

3435
01:28:38.821 --> 01:28:39.654
<v Speaker 2>they molested his,</v>

3436
01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.390
<v Speaker 2>that's what he said on his show.</v>

3437
01:28:42.391 --> 01:28:46.890
<v Speaker 2>He said it was during that movie bus is at least 10% crazy though.</v>

3438
01:28:46.891 --> 01:28:47.251
<v Speaker 2>You agree?</v>

3439
01:28:47.251 --> 01:28:48.084
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3440
01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:48.780
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

3441
01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:50.010
<v Speaker 2>He's at least 10% crazy.</v>

3442
01:28:50.011 --> 01:28:53.600
<v Speaker 2>He's a but on the stuff that he reports about,</v>

3443
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:54.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3444
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:56.250
<v Speaker 2>85% correct.</v>

3445
01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.420
<v Speaker 2>That's probably a good number.</v>

3446
01:28:57.690 --> 01:28:58.980
<v Speaker 2>At least 80 right?</v>

3447
01:28:59.310 --> 01:29:01.910
<v Speaker 2>80% he's talking about some that's probably legit.</v>

3448
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally he goes off the rails and that hurts them.</v>

3449
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.710
<v Speaker 2>But that's okay.</v>

3450
01:29:05.710 --> 01:29:07.260
<v Speaker 2>You can't be 100% right.</v>

3451
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:11.430
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is he's always looking for conspiracies that might not exist and</v>

3452
01:29:11.431 --> 01:29:14.040
<v Speaker 2>then people can discredit it because of the misses.</v>

3453
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:15.830
<v Speaker 2>You gotta take some swings and hit a home run.</v>

3454
01:29:15.831 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 2>You know it's true.</v>

3455
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.530
<v Speaker 2>When you're making all these accusations,</v>

3456
01:29:19.531 --> 01:29:19.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3457
01:29:19.861 --> 01:29:21.000
<v Speaker 2>against criminals,</v>

3458
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:22.740
<v Speaker 2>a couple of them are not going to stick.</v>

3459
01:29:22.741 --> 01:29:23.101
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3460
01:29:23.101 --> 01:29:25.680
<v Speaker 2>and you might be wrong about a couple of murders here and there,</v>

3461
01:29:25.681 --> 01:29:26.880
<v Speaker 2>but they're still murderers.</v>

3462
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:30.720
<v Speaker 2>So we should focus on the fact that Alex Jones on Info wars,</v>

3463
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.620
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

3464
01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:34.950
<v Speaker 2>if you'd think that's a fake news station to get,</v>

3465
01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.970
<v Speaker 2>then you've been brainwashed because that's where most of the truth is coming</v>

3466
01:29:38.971 --> 01:29:39.211
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

3467

3590
01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.210

3595
01:32:48.701 --> 01:32:49.630
<v Speaker 2>This is a bad thing.</v>

3596
01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.490
<v Speaker 2>He's got to shoot and pull guard here.</v>

3597
01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:51.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3598
01:32:51.851 --> 01:32:53.580
<v Speaker 2>this is a bad fire guard.</v>

3599
01:32:53.650 --> 01:32:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3600
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Something tagged.</v>

3601
01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:56.890
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't move his head,</v>

3602
01:32:56.891 --> 01:32:57.724
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3603
01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:01.270
<v Speaker 2>The cowboys firing back cowboys not out of it.</v>

3604
01:33:01.271 --> 01:33:03.970
<v Speaker 2>You got to remember all the times cowboys been in trouble in the past.</v>

3605
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.760
<v Speaker 2>He's a slow start and then once he gets going he's trouble.</v>

3606
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:09.010
<v Speaker 2>This guy legitimately might be the best striker.</v>

3607
01:33:09.011 --> 01:33:11.050
<v Speaker 2>He falls and there is chance right here.</v>

3608
01:33:11.230 --> 01:33:12.063
<v Speaker 2>Jump on his back.</v>

3609
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.911
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Good distance control on the feet.</v>

3640
01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.180
<v Speaker 2>How relaxed he is first.</v>

3641
01:34:07.181 --> 01:34:09.280
<v Speaker 2>First main event is crazy and he's fucking,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't get over how big he is.</v>

3648
01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Well you gotta think cowboy striking is good for MMA,</v>

3649
01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:29.340
<v Speaker 2>but at the level that you know you're talking about like glory or you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Vinny shoreman is very high on this guy.</v>

3658
01:34:49.061 --> 01:34:51.550
<v Speaker 2>He says he's a very legit Moy Thai fighter,</v>

01:34:56.930 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing it here just from this distance control and his footwork and</v>

3663
01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:00.531
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

3664
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:01.291

3673
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.470
<v Speaker 2>land that upper cut.</v>

3674
01:35:12.471 --> 01:35:14.520
<v Speaker 2>He's done that twice to cowboy cowboy.</v>

3675
01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.440
<v Speaker 2>She's ducking down cowboys getting lit up.</v>

01:35:21.801 --> 01:35:23.360
<v Speaker 2>but he's not having much success.</v>

3679
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3680

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:34.280
<v Speaker 2>And Cowboy is the guy that will fight anybody anywhere flies to fucking Poland</v>

3688
01:35:34.281 --> 01:35:35.114
<v Speaker 2>to find this kid,</v>

3689
01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:35.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3690
01:35:35.961 --> 01:35:36.860
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

3691
01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:38.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch any footage on them.</v>

3692
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know shit about him.</v>

3693
01:35:39.951 --> 01:35:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I heard he's a good standup.</v>

3694
01:35:41.181 --> 01:35:41.391
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

3695
01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:42.201
<v Speaker 2>I love to strike,</v>

3696
01:35:42.201 --> 01:35:43.520
<v Speaker 2>which is why we love cowboy,</v>

3697
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:44.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's a double edge sword in.</v>

3698
01:35:44.841 --> 01:35:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3699
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:47.770
<v Speaker 2>well especially is when you're a big name like cowboys,</v>

3700
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:48.770
<v Speaker 2>a huge name.</v>

3701
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:50.480
<v Speaker 2>So for cowboy to fight,</v>

3702
01:35:50.481 --> 01:35:53.990
<v Speaker 2>this guy who is arguably one of the best strikers he's ever fought and he didn't</v>

3703
01:35:53.991 --> 01:35:55.340
<v Speaker 2>really look into a much,</v>

3704
01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:56.740
<v Speaker 2>but it does nothing for cowboys.</v>

3705
01:35:56.741 --> 01:35:57.441
<v Speaker 2>So you beat them to go?</v>

3706
01:35:57.441 --> 01:35:57.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3707

01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:38.870
<v Speaker 2>This guy has the ability to maybe,</v>

3731
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:40.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3732
01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:41.690
<v Speaker 2>contend for the belt.</v>

3733
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3734
01:36:42.250 --> 01:36:44.430
<v Speaker 2>hunter hunter is taken out of his side.</v>

3735
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:49.810
<v Speaker 2>His only 24 it's 24 with that extensive of a striking and he just made,</v>

3736
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:52.460
<v Speaker 2>he just turned into a fucking star,</v>

3737
01:36:52.461 --> 01:36:54.890
<v Speaker 2>at least in our small group of MMA.</v>

3738
01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.060
<v Speaker 2>This is on fight pass.</v>

3739
01:36:56.390 --> 01:37:00.890
<v Speaker 2>There might prop 40,000 people watching less talking about it might not even be</v>

3740
01:37:00.891 --> 01:37:04.130
<v Speaker 2>40,000 but this is bigger than that.</v>

3741
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Like however,</v>

3742
01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 2>watching this,</v>

3743
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:08.180
<v Speaker 2>you put a youtube video taking a piss.</v>

3744
01:37:08.181 --> 01:37:08.370
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

3745
01:37:08.370 --> 01:37:09.160
<v Speaker 2>it gets more beautiful.</v>

3746
01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.150
<v Speaker 2>We have 40,000 watching on here.</v>

3747
01:37:11.210 --> 01:37:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3748
01:37:11.290 --> 01:37:12.123
<v Speaker 2>we're beating them.</v>

3749
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3750
01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.340
<v Speaker 2>we're beating them.</v>

3751
01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:16.730
<v Speaker 2>But then when it sits for 10,000 remember those days?</v>

3752
01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:17.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3753
01:37:17.071 --> 01:37:19.910
<v Speaker 2>115 hundred but when it can look at that elbow,</v>

3754
01:37:19.911 --> 01:37:20.630
<v Speaker 2>we landed on him.</v>

3755
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

3756
01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:22.731
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

3757
01:37:22.731 --> 01:37:24.470
<v Speaker 2>He t tuned cowboy up.</v>

3758
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:24.951
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3759
01:37:24.951 --> 01:37:26.630
<v Speaker 2>that is just an absolute beating.</v>

3760
01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 2>I hate seeing it for cowboy like,</v>

3761
01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:30.560
<v Speaker 2>and this is the reason why Kelby so big,</v>

3762
01:37:30.650 --> 01:37:31.850
<v Speaker 2>but then it's also like it,</v>

3763
01:37:31.851 --> 01:37:32.601
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked you man,</v>

3764
01:37:32.601 --> 01:37:34.640
<v Speaker 2>because you're never going to be world champion fighting like this.</v>

3765
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:34.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3766
01:37:34.941 --> 01:37:35.451
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

3767
01:37:35.451 --> 01:37:38.090
<v Speaker 2>cowboy has had a few of these fights recently.</v>

3768
01:37:38.091 --> 01:37:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Mosfet all beat the shit out of him.</v>

3769
01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:40.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3770
01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:41.690
<v Speaker 2>the Robbie Lawler fight,</v>

3771
01:37:41.691 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 2>his last fight was a rough fight.</v>

3772
01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Well some people,</v>

3773
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3774
01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Calvin win that fight,</v>

3775
01:37:45.321 --> 01:37:47.960
<v Speaker 2>but it was a controversial fight to get back to the judges.</v>

3776
01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:48.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3777
01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:50.420
<v Speaker 2>some people think Calloway Roseville,</v>

3778
01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.011
<v Speaker 2>I think cal,</v>

3779
01:37:51.011 --> 01:37:51.890
<v Speaker 2>they lost that fight.</v>

3780
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I think he'd lost too because especially like Robbie really came on strong in</v>

3781
01:37:55.621 --> 01:37:56.311
<v Speaker 2>that last round.</v>

3782
01:37:56.311 --> 01:37:56.851
<v Speaker 2>The first round.</v>

3783
01:37:56.851 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 2>If you have ten eight it'd be a draw.</v>

3784
01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:00.630
<v Speaker 2>But cowboy is shaking his head,</v>

3785
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 2>his nose is smashed and we lost three in a row brother.</v>

3786
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3787
01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:04.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

3788
01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.101
<v Speaker 2>that's a rough go.</v>

3789
01:38:05.101 --> 01:38:08.730
<v Speaker 2>And your cowboys age lost three in a row and just got marked by a young kid.</v>

3790
01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:11.130
<v Speaker 2>A 24 year old kid just lit him on fire.</v>

3791
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.550
<v Speaker 2>24 year old stud though.</v>

3792
01:38:13.551 --> 01:38:15.060
<v Speaker 2>This is not just some random fucking,</v>

3793
01:38:15.061 --> 01:38:15.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3794
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:17.310
<v Speaker 2>well that's why you don't fight randoms and Poland though,</v>

3795
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3796
01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Well as it should be a 55 he's a 55 or,</v>

3797
01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:24.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's one of those guys that went up to one 70 like design hills.</v>

3798
01:38:24.091 --> 01:38:26.130
<v Speaker 2>And generally that doesn't work though.</v>

3799
01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:27.240
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work though.</v>

3800
01:38:27.330 --> 01:38:27.601
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

3801
01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:27.811
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3802
01:38:27.811 --> 01:38:28.560
<v Speaker 2>not that often.</v>

3803
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.130
<v Speaker 2>How you were just talking about Kevin leak like cobble has killed himself at 55</v>

3804
01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.060
<v Speaker 2>but he was dominated at 55 cowboy never champion.</v>

3805
01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:39.990
<v Speaker 2>He got close to a belt at 70 they did 55 well,</v>

3806
01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean he lost the belt at 55</v>

3807
01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:47.640
<v Speaker 2>we have to worry about how the cowboy show ends because cowboy getting stopped</v>

3808
01:38:47.641 --> 01:38:50.870
<v Speaker 2>like that and this fight like you gotta wonder how many more of those we're</v>

3809
01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:51.870
<v Speaker 2>going to see and what,</v>

3810
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:52.500
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>

3811
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:56.220
<v Speaker 2>what tolls that going to take on cowboy because of that style that he has.</v>

3812
01:38:56.490 --> 01:38:56.671
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3813
01:38:56.671 --> 01:38:59.370
<v Speaker 2>because of the fact that he's willing to fight anybody and because of the fact</v>

3814
01:38:59.371 --> 01:39:00.900
<v Speaker 2>that he spends his money like water,</v>

3815
01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3816
01:39:02.150 --> 01:39:02.341
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

3817
01:39:02.341 --> 01:39:03.051
<v Speaker 2>you play the law,</v>

3818
01:39:03.051 --> 01:39:03.721
<v Speaker 2>it's cowboy.</v>

3819
01:39:03.721 --> 01:39:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the persona he has your cow.</v>

3820
01:39:05.841 --> 01:39:08.800
<v Speaker 2>We fighting went anywhere and then once I stop,</v>

3821
01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

3822
01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:11.970
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying is you got to worry about how this,</v>

3823
01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:13.170
<v Speaker 2>how this story ends.</v>

3824
01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Because when you 34 you don't get younger,</v>

3825
01:39:16.410 --> 01:39:17.243
<v Speaker 2>you just get older.</v>

3826
01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:18.240
<v Speaker 2>But he's still a name.</v>

3827
01:39:18.241 --> 01:39:19.800
<v Speaker 2>So how many more fights will they give them?</v>

3828
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:20.011
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

3829
01:39:20.011 --> 01:39:20.844
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

3830
01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.753
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3831
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.550
<v Speaker 2>That fucking right left Combo.</v>

3832
01:39:23.551 --> 01:39:24.480
<v Speaker 2>He just landed on him.</v>

3833
01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:28.950
<v Speaker 2>We should back this up and watch it again because he tuned you.</v>

3834
01:39:28.951 --> 01:39:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to hear what Tim is saying.</v>

3835
01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.253
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

3836
01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

3837
01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:34.851
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>

3838
01:39:34.851 --> 01:39:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3839
01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Those wicked.</v>

3840
01:39:36.090 --> 01:39:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I can't get over how fucking big this kid is,</v>

3841
01:39:38.571 --> 01:39:38.841
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's amazing for that as well.</v>

3848
01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:58.510

3849
01:39:58.690 --> 01:39:59.560
<v Speaker 2>He knows what he's saying.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's nowhere near.</v>

3872
01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Not even on the same planet.</v>

3873
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Not even the same part of the yard he does is really box.</v>

3874
01:40:42.951 --> 01:40:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3875
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Well he's an animal.</v>

3876
01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:44.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3877
01:40:44.781 --> 01:40:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Mike Perry is a fucking animal.</v>

3878
01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:46.580
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

3879
01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Found them all because he or she is a strong guy.</v>

3880
01:40:49.331 --> 01:40:50.570
<v Speaker 2>He's got some serious power.</v>

3881
01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:51.170
<v Speaker 2>He's from here.</v>

3882
01:40:51.170 --> 01:40:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Paris from Florida.</v>

3883
01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3884
01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Strong with serious power.</v>

3885
01:40:54.341 --> 01:40:56.680
<v Speaker 2>But he's in he's way out class.</v>

3886
01:40:56.681 --> 01:40:59.920
<v Speaker 2>When he fights like a really good striker like job answer was foot work.</v>

3887
01:40:59.921 --> 01:41:00.220
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

3888
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.740
<v Speaker 2>they just avoid the big shot and just pick them apart.</v>

3889
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:03.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3890
01:41:03.131 --> 01:41:05.800
<v Speaker 2>But if you play that game you will not get a fucking Pluto.</v>

3891
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:07.420
<v Speaker 2>This is a different guy though.</v>

3892
01:41:07.570 --> 01:41:08.720
<v Speaker 2>This Darren till is it?</v>

3893
01:41:08.730 --> 01:41:09.730
<v Speaker 2>This is a different guy.</v>

3894
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:11.903
<v Speaker 2>Shoreman was saying,</v>

3895
01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:12.221
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3896
01:41:12.221 --> 01:41:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I wish the remote right here.</v>

3897
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:15.303
<v Speaker 2>Run that bench.</v>

3898
01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:15.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3899
01:41:15.551 --> 01:41:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Run that bitch back.</v>

3900
01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Let's watch this again.</v>

3901
01:41:17.410 --> 01:41:19.010
<v Speaker 2>I wish they would a enough,</v>

3902
01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:21.370
<v Speaker 2>they can't cause you need the fight on fight pass by.</v>

3903
01:41:21.371 --> 01:41:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I wish they would air it like tomorrow on Fox sports so you can so till he gets</v>

3904
01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.210
<v Speaker 2>like more recognition because how many people are going to see this beat down?</v>

3905
01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.111
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

3906
01:41:29.111 --> 01:41:31.690
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is like if they aired on Fox sports,</v>

3907
01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:32.231
<v Speaker 2>Fox sports,</v>

3908
01:41:32.231 --> 01:41:32.591
<v Speaker 2>own it,</v>

3909
01:41:32.591 --> 01:41:33.520
<v Speaker 2>then how does that work?</v>

3910
01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.550
<v Speaker 2>You do got a Brazilian flag with his English flag.</v>

3911
01:41:36.670 --> 01:41:36.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3912
01:41:36.851 --> 01:41:38.350
<v Speaker 2>That's him there for a while.</v>

3913
01:41:38.351 --> 01:41:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Training.</v>

3914
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:39.970
<v Speaker 2>That's why eight years,</v>

3915
01:41:39.971 --> 01:41:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I think allow man total eight years.</v>

3916
01:41:42.250 --> 01:41:44.080
<v Speaker 2>So he was like a little kid when he went over that.</v>

3917
01:41:44.081 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 2>It's so nuts.</v>

3918
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:50.340
<v Speaker 2>These 24 years old and this is already this good God damn.</v>

01:41:53.411 --> 01:41:54.490
<v Speaker 2>that was so crisp.</v>

3922
01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.810
<v Speaker 2>What show did he come up on?</v>

3923
01:41:56.370 --> 01:41:56.681
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

3924
01:41:56.681 --> 01:41:57.071
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask me.</v>

3925
01:41:57.071 --> 01:41:57.904
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3926
01:41:58.090 --> 01:41:59.080
<v Speaker 2>It's only going back to this,</v>

3927
01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:00.210
<v Speaker 2>if any just texted him.</v>

3928
01:42:00.211 --> 01:42:00.551
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

3929
01:42:00.551 --> 01:42:01.930
<v Speaker 2>I told you he is special.</v>

3930
01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:03.093
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3931
01:42:03.110 --> 01:42:06.310
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of odds makers barely had Calloway is the favorite.</v>

3932
01:42:06.311 --> 01:42:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Callo was like a minus one 20 so there's a reason for it,</v>

3933
01:42:09.671 --> 01:42:10.450
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3934
01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:10.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3935
01:42:10.781 --> 01:42:13.420
<v Speaker 2>but people in the know no tills a fucking monster.</v>

3936
01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

3937
01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Crazy shit man.</v>

3938
01:42:18.630 --> 01:42:20.540
<v Speaker 2>It's inserting call out Mike Perry after that.</v>

3939
01:42:20.541 --> 01:42:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just once he another wind,</v>

3940
01:42:21.791 --> 01:42:24.020
<v Speaker 2>but my career is ramped in Jujitsu.</v>

3941
01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:25.251
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3942
01:42:25.251 --> 01:42:26.084
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

3943
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3944
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Take down the fence.</v>

3945
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.823
<v Speaker 2>Brazil.</v>

3946
01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:31.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3947
01:42:31.191 --> 01:42:31.970
<v Speaker 2>he's there alone.</v>

3948
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:33.380
<v Speaker 2>He also speaks Portuguese.</v>

3949
01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.573
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

3950
01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.900
<v Speaker 2>So have them fight Brazil.</v>

3951
01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:38.460
<v Speaker 2>That'd be interesting,</v>

3952
01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:38.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3953
01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3954
01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I think the Brazilians would totally love them.</v>

3955
01:42:41.970 --> 01:42:42.571
<v Speaker 2>Look at this shit.</v>

3956
01:42:42.571 --> 01:42:44.910
<v Speaker 2>You could just put up some stuff from your phone.</v>

3957
01:42:44.911 --> 01:42:45.744
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3958
01:42:50.050 --> 01:42:50.261
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

3959
01:42:50.261 --> 01:42:50.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3960
01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.790
<v Speaker 2>let's watch the fight again.</v>

3961
01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to rewind.</v>

3962
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Fucking cowboys knows everyone.</v>

3963
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:57.400
<v Speaker 2>I think you don't want to,</v>

3964
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:58.150
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

3965
01:42:58.150 --> 01:42:58.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3966
01:42:58.421 --> 01:42:58.871
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

3967
01:42:58.871 --> 01:43:02.920
<v Speaker 2>But you have to use the remote and click on it and then scroll backwards.</v>

3968
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:04.383
<v Speaker 2>Just doing that.</v>

3969
01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Is it because it's streaming?</v>

3970
01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:06.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3971
01:43:06.141 --> 01:43:06.974
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

3972
01:43:07.570 --> 01:43:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's still going on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Story and George St Pierre retires now he's coming back to fight and Bisping the</v>

3993
01:43:37.481 --> 01:43:42.481
<v Speaker 2>cowboy stories different because cowboy was never the champion and he loves this</v>

3994
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:44.110
<v Speaker 2>rough and tumble life.</v>

3997
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:46.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4000
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.660

01:44:23.081 --> 01:44:25.750
<v Speaker 2>but he was winning by decisions who want a split decision.</v>

4017
01:44:25.751 --> 01:44:27.120
<v Speaker 2>He had a draw really</v>

4018
01:44:28.810 --> 01:44:32.170
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe knocking people's socks off early on.</v>

4019
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:33.303
<v Speaker 2>Maybe</v>

4020
01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:38.100
<v Speaker 3>cowboy had a terrible training camp or maybe the jet lag is fuck thing is just</v>

4021
01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:39.820
<v Speaker 3>realizing he's just that comfortable.</v>

4022
01:44:39.821 --> 01:44:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4023
01:44:40.210 --> 01:44:40.901
<v Speaker 3>he's that good.</v>

4024
01:44:40.901 --> 01:44:42.850
<v Speaker 3>He's 24 and he's also realizing,</v>

4025
01:44:42.851 --> 01:44:43.011
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4026
01:44:43.011 --> 01:44:45.010
<v Speaker 3>you're just watching his movement in this.</v>

4027
01:44:45.011 --> 01:44:46.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying cowboy had a bad training camp.</v>

4028
01:44:46.991 --> 01:44:48.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying this kid's a motherfucker.</v>

4029
01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.170
<v Speaker 3>The way he landed that uppercut,</v>

4030
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:51.161
<v Speaker 3>the way he landed,</v>

4031
01:44:51.161 --> 01:44:52.180
<v Speaker 3>that one too,</v>

4032
01:44:52.210 --> 01:44:55.180
<v Speaker 3>that jab left like my Perry.</v>

4033
01:44:55.181 --> 01:44:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Ask him for this fight.</v>

4034
01:44:56.261 --> 01:44:57.094
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4035
01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:58.360
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's there.</v>

4036
01:44:58.610 --> 01:45:00.160
<v Speaker 3>It'll still called him out.</v>

4037
01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:00.850
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

4038
01:45:00.850 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just once a year item.</v>

4039
01:45:02.290 --> 01:45:02.471
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4040
01:45:02.471 --> 01:45:06.570
<v Speaker 3>because he's a name Mike Perry's name God from Calloway to Perry though.</v>

4041
01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:07.893
<v Speaker 3>Good fight.</v>

4042
01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Fun Fight.</v>

4043
01:45:08.710 --> 01:45:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Let him like,</v>

4044
01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:10.750
<v Speaker 3>he's going to fight a brawler.</v>

4045
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Let him show his skills.</v>

4046
01:45:13.150 --> 01:45:13.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4047
01:45:13.391 --> 01:45:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I would think that's a good fight for him.</v>

4048
01:45:14.831 --> 01:45:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

4049
01:45:15.130 --> 01:45:16.870
<v Speaker 3>this dude dude's just standing up credit matchup for him.</v>

4050
01:45:16.871 --> 01:45:17.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4051
01:45:17.041 --> 01:45:18.160
<v Speaker 3>it's a great matchup for her.</v>

4052
01:45:18.161 --> 01:45:18.621
<v Speaker 3>It has a,</v>

4053
01:45:18.621 --> 01:45:19.510
<v Speaker 3>a fight already though.</v>

4054
01:45:19.810 --> 01:45:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Who's he?</v>

4055
01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:20.893
<v Speaker 3>Gotta fight?</v>

4056
01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4057
01:45:22.810 --> 01:45:23.643
<v Speaker 3>I forget,</v>

4058
01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.990
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty sure he has a,</v>

4059
01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:25.990
<v Speaker 3>a matchup already.</v>

4060
01:45:28.090 --> 01:45:28.923
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

4061
01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting.</v>

4062
01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:33.010
<v Speaker 3>Just a difference in the level of technique.</v>

4063
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:35.230
<v Speaker 3>You know what till can do,</v>

4064
01:45:35.231 --> 01:45:36.070
<v Speaker 3>he can do everything.</v>

4065
01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:36.551
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4066
01:45:36.551 --> 01:45:39.370
<v Speaker 3>he's not just a guy that just wades in and throws haymakers.</v>

4067
01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:39.941
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4068
01:45:39.941 --> 01:45:40.751
<v Speaker 3>he's like very,</v>

4069
01:45:40.751 --> 01:45:43.770
<v Speaker 3>very technically proficient besides him.</v>

4070
01:45:43.771 --> 01:45:44.450
<v Speaker 3>But as you look,</v>

4071
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:45.400
<v Speaker 3>you could get killed.</v>

4072
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:47.020
<v Speaker 3>He could get fucking knocked out.</v>

4073
01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Mike Perry can knock out anybody you fuck up and you zig when you should have</v>

4074
01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:52.080
<v Speaker 3>that fight.</v>

4075
01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:52.921
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

4076
01:45:52.921 --> 01:45:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Fucking tough fight for him too.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's a great Santiago and no Byo.</v>

4078
01:45:56.921 --> 01:45:58.070
<v Speaker 3>Is Doug just speed?</v>

4089
01:46:08.850 --> 01:46:09.683
<v Speaker 2>He stopped him.</v>

4090
01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:10.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4091

4137
01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:17.700
<v Speaker 3>That's how you do it.</v>

4138

4143
01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.170
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way to do it.</v>

4144
01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Give out the numbers on five paths.</v>

01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Smart mode.</v>

01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4152
01:47:31.290 --> 01:47:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Why give it up when you don't have to give it out?</v>

4153
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.470

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm hearing that that's not selling well.</v>

4161
01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Like the square garden from what I've heard too.</v>

4162
01:47:47.161 --> 01:47:48.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not doing great.</v>

4163
01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:49.603
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

4164
01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:51.600
<v Speaker 3>That's unfortunate.</v>

4165
01:47:51.601 --> 01:47:52.890
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make it less and it just,</v>

4166
01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:53.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4167
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:54.101
<v Speaker 3>I just went,</v>

4168
01:47:54.101 --> 01:47:56.690
<v Speaker 3>it's not doing great GSP GSP versus Bisping.</v>

4169
01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:57.750
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing great.</v>

4170
01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Not like you'd think though.</v>

4171
01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:00.420
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing though,</v>

4172
01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:03.150
<v Speaker 3>if you really stop and think about it,</v>

4173
01:48:03.630 --> 01:48:06.270
<v Speaker 3>that was four years ago was the last time you fought Johnny Hendricks.</v>

4174
01:48:06.570 --> 01:48:11.570
<v Speaker 3>The people that are into the UFC now diff post Ronda Rousey and post Conor</v>

4175
01:48:12.450 --> 01:48:12.451
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor,</v>

4176
01:48:12.451 --> 01:48:14.730
<v Speaker 3>like the casual fans hosts Lesnar the hot,</v>

4177
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:16.260
<v Speaker 3>the hardcore fans like you and I,</v>

4178
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:17.011
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna go,</v>

4179
01:48:17.011 --> 01:48:18.240
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna Watch that fight for sure.</v>

4180
01:48:18.241 --> 01:48:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4181
01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:19.140
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4182
01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:20.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna see what Bisping looks like.</v>

4183
01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:21.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4184
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:24.840
<v Speaker 3>fighting a guy like George St Pierre was smaller than him.</v>

4185
01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:26.580
<v Speaker 3>God has taken four years off.</v>

4186
01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Bisping's got this opportunity to make a shitload of money.</v>

4187
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.050
<v Speaker 3>And then George George,</v>

4188
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:32.490
<v Speaker 3>how's George going to look?</v>

4189
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:34.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a tough moment for years.</v>

4190
01:48:34.291 --> 01:48:35.071
<v Speaker 3>It's a tough sell.</v>

4191
01:48:35.071 --> 01:48:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Even for the hardcore fans like pulling all,</v>

4192
01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:38.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a great fight.</v>

4193
01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Fight.</v>

4194
01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Bisping and GSP is going to be a great fight.</v>

4195
01:48:41.970 --> 01:48:43.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward to it for sure.</v>

4196
01:48:43.501 --> 01:48:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Keep even,</v>

4197
01:48:44.521 --> 01:48:45.930
<v Speaker 3>even now people keep,</v>

4198
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.760
<v Speaker 3>they don't give Bisping the respect.</v>

4199
01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:48.570
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

4200
01:48:48.570 --> 01:48:49.231
<v Speaker 3>He keys,</v>

4201
01:48:49.231 --> 01:48:50.100
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to get it.</v>

4202
01:48:50.101 --> 01:48:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Even if he beats GSP,</v>

4203
01:48:51.181 --> 01:48:52.110
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>

4204
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:53.400
<v Speaker 3>He took four years off.</v>

4205
01:48:53.490 --> 01:48:53.740
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

4206
01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:54.600
<v Speaker 3>he's a seven year.</v>

4207
01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:55.980
<v Speaker 3>He might and it doesn't matter.</v>

4208
01:48:55.981 --> 01:48:58.680
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't sell 2 billion.</v>

4209
01:48:58.681 --> 01:48:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that dude's that.</v>

4210
01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:00.900
<v Speaker 3>The casual fans,</v>

4211
01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:01.411
<v Speaker 3>fuck them.</v>

4212
01:49:01.411 --> 01:49:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

4213
01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:03.390
<v Speaker 3>just we got enough.</v>

4214
01:49:03.450 --> 01:49:04.920
<v Speaker 3>You can't run a business like that Eddie.</v>

4215
01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:05.131
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4216
01:49:05.131 --> 01:49:05.964
<v Speaker 3>you don't care.</v>

4217
01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:08.130
<v Speaker 3>All we care about is the matchups.</v>

4218
01:49:08.131 --> 01:49:09.120
<v Speaker 3>That's a good matchup.</v>

4219
01:49:09.150 --> 01:49:09.331
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4220
01:49:09.331 --> 01:49:10.164
<v Speaker 3>you don't know it.</v>

4221
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Not work like,</v>

4222
01:49:11.530 --> 01:49:12.780
<v Speaker 3>but we don't run the business.</v>

4223
01:49:12.781 --> 01:49:13.531
<v Speaker 3>So for us,</v>

4224
01:49:13.531 --> 01:49:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Eddie's right.</v>

4225
01:49:14.250 --> 01:49:15.083
<v Speaker 3>I agree with Eddie.</v>

4226
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:16.620
<v Speaker 3>As long as they're putting in these fights on,</v>

4227
01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:17.580
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a great fight.</v>

4228
01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4229
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:19.570
<v Speaker 3>So you'd have to,</v>

4230
01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:23.880
<v Speaker 3>would rather watch a GSB has taken four years off fight for the middleweight</v>

4231
01:49:23.881 --> 01:49:26.790
<v Speaker 3>title than him fight a guy who's an actual champion,</v>

4232
01:49:26.791 --> 01:49:28.020
<v Speaker 3>85 like I don't mind,</v>

4233
01:49:28.021 --> 01:49:28.854
<v Speaker 3>I'm in no hurry.</v>

4234
01:49:28.890 --> 01:49:29.730
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

4235
01:49:29.970 --> 01:49:30.451
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

4236
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:33.240
<v Speaker 3>Whitaker's injured and you can't fight right now with her care as a pretty</v>

4237
01:49:33.241 --> 01:49:34.890
<v Speaker 3>serious tear his knee ligament.</v>

4238
01:49:35.130 --> 01:49:36.840
<v Speaker 3>So that's one thing.</v>

4239
01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.950
<v Speaker 3>This is also an opportunity for Bisbing who's been in the game forever to make a</v>

4240
01:49:40.951 --> 01:49:41.671
<v Speaker 3>shitload of money.</v>

4241
01:49:41.671 --> 01:49:42.504
<v Speaker 3>I liked that.</v>

4242
01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I liked Michael.</v>

4243
01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I liked the fact that Michael is an opportunity to make a fuck load of money</v>

4244
01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:47.380
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

4245
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:48.213
<v Speaker 3>I like this.</v>

4246
01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:49.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4247
01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:50.890
<v Speaker 3>don't need it to sell him old man.</v>

4248
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.090
<v Speaker 3>That's why you do what you wanted to make.</v>

4249
01:49:52.570 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 3>But if you wanted to make money,</v>

4250
01:49:53.651 --> 01:49:54.150
<v Speaker 3>it has said,</v>

4251
01:49:54.150 --> 01:49:54.221
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4252
01:49:54.221 --> 01:49:55.950
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not in the business of selling paper views.</v>

4253
01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm in the business so we don't want to speak.</v>

4254
01:49:57.911 --> 01:49:59.770
<v Speaker 3>You just said you wanted him to make a lot of money.</v>

4255
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.221
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4256
01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:01.001
<v Speaker 3>he's going to make a lot of money.</v>

4257
01:50:01.001 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Either way he's going to make more money in this fight.</v>

4258
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:06.880
<v Speaker 3>I'll guarantee there's some sort of a guarantee like pay view points where you</v>

4259
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:10.720
<v Speaker 3>make your money like your re your life changing monies paid for viewpoints as</v>

4260
01:50:10.721 --> 01:50:11.321
<v Speaker 3>mighty mouse.</v>

4261
01:50:11.321 --> 01:50:13.420
<v Speaker 3>As Jon Jones asked Connor Mcgregor,</v>

4262
01:50:13.421 --> 01:50:14.254
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure,</v>

4263
01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:18.520
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think that George Saint Pierre is at least going to do half a</v>

4264
01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.560
<v Speaker 3>million pay per view buys maybe more.</v>

4265
01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.610
<v Speaker 3>I like to think so.</v>

4266
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:22.541
<v Speaker 3>Heartbreaking.</v>

4267
01:50:22.541 --> 01:50:23.250
<v Speaker 3>If he doesn't.</v>

4268
01:50:23.250 --> 01:50:25.570
<v Speaker 3>I like to think he's going to do at least a half a million.</v>

4269
01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Make sure this thing about 700 stuff's weird.</v>

4270
01:50:28.451 --> 01:50:28.841
<v Speaker 3>Me Out,</v>

4271
01:50:28.841 --> 01:50:29.080
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4272
01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.250
<v Speaker 3>This weird shit that he's doing,</v>

4273
01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:33.820
<v Speaker 3>whether they're touching things with moving things and touch things with his</v>

4274
01:50:33.821 --> 01:50:34.150
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>

4275
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen how Jack d looks?</v>

4276
01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Looks jacked.</v>

4277
01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:37.800
<v Speaker 3>He looks super swollen.</v>

4278
01:50:37.801 --> 01:50:38.720
<v Speaker 3>What if he pisses hot?</v>

4279
01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:39.220
<v Speaker 3>He'd,</v>

4280
01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:40.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he cares.</v>

4281
01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:42.790
<v Speaker 3>I think if he's just one and done,</v>

4282
01:50:42.791 --> 01:50:43.011
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

4283
01:50:43.011 --> 01:50:43.610
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4284

4289
01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:50.380
<v Speaker 3>when money taken away,</v>

4290
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:51.820
<v Speaker 3>25% yeah.</v>

4291
01:50:51.821 --> 01:50:53.950
<v Speaker 3>They take some of your mind only 25% though.</v>

4292
01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:54.993
<v Speaker 3>Even if you won.</v>

4293
01:50:55.090 --> 01:50:55.391

4302
01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:07.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm balls deep in me.</v>

4303
01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:07.691
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>

4304
01:51:07.691 --> 01:51:08.670
<v Speaker 3>it's a fun fight.</v>

4305
01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Not The fight that</v>

4306
01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.000
<v Speaker 3>take people down these days too.</v>

4307
01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:13.480
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

4308
01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:15.730
<v Speaker 3>The GSP was taken everyone down five years ago.</v>

4309
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:16.600
<v Speaker 3>This means it's up.</v>

4310
01:51:16.601 --> 01:51:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Damn tough to take.</v>

4311
01:51:17.590 --> 01:51:19.630
<v Speaker 3>The dance gets it.</v>

4312
01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:21.220
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a little harder.</v>

4313
01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:22.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

4314
01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:25.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure the GSP is going to be able to take people down like you did five</v>

4315
01:51:25.331 --> 01:51:25.661
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

4316
01:51:25.661 --> 01:51:26.494
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

4317
01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:28.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll be right there.</v>

4318
01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:30.250
<v Speaker 3>This matchup.</v>

4319
01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:33.970
<v Speaker 3>It's all rights by nowhere near the best fight on the card.</v>

4320
01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:34.811
<v Speaker 3>You look at that card.</v>

4321
01:51:34.811 --> 01:51:36.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking heater.</v>

4322
01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's a recent picture of George?</v>

4323
01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:39.730
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4324
01:51:39.730 --> 01:51:40.420
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

4325
01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:40.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4326
01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:41.673
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

4327
01:51:41.770 --> 01:51:44.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it is because I think he looks like his gun.</v>

4328
01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:45.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a little soft.</v>

4329
01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4330
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.871
<v Speaker 3>that's fair.</v>

4331
01:51:46.871 --> 01:51:47.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4332
01:51:47.201 --> 01:51:47.741
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

4333
01:51:47.741 --> 01:51:48.880
<v Speaker 3>A little bit like,</v>

4334
01:51:48.881 --> 01:51:49.151
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4335
01:51:49.151 --> 01:51:50.380
<v Speaker 3>we just saw Kevin Lee.</v>

4336
01:51:50.410 --> 01:51:52.090
<v Speaker 3>He's thicker than a snickers down their,</v>

4337
01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:52.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4338
01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ thick.</v>

4339
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:56.520
<v Speaker 3>That's Johnny Hendrickson.</v>

4340
01:51:56.530 --> 01:51:59.860
<v Speaker 3>That big kind of heavy,</v>

4341
01:51:59.890 --> 01:52:00.910
<v Speaker 3>like around the middle.</v>

4342
01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4343
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Eating a lot,</v>

4344
01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:03.941
<v Speaker 3>but there's a,</v>

4345
01:52:03.941 --> 01:52:06.490
<v Speaker 3>there's a big difference between that and Kevin Lee.</v>

4346
01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4347
01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Kevin leave was g,</v>

4348
01:52:07.731 --> 01:52:08.530
<v Speaker 3>g G.</v>

4349
01:52:08.530 --> 01:52:08.530
<v Speaker 3>G.</v>

4350
01:52:08.530 --> 01:52:08.530
<v Speaker 3>G.</v>

4351
01:52:08.530 --> 01:52:12.010
<v Speaker 3>G jacked jacked Rick when he was on top of that picture of him on top of Tony</v>

4352
01:52:12.011 --> 01:52:13.090
<v Speaker 3>when he was dropping bombs on them,</v>

4353
01:52:13.091 --> 01:52:13.924
<v Speaker 3>jacked,</v>

4354
01:52:14.170 --> 01:52:14.860
<v Speaker 3>jacked.</v>

4355
01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:16.210
<v Speaker 3>George does not look that good,</v>

4356
01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:18.130
<v Speaker 3>but then again if he's clean,</v>

4357
01:52:18.190 --> 01:52:19.390
<v Speaker 3>which she kind of has to be,</v>

4358
01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.260
<v Speaker 3>have to be,</v>

4359
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I think he's 35 now.</v>

4360
01:52:21.970 --> 01:52:22.803
<v Speaker 3>He's not young.</v>

4361
01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:23.800
<v Speaker 3>How old was George?</v>

4362
01:52:25.450 --> 01:52:30.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's 35 you can be in great shape at 35 but really it completely helps if</v>

4363
01:52:31.691 --> 01:52:33.370
<v Speaker 3>you were super active for a long time.</v>

4364
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Are we looking at the tip of his Dick in that picture?</v>

4365
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:36.250
<v Speaker 3>What's that all about?</v>

4366
01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:37.490
<v Speaker 3>He has a fat take if that,</v>

4367
01:52:37.491 --> 01:52:40.780
<v Speaker 3>so why don't you guys Photoshop that out please.</v>

4368
01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:43.490
<v Speaker 3>I want to look taking that picture.</v>

4369
01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 3>That's all I can see you Mike Perry here.</v>

4370
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:47.173
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

4375
01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.290

4378
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.840
<v Speaker 6>and we got assigned to paperwork and we're going to make it happen.</v>

4379
01:53:01.841 --> 01:53:03.940
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure that it's going to go down.</v>

4380
01:53:04.150 --> 01:53:05.080
<v Speaker 6>I look forward to it,</v>

4381
01:53:05.081 --> 01:53:08.710
<v Speaker 6>but I got work to do first with Santiago positive you in Winnipeg,</v>

4382

<v Speaker 6>Canada.</v>

4383
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:12.250
<v Speaker 3>He sounds like a rapper.</v>

4384
01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4385
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Well it's got a tattoo above his eyebrow.</v>

4386
01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:16.810
<v Speaker 3>It feels like it's about to drop some sick beat.</v>

4387
01:53:18.330 --> 01:53:18.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4388
01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:21.880
<v Speaker 6>You look good against Donald Donald Cerrone,</v>

4389
01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:23.130
<v Speaker 6>Donald,</v>

4390
01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:23.963
<v Speaker 6>the cowboy,</v>

4391
01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:26.560
<v Speaker 6>the cowboy that that wins fights.</v>

4392
01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:29.620
<v Speaker 6>That was Donald that that shows up at.</v>

4393
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:30.743
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

4394
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.870
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't,</v>

4395
01:53:31.870 --> 01:53:33.640
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't happy with Donald's performance.</v>

4396
01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:36.080
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

4397
01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:36.913
<v Speaker 3>American</v>

4398
01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.520
<v Speaker 6>Darrin didn't get a tough finder tonight.</v>

4399
01:53:39.970 --> 01:53:41.930
<v Speaker 6>He got someone who gave up in the first round,</v>

4400
01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:42.773
<v Speaker 6>but that doesn't,</v>

4401
01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:44.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4402
01:53:44.490 --> 01:53:45.630
<v Speaker 6>that that's not what was done.</v>

4403
01:53:45.970 --> 01:53:46.291
<v Speaker 3>Donald.</v>

4404
01:53:46.291 --> 01:53:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Did it look great.</v>

4405
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.590
<v Speaker 3>They should keep Mike Perry off.</v>

4406
01:53:48.591 --> 01:53:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Microphone from now on.</v>

4407
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.180

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:54.873
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

4410
01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:56.700
<v Speaker 3>Enjoying limp biscuit.</v>

4411
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:57.700
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

4412
01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:57.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4413
01:53:57.930 --> 01:53:59.420
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a white rapper.</v>

4414
01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like that one towards the top 10 do you want an even playing field</v>

4415
01:54:14.271 --> 01:54:14.631
<v Speaker 2>with your,</v>

4416
01:54:14.631 --> 01:54:16.170
<v Speaker 2>did you still feel like you're ahead of him?</v>

4417
01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:18.890
<v Speaker 2>My parents got a great record.</v>

4418
01:54:18.891 --> 01:54:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm number 15.</v>

4419
01:54:19.881 --> 01:54:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where that puts him on the rankings,</v>

4420
01:54:21.621 --> 01:54:22.820
<v Speaker 2>but rankings don't matter then</v>

4421
01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:24.530
<v Speaker 6>it never mattered since I've got here.</v>

4422
01:54:24.710 --> 01:54:25.543
<v Speaker 3>That's fair.</v>

4423
01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:26.510
<v Speaker 6>My right,</v>

4424
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:27.080
<v Speaker 6>my left hand,</v>

4425
01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:27.801
<v Speaker 6>he wants to box.</v>

4426
01:54:27.801 --> 01:54:30.530
<v Speaker 6>I look forward to any MMA fighter that won a box with me.</v>

4427
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:33.590
<v Speaker 6>Santiago punks in Libya was going to be the first example of that.</v>

4428
01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:36.043
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4429
01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:37.510
<v Speaker 3>What's that guy's name?</v>

4430
01:54:37.511 --> 01:54:38.470
<v Speaker 3>The guy with the bow tie.</v>

4431
01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:38.831
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

4432
01:54:38.831 --> 01:54:39.820
<v Speaker 3>but he seems scared.</v>

4433
01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared to say anything.</v>

4434
01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.930
<v Speaker 3>This makes me uncomfortable.</v>

4435
01:54:47.770 --> 01:54:48.970
<v Speaker 6>He's heavy handed as well.</v>

4436
01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4437

4446
01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:11.800
<v Speaker 6>And very similar.</v>

4447
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:12.980
<v Speaker 6>I'll get there until,</v>

4448
01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:14.420
<v Speaker 3>what's that face?</v>

4449
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Very similar style.</v>

4450
01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:17.131
<v Speaker 3>Similar at all,</v>

4451
01:55:17.131 --> 01:55:17.940
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

4452
01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Guess they both throw punches.</v>

4453
01:55:19.141 --> 01:55:19.974
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

4454
01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:21.300
<v Speaker 6>I look forward to a man.</v>

4455
01:55:21.301 --> 01:55:22.320
<v Speaker 6>I can't wait to do it.</v>

4456
01:55:22.321 --> 01:55:23.154
<v Speaker 6>And I looked up,</v>

4457
01:55:23.190 --> 01:55:26.580
<v Speaker 6>skyrocket myself off this kid undefeated record.</v>

4458
01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm ready to take that on from that board.</v>

4459
01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:31.490
<v Speaker 3>It's weird talking about that fight when you have a huge fight</v>

4460
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:33.833
<v Speaker 3>for</v>

4461
01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:36.920
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

4462
01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Rocking back and forth.</v>

4463
01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:39.053
<v Speaker 3>I like him.</v>

4464
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:42.980
<v Speaker 3>That mother fucker hits a haul truck.</v>

4465
01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:43.883
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

4466
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:45.950
<v Speaker 3>he reminds me a lot of limits.</v>

4467
01:55:46.230 --> 01:55:48.270
<v Speaker 3>He's just a fucking nightmare if you get hit by him.</v>

4468
01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:49.650
<v Speaker 3>But if you can avoid it,</v>

4469
01:55:50.170 --> 01:55:51.420
<v Speaker 3>it's an easy game plan.</v>

4470
01:55:51.450 --> 01:55:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Jake Ellenberger fight man.</v>

4471
01:55:53.850 --> 01:55:55.650
<v Speaker 3>When he caught Jake with a big fucking deal.</v>

4472
01:55:55.651 --> 01:55:57.030
<v Speaker 3>But that November 4th garde,</v>

01:56:00.991 --> 01:56:01.824
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting.</v>

01:56:08.881 --> 01:56:09.714

4487
01:56:14.190 --> 01:56:15.150
<v Speaker 3>He might make weight.</v>

4488
01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I can't promise you,</v>

4489
01:56:16.081 --> 01:56:16.914
<v Speaker 3>but he's back.</v>

01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:18.750
<v Speaker 3>He's at Jackson's now.</v>

4491
01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:20.220
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

4492
01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:22.020
<v Speaker 3>that's like don't move into Florida when you're older.</v>

4493
01:56:28.930 --> 01:56:30.620
<v Speaker 3>It's just what people do when they get older.</v>

4494
01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Tired.</v>

4499
01:56:34.621 --> 01:56:35.610
<v Speaker 3>let's try this out.</v>

4500
01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:36.451
<v Speaker 3>It was an interesting,</v>

4501
01:56:36.451 --> 01:56:38.880
<v Speaker 3>listen to what Johnny Hendricks was saying about training in Texas.</v>

4502
01:56:38.881 --> 01:56:39.420
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

4503
01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:43.140
<v Speaker 3>I gotta be careful when I spar with people cause if I go do ho too hard then</v>

4504
01:56:43.141 --> 01:56:47.310
<v Speaker 3>they won't come back to you got to find a real camp.</v>

4505
01:56:47.370 --> 01:56:47.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4506
01:56:47.611 --> 01:56:48.930
<v Speaker 3>per watt can.</v>

4507
01:56:48.931 --> 01:56:49.310
<v Speaker 3>He can't,</v>

4508
01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:50.310
<v Speaker 3>but everybody go too hard.</v>

4509
01:56:50.311 --> 01:56:51.420
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked up.</v>

4510
01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:53.280
<v Speaker 3>But he saying Aka and let me know how that goes.</v>

4511
01:56:53.281 --> 01:56:54.061
<v Speaker 3>So that's what he was saying.</v>

4512
01:56:54.061 --> 01:56:57.030
<v Speaker 3>He was saying finally I can go to Jackson's and I'm getting pushed.</v>

4513
01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:57.541
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

4514
01:56:57.541 --> 01:56:58.560
<v Speaker 3>where I am in Texas,</v>

4515
01:56:58.561 --> 01:56:58.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

4516
01:56:58.890 --> 01:56:59.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not getting pushed.</v>

4517
01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:00.600
<v Speaker 3>He left,</v>

4518
01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.100
<v Speaker 3>he left that team take down.</v>

4519
01:57:02.101 --> 01:57:03.810
<v Speaker 3>Remember they had some gnarly dudes there.</v>

4520
01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:04.410
<v Speaker 3>He left them.</v>

4521
01:57:04.410 --> 01:57:06.060
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of shit going on with that though.</v>

4522
01:57:06.061 --> 01:57:06.930
<v Speaker 3>You know how that worked?</v>

4523
01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4524
01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:09.930
<v Speaker 3>He had a weird deal when they're like 20% of all the shifts.</v>

4525
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:11.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4526
01:57:12.190 --> 01:57:13.800
<v Speaker 3>They took like the game,</v>

4527
01:57:13.801 --> 01:57:16.200
<v Speaker 3>a salary and then they took like half as money.</v>

4528
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

4529
01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:19.830
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is the guy put a lot of money in everything.</v>

4530
01:57:19.831 --> 01:57:21.330
<v Speaker 3>So I see his perspective too.</v>

4531
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:23.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like they put together a training facility.</v>

4532
01:57:23.641 --> 01:57:23.950
<v Speaker 3>They put,</v>

4533
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:25.230
<v Speaker 3>they hired all these coaches,</v>

4534
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:26.880
<v Speaker 3>they had all this stuff going on.</v>

4535
01:57:26.881 --> 01:57:27.810
<v Speaker 3>They paid for everything.</v>

4536
01:57:27.811 --> 01:57:30.330
<v Speaker 3>They gave him a salary and then when it came time,</v>

4537
01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:32.670
<v Speaker 3>you know to for that investment to pay off,</v>

4538
01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:35.550
<v Speaker 3>they wanted half the money and I don't know how they,</v>

4539
01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:38.370
<v Speaker 3>how they worked it out.</v>

4540
01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:39.500
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Hendricks on,</v>

4541
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:41.970
<v Speaker 3>you're a national champion from Oklahoma state and someone's like,</v>

4542
01:57:41.971 --> 01:57:42.121
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4543
01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:42.770
<v Speaker 3>we're going to vet.</v>

4544
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:44.460
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't take 50% right?</v>

4545
01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you man.</v>

4546
01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Well I think what happened was,</v>

4547
01:57:48.421 --> 01:57:48.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4548
01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:51.450
<v Speaker 3>once you started getting that world championship money,</v>

4549
01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:52.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4550
01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:55.920
<v Speaker 3>that's probably one of the 5% then he opened the big rig steakhouse,</v>

4551
01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:57.840
<v Speaker 3>which God blesses the problem.</v>

4552
01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the bigger problem.</v>

4553
01:57:59.131 --> 01:58:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Opening a restaurant is like notoriously one of the worst investments you could</v>

4554
01:58:02.641 --> 01:58:03.091
<v Speaker 3>ever make.</v>

4555
01:58:03.091 --> 01:58:04.980
<v Speaker 3>Restaurant Lodge celebrities go under.</v>

4556
01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:06.090
<v Speaker 3>Jim's are bad,</v>

4557
01:58:06.091 --> 01:58:06.331
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4558
01:58:06.331 --> 01:58:09.420
<v Speaker 3>But gyms don't have the same kind of overhead that a restaurant does and the</v>

4559
01:58:09.421 --> 01:58:10.480
<v Speaker 3>dynamics of arrest,</v>

4560
01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:12.300
<v Speaker 3>they just don't go well.</v>

4561
01:58:12.301 --> 01:58:13.800
<v Speaker 3>And if you get a couple of bad reviews,</v>

4562
01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:17.040
<v Speaker 3>you don't bounce back unless it's a Mexican restaurant.</v>

4563
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:18.810
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have a clean restaurant.</v>

4564
01:58:18.811 --> 01:58:19.660
<v Speaker 3>If it's Mexican food,</v>

4565
01:58:19.661 --> 01:58:20.371
<v Speaker 3>not making marine,</v>

4566
01:58:20.371 --> 01:58:21.570
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be nice.</v>

4567
01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:24.720
<v Speaker 3>You know like we show up to El Torito.</v>

4568
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:28.410
<v Speaker 3>What was that place on Fairfax and is it not?</v>

4569
01:58:28.411 --> 01:58:30.410
<v Speaker 3>El Torito is that place and lost.</v>

4570
01:58:30.411 --> 01:58:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Bonnie knows Benito Benito.</v>

4571
01:58:32.230 --> 01:58:36.300
<v Speaker 3>Benito burritos show up and it's like little Taco shop and there's a Mexican guy</v>

4572
01:58:36.301 --> 01:58:36.781
<v Speaker 3>in the back.</v>

4573
01:58:36.781 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 3>He's making a burrito and you said hey.</v>

4574
01:58:38.970 --> 01:58:40.230
<v Speaker 3>And he looks over and he goes,</v>

4575
01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:40.441
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4576
01:58:40.441 --> 01:58:42.190
<v Speaker 3>can I get two the sodas?</v>

4577
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.390
<v Speaker 2>And the guy just kind of looks at Unis like waves at you kind of just nods at</v>

4578
01:58:46.391 --> 01:58:47.590
<v Speaker 2>you and you're like cool,</v>

4579
01:58:47.591 --> 01:58:48.640
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a great place.</v>

4580
01:58:48.730 --> 01:58:50.380
<v Speaker 2>That was a white guy that did that.</v>

4581
01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:51.251
<v Speaker 2>They'd be shut down.</v>

4582
01:58:51.251 --> 01:58:51.851
<v Speaker 2>If it's good,</v>

4583
01:58:51.851 --> 01:58:52.684
<v Speaker 2>I'll put up with it.</v>

4584
01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:55.900
<v Speaker 2>So with photos is 24 hours a day.</v>

4585
01:58:55.930 --> 01:58:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh is it on Beverly?</v>

4586
01:58:57.580 --> 01:58:59.170
<v Speaker 2>On Beverly and Fairfax Him.</v>

4587
01:58:59.240 --> 01:58:59.770

4734
02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:17.190
<v Speaker 7>Martina was ready for her most shocking transformation.</v>

4735
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:21.700
<v Speaker 7>I got three injections in the valley to change my skin color.</v>

4736

02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:27.550

02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:31.080
<v Speaker 8>she is black.</v>

4741
02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:33.033
<v Speaker 8>Black,</v>

4742
02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:34.250
<v Speaker 8>black.</v>

4745
02:03:38.231 --> 02:03:38.740
<v Speaker 7>Didn't did it</v>

4746
02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:39.250
<v Speaker 8>a lot of fake.</v>

4747
02:03:39.250 --> 02:03:40.660
<v Speaker 8>I've never seen him fake Tan.</v>

4748
02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:42.093
<v Speaker 8>Look at her.</v>

4749
02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:44.110
<v Speaker 8>Look at those stupid tits.</v>

4750
02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:47.170
<v Speaker 8>Those tits are distro preposterous.</v>

4751
02:03:47.710 --> 02:03:47.981
<v Speaker 8>God,</v>

4752
02:03:47.981 --> 02:03:48.814
<v Speaker 8>we are sick</v>

4753
02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:52.470
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>

4754
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:53.400
<v Speaker 8>Some white face.</v>

4755
02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:54.610
<v Speaker 7>Does she use the n word?</v>

4756
02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:57.340
<v Speaker 7>I've heard of people doing fake things on Maury before.</v>

4757
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.481
<v Speaker 7>Tricking them.</v>

4758
02:03:58.481 --> 02:03:59.680
<v Speaker 7>Just making up a story,</v>

4759
02:03:59.681 --> 02:04:00.514
<v Speaker 7>so hold on.</v>

4760
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:02.130
<v Speaker 7>But those chicks can't be fake.</v>

4761
02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:02.980
<v Speaker 7>What is she saying?</v>

4762
02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:03.310
<v Speaker 7>Hold on.</v>

4763
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:04.143
<v Speaker 7>Maybe they can be okay.</v>

4764
02:04:04.210 --> 02:04:04.770
<v Speaker 7>Myself.</v>

4765
02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:06.270
<v Speaker 7>What I also liked to do.</v>

4766
02:04:06.271 --> 02:04:07.920
<v Speaker 7>Photos work on the photos.</v>

4767
02:04:07.921 --> 02:04:10.910
<v Speaker 7>I didn't see if you have the cuffs of Pamela Anderson.</v>

4768
02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:11.913
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4769
02:04:12.330 --> 02:04:13.960
<v Speaker 7>photos would be much more.</v>

4770
02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:14.560
<v Speaker 7>That's awesome.</v>

4771
02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:18.430
<v Speaker 7>So you want her to look like Pamela Anderson because you like her curves.</v>

4772
02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:19.273
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4773
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:24.510
<v Speaker 7>And so then you became what you thought was Pamela Anderson and little bit more,</v>

4774
02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:25.480
<v Speaker 7>but now</v>

4775
02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:30.250
<v Speaker 7>it goes over our shoulders and arms.</v>

4776
02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:31.690
<v Speaker 7>That's how they do it in movies.</v>

4777
02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:32.793
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4778
02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:33.740
<v Speaker 7>Think could be.</v>

4779
02:04:34.030 --> 02:04:34.301
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

4780
02:04:34.301 --> 02:04:35.020
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't look like it.</v>

4781
02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:36.120
<v Speaker 7>Was it Sandra neck,</v>

4782
02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.620
<v Speaker 7>black girls,</v>

4783
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:38.821
<v Speaker 7>rock black.</v>

4784
02:04:38.821 --> 02:04:39.654
<v Speaker 7>God's wrong.</v>

4785
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:40.461
<v Speaker 7>Black slacks,</v>

4786
02:04:40.461 --> 02:04:40.831
<v Speaker 7>girls,</v>

4787
02:04:40.831 --> 02:04:41.760
<v Speaker 7>rock girl.</v>

4788
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:42.623
<v Speaker 7>Oh girl.</v>

4789
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:43.630
<v Speaker 7>Plots of land when he's,</v>

4790
02:04:43.650 --> 02:04:43.940
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

4791
02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:44.340
<v Speaker 7>yes.</v>

4792
02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:44.670
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

4793
02:04:44.670 --> 02:04:46.460
<v Speaker 7>I get my first look at that.</v>

4794
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:51.510
<v Speaker 7>So dark that somehow I got the liposuction as a form.</v>

4795
02:04:52.230 --> 02:04:53.400
<v Speaker 7>I want to see her boyfriend.</v>

4796
02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:54.563
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4797
02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:55.793
<v Speaker 3>Fucks</v>

4798
02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:00.240
<v Speaker 3>retirees.</v>

4799
02:05:00.430 --> 02:05:01.960
<v Speaker 3>Browse forward to the boyfriend.</v>

4800
02:05:02.450 --> 02:05:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's a boyfriend in there.</v>

4801
02:05:03.970 --> 02:05:04.141
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4802
02:05:04.141 --> 02:05:04.901
<v Speaker 3>there is no boyfriend.</v>

4803
02:05:04.901 --> 02:05:05.631
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure?</v>

4804
02:05:05.631 --> 02:05:06.464
<v Speaker 3>Look Darker.</v>

4805
02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:07.780
<v Speaker 3>There's no what?</v>

4806
02:05:07.870 --> 02:05:08.703
<v Speaker 3>She says,</v>

4807
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:09.760
<v Speaker 7>there's no boyfriend.</v>

4808
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:14.050
<v Speaker 7>Three injections in the belly and after the first boyfriend shown his face shot.</v>

4809
02:05:15.070 --> 02:05:16.320
<v Speaker 7>But today's security,</v>

4810
02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:17.533
<v Speaker 7>Martina,</v>

4811
02:05:18.850 --> 02:05:19.690
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck you're,</v>

4812
02:05:20.110 --> 02:05:20.943
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

4813
02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:24.221
<v Speaker 8>Oh No,</v>

4814
02:05:24.221 --> 02:05:24.551
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

4815
02:05:24.551 --> 02:05:25.384
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

4816
02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:26.260
<v Speaker 8>Oh No.</v>

4817
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:28.830
<v Speaker 7>I know you have to learn a lot.</v>

4818
02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:29.670
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4819
02:05:29.670 --> 02:05:30.503
<v Speaker 7>I see</v>

4820
02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:32.853
<v Speaker 3>your skin is black,</v>

4821
02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:34.720
<v Speaker 3>but you're not a black person.</v>

4822
02:05:34.930 --> 02:05:35.830
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing.</v>

4823
02:05:36.250 --> 02:05:38.230
<v Speaker 3>All people came from Africa originally,</v>

4824
02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:40.660
<v Speaker 3>like the only reason why people have white skin at all because he moved to</v>

4825
02:05:40.661 --> 02:05:41.441
<v Speaker 3>colder climates.</v>

4826
02:05:41.441 --> 02:05:43.480
<v Speaker 3>It was more cloudy and we didn't have vitamin D.</v>

4827
02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:43.981
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>

4828
02:05:43.981 --> 02:05:47.110
<v Speaker 3>you basically like a solar panel for vitamin D.</v>

4829
02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:48.460
<v Speaker 3>That's what white people are.</v>

4830
02:05:48.610 --> 02:05:51.880
<v Speaker 3>That's why people in England are so fucking Pale because it's always raining and</v>

4831
02:05:51.881 --> 02:05:53.140
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what it is.</v>

4832
02:05:53.141 --> 02:05:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone came from Africa.</v>

4833
02:05:54.941 --> 02:05:56.830
<v Speaker 3>All human beings came from Africa.</v>

4834
02:05:57.670 --> 02:06:01.600
<v Speaker 3>So she's not really black because that's not really her natural skin color</v>

4835
02:06:02.110 --> 02:06:02.471
<v Speaker 3>sheet.</v>

4836
02:06:02.471 --> 02:06:02.921
<v Speaker 3>But dude,</v>

4837
02:06:02.921 --> 02:06:05.260
<v Speaker 3>that is the greatest thing you've ever said for mankind.</v>

4838
02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:07.360
<v Speaker 3>She's not applying to a lot of reasons.</v>

4839
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:10.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a Turd giant problem that people have.</v>

4840
02:06:10.090 --> 02:06:11.380
<v Speaker 3>This idea of race,</v>

4841
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:13.750
<v Speaker 3>like the only reason why people look different,</v>

4842
02:06:13.751 --> 02:06:15.580
<v Speaker 3>it's because we moved to different climates.</v>

4843
02:06:15.850 --> 02:06:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone comes out of the same thing.</v>

4844
02:06:18.590 --> 02:06:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like all dogs come from wolves.</v>

4845
02:06:20.501 --> 02:06:22.090
<v Speaker 3>All humans come from Africa,</v>

4846
02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:22.953
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

4847
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Everybody originated there.</v>

4848
02:06:24.791 --> 02:06:25.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the motherland.</v>

4849
02:06:26.050 --> 02:06:30.010
<v Speaker 3>So like the only reason why they look different than you is because of natural</v>

4850
02:06:30.011 --> 02:06:30.850
<v Speaker 3>selection.</v>

4851
02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Because the people that live there that you know,</v>

4852
02:06:33.491 --> 02:06:34.390
<v Speaker 3>you're obviously,</v>

4853
02:06:34.391 --> 02:06:37.030
<v Speaker 3>you need that melon in your skin to protect you from the sun.</v>

4854
02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:38.140
<v Speaker 3>That's how people evolved.</v>

4855
02:06:38.141 --> 02:06:41.290
<v Speaker 3>And then as soon as people started going to all these colder climates and all</v>

4856
02:06:41.291 --> 02:06:43.360
<v Speaker 3>these climates that have a lot of cloud cover,</v>

4857
02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:47.320
<v Speaker 3>the people's body started changing and their body started changing to try to</v>

4858
02:06:47.321 --> 02:06:48.520
<v Speaker 3>absorb more vitamin D.</v>

4859
02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:50.680
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly why people have white skin.</v>

4860
02:06:52.330 --> 02:06:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Can they,</v>

4861
02:06:52.810 --> 02:06:55.720
<v Speaker 3>can they take hyenas and breed them to be like miniatures?</v>

4862
02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:56.321
<v Speaker 3>They could.</v>

4863
02:06:56.321 --> 02:06:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4864
02:06:56.620 --> 02:06:57.210
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

4865
02:06:57.210 --> 02:06:58.160
<v Speaker 3>I saw a guy with a pet,</v>

4866
02:06:58.161 --> 02:06:58.540
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>

4867
02:06:58.540 --> 02:06:58.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4868
02:06:58.810 --> 02:07:00.280
<v Speaker 3>they did it with foxes.</v>

4869
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:04.600
<v Speaker 3>They've done it with foxes and take it foxes in really quickly within 10 years.</v>

4870
02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:08.710
<v Speaker 3>Turn them into a completely different thing with a weak jaw and like floppy</v>

4871
02:07:08.711 --> 02:07:09.544
<v Speaker 3>ears.</v>

4872
02:07:09.550 --> 02:07:10.383
<v Speaker 3>Like to be pets.</v>

4873
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4874
02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:11.673
<v Speaker 3>well they did.</v>

4875
02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:16.680
<v Speaker 3>What they did was they took foxes and when they had a Fox that exhibited any</v>

4876
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:18.220
<v Speaker 3>aggression at all,</v>

4877
02:07:18.221 --> 02:07:23.221
<v Speaker 3>the killed it and so then they would breed them again and then any fox that it</v>

4878
02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:24.580
<v Speaker 3>showed any aggression at all,</v>

4879
02:07:24.581 --> 02:07:28.300
<v Speaker 3>killed it and then they kept doing this and they were doing this to generation</v>

4880
02:07:28.301 --> 02:07:33.280
<v Speaker 3>after generation to try to see how many generations it would take to turn a Fox</v>

4881
02:07:33.550 --> 02:07:36.400
<v Speaker 3>into like a really docile sort of house pet,</v>

4882
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:38.170
<v Speaker 3>sort of a stupid study.</v>

4883
02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:42.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not stupid because it's fascinating to find out how long it takes because</v>

4884
02:07:42.101 --> 02:07:44.860
<v Speaker 3>we thought it would take like hundreds of years for an animal to change.</v>

4885
02:07:45.130 --> 02:07:47.010
<v Speaker 3>It's essentially it's appearance like its,</v>

4886
02:07:47.011 --> 02:07:50.260
<v Speaker 3>its physical appearance is very different than a regular fox changed.</v>

4887
02:07:50.261 --> 02:07:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Their coloration changed how their ears,</v>

4888
02:07:52.451 --> 02:07:53.620
<v Speaker 3>their ears don't stick up anymore.</v>

4889
02:07:53.621 --> 02:07:55.660
<v Speaker 3>They flopped down and show submissiveness.</v>

4890
02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Same with dogs,</v>

4891
02:07:56.801 --> 02:07:57.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4892
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:59.020
<v Speaker 3>Like all dogs come from wolves.</v>

4893
02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:00.760
<v Speaker 3>In the original wolves,</v>

4894
02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:03.070
<v Speaker 3>the people kept as pets.</v>

4895
02:08:03.071 --> 02:08:04.270
<v Speaker 3>They would just get closer.</v>

4896
02:08:04.271 --> 02:08:07.150
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones you get closer to the people by the campfire that people would</v>

4897
02:08:07.151 --> 02:08:09.790
<v Speaker 3>feed those wolves and then they would use those wolves.</v>

4898
02:08:09.791 --> 02:08:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Still alert them to other animals are coming nearby.</v>

4899
02:08:12.130 --> 02:08:15.370
<v Speaker 3>The wolves stayed close to the campfire because the wolves knew that people were</v>

4900
02:08:15.371 --> 02:08:16.204
<v Speaker 3>going to give him food.</v>

4901
02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Then the wolf started protecting those people cause they,</v>

4902
02:08:18.181 --> 02:08:21.130
<v Speaker 3>that's where their food source was and the people worked out.</v>

4903
02:08:21.131 --> 02:08:22.520
<v Speaker 3>This relationship with wolves.</v>

4904
02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:23.380
<v Speaker 3>What country?</v>

4905
02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>This is the human race before there was country,</v>

4906
02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:27.010
<v Speaker 3>this is probably,</v>

4907
02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:27.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4908
02:08:27.251 --> 02:08:29.020
<v Speaker 3>we're talking more than 10,000 years ago.</v>

4909
02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:31.421
<v Speaker 3>Very recently,</v>

4910
02:08:31.421 --> 02:08:32.560
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in Russia.</v>

4911
02:08:32.590 --> 02:08:34.160
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where they did this folks doing that.</v>

4912
02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:39.240
<v Speaker 3>American Fox was in the 1950s and so they is ruthless study,</v>

4913
02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:43.360
<v Speaker 3>but they found out pretty quickly that you can,</v>

4914
02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:44.620
<v Speaker 3>you can select,</v>

4915
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:48.670
<v Speaker 3>you can change the way these things look based on which ones you breed with</v>

4916
02:08:48.671 --> 02:08:49.504
<v Speaker 3>which ones,</v>

4917
02:08:49.570 --> 02:08:52.900
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to think when people migrated out of Africa and they moved across</v>

4918
02:08:52.901 --> 02:08:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Asia and move through the Bering strait and into North America,</v>

4919
02:08:55.690 --> 02:08:55.941
<v Speaker 3>they may,</v>

4920
02:08:55.941 --> 02:08:57.490
<v Speaker 3>they're dealing with brutal cold.</v>

4921
02:08:57.700 --> 02:09:00.640
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times they're completely covered up because it's so fucking cold.</v>

4922
02:09:00.930 --> 02:09:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Or is that the boxes are more naturally stubborn than dogs.</v>

4923
02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh Cutie face.</v>

4924
02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:05.830
<v Speaker 3>They're very playful.</v>

4925
02:09:05.831 --> 02:09:06.431
<v Speaker 3>There's a little guys,</v>

4926
02:09:06.431 --> 02:09:08.110
<v Speaker 3>even in the wire lock to the pet,</v>

4927
02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:11.230
<v Speaker 3>you ever see a grizzly man with the dude made friends with Fox,</v>

4928
02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:14.110
<v Speaker 3>like a wild Fox in grizzly man,</v>

4929
02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.210
<v Speaker 3>like stole his hat and was playing with him.</v>

4930
02:09:16.210 --> 02:09:17.440
<v Speaker 3>He's tourism as the that died,</v>

4931
02:09:17.441 --> 02:09:17.621
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4932
02:09:17.621 --> 02:09:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:28.360
<v Speaker 3>No fines.</v>

4939
02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:33.900
<v Speaker 3>There's these weird gigantic Fox looking vulture bat things in Australia that</v>

4940
02:09:34.001 --> 02:09:36.100
<v Speaker 3>just a city that just like in the city,</v>

4948
02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:46.180
<v Speaker 3>swimming Australia.</v>

4949
02:09:46.181 --> 02:09:48.820
<v Speaker 3>So radical Adam Green tree was sending me videos.</v>

4950
02:09:48.821 --> 02:09:49.441
<v Speaker 3>He took these salt,</v>

4951
02:09:49.441 --> 02:09:50.320
<v Speaker 3>saltwater crocodiles.</v>

4952
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

4953
02:09:50.810 --> 02:09:51.670
<v Speaker 3>A regular bat.</v>

4954
02:09:51.810 --> 02:09:53.380
<v Speaker 3>Australian flying foxes.</v>

4955
02:09:53.381 --> 02:09:54.570
<v Speaker 3>It just sometime Fox.</v>

4956
02:09:54.590 --> 02:09:55.423
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

4957
02:09:55.930 --> 02:09:57.040
<v Speaker 3>flying flats area.</v>

4958
02:09:57.050 --> 02:09:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4959
02:09:57.370 --> 02:09:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Is it crazy as that?</v>

4960
02:09:58.421 --> 02:10:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Is it actually a flying fox or is that what they call a bat that they call it</v>

4961
02:10:01.681 --> 02:10:04.600
<v Speaker 3>that everything looks like it looks like a Fox.</v>

4962
02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:08.650
<v Speaker 3>The Fox with winning Shin in soldier and just in Sydney.</v>

4963
02:10:08.651 --> 02:10:10.330
<v Speaker 3>Just hanging on the tree thing is sick.</v>

4964
02:10:10.331 --> 02:10:11.164
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>

4965
02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:11.321
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4966
02:10:11.321 --> 02:10:12.031
<v Speaker 3>you know how like we,</v>

4967
02:10:12.031 --> 02:10:12.701
<v Speaker 3>we always look good.</v>

4968
02:10:12.701 --> 02:10:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Another pterodactyls.</v>

4969
02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:17.170
<v Speaker 3>You know how we look at care doctors and we always assume that they have wings</v>

4970
02:10:17.171 --> 02:10:18.004
<v Speaker 3>like a bat.</v>

4971
02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 3>That's what everybody was thought.</v>

4972
02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:22.600
<v Speaker 3>But now they're finding out that so many dinosaurs had feathers that it's</v>

4973
02:10:22.601 --> 02:10:25.030
<v Speaker 3>entirely possible that Tara doctors were birds.</v>

4974
02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:27.760
<v Speaker 3>Did they think the t rex were covered in feathers to write?</v>

4975
02:10:27.761 --> 02:10:28.594
<v Speaker 3>Very possible.</v>

4976
02:10:28.690 --> 02:10:29.980
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of evidence.</v>

4977
02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:32.770
<v Speaker 3>There's some evidence that some,</v>

4978
02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:35.750
<v Speaker 3>well there's definitely evidence that some dinosaurs had feathers.</v>

4979
02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:38.230
<v Speaker 3>They found fossilized dinosaurs with feathers and,</v>

4980
02:10:38.231 --> 02:10:40.940
<v Speaker 3>but this is all recently like over the last few decades,</v>

4981
02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:43.200
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to find more and more of them like it.</v>

4982
02:10:43.210 --> 02:10:43.410
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

4983
02:10:43.410 --> 02:10:48.230
<v Speaker 3>there's a museum that I went to in Montana and they mocked out a velociraptor</v>

4984
02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:50.800
<v Speaker 3>with feathers because look birds like,</v>

4985
02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:52.580
<v Speaker 3>like you look at it like an owl.</v>

4986
02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:53.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a fucking dinosaur.</v>

4987
02:10:53.791 --> 02:10:54.050
<v Speaker 3>Me.</v>

4988
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:56.240
<v Speaker 3>The closest thing to the closest thing to a dinosaur.</v>

4989
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:56.931
<v Speaker 3>They're ruthless,</v>

4990
02:10:56.931 --> 02:10:57.071
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

4991
02:10:57.071 --> 02:10:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Did I tell you about the fucking the wars that I'm having in my backyard?</v>

4992
02:10:59.930 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 3>That's what dude,</v>

4993
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:02.420
<v Speaker 3>there's Fox war.</v>

4994
02:11:02.490 --> 02:11:03.261
<v Speaker 3>Not Fox wars.</v>

4995
02:11:03.261 --> 02:11:05.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a hawk wars going on in my yard.</v>

4996
02:11:05.630 --> 02:11:06.470
<v Speaker 3>They're killing each other.</v>

4997
02:11:07.370 --> 02:11:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Birds are killing other birds and they behead them.</v>

4998
02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:13.750
<v Speaker 3>So I started going online and reading about it and they eat their head and I'm,</v>

4999
02:11:13.751 --> 02:11:14.121
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5000
02:11:14.121 --> 02:11:15.890
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck eats a hawk's head?</v>

5001
02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:16.251
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5002
02:11:16.251 --> 02:11:19.640
<v Speaker 3>apparently when birds of prey will kill other birds,</v>

5003
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:21.560
<v Speaker 3>one of the things they do is eat their head.</v>

5004
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:22.730
<v Speaker 3>They eat the headache,</v>

5005
02:11:22.731 --> 02:11:24.250
<v Speaker 3>they pull the head of show like dominant.</v>

5006
02:11:24.251 --> 02:11:25.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

5007
02:11:25.101 --> 02:11:25.761
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on,</v>

5008
02:11:25.761 --> 02:11:26.900
<v Speaker 3>but Jesus Christ.</v>

5009
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:29.730
<v Speaker 3>But one of my neighbors saw um,</v>

5010
02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:33.230
<v Speaker 3>a hawk eating a hawk baby like right up the street from me.</v>

5011
02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:36.950
<v Speaker 3>And I watched these hawks like swooped down and one of them slammed in my</v>

5012
02:11:36.951 --> 02:11:37.784
<v Speaker 3>chicken coop.</v>

5013
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Like there's like these juvenile hawks.</v>

5014
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:44.240
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the things that's going on is I have a fence in my backyard</v>

5015
02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:45.170
<v Speaker 3>and it's a,</v>

5016
02:11:45.170 --> 02:11:48.200
<v Speaker 3>we just put up a glass fence and these birds just fucking,</v>

5017
02:11:48.590 --> 02:11:50.530
<v Speaker 3>we've murked like 15 birds.</v>

5018
02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

5019
02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:52.110
<v Speaker 3>Did you pick a class fence?</v>

5020
02:11:52.170 --> 02:11:53.003
<v Speaker 3>It looks beautiful.</v>

5021
02:11:53.010 --> 02:11:54.830
<v Speaker 3>You could see the whole view with these birds.</v>

5022
02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:59.600
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand that it's a fence and they swooped down clang and they get</v>

5023
02:11:59.601 --> 02:12:00.440
<v Speaker 3>k that fuck,</v>

5024
02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:01.333
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5025
02:12:01.670 --> 02:12:05.070
<v Speaker 3>just had traveling when she had a video camera.</v>

5026
02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:06.320
<v Speaker 3>A little security,</v>

5027
02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:08.960
<v Speaker 3>a lot of wasted footage because it only happens like once a month.</v>

5028
02:12:10.110 --> 02:12:13.390
<v Speaker 3>It's happened quite a few times where birds have flown down.</v>

5029
02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:16.820
<v Speaker 3>We found them just like drunk wandering around the backyard.</v>

5030
02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Ct just hammered the fuck up.</v>

5031
02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Blood coming out of their nose like a fag and him with blood coming out of their</v>

5032
02:12:24.201 --> 02:12:24.620
<v Speaker 3>nose.</v>

5033
02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:25.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5034
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:26.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5035
02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:27.133
<v Speaker 3>They get kol.</v>

5036
02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:31.460
<v Speaker 3>So I think we've killed a bunch of hawks this way.</v>

5037
02:12:31.461 --> 02:12:32.294
<v Speaker 3>Hawks have died.</v>

5038
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:33.531
<v Speaker 3>We haven't killed him.</v>

5039
02:12:33.531 --> 02:12:34.191
<v Speaker 3>They killed themselves.</v>

5040
02:12:34.191 --> 02:12:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5041
02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:35.653
<v Speaker 3>Evolution Bitch.</v>

5042
02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.580
<v Speaker 3>But these other hawks,</v>

5043
02:12:37.610 --> 02:12:41.490
<v Speaker 3>these juvenile hawks are now like kind of taken over because of that.</v>

5044
02:12:41.491 --> 02:12:43.190
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the ones that got killed,</v>

5045
02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:44.570
<v Speaker 3>one of the hawks that got killed,</v>

5046
02:12:44.571 --> 02:12:45.404
<v Speaker 3>look at that fucker.</v>

5047
02:12:45.930 --> 02:12:46.221
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>

5048
02:12:46.221 --> 02:12:47.000
<v Speaker 3>And he's eaten.</v>

5049
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Eaten a bird to decapitated a hawk.</v>

5050
02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:49.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5051
02:12:49.371 --> 02:12:49.791
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

5052
02:12:49.791 --> 02:12:51.020
<v Speaker 3>He's decapitating a hawk.</v>

5053
02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

5054
02:12:52.490 --> 02:12:54.170
<v Speaker 3>They are fucking monster.</v>

5055
02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:55.033
<v Speaker 3>Do this.</v>

5056
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Ruthless owls are so God damn ruthless.</v>

5057
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:59.361
<v Speaker 3>So cool.</v>

5058
02:12:59.361 --> 02:12:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Don't they?</v>

5059
02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:00.591
<v Speaker 3>They do look cool.</v>

5060
02:13:00.591 --> 02:13:05.591
<v Speaker 3>But it's weird that we've made these things out to be these wise cute creatures</v>

5061
02:13:05.661 --> 02:13:06.920
<v Speaker 3>that like give a hoot.</v>

5062
02:13:06.921 --> 02:13:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Don't pollute the tootsie roll.</v>

5063
02:13:08.661 --> 02:13:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Pop.</v>

5064
02:13:09.050 --> 02:13:09.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5065
02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:10.560
<v Speaker 3>The tootsie roll pops.</v>

5066
02:13:10.770 --> 02:13:12.050
<v Speaker 3>There's owls everywhere.</v>

5067
02:13:12.770 --> 02:13:14.540
<v Speaker 3>The ruthless man there too.</v>

5068
02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:16.640
<v Speaker 3>I'd ever seen straight up predators.</v>

5069
02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:17.031
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

5070
02:13:17.031 --> 02:13:17.410
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

5071
02:13:17.410 --> 02:13:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Every time I see him all the time,</v>

5072
02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:20.970
<v Speaker 3>oh look at this bird.</v>

5073
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:23.320
<v Speaker 3>He trying to get away like not today.</v>

5074
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Pitch birth the fucking day to Dow.</v>

5075
02:13:26.991 --> 02:13:29.330
<v Speaker 3>Ho do you an eat your head.</v>

5076
02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:30.800
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

5077
02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:31.970
<v Speaker 3>so I've found a</v>

5078
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.330
<v Speaker 2>decapitated bird in my yard and I posted a picture of it on Instagram and then</v>

5079
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:37.650
<v Speaker 2>started reading up on it.</v>

5080
02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's when birds kill other birds,</v>

5081
02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:40.891
<v Speaker 2>they'll do that.</v>

5082
02:13:40.891 --> 02:13:44.100
<v Speaker 2>They literally bite their fucking head off like a territory war thing.</v>

5083
02:13:44.101 --> 02:13:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Like a gang thing.</v>

5084
02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:46.980
<v Speaker 2>I think when these Bert,</v>

5085
02:13:47.010 --> 02:13:47.701
<v Speaker 2>my theory,</v>

5086
02:13:47.701 --> 02:13:51.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a shitty theory cause I'm not really qualified to have a theory on this,</v>

5087
02:13:51.181 --> 02:13:55.650
<v Speaker 2>but I think that these birds slamming into that fence and a few of them dying</v>

5088
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:57.590
<v Speaker 2>have kinda upset the,</v>

5089
02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>the gang situation in my neighborhood,</v>

5090
02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:04.753
<v Speaker 2>bird Fuller's,</v>

5091
02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:06.413
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

5092
02:14:06.570 --> 02:14:09.870
<v Speaker 2>owls are so ruthless and they ain't shit compared to eagles.</v>

5093
02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Eagles of the most ruthless.</v>

5094
02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen those Harpy Eagles that are they huge shy and they're just</v>

5095
02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:21.210
<v Speaker 2>how big huge kills monkeys.</v>

5096
02:14:21.211 --> 02:14:23.100
<v Speaker 2>They go after monkeys and they eat a lot of,</v>

5097
02:14:23.101 --> 02:14:23.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5098
02:14:23.670 --> 02:14:24.780
<v Speaker 2>what are those little slow things?</v>

5099
02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:25.613
<v Speaker 2>Sloths.</v>

5100
02:14:25.770 --> 02:14:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Who's talking?</v>

5101
02:14:26.761 --> 02:14:27.321
<v Speaker 2>Sloths.</v>

5102
02:14:27.321 --> 02:14:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

5103
02:14:27.690 --> 02:14:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Harpy Eagles.</v>

5104
02:14:28.571 --> 02:14:32.130
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up because Google Harpy Eagles eat sloths.</v>

5105
02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:34.640
<v Speaker 2>I think Thursdays official sloths day.</v>

5106
02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:35.673
<v Speaker 2>If you're a slot,</v>

5107
02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I think Harpy Eagles of the biggest eagles in the world.</v>

5108
02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:41.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that thing is Jack.</v>

5109
02:14:42.450 --> 02:14:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

5110
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:43.820
<v Speaker 2>they're ruthless.</v>

5111
02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:43.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5112
02:14:43.911 --> 02:14:45.510
<v Speaker 2>get this motherfucker swoops down.</v>

5113
02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:47.130
<v Speaker 2>What about vultures?</v>

5114
02:14:47.131 --> 02:14:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

5115
02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:48.593
<v Speaker 2>they're big.</v>

5116
02:14:48.630 --> 02:14:49.100
<v Speaker 2>They're big.</v>

5117
02:14:49.100 --> 02:14:52.200
<v Speaker 2>The scary cause they're not predators like that.</v>

5118
02:14:52.201 --> 02:14:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Sloths are gone or so that's a bummer.</v>

5119
02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:55.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrap like a sloths man.</v>

5120
02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:58.140
<v Speaker 2>But nature just made them like real easy to eat,</v>

5121
02:14:58.770 --> 02:15:01.860
<v Speaker 2>but they really don't get fucked with doe because they're not out in the open.</v>

5122
02:15:01.861 --> 02:15:02.100
<v Speaker 2>I the,</v>

5123
02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:03.600
<v Speaker 2>when they are to get the cat monkey,</v>

5124
02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:05.520
<v Speaker 2>she'll goddamn slow.</v>

5125
02:15:05.521 --> 02:15:06.960
<v Speaker 2>These these Harpy Eagles,</v>

5126
02:15:06.961 --> 02:15:08.280
<v Speaker 2>they eat monkeys like crazy.</v>

5127
02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:10.320
<v Speaker 2>He swooped down and Jack monkeys in,</v>

5128
02:15:10.321 --> 02:15:14.970
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they found on ancient primate skulls,</v>

5129
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:20.130
<v Speaker 2>they fell out all these weird scratches and all this evidence of predation and</v>

5130
02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:21.480
<v Speaker 2>now they think that that,</v>

5131
02:15:21.570 --> 02:15:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

5132
02:15:21.870 --> 02:15:22.703
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

5133
02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:23.773
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5134
02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:24.491
<v Speaker 2>it's doing,</v>

5135
02:15:24.491 --> 02:15:28.230
<v Speaker 2>it's a little left and right now they think that that scratching is probably</v>

5136
02:15:28.231 --> 02:15:30.300
<v Speaker 2>some sort of an ancient eagle.</v>

5137
02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:34.220
<v Speaker 2>There was preying on ancient hominids Jesus Christ.</v>

5138
02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5139
02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:35.810
<v Speaker 2>birds are real PELICO.</v>

5140
02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:36.930
<v Speaker 2>They film this and put this in,</v>

5141
02:15:36.931 --> 02:15:37.830
<v Speaker 2>edited this together.</v>

5142
02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:40.110
<v Speaker 2>That's not going happen like this.</v>

5143
02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:42.780
<v Speaker 2>It's all taken in different years.</v>

5144
02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:45.630
<v Speaker 2>But she got her license disbelief just to watch him.</v>

5145
02:15:45.631 --> 02:15:46.500

5147
02:15:48.351 --> 02:15:51.810
<v Speaker 2>What's the big ass bird that grabs the goats and drops some Feagles.</v>

5148
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Those are Golden Eagles.</v>

5149
02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:54.990
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing that shit without guns.</v>

5150
02:15:55.050 --> 02:15:56.860
<v Speaker 2>What about the small notes?</v>

5151
02:15:56.870 --> 02:16:00.030
<v Speaker 2>Such Muslim guys with that falconry?</v>

5152
02:16:00.031 --> 02:16:00.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5153
02:16:00.301 --> 02:16:01.350
<v Speaker 2>They use them to hunt.</v>

5154
02:16:02.190 --> 02:16:05.310
<v Speaker 2>They hunt rabbits and shit with them at that bird that picks up a straight up</v>

5155
02:16:05.311 --> 02:16:05.790
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

02:16:09.571 --> 02:16:09.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5160
02:16:09.811 --> 02:16:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Golden Eagles hunt goats.</v>

02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Those are big.</v>

5162

<v Speaker 2>I think those are the biggest eagles in North America.</v>

02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Those are big ass ego.</v>

02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:24.900
<v Speaker 2>All they're doing is dragging them down.</v>

5170
02:16:24.930 --> 02:16:28.170
<v Speaker 2>And the goats sometimes drag the eagles down to the Eagle.</v>

5171
02:16:28.171 --> 02:16:29.004
<v Speaker 2>Takes a hit too.</v>

02:17:27.890 --> 02:17:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

5203
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:30.230
<v Speaker 2>And they sent the bird down.</v>

5204
02:17:30.231 --> 02:17:32.990
<v Speaker 2>The bird just put the whacked down on these poor Fox.</v>

5205
02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:33.351
<v Speaker 2>They eat.</v>

02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:36.141
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

02:17:36.141 --> 02:17:36.890
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>

5210
02:17:36.890 --> 02:17:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they eat them.</v>

5211
02:17:37.970 --> 02:17:38.690
<v Speaker 2>They might,</v>

5212
02:17:38.690 --> 02:17:38.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5213
02:17:38.961 --> 02:17:41.270
<v Speaker 2>apparently some trappers in pioneers,</v>

5214
02:17:41.271 --> 02:17:42.081
<v Speaker 2>we're big on eating.</v>

5215
02:17:42.081 --> 02:17:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Eagles are not eagles.</v>

5216
02:17:43.490 --> 02:17:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5217
02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5218
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:46.520
<v Speaker 2>wolves they eat,</v>

5219
02:17:46.550 --> 02:17:47.480
<v Speaker 2>they ate a lot of wolves,</v>

5220
02:17:47.481 --> 02:17:48.830
<v Speaker 2>like some famous trappers.</v>

5221
02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Goals were their favorite food,</v>

5222
02:17:50.630 --> 02:17:52.040
<v Speaker 2>whatever that lady's Eskimo or whatever.</v>

5223
02:17:52.041 --> 02:17:54.470
<v Speaker 2>She is stressed out that this thing is not going to like catch it.</v>

5224
02:17:54.890 --> 02:17:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just what she looks like.</v>

5225
02:17:58.400 --> 02:17:59.910
<v Speaker 2>She's living a hard life son.</v>

5226
02:18:00.290 --> 02:18:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

5227
02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:03.290
<v Speaker 2>The look at the fucking Fox trying to fight,</v>

5228
02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:04.850
<v Speaker 2>trying to fight back in those clauses.</v>

5229
02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:07.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a vice grip.</v>

5230
02:18:07.550 --> 02:18:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh but you can get that beacon vault soon on that neck.</v>

5231
02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I think they'd have to put the chase in later.</v>

5232
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.823
<v Speaker 2>Like they get like,</v>

5233
02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:16.310
<v Speaker 2>like train foxes and have them running and shit.</v>

5234
02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:17.600
<v Speaker 2>The bitch hold a whistle.</v>

5235
02:18:17.601 --> 02:18:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Is that a thing?</v>

5236
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Does that exactly what it is</v>

5237
02:18:21.390 --> 02:18:23.270
<v Speaker 2>that Fox put up like decent fight.</v>

5238
02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:25.490
<v Speaker 2>The wolf one is even more disturbing.</v>

5239
02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh the Fox is trying,</v>

5240
02:18:26.691 --> 02:18:26.931
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5241
02:18:26.931 --> 02:18:27.381
<v Speaker 2>He's trying,</v>

5242
02:18:27.381 --> 02:18:28.160
<v Speaker 2>but he's just kidding.</v>

5243
02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:29.330
<v Speaker 2>We got ourselves a fight here.</v>

5244
02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:29.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5245
02:18:29.991 --> 02:18:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Well not really cause the Fox can't even bite them.</v>

5246
02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:32.990
<v Speaker 2>They're so smart.</v>

5247
02:18:32.991 --> 02:18:35.160
<v Speaker 2>They just grab a hold of all birds.</v>

5248
02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Stress me out man.</v>

5249
02:18:36.181 --> 02:18:36.831
<v Speaker 2>Which is weird.</v>

5250
02:18:36.831 --> 02:18:38.930
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to train these things man.</v>

5251
02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:41.900
<v Speaker 2>When you call Your Eagle stand against the wind.</v>

5252
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh that makes sense.</v>

5253
02:18:42.890 --> 02:18:43.850
<v Speaker 2>So the ego can hear you.</v>

5254
02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:48.170
<v Speaker 2>If you saw one of those things coming right at you,</v>

5255
02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:48.561
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

5256
02:18:48.561 --> 02:18:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Strike that overhand knife strength.</v>

5257
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll just come around at all.</v>

5258
02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:53.900
<v Speaker 2>You got to grapple with an eagle.</v>

5259
02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:55.990
<v Speaker 2>This fucking the problem.</v>

5260
02:18:55.991 --> 02:18:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Have them arms.</v>

5261
02:18:57.350 --> 02:18:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think if you hit him there,</v>

5262
02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:02.060
<v Speaker 2>they're not heavy enough for it to make like a lot of impact when you hit him.</v>

5263
02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:03.200
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

5264
02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:04.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're hitting a dog.</v>

5265
02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:04.881
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5266
02:19:04.881 --> 02:19:06.170
<v Speaker 2>If you punch a dog in the face,</v>

5267
02:19:06.171 --> 02:19:07.380
<v Speaker 2>a dog weighs 70 pounds.</v>

5268
02:19:07.381 --> 02:19:07.511
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

5269
02:19:07.511 --> 02:19:09.320
<v Speaker 2>they're both squishing the stance you're getting.</v>

5270
02:19:09.321 --> 02:19:10.154

02:19:47.391 --> 02:19:48.260
<v Speaker 2>and you got to grab them.</v>

5301
02:19:48.261 --> 02:19:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Talents.</v>

5302
02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:49.461
<v Speaker 2>Got to grab the speed.</v>

5303
02:19:49.461 --> 02:19:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they,</v>

5304
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:53.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they attack with a beak as much as they attack with the towns and</v>

5305
02:19:53.241 --> 02:19:53.860
<v Speaker 2>eat with the beat.</v>

5306
02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:55.040
<v Speaker 2>They come feet first.</v>

5307
02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5308
02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Like when they catch a salmon,</v>

5309
02:19:57.200 --> 02:19:58.450
<v Speaker 2>how are they going to get around this?</v>

5310
02:19:58.520 --> 02:19:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about how powerful they are.</v>

5311
02:19:59.661 --> 02:20:00.950
<v Speaker 2>What if you had to grab a salmon,</v>

5312
02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:02.600
<v Speaker 2>what did I say wrong?</v>

5313
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:03.980
<v Speaker 2>You gotta reach in and grab it with your hands.</v>

5314
02:20:03.981 --> 02:20:07.400
<v Speaker 2>No chance they swimming down and fly with it.</v>

5315
02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.450
<v Speaker 2>They snatched it out of the water and fly away with a standard long lasting</v>

5316
02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:12.210
<v Speaker 2>males.</v>

5317
02:20:12.210 --> 02:20:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5318
02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:14.040
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably be able to grab him to,</v>

5319
02:20:15.390 --> 02:20:16.270
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to have some serious,</v>

5320
02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:17.930
<v Speaker 2>also not very cuddly,</v>

5321
02:20:17.931 --> 02:20:20.570
<v Speaker 2>like they're fucking evil</v>

5322
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:25.460
<v Speaker 2>tribal cultures that let their nails grow and they sharpen them and they use</v>

5323
02:20:25.461 --> 02:20:27.680
<v Speaker 2>them as like weapons and war.</v>

5324
02:20:27.890 --> 02:20:29.810
<v Speaker 2>We have bitch nails are nails fall apart.</v>

5325
02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:31.073
<v Speaker 2>You know our nails,</v>

5326
02:20:31.180 --> 02:20:32.500
<v Speaker 2>if you get him slammed in the door,</v>

5327
02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:33.410
<v Speaker 2>cause we don't use them.</v>

5328
02:20:33.470 --> 02:20:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're supposed to,</v>

5329
02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:35.690
<v Speaker 2>we don't really need caught.</v>

5330
02:20:35.691 --> 02:20:38.240
<v Speaker 2>A salmon are supposed to have claws.</v>

5331
02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:39.230
<v Speaker 2>That guy's a beast.</v>

5332
02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:41.030
<v Speaker 2>The water.</v>

5333
02:20:41.470 --> 02:20:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Why this is different,</v>

5334
02:20:42.861 --> 02:20:43.041
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5335
02:20:43.041 --> 02:20:44.720
<v Speaker 2>These things are males are,</v>

5336
02:20:44.750 --> 02:20:45.640
<v Speaker 2>he's going to eat it too.</v>

5337
02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:46.533
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5338
02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:47.873
<v Speaker 2>Geez.</v>

5339
02:20:48.270 --> 02:20:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Bare hands and eat it raw.</v>

5340
02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

5341
02:20:50.450 --> 02:20:54.620
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to really eat salmon Sushi even because my Paris like the</v>

5342
02:20:54.621 --> 02:20:55.430
<v Speaker 2>shit out of it.</v>

5343
02:20:55.430 --> 02:20:56.241
<v Speaker 2>It's not smart.</v>

5344
02:20:56.241 --> 02:20:57.074
<v Speaker 2>I feel good.</v>

5345
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:59.600
<v Speaker 2>You can get parasites guys going to eat it raw.</v>

5346
02:20:59.690 --> 02:21:00.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5347
02:21:00.530 --> 02:21:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Well a lot of people do,</v>

5348
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:05.000
<v Speaker 2>but when you talk to like people that want to play it safe,</v>

5349
02:21:05.001 --> 02:21:06.170
<v Speaker 2>they say you should need anything.</v>

5350
02:21:06.171 --> 02:21:07.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a fresh water.</v>

5351
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Don't eat fresh water.</v>

5352
02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Well this guy's,</v>

5353
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:11.810
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's gross?</v>

5354
02:21:11.811 --> 02:21:12.830
<v Speaker 2>But do you like Sushi?</v>

5355
02:21:12.831 --> 02:21:13.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't need it.</v>

5356
02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I hate Sushi.</v>

5357
02:21:14.031 --> 02:21:15.670
<v Speaker 2>You don't like Sushi Joe Eight he's got,</v>

5358
02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:18.500
<v Speaker 2>I used to go to when Eddie and I would go to restaurants,</v>

5359
02:21:18.530 --> 02:21:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I used to lose my fucking mind cause ed,</v>

5360
02:21:20.281 --> 02:21:21.950
<v Speaker 2>he's like no Cilantro,</v>

5361
02:21:22.450 --> 02:21:23.150
<v Speaker 2>onions,</v>

5362
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Callidus.</v>

5363
02:21:23.960 --> 02:21:24.850
<v Speaker 2>That's how Brian,</v>

5364
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't need all that chip.</v>

5365
02:21:27.171 --> 02:21:28.010
<v Speaker 2>The meat's good.</v>

5366
02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Why do I need onions and shit on it?</v>

5367
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Give me some good meat.</v>

5368
02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:32.810
<v Speaker 2>The best is going to Fogo with him though.</v>

5369
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Then there's no bro Shit.</v>

5370
02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:34.531
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5371
02:21:34.531 --> 02:21:38.810
<v Speaker 2>you just get this on this flip that pinch over what's happening with the Fogo de</v>

5372
02:21:38.810 --> 02:21:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Chao.</v>

5373
02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:39.710
<v Speaker 2>We went in Vegas,</v>

5374
02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:40.870
<v Speaker 2>we've chatted up con.</v>

5375
02:21:40.871 --> 02:21:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5376
02:21:41.210 --> 02:21:42.990
<v Speaker 2>we gained like fucking 10 pounds.</v>

5377
02:21:43.980 --> 02:21:44.621
<v Speaker 2>We feast.</v>

5378
02:21:44.621 --> 02:21:45.890
<v Speaker 2>It sounds nice.</v>

5379
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:46.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh so good.</v>

5380
02:21:46.701 --> 02:21:47.840
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't been there in forever.</v>

5381
02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:49.100
<v Speaker 2>We had a good time.</v>

5382
02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't really have,</v>

5383
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say munchies,</v>

5384
02:21:52.310 --> 02:21:53.143
<v Speaker 2>but when you get the high,</v>

5385
02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you get high so much.</v>

5386
02:21:54.171 --> 02:21:55.040
<v Speaker 2>He probably doesn't fuck with you,</v>

5387
02:21:55.041 --> 02:21:57.170
<v Speaker 2>but since you're not got the munchies from pot,</v>

5388
02:21:57.171 --> 02:21:58.580
<v Speaker 2>man probably never know.</v>

5389
02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean not get hungry like normal,</v>

5390
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.791
<v Speaker 2>but pot was,</v>

5391
02:22:01.791 --> 02:22:06.470
<v Speaker 2>it never gave me munchies cause now you're off the hot food tastes way better</v>

5392
02:22:06.471 --> 02:22:06.770
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

5393
02:22:06.770 --> 02:22:07.560
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

5394
02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:08.393
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

5395
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5396
02:22:09.450 --> 02:22:11.060
<v Speaker 2>He's smoking a little bit.</v>

5397
02:22:11.090 --> 02:22:12.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean I do too.</v>

5398
02:22:12.370 --> 02:22:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5399
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:14.023
<v Speaker 2>Do you use it to write?</v>

5400
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:14.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5401
02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:15.231
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

5402
02:22:15.231 --> 02:22:15.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5403
02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:16.280
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5404
02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:17.113
<v Speaker 2>He should try to.</v>

5405
02:22:17.130 --> 02:22:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5406
02:22:17.790 --> 02:22:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5407
02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Since you're doing stand up,</v>

5408
02:22:19.191 --> 02:22:20.310
<v Speaker 2>you should definitely write hi.</v>

5409
02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5410
02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

5411
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:22.141
<v Speaker 2>That's the day.</v>

5412
02:22:22.141 --> 02:22:24.350
<v Speaker 2>That's where you know what I do don't I do both.</v>

5413
02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 2>I write sober and I write hi.</v>

5414
02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:27.930
<v Speaker 3>I do both and sometimes I break.</v>

5415
02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Listen to George Carlin talk about that once he was saying that he likes to</v>

5416
02:22:30.301 --> 02:22:32.630
<v Speaker 3>write sober and then he touches everything,</v>

5417
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:34.170
<v Speaker 3>not punches it up when he's high.</v>

5418
02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:34.591
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5419
02:22:34.591 --> 02:22:35.400
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

5420
02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:35.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5421
02:22:35.830 --> 02:22:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Like smoke a little weed and then go over the material back.</v>

5422
02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:38.940
<v Speaker 3>But what's funny about it?</v>

5423
02:22:38.941 --> 02:22:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5424
02:22:39.390 --> 02:22:40.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5425
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:41.280
<v Speaker 3>I like both men.</v>

5426
02:22:41.370 --> 02:22:42.360
<v Speaker 3>I like writing,</v>

5427
02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:44.460
<v Speaker 3>writing sober and riding high,</v>

5428
02:22:44.461 --> 02:22:45.780
<v Speaker 3>but when I write high it's like,</v>

5429
02:22:45.781 --> 02:22:47.250
<v Speaker 3>are you just get these gifts?</v>

5430
02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:49.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like the universe gives you these gifts.</v>

5431
02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:49.891
<v Speaker 3>Like where is this?</v>

5432
02:22:49.891 --> 02:22:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Even comedies as it funny too.</v>

5433
02:22:51.271 --> 02:22:51.970
<v Speaker 3>When you're highly,</v>

5434
02:22:51.970 --> 02:22:53.130
<v Speaker 3>you look back over when you're sober,</v>

5435
02:22:53.131 --> 02:22:53.341
<v Speaker 3>that guy,</v>

5436
02:22:53.341 --> 02:22:54.930
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck was definitely that?</v>

5437
02:22:54.931 --> 02:22:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a bit about it,</v>

5438
02:22:56.020 --> 02:22:59.670
<v Speaker 3>but I literally wrote down a Unicorn as a donkey from the future and then I went</v>

5439
02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:00.540
<v Speaker 3>down and looked at my notes and,</v>

5440
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5441
02:23:00.670 --> 02:23:02.430
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck does that even mean?</v>

5442
02:23:02.460 --> 02:23:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

5443
02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:03.883
<v Speaker 3>The</v>

5444
02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:09.870
<v Speaker 3>funny thing about it that you didn't write down exactly and you forgot it was so</v>

5445
02:23:09.871 --> 02:23:10.410
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>

5446
02:23:10.410 --> 02:23:13.110
<v Speaker 3>but I wrote it down and then I went over it two days after the fact.</v>

5447
02:23:13.111 --> 02:23:13.501
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

5448
02:23:13.501 --> 02:23:15.030
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

5449
02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:16.410
<v Speaker 3>I wrote that down,</v>

5450
02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:19.170
<v Speaker 3>I bring a bunch of shit down.</v>

5451
02:23:19.470 --> 02:23:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Like I have to see every now and then cause a lot of what I write down,</v>

5452
02:23:22.381 --> 02:23:25.290
<v Speaker 3>if I'm high I'll write down some shit like at the comedy store or something like</v>

5453
02:23:25.291 --> 02:23:25.740
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

5454
02:23:25.740 --> 02:23:27.750
<v Speaker 3>And then I have to go over my notes when I'm sober.</v>

5455
02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:28.733
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5456
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

5457
02:23:30.010 --> 02:23:30.843
<v Speaker 3>I do not.</v>

5458
02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:32.970
<v Speaker 3>I do on your phone and do it physically.</v>

5459
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Well physically like with a computer and then I write notes on the computer.</v>

5460
02:23:38.461 --> 02:23:39.300
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

5461
02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:43.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a tiny the computer like physically,</v>

5462
02:23:43.261 --> 02:23:44.094
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5463
02:23:44.190 --> 02:23:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Like uh,</v>

5464
02:23:44.970 --> 02:23:46.950
<v Speaker 3>I thought physically was like with a pen.</v>

5465
02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:47.551
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5466
02:23:47.551 --> 02:23:50.010
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I would probably wrong way to say it,</v>

5467
02:23:50.011 --> 02:23:51.690
<v Speaker 3>but I have three stages,</v>

5468
02:23:51.691 --> 02:23:52.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5469
02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I write with a computer,</v>

5470
02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:55.980
<v Speaker 3>but then I write things down on paper.</v>

5471
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:57.690
<v Speaker 3>Like if I have to like do a set,</v>

5472
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:59.610
<v Speaker 3>I write a set list out with paper.</v>

5473
02:23:59.730 --> 02:24:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm really interested in this new Samsung man.</v>

5474
02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:03.720
<v Speaker 3>The Samsung note eight.</v>

5475
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5476
02:24:03.961 --> 02:24:04.771
<v Speaker 3>because the note eight,</v>

5477
02:24:04.771 --> 02:24:06.240
<v Speaker 3>you write on the lock screen,</v>

5478
02:24:06.510 --> 02:24:08.250
<v Speaker 3>you don't even have to open up an application.</v>

5479
02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:08.910
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

5480
02:24:08.910 --> 02:24:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Right on the lock screen.</v>

5481
02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:11.640
<v Speaker 3>And you write it with a pen.</v>

5482
02:24:11.641 --> 02:24:15.120
<v Speaker 3>You could write like a hundred pages of notes just on the lock screen and you</v>

5483
02:24:15.121 --> 02:24:15.954
<v Speaker 3>could save him.</v>

5484
02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:17.033
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that yet?</v>

5485
02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:18.360
<v Speaker 3>What does an apple do?</v>

5486
02:24:18.361 --> 02:24:18.931
<v Speaker 3>That shit.</v>

5487
02:24:18.931 --> 02:24:19.764
<v Speaker 3>They'll jump on.</v>

5488
02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Samsung's got it,</v>

5489
02:24:21.211 --> 02:24:21.680
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5490
02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.750
<v Speaker 3>You apple gets sued left and right for patents.</v>

5492
02:24:26.431 --> 02:24:26.700

5542
02:25:46.061 --> 02:25:49.660

5543
02:25:50.050 --> 02:25:51.160
<v Speaker 3>It didn't exist.</v>

5544
02:25:51.370 --> 02:25:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't pull it up so I should I,</v>

5545
02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:54.041
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>

5546
02:25:54.041 --> 02:25:58.570
<v Speaker 3>I hit the home button and then I reopened the text messages back to the same</v>

5547
02:25:58.571 --> 02:25:58.960
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

5548
02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:03.700
<v Speaker 3>so I had to physically like swipe up and close out the text message program and</v>

5549
02:26:03.701 --> 02:26:08.050
<v Speaker 3>then start it up again just to get a dialogue where I could like press the keys</v>

5550
02:26:08.051 --> 02:26:08.450
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

5551
02:26:08.450 --> 02:26:09.520
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't let me press the keys.</v>

5552
02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:10.140
<v Speaker 3>It's apple.</v>

5553
02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:10.361
<v Speaker 3>Tony,</v>

5556
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.610
<v Speaker 3>The iPhone eight and I think,</v>

5557
02:26:14.890 --> 02:26:16.180
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm at the six still.</v>

5558
02:26:16.181 --> 02:26:17.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what this a dam.</v>

5559
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:19.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the three c Jamie,</v>

5560
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.751
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

5561
02:26:19.751 --> 02:26:23.590
<v Speaker 3>see if you could pull up a video on the Samsung Galaxy note eight.</v>

5562
02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:26.080
<v Speaker 3>This galaxy note eight has got me very,</v>

5563
02:26:26.081 --> 02:26:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm very curious,</v>

5564
02:26:27.430 --> 02:26:30.520
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of things that apple does that keeps you on the tit.</v>

5565
02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:32.440
<v Speaker 3>One of them is that airdrop,</v>

5566
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:34.270
<v Speaker 3>like if made it forever,</v>

5567
02:26:34.271 --> 02:26:35.120
<v Speaker 3>then once I went to it,</v>

5568
02:26:35.121 --> 02:26:35.954
<v Speaker 3>so easy man.</v>

5569
02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:36.780
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty easy.</v>

5570
02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:37.613
<v Speaker 3>So easy.</v>

5571
02:26:38.350 --> 02:26:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5572
02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:40.390
<v Speaker 3>everything's pretty good use that.</v>

5573
02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:41.710
<v Speaker 3>I use it all the time,</v>

5574
02:26:41.711 --> 02:26:43.690
<v Speaker 3>but say like if we made a video right here,</v>

5575
02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I would airdrop it to you.</v>

5576
02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:46.690
<v Speaker 3>She can't text it because the file is so big.</v>

5577
02:26:46.691 --> 02:26:51.280
<v Speaker 3>If you instead of it texting it just goes through Bluetooth because you're near</v>

5578
02:26:51.281 --> 02:26:52.840
<v Speaker 3>me and it sends it to you in full.</v>

5579
02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:53.890
<v Speaker 3>So this is it right here.</v>

5580
02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:55.720
<v Speaker 3>This is the galaxy note eight.</v>

5581
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:58.360
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking huge and it's all screen.</v>

5582
02:26:58.630 --> 02:27:01.540
<v Speaker 3>They have a little bit of room for like the speakers on it but the screen is</v>

5583
02:27:01.541 --> 02:27:02.350

02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:59.770
<v Speaker 3>you send them my messages.</v>

5624
02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:01.720
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't want to send you a text.</v>

5625
02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:02.500
<v Speaker 3>It wants,</v>

5626
02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:06.220
<v Speaker 3>it wants to continue to send imessages and it takes a long time to switch over.</v>

5627
02:28:06.221 --> 02:28:08.500
<v Speaker 3>I actually called up apple and I said,</v>

5628
02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:12.640
<v Speaker 3>I want you to remove me from the I message database.</v>

5629
02:28:12.670 --> 02:28:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Like remove my email from ims,</v>

5630
02:28:14.281 --> 02:28:14.561

<v Speaker 3>remove me.</v>

5632
02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:15.881
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

5633
02:28:15.881 --> 02:28:16.220
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

5634
02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:16.451
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

5635
02:28:16.451 --> 02:28:17.281
<v Speaker 3>because I've got a Google phone.</v>

5636
02:28:17.281 --> 02:28:17.501
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

5637
02:28:17.501 --> 02:28:18.191
<v Speaker 3>why did you do that?</v>

5638
02:28:18.191 --> 02:28:18.461
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

5640
02:28:21.610 --> 02:28:22.400

02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:25.850
<v Speaker 2>me from the a I message database and it still wouldn't work.</v>

5642
02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would work half the time.</v>

5643
02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:29.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a deal breaker for me.</v>

02:30:33.140 --> 02:30:33.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5729
02:30:33.501 --> 02:30:36.560
<v Speaker 2>just to see like what the messages because I don't have time.</v>

5730
02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:36.861
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5731
02:30:36.861 --> 02:30:37.131
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5732
02:30:37.131 --> 02:30:38.240
<v Speaker 2>we don't have time for everybody,</v>

5733
02:30:38.290 --> 02:30:39.130
<v Speaker 2>so fucked up.</v>

5734
02:30:39.270 --> 02:30:42.200
<v Speaker 2>The other day I got 39 text messages.</v>

5735
02:30:42.201 --> 02:30:44.720
<v Speaker 2>I counted up from a psycho or a bunch of people in the day,</v>

5736
02:30:44.810 --> 02:30:46.800
<v Speaker 2>39 I can't keep up with all the time.</v>

5737
02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:48.080
<v Speaker 2>39 different people.</v>

5738
02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Text messaged me,</v>

5739
02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:50.600
<v Speaker 2>what is my job?</v>

5740
02:30:50.601 --> 02:30:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Just replying texts that took us up.</v>

5741
02:30:52.301 --> 02:30:53.180
<v Speaker 2>That's my job.</v>

5742
02:30:53.390 --> 02:30:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Then I got to sit down and just,</v>

5743
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:56.150
<v Speaker 2>and then people go,</v>

5744
02:30:56.151 --> 02:30:56.301
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5745
02:30:56.301 --> 02:30:56.751
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

5746
02:30:56.751 --> 02:30:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Like those,</v>

5747
02:30:57.290 --> 02:30:58.280
<v Speaker 2>those don't get a reply.</v>

5748
02:30:58.850 --> 02:30:59.031
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5749
02:30:59.031 --> 02:30:59.510
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

5750
02:30:59.510 --> 02:31:00.021
<v Speaker 2>What's up?</v>

5751
02:31:00.021 --> 02:31:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Call me or my family or our aunt or,</v>

5752
02:31:03.920 --> 02:31:05.660
<v Speaker 2>or answer a non question.</v>

5753
02:31:06.220 --> 02:31:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll get back to that.</v>

5754
02:31:07.371 --> 02:31:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Like for me it's like right now I got to answer these and I'll try to catch up</v>

5755
02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:11.630
<v Speaker 2>to those.</v>

5756
02:31:11.630 --> 02:31:12.450
<v Speaker 2>You go to one,</v>

5757
02:31:12.450 --> 02:31:15.830
<v Speaker 2>you lock yourself away doing a podcast for three hours,</v>

5758
02:31:15.831 --> 02:31:17.000
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a million messages.</v>

5759
02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:17.920
<v Speaker 2>You don't have time to,</v>

5760
02:31:18.010 --> 02:31:19.100
<v Speaker 2>you got to get in your car.</v>

5761
02:31:19.230 --> 02:31:23.010
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the few times that I guarantee that I'm not going to communicate</v>

5762
02:31:23.011 --> 02:31:24.030
<v Speaker 2>with anybody any other way.</v>

5763
02:31:24.490 --> 02:31:26.490
<v Speaker 2>So one of the few times like doing a podcast,</v>

5764
02:31:26.590 --> 02:31:26.761
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

5765
02:31:26.761 --> 02:31:29.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the cool things about these kinds of conversations,</v>

5766
02:31:29.970 --> 02:31:32.310
<v Speaker 2>like this is the only way we have these conversations.</v>

5767
02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Like even if we eat dinner,</v>

5768
02:31:33.930 --> 02:31:35.460
<v Speaker 2>we don't have these kind of conversations.</v>

5769
02:31:35.710 --> 02:31:36.970
<v Speaker 2>You acted as distracted,</v>

5770
02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:38.310
<v Speaker 2>you checking your phone,</v>

5771
02:31:38.330 --> 02:31:39.030
<v Speaker 2>got to take.</v>

5772
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:40.170
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot of shit going on.</v>

5773
02:31:40.440 --> 02:31:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Like the art of conversation is lost a lot of people.</v>

5774
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:47.280
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways we practice it is by doing these podcasts.</v>

5775
02:31:47.281 --> 02:31:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5776
02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:50.790
<v Speaker 2>This is like a real hangout on your phones are off.</v>

5777
02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5778
02:31:51.540 --> 02:31:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Have you had anyone come in and try to keep on,</v>

5779
02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:54.211
<v Speaker 2>stay on their phone?</v>

5780
02:31:54.211 --> 02:31:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5781
02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:55.531
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck.</v>

5782
02:31:55.531 --> 02:31:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Russell Peters cannot leave his phone alone.</v>

5783
02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I can't be on the show that he cannot leave his phone alone.</v>

5784
02:32:00.350 --> 02:32:00.871
<v Speaker 2>Those like,</v>

5785
02:32:00.871 --> 02:32:01.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5786
02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:01.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5787
02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:03.001
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5788
02:32:03.001 --> 02:32:03.631

5793
02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:10.430
<v Speaker 2>We're right here.</v>

5794
02:32:10.430 --> 02:32:12.100
<v Speaker 2>The million people are listening a bit.</v>

5795
02:32:12.101 --> 02:32:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

5796
02:32:12.390 --> 02:32:12.841
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

5797
02:32:12.841 --> 02:32:13.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a bummer.</v>

5798
02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:14.273
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's got,</v>

5799
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:17.700
<v Speaker 2>everyone's got a phone and everyone's got a lot of work to do on the God damn</v>

5800
02:32:17.701 --> 02:32:18.120
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

5801
02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:20.940
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to be able to hang out with somebody and you're like,</v>

5802
02:32:20.941 --> 02:32:23.610
<v Speaker 2>let's just get on our phones together and we'll talk every now and then and I'll</v>

5803
02:32:23.611 --> 02:32:26.610
<v Speaker 2>show you a video and we're cool and we're not offending anybody.</v>

5804
02:32:26.910 --> 02:32:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's just on your phone.</v>

5805
02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:29.760
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

5806
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:30.623
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with that.</v>

5807
02:32:31.590 --> 02:32:31.980
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

5808
02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:32.521
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

5809
02:32:32.521 --> 02:32:33.354
<v Speaker 2>It's like we got,</v>

5810
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I want to hang out with you,</v>

5811
02:32:34.890 --> 02:32:37.680
<v Speaker 2>but I got to do business and we could talk when there's something to talk about</v>

5812
02:32:37.681 --> 02:32:38.071
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

5813
02:32:38.071 --> 02:32:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I got to handle some shit for sure.</v>

5814
02:32:39.721 --> 02:32:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Don't you notice from doing a lot of podcasts,</v>

5815
02:32:42.330 --> 02:32:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I would like if you have conversations with some people,</v>

5816
02:32:44.671 --> 02:32:46.650
<v Speaker 2>some people that are just not really listening to you,</v>

5817
02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:47.880
<v Speaker 2>not in podcasts,</v>

5818
02:32:47.881 --> 02:32:48.714
<v Speaker 2>but in the real world,</v>

5819
02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:50.640
<v Speaker 2>like you get good at this.</v>

5820
02:32:50.641 --> 02:32:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

5821
02:32:50.970 --> 02:32:51.990
<v Speaker 2>you do podcasts a lot,</v>

5822
02:32:51.991 --> 02:32:53.490
<v Speaker 2>so you're really good at having conversations.</v>

5823
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:56.490
<v Speaker 2>But when you go out in the real world and have conversations with people,</v>

5824
02:32:56.491 --> 02:32:58.290
<v Speaker 2>there's motherfuckers are just aren't listening.</v>

5825
02:32:58.530 --> 02:33:00.510
<v Speaker 2>They're just talking the tracking at you.</v>

5826
02:33:00.930 --> 02:33:02.580
<v Speaker 2>They're not even responding to what you're saying.</v>

5827
02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:05.310
<v Speaker 2>There's thinking about what they want to get done and their agenda.</v>

5828
02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:06.173
<v Speaker 2>They're in a different,</v>

5829
02:33:06.330 --> 02:33:07.590
<v Speaker 2>in a text,</v>

5830
02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:10.230
<v Speaker 2>they're like texting someone else and in some serious business and they're like,</v>

5831
02:33:10.350 --> 02:33:10.531
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5832
02:33:10.531 --> 02:33:10.710
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5833
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you're having a conversation with someone and they're not even like</v>

5834
02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:14.460
<v Speaker 2>tuned in to what you're saying.</v>

5835
02:33:14.610 --> 02:33:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that are just bad at talking.</v>

5836
02:33:16.531 --> 02:33:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5837
02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.790
<v Speaker 2>That communicators and those people are bad at podcast.</v>

5838
02:33:19.791 --> 02:33:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then I'll get one of those people on a podcast and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like that's another thing I'm finding it's how many fucking people are on speed.</v>

5870
02:33:54.450 --> 02:33:55.283
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

5871
02:33:56.380 --> 02:33:57.213
<v Speaker 2>Adderall,</v>

5872
02:33:57.610 --> 02:33:58.443
<v Speaker 2>Adderall.</v>

5873
02:33:58.550 --> 02:34:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not technically 100% crystal meth until Pharaoh is meth.</v>

5874
02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:04.360
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

5875
02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Like does the same thing.</v>

5876
02:34:05.431 --> 02:34:05.581
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5877
02:34:05.581 --> 02:34:06.570
<v Speaker 2>it does the same thing,</v>

5878
02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:08.220
<v Speaker 2>but when you're on Adderall you're like,</v>

5879
02:34:08.221 --> 02:34:08.941
<v Speaker 2>you've got a prescription.</v>

5880
02:34:08.941 --> 02:34:09.774
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel like you're,</v>

5881
02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:11.220
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel like you're a meth head.</v>

5882
02:34:11.220 --> 02:34:12.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between,</v>

5883
02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:12.840
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

5884
02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:13.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5885
02:34:13.201 --> 02:34:14.220
<v Speaker 2>This difference between the,</v>

5886
02:34:14.350 --> 02:34:16.950
<v Speaker 2>that are all still have their teeth for a,</v>

5887
02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:18.063
<v Speaker 2>not all of them</v>

5888
02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:21.340
<v Speaker 2>before we started the show,</v>

5889
02:34:21.341 --> 02:34:22.180
<v Speaker 2>this is the same guy.</v>

5890
02:34:22.181 --> 02:34:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Tommy caffeine is bad for you.</v>

5891
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:24.821
<v Speaker 2>You told me caffeine,</v>

5892
02:34:24.821 --> 02:34:25.181
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

5893
02:34:25.181 --> 02:34:25.750
<v Speaker 2>His coat.</v>

5894
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:26.583
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5895
02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:29.500
<v Speaker 2>caffeine is a cousin of coke.</v>

5896
02:34:29.970 --> 02:34:31.600
<v Speaker 2>While they're in the same caffeine.</v>

5897
02:34:31.630 --> 02:34:32.470
<v Speaker 2>They're in the same,</v>

5898
02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:33.540
<v Speaker 2>unless,</v>

5899
02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:35.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was mainstream information,</v>

5900
02:34:35.051 --> 02:34:36.110
<v Speaker 2>so maybe it a stimulant,</v>

5901
02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:38.253
<v Speaker 2>but it's real.</v>

5902
02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:39.093
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

5903
02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:40.540
<v Speaker 2>cause they used to put coke and Coke a cola,</v>

5904
02:34:40.541 --> 02:34:40.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5905
02:34:40.900 --> 02:34:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Then they go,</v>

5906
02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:44.560
<v Speaker 2>well they still use coca leaves to make the flavor of,</v>

5907
02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:45.820
<v Speaker 2>do you know that cocaine,</v>

5908
02:34:46.690 --> 02:34:51.040
<v Speaker 2>like the number one provider of medical cocaine is Coca Cola.</v>

5909
02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how this works?</v>

5910
02:34:52.570 --> 02:34:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Coca Cola [inaudible] coca leaves,</v>

5911
02:34:54.970 --> 02:34:57.460
<v Speaker 2>they have like cocoa leaves that you would get cocaine from.</v>

5912
02:34:57.610 --> 02:34:58.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the flavor.</v>

5913
02:34:58.451 --> 02:35:00.340
<v Speaker 2>It's secret to the flavor of Coca Cola.</v>

5914
02:35:00.370 --> 02:35:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Shit's delicious flavor soda.</v>

5915
02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:04.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just better than tap coca cola.</v>

5916
02:35:04.481 --> 02:35:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Forget.</v>

5917
02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:08.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just better than Pepsi in the can forget that.</v>

5918
02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:11.520
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter [inaudible] I love it.</v>

5919
02:35:11.521 --> 02:35:12.850
<v Speaker 2>He hit the Mexican sugar.</v>

5920
02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I love that shit.</v>

5921
02:35:15.370 --> 02:35:18.040
<v Speaker 2>But the way they make it is with cocoa leaves,</v>

5922
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:21.250
<v Speaker 2>they extract the cocaine from the cocoa leaves and the company that extracts the</v>

5923
02:35:21.251 --> 02:35:22.420
<v Speaker 2>cocaine from those cocoa leaves.</v>

5924
02:35:22.570 --> 02:35:27.040
<v Speaker 2>They sell it to like they use it as medical cocaine Escobar enterprises.</v>

5925
02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:28.180
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy,</v>

5926
02:35:28.181 --> 02:35:28.510
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5927
02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:29.130
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

5928
02:35:29.130 --> 02:35:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Let's say medical cocaine,</v>

5929
02:35:30.401 --> 02:35:31.181
<v Speaker 2>medical cocaine.</v>

5930
02:35:31.181 --> 02:35:31.511
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

5931
02:35:31.511 --> 02:35:32.650
<v Speaker 2>When are they going to legalize that?</v>

5932
02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5933
02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:33.773
<v Speaker 2>medicare,</v>

5934
02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:36.340
<v Speaker 2>they use for surgeries and shit.</v>

5935
02:35:36.410 --> 02:35:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Why do medical cocaine?</v>

5936
02:35:37.991 --> 02:35:40.060
<v Speaker 2>You can ignore things down numbs things like,</v>

5937
02:35:40.061 --> 02:35:41.530
<v Speaker 2>like locally without like,</v>

5938
02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:41.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5939
02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:44.440
<v Speaker 2>instead of like Novacane Novacane by the way,</v>

5940
02:35:44.441 --> 02:35:45.670
<v Speaker 2>related to cocaine,</v>

5941
02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Lidocaine,</v>

5942
02:35:47.530 --> 02:35:47.531
<v Speaker 2>Lidocaine.</v>

5943
02:35:47.531 --> 02:35:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I had that shit when I had my nose fixed.</v>

5944
02:35:49.630 --> 02:35:50.650
<v Speaker 2>They put the Lidacain in.</v>

5945
02:35:50.650 --> 02:35:53.800
<v Speaker 2>How many doctors are taking this medical cocaine and and,</v>

5946
02:35:53.801 --> 02:35:55.420
<v Speaker 2>and doing crazy things with it.</v>

5947
02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember Joel Wallach?</v>

5948
02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Dead doctors don't lie.</v>

5949
02:35:58.820 --> 02:35:59.830
<v Speaker 2>You turned me onto that.</v>

5950
02:36:00.100 --> 02:36:00.791
<v Speaker 2>You turned me on to that.</v>

5951
02:36:00.791 --> 02:36:01.900
<v Speaker 2>But it was a coke head.</v>

5952
02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:02.351
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5953
02:36:02.351 --> 02:36:04.090
<v Speaker 2>he was a doctor who was into minerals.</v>

5954
02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:05.740
<v Speaker 2>He's talking to you about how,</v>

5955
02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:10.000
<v Speaker 2>it's weird that people who are veterinarians know that if you have livestock,</v>

5956
02:36:10.210 --> 02:36:12.760
<v Speaker 2>you have to supplement the minerals and the livestock.</v>

5957
02:36:12.850 --> 02:36:15.700
<v Speaker 2>But people don't think about mineral deficiencies in food.</v>

5958
02:36:15.850 --> 02:36:18.190
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about people that have a regular diet,</v>

5959
02:36:18.370 --> 02:36:21.280
<v Speaker 2>especially when they don't have a vegetable rich diet there with,</v>

5960
02:36:21.281 --> 02:36:22.330
<v Speaker 2>with animals,</v>

5961
02:36:22.390 --> 02:36:23.320
<v Speaker 2>with livestock,</v>

5962
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:24.730
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a health insurance.</v>

5963
02:36:24.731 --> 02:36:25.540
<v Speaker 2>So you got to,</v>

5964
02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:26.081
<v Speaker 2>they know.</v>

5965
02:36:26.081 --> 02:36:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Farmers know.</v>

5966
02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5967
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:28.300
<v Speaker 2>give him these minerals.</v>

5968
02:36:28.450 --> 02:36:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise your livestock's going to be shit.</v>

5969
02:36:30.610 --> 02:36:32.080
<v Speaker 2>So there's no,</v>

5970
02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:33.580
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to humans,</v>

5971
02:36:33.581 --> 02:36:34.600
<v Speaker 2>we don't look at it the same way,</v>

5972
02:36:34.810 --> 02:36:37.570
<v Speaker 2>but you know a lot of people do.</v>

5973
02:36:37.570 --> 02:36:40.030
<v Speaker 2>They understand the importance of more minerals.</v>

5974
02:36:40.031 --> 02:36:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Now with Joel Wallach,</v>

5975
02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:43.750
<v Speaker 2>one of the things he was talking about and is how we put all our faith in</v>

5976
02:36:43.751 --> 02:36:45.400
<v Speaker 2>doctors when it comes to like health,</v>

5977
02:36:45.550 --> 02:36:49.960
<v Speaker 2>but how little education doctors actually have a nutrition and then how many</v>

5978
02:36:49.961 --> 02:36:51.550
<v Speaker 2>doctors are doing drugs?</v>

5979
02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:54.680
<v Speaker 2>How many doctors are like tons?</v>

5980
02:36:54.730 --> 02:36:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I know free pills.</v>

5981
02:36:56.530 --> 02:36:57.310
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>

5982
02:36:57.310 --> 02:36:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Access to all that.</v>

5983
02:36:58.631 --> 02:36:59.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't think shit.</v>

5984
02:37:00.170 --> 02:37:00.701
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

5985
02:37:00.701 --> 02:37:01.211
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>

5986
02:37:01.211 --> 02:37:02.044
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

5987
02:37:02.730 --> 02:37:03.790
<v Speaker 2>The ones that you've heard of,</v>

5988
02:37:03.850 --> 02:37:06.040
<v Speaker 2>the ledger ones that I've heard of them hung out with.</v>

5992
02:37:09.130 --> 02:37:10.240
<v Speaker 2>They make a lot of money.</v>

02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:25.423
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

02:39:25.580 --> 02:39:27.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like steroids for writing Gat.</v>

6105
02:39:27.381 --> 02:39:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6106
02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:28.670
<v Speaker 3>PD for writing.</v>

6107
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:29.720
<v Speaker 3>So let me ask you this.</v>

6108
02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:31.340
<v Speaker 3>If you had to guess,</v>

6109
02:39:31.430 --> 02:39:34.880
<v Speaker 3>what's the number of prescriptions every year for Adderall in the United States?</v>

6110
02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Let's guess we'll say that again.</v>

6111
02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:39.890
<v Speaker 3>The number of prescriptions every year for Adderall in the United States has to</v>

6112
02:39:39.891 --> 02:39:41.870
<v Speaker 3>know me to say 5 million.</v>

6113
02:39:42.980 --> 02:39:44.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm going with 30 million.</v>

6114
02:39:44.340 --> 02:39:46.700
<v Speaker 3>30 I was going to 20 to 30 million.</v>

6115
02:39:46.750 --> 02:39:47.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6116
02:39:47.870 --> 02:39:50.210
<v Speaker 3>How many right now,</v>

6117
02:39:50.270 --> 02:39:51.360
<v Speaker 3>how many people are on Adderall?</v>

6118
02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:52.790
<v Speaker 3>See they don't do it that way.</v>

6119
02:39:52.791 --> 02:39:52.901
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

6120
02:39:52.901 --> 02:39:54.620
<v Speaker 3>they write prescriptions written.</v>

6121
02:39:54.770 --> 02:39:57.140
<v Speaker 3>So like say if you see three months worth,</v>

6122
02:39:57.560 --> 02:39:59.960
<v Speaker 3>you might use it four times in a year.</v>

6123
02:39:59.961 --> 02:40:01.040
<v Speaker 3>So you would be for,</v>

6124

02:45:14.021 --> 02:45:17.230
<v Speaker 3>See that's the problem that to that it's never been clearly defined to me.</v>

6306
02:45:17.231 --> 02:45:19.960
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to a bunch of psychologists and psychiatrist about it.</v>

6312
02:45:26.051 --> 02:45:28.600
<v Speaker 3>But you could just say you have those.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you could complain about all sorts of things that are on the list.</v>

6340

<v Speaker 3>That's interesting because maybe</v>

6341
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Tim crater could have been granted it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it was public.</v>

6343
02:46:14.511 --> 02:46:16.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying anything that people don't know about.</v>

6348
02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:28.940

6349
02:46:28.941 --> 02:46:30.280

6364
02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Fitzsimmons is on it.</v>

6365
02:46:47.930 --> 02:46:48.621
<v Speaker 2>Brian didn't want,</v>

6366

02:46:50.421 --> 02:46:52.280
<v Speaker 2>he's on Ritalin for Tim is on Ritalin.</v>

6369
02:46:52.310 --> 02:46:53.000
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

6370
02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:53.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6371
02:46:53.370 --> 02:46:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Speed.</v>

6372
02:46:53.930 --> 02:46:54.420
<v Speaker 2>It's speed.</v>

6373
02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:56.930
<v Speaker 2>He does a podcast the other day and his knee was like,</v>

6374
02:46:57.020 --> 02:46:59.900
<v Speaker 2>he does like does a lot of like movement.</v>

6375
02:47:00.050 --> 02:47:01.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like constantly moving a lot.</v>

6376
02:47:01.791 --> 02:47:04.310
<v Speaker 2>And someone asked him on Twitter like what's that about?</v>

6377
02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:09.560
<v Speaker 2>And he's like Ritalin where he just wanted to talk to Beth and first pot.</v>

6378
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.981
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6379
02:47:09.981 --> 02:47:10.161
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6380
02:47:10.161 --> 02:47:10.341
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

6381
02:47:10.341 --> 02:47:13.100
<v Speaker 2>He's been on it cause he is legitimately,</v>

6382
02:47:13.101 --> 02:47:14.450
<v Speaker 2>he has legitimate add,</v>

6383
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:16.640
<v Speaker 2>which whatever the fuck that was going to say,</v>

6384
02:47:16.641 --> 02:47:18.740
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what led them to add means.</v>

6385
02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6386
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:20.503
<v Speaker 2>let's</v>

6387
02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:22.071
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

6388
02:47:22.071 --> 02:47:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's define it.</v>

6389
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Like let's try to see if someone has a definition.</v>

6390
02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:26.030
<v Speaker 2>What is legitimate?</v>

6391
02:47:26.330 --> 02:47:27.250
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is?</v>

6392
02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:28.370
<v Speaker 2>What do you guys think of this?</v>

6393
02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so who can't focus on fucking anything and they're distracted by</v>

6394
02:47:31.491 --> 02:47:32.001
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

6395
02:47:32.001 --> 02:47:32.801
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also like,</v>

6396
02:47:32.801 --> 02:47:33.021
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6397
02:47:33.021 --> 02:47:33.890
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely that.</v>

6398
02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.180
<v Speaker 2>It's also patterns and the patterns of behavior that you develop in your life.</v>

6399
02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:40.790
<v Speaker 2>But this also probably people that have a legitimate disease.</v>

6400
02:47:40.820 --> 02:47:42.860
<v Speaker 2>They were sitting legitimately something wrong with their brain.</v>

6401
02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:46.610
<v Speaker 2>The question is how many people legitimately have something wrong versus how</v>

6402
02:47:46.611 --> 02:47:48.960
<v Speaker 2>many people are just abusing it cause he's just assholes.</v>

6403
02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:50.390
<v Speaker 2>They just want to you speed,</v>

6404
02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:51.260
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

6405
02:47:51.260 --> 02:47:52.760
<v Speaker 2>get all that energy and get fired up.</v>

6406
02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible,</v>

6407
02:47:54.861 --> 02:47:59.861
<v Speaker 2>is there any chance maybe in some cases add or some kind of brain dysfunction is</v>

6408
02:48:03.051 --> 02:48:04.910
<v Speaker 2>caused by the vaccines?</v>

6409
02:48:04.911 --> 02:48:05.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe?</v>

6410
02:48:05.270 --> 02:48:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Is there a possibility that it's a vaccine?</v>

6411
02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:08.350
<v Speaker 2>No dairy?</v>

6412
02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:09.080
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

6413
02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6414
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:11.120
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely side effects.</v>

6415
02:48:11.121 --> 02:48:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Almost every medication that you take for certain people.</v>

6416
02:48:15.860 --> 02:48:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</v>

02:48:51.261 --> 02:48:53.210
<v Speaker 2>that's basically every kid you've ever met.</v>

6442
02:48:53.810 --> 02:48:53.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6443
02:48:53.991 --> 02:48:54.824
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem.</v>

6444
02:48:55.220 --> 02:48:56.150
<v Speaker 2>You get kids,</v>

6445
02:48:56.210 --> 02:48:59.510
<v Speaker 2>kids are filled with energy and they want to play and they want to have fun.</v>

6446
02:48:59.511 --> 02:49:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Then when you want to be stimulated and then you make them sit in your shit,</v>

6447
02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:03.690
<v Speaker 2>talk you,</v>

6448
02:49:03.690 --> 02:49:05.630
<v Speaker 2>they sit in an uncomfortable bullshit,</v>

6449
02:49:05.631 --> 02:49:06.590
<v Speaker 2>plastic chair.</v>

6450
02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

6451
02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:11.630
<v Speaker 2>some monotone asshole who's teaching them nonsense going wrong.</v>

6452
02:49:11.690 --> 02:49:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

6453
02:49:11.940 --> 02:49:14.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not the kids issue part of it,</v>

6454
02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:17.340
<v Speaker 2>but parents want to give it to their kids because they just want the kids to pay</v>

6455
02:49:17.341 --> 02:49:18.174
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

6456
02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:18.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6457
02:49:18.751 --> 02:49:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I had a neighbor who got their kid on Ritalin and there was nothing wrong with</v>

6458
02:49:21.811 --> 02:49:24.120
<v Speaker 2>this kid and he got the kid on Ritalin and was just like this,</v>

6459
02:49:24.121 --> 02:49:25.350
<v Speaker 2>all the stupid pants.</v>

6460
02:49:25.650 --> 02:49:26.483
<v Speaker 2>He's just like,</v>

6461
02:49:26.730 --> 02:49:27.070
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

6462
02:49:27.070 --> 02:49:27.903
<v Speaker 2>focus the spot.</v>

6463
02:49:28.210 --> 02:49:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

6464
02:49:28.430 --> 02:49:29.550
<v Speaker 2>focus focuses father.</v>

6465
02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:32.160
<v Speaker 2>He just listened by killing video games too.</v>

6466
02:49:32.370 --> 02:49:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Probably get them in front of Matt and Hell Yeah.</v>

6467
02:49:34.860 --> 02:49:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Can just kind of plays on bitches.</v>

6468
02:49:36.690 --> 02:49:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6469
02:49:37.170 --> 02:49:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6470
02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Probably had a lot of friends though.</v>

6471
02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:39.001
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6472
02:49:39.001 --> 02:49:41.250
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely dangerous how many people are medicated,</v>

6473
02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:44.910
<v Speaker 2>but the real question is like how many people actually could use the medication</v>

6474
02:49:44.911 --> 02:49:48.090
<v Speaker 2>versus how many people are medicated because doctors are like to meet someone</v>

6475
02:49:48.091 --> 02:49:49.950
<v Speaker 2>really w who has that problem,</v>

6476
02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:52.050
<v Speaker 2>who really has add and figure it out.</v>

6477
02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I bet some of them kids were seriously abused as kids and they just come out</v>

6478
02:49:56.170 --> 02:49:56.491
<v Speaker 2>just in,</v>

6479
02:49:56.491 --> 02:49:57.324
<v Speaker 2>they're all just fucked,</v>

6480
02:49:57.480 --> 02:49:58.313
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>

6481
02:49:59.490 --> 02:50:00.690
<v Speaker 2>That's definitely a possibility.</v>

6482
02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Not of abuse going on.</v>

6483
02:50:02.250 --> 02:50:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6484
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:04.350
<v Speaker 2>there's also like emotional abuse.</v>

6485
02:50:04.351 --> 02:50:05.580
<v Speaker 2>People just yell at their kids,</v>

6486
02:50:05.581 --> 02:50:06.361
<v Speaker 2>beat their kids.</v>

6487
02:50:06.361 --> 02:50:08.400
<v Speaker 2>There's kids that people get ignored.</v>

6488
02:50:08.730 --> 02:50:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Kids don't have friends who grow up with parents that are just assholes and</v>

6489
02:50:12.181 --> 02:50:12.600
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>

6490
02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:13.650
<v Speaker 2>they saw life is like,</v>

6491
02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:15.450
<v Speaker 2>they're constantly walking on eggshells.</v>

6492
02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:18.300
<v Speaker 2>They're all fucked up psychologically because of its bomber man.</v>

6493
02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6494
02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:20.051
<v Speaker 2>it's a bummer dude.</v>

6495
02:50:20.051 --> 02:50:20.610
<v Speaker 2>You here,</v>

6496
02:50:20.610 --> 02:50:23.940
<v Speaker 2>I can't read horrible stories but I've read some story about some guy in Texas</v>

6497
02:50:23.941 --> 02:50:24.940
<v Speaker 2>that he's,</v>

6498
02:50:25.030 --> 02:50:27.210
<v Speaker 2>his three year old daughter wouldn't drink her milk.</v>

6499
02:50:27.211 --> 02:50:30.830
<v Speaker 2>So he made her stand outside by the tree and she disappeared brother.</v>

6500
02:50:30.910 --> 02:50:34.330
<v Speaker 2>He went back out 15 minutes and she was gone and the police went looking for,</v>

6501
02:50:34.350 --> 02:50:35.250
<v Speaker 2>they can't find her.</v>

6502
02:50:35.251 --> 02:50:35.970
<v Speaker 2>She disappears.</v>

6503
02:50:35.970 --> 02:50:37.410
<v Speaker 2>You hear in the interview what he said.</v>

6504
02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:37.880
<v Speaker 2>What'd he say?</v>

6505
02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I put her out there and they do think happening.</v>

6521
02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:15.653
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

6522
02:51:17.190 --> 02:51:20.640
<v Speaker 2>almost like definitely that kid getting violent guy with that guy.</v>

6523
02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I would fuck up for free.</v>

6526
02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:27.150
<v Speaker 2>That guy should be toward the fact that he could do that to a baby,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's no update on that.</v>

6535
02:51:37.741 --> 02:51:38.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6536
02:51:38.070 --> 02:51:38.910
<v Speaker 2>they never found her.</v>

6537
02:51:39.030 --> 02:51:42.330
<v Speaker 2>She probably got eight and they got deserves the coyotes.</v>

6538
02:51:42.390 --> 02:51:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

6539
02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:44.471
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

6540
02:51:44.471 --> 02:51:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I probably killed her.</v>

6541
02:51:45.540 --> 02:51:48.120
<v Speaker 2>I need you that he made that story up and you might be right.</v>

6542
02:51:48.121 --> 02:51:48.960
<v Speaker 2>You might be right at,</v>

6543
02:51:48.961 --> 02:51:49.794
<v Speaker 2>he might be right.</v>

6544
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Might have like,</v>

6545
02:51:51.451 --> 02:51:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I deserved the death bell.</v>

6546
02:51:52.381 --> 02:51:55.110
<v Speaker 2>And there's the proof that a story that sounds like a,</v>

6547
02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I called him something.</v>

6548
02:51:55.990 --> 02:51:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Did it either way.</v>

6549
02:51:57.170 --> 02:51:58.290
<v Speaker 2>If he just left her outside,</v>

6550
02:51:58.291 --> 02:51:59.460
<v Speaker 2>if he knew this coyotes around,</v>

6551
02:51:59.461 --> 02:52:00.960
<v Speaker 2>he's asking his kid to get anything back.</v>

6552
02:52:01.500 --> 02:52:04.680
<v Speaker 2>He might've wanted the kid to get eaten by a code because he's a bad person.</v>

6553
02:52:04.681 --> 02:52:06.440
<v Speaker 2>He's a piece of shit and he's,</v>

6554
02:52:06.460 --> 02:52:07.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6555
02:52:07.090 --> 02:52:08.890
<v Speaker 2>raising a kid tests you.</v>

6556
02:52:09.070 --> 02:52:09.903
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

6557
02:52:09.940 --> 02:52:10.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6575
02:52:32.770 --> 02:52:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Like the once a guide does that to his daughter,</v>

02:52:39.791 --> 02:52:40.830
<v Speaker 2>His friends too.</v>

6582
02:52:40.870 --> 02:52:41.471
<v Speaker 2>And if you'd like,</v>

6583
02:52:41.471 --> 02:52:42.360
<v Speaker 2>how was your night last night?</v>

6584
02:52:42.361 --> 02:52:43.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh my fucking kid.</v>

6585
02:52:43.181 --> 02:52:44.110
<v Speaker 2>One finches bottle.</v>

6586
02:52:44.111 --> 02:52:45.100
<v Speaker 2>So I left her outside.</v>

6587
02:52:46.170 --> 02:52:48.730
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck do you hang out with?</v>

6588
02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Who else are you hanging out with?</v>

6589
02:52:50.111 --> 02:52:52.300
<v Speaker 2>We can talk like that and everyone thinks it's all good.</v>

6590
02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:58.540
<v Speaker 2>You know the thing is like you can't forgive someone for that and you have to</v>

6591
02:52:58.541 --> 02:52:59.374
<v Speaker 2>kill them.</v>

6592
02:52:59.680 --> 02:52:59.921
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

6593
02:52:59.921 --> 02:53:02.470
<v Speaker 2>How do you forgive someone for doing that to a baby?</v>

6594
02:53:02.680 --> 02:53:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone beats a baby to death,</v>

6595
02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:06.633
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

6596
02:53:06.970 --> 02:53:08.290
<v Speaker 2>there's no returning from that.</v>

6597
02:53:08.410 --> 02:53:09.191
<v Speaker 2>Get a torture.</v>

6598
02:53:09.191 --> 02:53:09.911
<v Speaker 2>But then people go,</v>

6599
02:53:09.911 --> 02:53:10.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a mental illness.</v>

6600
02:53:11.230 --> 02:53:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Publicly torture him publicly.</v>

6601
02:53:13.390 --> 02:53:13.841
<v Speaker 2>But does that,</v>

6602
02:53:13.841 --> 02:53:14.880
<v Speaker 2>is that really good?</v>

6603
02:53:14.881 --> 02:53:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Is that fix anything?</v>

6604
02:53:16.570 --> 02:53:17.403
<v Speaker 2>Does it like,</v>

6605
02:53:17.640 --> 02:53:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

6606
02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.760
<v Speaker 2>It'll scare people.</v>

6607
02:53:18.760 --> 02:53:20.260
<v Speaker 2>There's the bigger picture and people go,</v>

6608
02:53:20.261 --> 02:53:22.000
<v Speaker 2>it listened to mental illness issue,</v>

6609
02:53:22.001 --> 02:53:23.350
<v Speaker 2>so we need to fix them.</v>

6610
02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:24.213
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

6611
02:53:24.220 --> 02:53:24.431
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6612
02:53:24.431 --> 02:53:28.210
<v Speaker 2>the mental illness issue is a weird one because I saw something about huffpost</v>

6613
02:53:28.230 --> 02:53:32.470
<v Speaker 2>had some thing about pedophiles and they eventually took it down I think,</v>

6614
02:53:32.740 --> 02:53:33.580
<v Speaker 2>but this guy was saying,</v>

6615
02:53:33.581 --> 02:53:34.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a monster,</v>

6616
02:53:34.511 --> 02:53:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pedophile.</v>

6617
02:53:35.890 --> 02:53:37.750
<v Speaker 2>And he's basically saying that he has these thoughts.</v>

6618
02:53:37.751 --> 02:53:38.770
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't act on them.</v>

6619
02:53:38.771 --> 02:53:39.491
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was like,</v>

6620
02:53:39.491 --> 02:53:39.940
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

6621
02:53:39.940 --> 02:53:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck.</v>

6622
02:53:41.170 --> 02:53:42.250
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you?</v>

6623
02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:43.510
<v Speaker 2>What did they say that for?</v>

6624
02:53:43.511 --> 02:53:43.721
<v Speaker 2>Everything,</v>

6625
02:53:43.721 --> 02:53:43.901
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

6626
02:53:43.901 --> 02:53:44.591
<v Speaker 2>For if you,</v>

6627
02:53:44.591 --> 02:53:45.940
<v Speaker 2>if you rape kids,</v>

6628
02:53:45.941 --> 02:53:47.170
<v Speaker 2>if you're a child molester,</v>

6629
02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:48.290
<v Speaker 2>if you're uh,</v>

6630
02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:48.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6631
02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:49.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6632
02:53:49.001 --> 02:53:50.080
<v Speaker 2>if you shoot people,</v>

6633
02:53:50.110 --> 02:53:51.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a mental illness.</v>

6634
02:53:51.070 --> 02:53:53.350
<v Speaker 2>That molesters are running this planet,</v>

6635
02:53:53.410 --> 02:53:56.080
<v Speaker 2>that those are the one that you opened the door fucked up.</v>

6636
02:53:56.170 --> 02:53:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Those are the real key here.</v>

6637
02:53:57.131 --> 02:53:59.320
<v Speaker 2>The Donald Trump's gonna open up the JFK dump.</v>

6638
02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:00.393
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

6639
02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:04.540
<v Speaker 2>All the dump of documents from the JFK that had been sealed up by all the other</v>

6640
02:54:04.541 --> 02:54:07.930
<v Speaker 2>presidents like the JFK assassination investigation,</v>

6641
02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:12.370
<v Speaker 2>they sealed some documents up because they're too sensitive and like whatever</v>

6642
02:54:12.371 --> 02:54:13.204
<v Speaker 2>those documents,</v>

6643
02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:14.920
<v Speaker 2>they shred those documents.</v>

6644
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:15.730
<v Speaker 2>How can now,</v>

6645
02:54:15.730 --> 02:54:20.290
<v Speaker 2>why would damning documents B exists?</v>

6646
02:54:20.320 --> 02:54:24.920
<v Speaker 2>These are people from 1962 also Trump for sure folks on something else and this,</v>

6647
02:54:25.170 --> 02:54:25.361
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

6648
02:54:25.361 --> 02:54:27.160
<v Speaker 2>this is not a bad thing to focus on.</v>

6649
02:54:27.550 --> 02:54:30.280
<v Speaker 2>If he show me are the things we know for sure,</v>

6650
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:31.540
<v Speaker 2>but first of all,</v>

6651
02:54:31.690 --> 02:54:33.160
<v Speaker 2>no one really can be president.</v>

6652
02:54:33.161 --> 02:54:33.791
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest,</v>

6653
02:54:33.791 --> 02:54:37.030
<v Speaker 2>there's not a single person that could focus on the economy and healthcare and</v>

6654
02:54:37.031 --> 02:54:41.150
<v Speaker 2>international relations and the environment and like there's no way to do with</v>

6655
02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:42.040
<v Speaker 2>the word job though.</v>

6656
02:54:42.060 --> 02:54:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6657
02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:42.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6658
02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:42.971
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

6659
02:54:42.971 --> 02:54:44.910
<v Speaker 2>But there's not enough time in the world the focus on any of those.</v>

6660
02:54:45.090 --> 02:54:49.300
<v Speaker 2>The Sony should focus on Donald Trump should focus on the Vegas shooting that he</v>

6661
02:54:49.301 --> 02:54:50.260
<v Speaker 2>hasn't said Shit about it.</v>

6662
02:54:51.220 --> 02:54:52.060
<v Speaker 2>That's how we're ending it.</v>

6663
02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:52.953
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6664
02:54:52.990 --> 02:54:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6665
02:54:53.500 --> 02:54:54.640
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

6666
02:54:54.641 --> 02:54:55.840
<v Speaker 2>There was some shady shit going on,</v>

6667
02:54:56.080 --> 02:54:57.220
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing about this,</v>

6668
02:54:57.221 --> 02:54:58.960
<v Speaker 2>this Kennedy assassination,</v>

6669
02:54:59.110 --> 02:55:00.730
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why if I was him,</v>

6670
02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I would focus on the Kennedy assassination as they might fucking kill him.</v>

6671
02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Like it's entirely possible that he's thinking that he could get assassinated</v>

6672
02:55:08.180 --> 02:55:09.890
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent of herself.</v>

6673
02:55:10.650 --> 02:55:14.270
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's opening it would if I wouldn't think there was any files,</v>

6674
02:55:14.271 --> 02:55:14.781
<v Speaker 2>like why would they,</v>

6675
02:55:14.781 --> 02:55:15.650
<v Speaker 2>are those files exist?</v>

6676
02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:17.600
<v Speaker 2>They should have been burned a long time ago.</v>

6677
02:55:17.730 --> 02:55:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6678
02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:18.650
<v Speaker 2>you would think so.</v>

6679
02:55:18.650 --> 02:55:20.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no files and also is it,</v>

6680
02:55:21.660 --> 02:55:24.020
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have the highest security of all time.</v>

6681
02:55:24.020 --> 02:55:24.361
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

6682
02:55:24.361 --> 02:55:27.350
<v Speaker 2>they pay the most to protect amount of all time because there's such a threat</v>

6683
02:55:27.351 --> 02:55:28.184
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

6684
02:55:28.670 --> 02:55:28.821
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6685
02:55:28.821 --> 02:55:31.910
<v Speaker 2>he has crazy security doors on his limo.</v>

6686
02:55:32.090 --> 02:55:33.560
<v Speaker 2>They had a video of him.</v>

6687
02:55:33.710 --> 02:55:34.543
<v Speaker 2>I was a,</v>

6688
02:55:35.590 --> 02:55:35.870
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

6689
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't stop coughing in there.</v>

6690
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:38.141
<v Speaker 2>I was going,</v>

6691
02:55:38.141 --> 02:55:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at this image of,</v>

6692
02:55:40.351 --> 02:55:40.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6693
02:55:40.610 --> 02:55:41.443
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

6694
02:55:41.490 --> 02:55:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6695
02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:43.610
<v Speaker 2>there was a video of him getting out of the limo and I was like,</v>

6696
02:55:43.611 --> 02:55:45.020
<v Speaker 2>look at that door on that fucking limo.</v>

6697
02:55:45.021 --> 02:55:46.880
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to some images of the limo.</v>

6698
02:55:47.060 --> 02:55:49.160
<v Speaker 2>The Limo door is like that thick.</v>

6699
02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Is it different than Obama's though?</v>

6700
02:55:51.340 --> 02:55:53.510
<v Speaker 2>That the standard one I Cadillac makes.</v>

6701
02:55:53.540 --> 02:55:54.530
<v Speaker 2>I never looked at the other one,</v>

6702
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:55.610
<v Speaker 2>but I mean the,</v>

6703
02:55:55.610 --> 02:55:55.831
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6704
02:55:55.831 --> 02:55:57.980
<v Speaker 2>the doors are fucking ridiculous.</v>

6705
02:55:57.981 --> 02:55:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Bombproof yeah,</v>

6706
02:55:59.510 --> 02:56:00.200
<v Speaker 2>they're sick.</v>

6707
02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:01.970
<v Speaker 2>That would be the dopest car to drive around.</v>

6708
02:56:01.971 --> 02:56:02.481
<v Speaker 2>And you'd be like,</v>

6715
02:56:13.220 --> 02:56:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6716
02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:15.860
<v Speaker 2>They make a car that you can buy.</v>

6717
02:56:16.370 --> 02:56:18.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called Dev Rolo,</v>

6718
02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:21.310
<v Speaker 2>D v R O l o.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a Toyota Tundra.</v>

6721
02:56:25.550 --> 02:56:27.740
<v Speaker 2>But they make that motherfucker bulletproof.</v>

6722
02:56:27.770 --> 02:56:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I used to work for a company that used to bulletproof vehicles for two weeks.</v>

6723
02:56:31.341 --> 02:56:31.811

03:00:46.410 --> 03:00:47.011
<v Speaker 2>Well they did.</v>

6876
03:00:47.011 --> 03:00:49.020
<v Speaker 2>The old ones did when they had that,</v>

6877
03:00:49.021 --> 03:00:51.450
<v Speaker 2>a hurricane that hit the east coast couple of years back,</v>

6878
03:00:51.660 --> 03:00:56.660
<v Speaker 2>they had all these bitches parked near some water and the tide came in and they</v>

6879
03:00:57.481 --> 03:00:58.314
<v Speaker 2>all blew up</v>

6880
03:00:59.770 --> 03:01:00.810
<v Speaker 2>when they went under water.</v>

6881
03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:01.960
<v Speaker 2>They just started exploding.</v>

6882
03:01:02.180 --> 03:01:03.013
<v Speaker 2>Can get for cheap.</v>

6883
03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:03.851

6905
03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:29.073
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

6906
03:01:29.730 --> 03:01:30.910
<v Speaker 2>That car's gonna blow up.</v>

6907
03:01:30.940 --> 03:01:32.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a sweet ride though.</v>

6911
03:01:35.260 --> 03:01:35.951
<v Speaker 2>Those are the fee.</v>

6915
03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:41.433
<v Speaker 2>the chrome one.</v>

6916
03:01:41.530 --> 03:01:44.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the future is electric cars.</v>

6917
03:01:44.831 --> 03:01:46.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just they're not quite ready for prime time.</v>

6918
03:01:46.610 --> 03:01:47.443
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6919
03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:48.221
<v Speaker 2>I just can't get it.</v>

6920
03:01:48.221 --> 03:01:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I know for the environment I get it.</v>

6921
03:01:49.721 --> 03:01:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I liked that aspect.</v>

6922
03:01:50.651 --> 03:01:51.790
<v Speaker 2>I just can't get into it.</v>

6923
03:01:51.791 --> 03:01:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

6924
03:01:52.210 --> 03:01:53.130
<v Speaker 2>I can do a test on that.</v>

6925
03:01:53.131 --> 03:01:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Got bums me out there better for the air.</v>

6926
03:01:55.810 --> 03:01:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

6927
03:01:56.110 --> 03:01:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

6928
03:01:56.920 --> 03:02:00.670
<v Speaker 2>But environmentally there's a lot of concerns with those things like how they</v>

6929
03:02:00.671 --> 03:02:01.330
<v Speaker 2>extract them,</v>

6930
03:02:01.330 --> 03:02:05.590
<v Speaker 2>the minerals that they use to make them the batteries and the lithium.</v>

6931
03:02:06.010 --> 03:02:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Lithium comes from a a lot of like the comp conflict minerals that comes from a</v>

6932
03:02:10.751 --> 03:02:14.530
<v Speaker 2>lot of like really poor areas or people are forced to mind these things.</v>

6933
03:02:14.531 --> 03:02:15.940
<v Speaker 2>They have no other way to make money.</v>

6934
03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:20.470
<v Speaker 2>There had been a bunch of articles read all shits made pretty much cell phones</v>

6935
03:02:20.471 --> 03:02:21.330
<v Speaker 2>say that about everything.</v>

6936
03:02:21.380 --> 03:02:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing is is cell phones like cell phones,</v>

6937
03:02:23.710 --> 03:02:26.090
<v Speaker 2>like cold Chan that they use to make sense?</v>

6938
03:02:26.110 --> 03:02:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Is that how you call it?</v>

6939
03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Cold Tan?</v>

6940
03:02:27.550 --> 03:02:31.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called Cold Tan is a mineral that they use to make cell phones and</v>

6941
03:02:31.571 --> 03:02:34.660
<v Speaker 2>for the longest time at least it was like a lot of it was being made in the</v>

6942
03:02:34.661 --> 03:02:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Congo and these people were essentially almost slaves like minus stuff.</v>

6943
03:02:39.461 --> 03:02:40.480
<v Speaker 2>These little children,</v>

6944
03:02:40.481 --> 03:02:42.870
<v Speaker 2>these child workers to mine this stuff.</v>

6945
03:02:42.970 --> 03:02:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Their stuff though Colton,</v>

6946
03:02:44.890 --> 03:02:46.540
<v Speaker 2>conflict minerals in the Congo,</v>

6947
03:02:46.541 --> 03:02:49.360
<v Speaker 2>there's documentary has been done on this.</v>

6948
03:02:49.361 --> 03:02:50.194
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>

6949
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:51.670
<v Speaker 2>So in the Congo,</v>

6950
03:02:51.671 --> 03:02:52.471
<v Speaker 2>this is one place.</v>

6951
03:02:52.471 --> 03:02:55.390
<v Speaker 2>It's particularly rich with Colton and these poor,</v>

6952
03:02:55.540 --> 03:02:55.991
<v Speaker 2>poor,</v>

6953
03:02:55.991 --> 03:02:56.801
<v Speaker 2>poor people.</v>

6954
03:02:56.801 --> 03:03:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Like a level of poor that you and I just will never understand and we need that</v>

6955
03:03:00.461 --> 03:03:01.061
<v Speaker 2>for our phones.</v>

6956
03:03:01.061 --> 03:03:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

6957
03:03:01.630 --> 03:03:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

6958
03:03:01.990 --> 03:03:06.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a key ingredient in a cell phones and I think maybe laptops too,</v>

6959
03:03:07.390 --> 03:03:08.620
<v Speaker 2>but definitely cell phones.</v>

6960
03:03:09.710 --> 03:03:10.541
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up,</v>

6961
03:03:10.541 --> 03:03:11.374
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

6962
03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:12.281
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

6963
03:03:12.281 --> 03:03:12.730
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

6964
03:03:12.730 --> 03:03:13.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing,</v>

6965
03:03:13.691 --> 03:03:13.991
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6966
03:03:13.991 --> 03:03:14.950
<v Speaker 2>You got a phone,</v>

6967
03:03:14.980 --> 03:03:15.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6968
03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:18.280
<v Speaker 2>If you get a phone made by any of these major companies,</v>

6969
03:03:18.310 --> 03:03:23.310
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them get made in China jumping off the roof or are they just working?</v>

6970
03:03:23.770 --> 03:03:24.001
<v Speaker 2>What it,</v>

6971
03:03:24.001 --> 03:03:24.880
<v Speaker 2>what's going on right here?</v>

6972
03:03:25.380 --> 03:03:26.213
<v Speaker 2>They're getting paid.</v>

6973
03:03:26.260 --> 03:03:28.210
<v Speaker 2>They're getting paid very little money.</v>

6974
03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:29.680
<v Speaker 2>The thing is to us,</v>

6975
03:03:29.681 --> 03:03:33.220
<v Speaker 2>a compared to other people that have the standard pay out there,</v>

6976
03:03:33.221 --> 03:03:33.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6977
03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't.</v>

6978
03:03:35.300 --> 03:03:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're happy to have a job.</v>

6979
03:03:36.820 --> 03:03:38.320
<v Speaker 2>They're probably the handing of themselves.</v>

6980
03:03:38.321 --> 03:03:39.154
<v Speaker 2>Like in China.</v>

6981
