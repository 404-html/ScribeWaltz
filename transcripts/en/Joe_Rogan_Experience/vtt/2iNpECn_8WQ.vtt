<v Speaker 1>Thanks for being here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.113
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been paying attention to your </v>

5
00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>work for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a no,</v>

6
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.870
<v Speaker 1>you're the one who bakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7
00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've got a lot but a bunch of</v>

8
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>your books here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for bringing those in.</v>

9
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have some stuff to read.</v>

10
00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you get involved in skepticism?</v>

11
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>I know you started off as a cyclist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.601
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

13
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Well I was a,</v>

14
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.673
<v Speaker 2>a bike racer from 1980 to about 1990,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 10 years in between when I was </v>

15
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.973
<v Speaker 2>first in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to pepperdine and then cal state </v>

16
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 2>fullerton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then uh,</v>

17
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.490
<v Speaker 2>I just was burned out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a master's degree and uh,</v>

18
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I just decided I didn't want to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>another six straight years of phd work.</v>

19
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:48.504
<v Speaker 2>So I quit and I went over the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a placement office at cal state </v>

20
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 2>fullerton and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

21
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I need a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

22
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:53.491
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you do?</v>

23
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:54.324
<v Speaker 2>I said nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>

24
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.343
<v Speaker 2>I have no skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a college student but I like to </v>

25
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 2>write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I got a job at a bike magazine,</v>

26
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 2>my first job out of college and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade magazine for um,</v>

27
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 2>for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bike industry,</v>

28
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got right into cycling right away </v>

29
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 2>about a bike the first week and when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't a bike rider before this job.</v>

30
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.923
<v Speaker 2>And I went to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big event at the Griffith Park where </v>

31
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 2>they had a yoplait yogurt 50 kilometer </v>
<v Speaker 2>bike race.</v>

32
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 2>And Jonathan Boyer was the Big Star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the first American to do the Tour</v>

33
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 2>de France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I saw him.</v>

34
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:24.481
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

35
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.950
<v Speaker 2>this is a cool sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just got into it.</v>

36
00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I just started riding and racing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I did.</v>

37
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 2>We started race across America in 1992 </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1982.</v>

38
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 2>And so I quit my job and just did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

39
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.403
<v Speaker 2>for a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had corporate sponsors and we had ABC </v>

40
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 2>wide world of sports that contract with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to film it.</v>

41
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 2>And we turned it into a little little </v>
<v Speaker 2>mini culture business.</v>

42
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.823
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra and ultra endurance sports were </v>

43
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 2>just taking off the iron man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became famous in the early eighties,</v>

44
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 2>John Howard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who won,</v>

45
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.393
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the first to do the race </v>
<v Speaker 2>across America with me and two other </v>

46
00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 2>guys and I did a rod dog sled race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then soon after that,</v>

47
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 2>we're all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

48
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 2>a sort of long distance mixed sport type</v>
<v Speaker 2>things where you run and hike and swim.</v>

49
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

50
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:10.441
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

51
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:13.070
<v Speaker 2>so that was just part of that culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

52
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I was young and single and didn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>house or mortgage,</v>

53
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:16.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

54
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 2>So you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do those kinds of things.</v>

55
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a fascinating thing to get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

56
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>because I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real rabbit hole.</v>

57
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.770
<v Speaker 1>You get into two when you started into </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycling and endurance racing and you,</v>

58
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:28.604
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand the culture and you get </v>

59
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 1>into those people there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are bizarre group of people.</v>

60
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

61
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.480
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>the subculture of ultra endurance </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes as a number of Weirdos.</v>

63
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>But so does the sort of skeptical </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

64
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.543
<v Speaker 1>I've decided that all kind of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>subcultures have a handful of real </v>

65
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:46.814
<v Speaker 1>weirdos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that show up at your door </v>

66
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I stay here this weekend?</v>

67
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.053
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

68
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>you have skeptics that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there are also skeptical there.</v>

69
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some oddballs there for sure.</v>

70
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 1>That's always going to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're absolutely right.</v>

71
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>That and about groups</v>

72
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 2>you're always going have like outliers </v>
<v Speaker 2>or strange strange,</v>

73
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.683
<v Speaker 2>but it's all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the endurance racing in and of </v>

74
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:06.934
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of pushing your body to </v>

75
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:09.094
<v Speaker 2>the limits is a really fascinating sport</v>
<v Speaker 2>because pretty much everyone can ride a </v>

76
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:14.224
<v Speaker 2>bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're doing something </v>

77
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 2>like ballet where you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine doing,</v>

78
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched like some people do like </v>

79
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:20.524
<v Speaker 2>flips and gymnastics and stuff and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I know the human body can do </v>

80
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

81
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't see myself doing it,</v>

82
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 2>but I can get on a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

83
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 2>The key is find something you like to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you're good at.</v>

84
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife's a beautiful dancer.</v>

85
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.611
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:34.444
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to dancing lessons with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't do it and I just got two </v>

87
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 2>left feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't do it.</v>

88
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.973
<v Speaker 2>What I meant is though that it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things where a normal person can </v>

89
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:43.400
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to,</v>

90
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.343
<v Speaker 2>but to do it the way a Lance Armstrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do it or the way of Greg Lamon can </v>

91
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.754
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

92
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.623
<v Speaker 2>You get into that weird area where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just tweaking every single aspect of </v>

93
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you eat,</v>

94
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 2>the way you sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do,</v>

95
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:57.920
<v Speaker 2>your mental attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

96
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.953
<v Speaker 2>your motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did you get down that rabbit hole </v>

97
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 2>one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

98
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:03.380
<v Speaker 2>It's all I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

100
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.163
<v Speaker 2>it was a 40 hour week but really more </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 60 hour a week job where you're </v>

101
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

102
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:09.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

103
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.393
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of preparation before you </v>

104
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:12.424
<v Speaker 2>go out on a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you come back from a ride and then </v>

105
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 2>you add weights or stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga,</v>

106
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:17.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever it ends up being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 2>an all day process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long did it take before you got into</v>

108
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 2>all those people that are into epo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood dope in?</v>

109
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 2>When I was raised in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no epo,</v>

110
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:31.380
<v Speaker 2>a blood doping was legal and it was done</v>
<v Speaker 2>by people I knew and the 84 Olympics,</v>

111
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the 84 Olympic team,</v>

112
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:33.754
<v Speaker 2>I know some of the people that did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used their own blood or a </v>

113
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 2>relative's blood.</v>

114
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.713
<v Speaker 2>They just stored it and packed it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even band until after the 84 </v>

115
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Olympics when it was found out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The American team did it.</v>

116
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.520
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

117
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.583
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

118
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 2>whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that UCI,</v>

119
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 2>the Olympic Committee said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

120
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no blood doping,</v>

121
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 2>but it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't try it.</v>

122
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 2>A race across America is kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different sort of competition.</v>

123
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 2>It's more of you against yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the in the clock,</v>

124
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hardly ever see the other people out</v>

125
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 2>there on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

126
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:02.644
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't into the idea of taking </v>

127
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 2>your blood out and packing it back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sort of creeped me out.</v>

128
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 2>And there were no drugs that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>

129
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like steroids,</v>

130
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.314
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to do it for a cyclist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It the miracle Vpo is that it packs in </v>

131
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:20.150
<v Speaker 2>more red blood cells much faster than </v>
<v Speaker 2>say trading at high altitude and uh,</v>

132
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have to do the creepy </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing with story and bags of blood and,</v>

133
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 2>and then the blood cells die or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood gets infected.</v>

134
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got Hep c when I was in college</v>

135
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:31.474
<v Speaker 2>and I had a back surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a tumor on my spine and I had to </v>

136
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 2>have it taken out and I had been taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of aspirin for pain.</v>

137
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 2>It was in pain for years and so they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this,</v>

138
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.533
<v Speaker 2>a blood transfusion in night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was 1976 and there was no test for </v>

139
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got Hep C.</v>

140
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 2>and so after that I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

141
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>blood blood doping packing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just sort of creeped me out.</v>

142
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 2>And there were people that were getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick from blood doping know you take the</v>

143
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.184
<v Speaker 2>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put in a,</v>

144
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 2>you store it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's stored properly,</v>

145
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:00.344
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you get blood infections and </v>

146
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:02.970
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

147
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.803
<v Speaker 2>that's dangerous is Hep c the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was recently in the news because </v>

148
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.134
<v Speaker 2>there was a young guy who owns some </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical company and they charged </v>

149
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>a ridiculous amount of money for it.</v>

150
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.251
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

151
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Because you can get the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been cured.</v>

152
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.153
<v Speaker 2>Know I'm a kaiser patient and I did it </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago and wiped it out within a </v>

153
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>month and I did the six month treatment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've had been clear ever since.</v>

154
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.150
<v Speaker 2>But the drugs aren't that expensive if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it through an Hmo,</v>

155
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.633
<v Speaker 2>they just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just built into it should be part </v>

156
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:35.530
<v Speaker 2>of your any healthcare system and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

157
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.383
<v Speaker 2>somebody was doctoring the search,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating the system or something like </v>

158
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

159
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 2>there was Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the story behind it,</v>

160
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it was a young Martin.</v>

161
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelly is that.</v>

162
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.230
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Hep c or HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe some different,</v>

163
00:06:49.231 --> 00:06:50.064
<v Speaker 2>different medications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a company that works for a lot </v>

164
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:52.214
<v Speaker 2>of pharmaceutical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it couldn't be both and the </v>

165
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 2>accusation once he was price gouging and</v>
<v Speaker 2>charging ridiculous.</v>

166
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.590
<v Speaker 2>It took you six months to get over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

167
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 2>my first blood test after a month of </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking the,</v>

168
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.923
<v Speaker 2>the antiviral and the interferon was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>combination would they use 10 years ago </v>

169
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 2>and within the first blood test it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

170
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Undetectable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

171
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:13.334
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to do the whole six month </v>

172
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our program.</v>

173
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did it.</v>

174
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.023
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the fortunate ones that </v>

175
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:20.930
<v Speaker 2>didn't get sick from the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people just are laid out,</v>

176
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:24.380
<v Speaker 2>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't do exercise or function,</v>

177
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:25.214
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't have any problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you tested negative but they still </v>

178
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 2>made you continue the medication?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

179
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.613
<v Speaker 2>Is it because just because you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a trials and it's like this is </v>

180
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:35.140
<v Speaker 2>what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to do the six months.</v>

181
00:07:35.141 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

182
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

183
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:38.020
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't mess with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

184
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 2>that was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

185
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.911
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:42.250
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

187
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.403
<v Speaker 2>that was the only thing you could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with was blood doping when epo was </v>

188
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 2>introduced in the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really made a big difference.</v>

189
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 2>And as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg,</v>

190
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I first discovered this when his </v>
<v Speaker 2>teammates came to him a and said,</v>

191
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:55.814
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found out these other guys are doing </v>

192
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

193
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 2>We got to get on the program and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to do it.</v>

194
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 2>And so by the time Lance got into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport,</v>

195
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't invent doping.</v>

196
00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was already ramping in,</v>

197
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.870
<v Speaker 2>it was full on cold coal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full coal.</v>

198
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.550
<v Speaker 2>And only land stayed was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

199
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everybody's doing it,</v>

200
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:11.534
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might as well do it at a really </v>

201
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 2>professional level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

202
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:15.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

203
00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:16.554
<v Speaker 2>that's where he sort of took it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another level and who knows if it's </v>

204
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 2>still going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

205
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I had him on the podcast and I watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

206
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

207
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 2>it was very enlightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

208
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I like him a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

209
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 2>he's an extreme winter and extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>winters are there.</v>

210
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:29.924
<v Speaker 2>They are the type of people that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just push everything to the outmost </v>

211
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 2>edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that guy,</v>

212
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 2>if everybody.</v>

213
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I've firmly believed that if everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>was 100 percent natural,</v>

214
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.960
<v Speaker 2>there was the same results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably would have had probably.</v>

215
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably would have been different </v>

216
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 2>numbers as far as like the times </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieved.</v>

217
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 2>But I think he's still probably would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have won it.</v>

218
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

219
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably is a bit.</v>

220
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:51.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a big word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

221
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

222
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.173
<v Speaker 2>this is why it's still in a moral act </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are people that don't do </v>

223
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:57.324
<v Speaker 2>it or they don't want to do it and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>never know how they would've done </v>

224
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.470
<v Speaker 2>compared to the people that are doping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

225
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

226
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.353
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

227
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.323
<v Speaker 2>probably we know that all of the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were on the podium with </v>

228
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:08.844
<v Speaker 2>lance for those seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all had been busted for dopey or </v>

229
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 2>admitted that they doped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the outcome,</v>

230
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:14.904
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far down do you go to give the </v>

231
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.584
<v Speaker 2>Jersey and did 127th place guy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something because we know so many of </v>

232
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:20.934
<v Speaker 2>them were doing it.</v>

233
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:22.743
<v Speaker 2>It's just so fascinating to me from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of these guys are </v>

234
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 2>essentially experimenting with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>

235
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:29.094
<v Speaker 2>Trying to find the right levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find out what's the best </v>

236
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:34.760
<v Speaker 2>method to do so and along the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

237
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 2>the career that lance had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see all these adjustments that these</v>

238
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 2>people are making and been trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

239
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:43.810
<v Speaker 2>one of the early books at before all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this came out about land.</v>

240
00:09:43.811 --> 00:09:47.390
<v Speaker 2>So it was called breaking the chain by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Willie who was a,</v>

241
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sworn your or you know,</v>

242
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 2>one of the people who give massage </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapies to a or.</v>

243
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:54.564
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was one of the mechanics </v>

244
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:55.550
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

245
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.540
<v Speaker 2>with the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

246
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Festina team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got busted in [inaudible] 98 and he</v>

247
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 2>said basically these guys were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimenting randomly.</v>

248
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:04.800
<v Speaker 2>No one knew what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the dosage?</v>

249
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 2>How many days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every other day.</v>

250
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:08.670
<v Speaker 2>How do I incorporate the other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing?</v>

251
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.710
<v Speaker 2>What about food training?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

252
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Katy bar the door.</v>

253
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's just try anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

254
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 2>one of the things lance did was hire the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best doctor.</v>

255
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.553
<v Speaker 2>This mckelly Ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know the business you got to knew the </v>

256
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:23.850
<v Speaker 2>most about how to do it properly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjust it for each body.</v>

257
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Because everybody's body is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

258
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:26.900
<v Speaker 2>so we're gonna try it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.913
<v Speaker 2>you do this for months before the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>race and figure it out and other people </v>

260
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:32.304
<v Speaker 2>weren't doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then by the time they scrambled to </v>

261
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 2>catch up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tyler talks about this in his book,</v>

262
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:37.524
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after he left the postal team and got </v>

263
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 2>his own team and then of course Ferrari </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't available.</v>

264
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 2>So we hired this other guy flint days </v>
<v Speaker 2>who screwed up and mix the bags of blood</v>

265
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 2>and gave him the wrong drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he got.</v>

266
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 2>He got popped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said for what?</v>

267
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.553
<v Speaker 2>He was doping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got popped for somebody else's </v>

268
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 2>dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

269
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 2>because someone else's blood was in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

270
00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

271
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and really vote talks about this and</v>

272
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 2>breaking the chain to about one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that,</v>

273
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.610
<v Speaker 2>one of the early guys that got busted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

274
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.473
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used his mechanics urine for the </v>

275
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:11.664
<v Speaker 2>urine test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you store it in a little condom </v>

276
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.690
<v Speaker 2>that's held underneath this little fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>penis called the wizard.</v>

277
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.613
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that because at the drug test </v>

278
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:24.190
<v Speaker 2>you have to look and watch the Ip </v>
<v Speaker 2>because just to make sure so you,</v>

279
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.083
<v Speaker 2>you do it in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just what the problem was that the </v>

280
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 2>mechanic had stayed up all night working</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the bikes and took some stimulants.</v>

281
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Stimulants are in the year and so this </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor guy gets busted for something.</v>

282
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:35.490
<v Speaker 2>He didn't take course he was taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

283
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.353
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's horror stories about this guy's </v>

284
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.150
<v Speaker 2>putting bags of blood on the hook on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

285
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.153
<v Speaker 2>in the hotel room on the wall where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>painting is that it drips down into </v>

286
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:45.260
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.240
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

288
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

289
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really a,</v>

290
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:49.783
<v Speaker 2>a barbaric system when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early days when they were </v>

291
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:53.790
<v Speaker 2>experimenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

292
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.753
<v Speaker 2>so again went lance did was just take it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to another level since it's going on </v>

293
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might as well do it professionally.</v>

294
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would have gotten away with it </v>

295
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 2>because had he stayed retired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back to where you started,</v>

296
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.153
<v Speaker 2>when you're at that level and you push </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body every day and you get all the </v>

298
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:13.800
<v Speaker 2>endorphins and the testosterone and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>camaraderie with the guys.</v>

299
00:12:13.801 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

300
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:15.663
<v Speaker 2>It is so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still ride four or five days a week </v>

301
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 2>with the guys that I used to race with </v>
<v Speaker 2>and friends in the area here and I,</v>

302
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:21.874
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I missed three or four days a week </v>

303
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 2>traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just crawling out of my skin.</v>

304
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>I just got to get back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

305
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

306
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:29.284
<v Speaker 2>And I'm 62 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine your lance and you have the </v>

307
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 2>highest competitive edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably anybody and,</v>

308
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.170
<v Speaker 2>and you're a super athlete and super </v>
<v Speaker 2>gifted and then you're push,</v>

309
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:38.681
<v Speaker 2>push,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push,</v>

310
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 2>and then you've got those seven straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you retire.</v>

311
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.730
<v Speaker 2>And then what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golf.</v>

312
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have the same intensity.</v>

313
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.820
<v Speaker 2>And so I completely understand why so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of these guys come back.</v>

314
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:49.723
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brett Farve came back a couple of times </v>

315
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:52.580
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.610
<v Speaker 2>it's just hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

317
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 2>to break that habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

318
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I see it all the time with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately we're,</v>

319
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.810
<v Speaker 2>the consequences are much graver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.823
<v Speaker 2>when you're older and your body doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>respond the same way and you've already </v>

321
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 2>taken a lot of damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you still have this Jonesing for</v>

322
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 2>the spotlight and see them come back.</v>

323
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all have done it yet.</v>

324
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Sugar Ray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leonard,</v>

325
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Alia down the line and a lot of MMA </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters have done it as well.</v>

326
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

327
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 2>it's the life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

328
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:20.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get Monday morning,</v>

329

<v Speaker 2>I eat this and it's just a great pattern</v>

330
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:24.094
<v Speaker 2>to be and it feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're working toward this goal in six </v>

331
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:28.990
<v Speaker 2>months or this is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when that goal is gone,</v>

332
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.741
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

333
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:30.574
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I getting up at six in the </v>

334
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:32.080
<v Speaker 2>morning to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

335
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I like doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got to have a reason.</v>

336
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta stayed retired,</v>

337
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 2>probably be governor of Texas by now </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably right?</v>

338
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.390
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

339
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

340
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was so beloved when he was </v>

341
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 2>doing the live strong foundation and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole deal of trying to help people with</v>

342
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:48.680
<v Speaker 2>cancer and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

343
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.590
<v Speaker 2>his own struggle overcoming cancer.</v>

344
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just such a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

345
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:54.390
<v Speaker 2>and it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

346
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.263
<v Speaker 2>the meltdown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it part of that Omerta rule and it </v>

347
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 2>works if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everyone has something to lose.</v>

348
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.620
<v Speaker 2>The problem was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was um,</v>

349
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Floyd Landis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

350
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.570
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got popped for the,</v>

351
00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 2>his victory in the 2006 Tour de France </v>
<v Speaker 2>for doping,</v>

352
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.853
<v Speaker 2>which he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he served his two years after a </v>

353
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:18.510
<v Speaker 2>long struggle of denial and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he wanted to come back and he,</v>

354
00:14:18.511 --> 00:14:19.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he couldn't get hired.</v>

355
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 2>And then he went to lance and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

356
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I be on the radio shack team?</v>

357
00:14:24.401 --> 00:14:25.234
<v Speaker 2>And apparently lance said no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there he is standing there with </v>

358
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.530
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to lose.</v>

359
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 2>So that's when he went to the press and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

360
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where the bodies are buried.</v>

361
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.253
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.310
<v Speaker 2>that's where it got bad.</v>

363
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Remember that when that happened and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lance Hill,</v>

364
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:39.120
<v Speaker 2>that press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

365
00:14:39.121 --> 00:14:43.240
<v Speaker 2>we like our story better than his story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like wait stories.</v>

366
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.320
<v Speaker 2>He's got to start with just what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and uh,</v>

367
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:47.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

368
00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and same thing with tyler,</v>

369
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:50.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had nothing left to lose.</v>

370
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that book the secret race,</v>

371
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 2>here's what we did and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blew it all open.</v>

372
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 2>So how do you get into skepticism from </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

373
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.143
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was still teaching college at night </v>

374
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 2>while I was doing the bike race and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

375
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.540
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I,</v>

376
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I got burnout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

377
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 2>just the training and all that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>

378
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this forever.</v>

379
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.920
<v Speaker 2>So I went back and got my phd in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of science and uh,</v>

380
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.360
<v Speaker 2>and then I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was teaching at Occidental College and</v>

381
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.001
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

382
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm a college professor.</v>

383
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a great gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

384
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.530
<v Speaker 2>it's a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

385
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we started in my garage,</v>

386
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:23.954
<v Speaker 2>skeptic magazine and the lecture series </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Caltech on science and pseudoscience </v>

387
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:28.304
<v Speaker 2>and cults and science and religion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative medicine and quackery and </v>

388
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:32.684
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

389
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.330
<v Speaker 2>and I thought that that's an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>niche to have and,</v>

390
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 2>and so that just got bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my first book,</v>

391
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.623
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white people believe where things came </v>

392
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 2>out in [inaudible] 97 and at about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

393
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:45.794
<v Speaker 2>Occidental college is going through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial crisis and they were letting </v>

394
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:49.064
<v Speaker 2>go their adjuncts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which at the time I was not on a tenure </v>

395
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:51.614
<v Speaker 2>track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a full time adjunct and I could </v>

396
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:54.110
<v Speaker 2>see the writing on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

397
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 2>this may not end up being a tenure track</v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

398
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.583
<v Speaker 2>And the skeptic thing was getting big </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got a big contract through my </v>

399
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:01.900
<v Speaker 2>agent for my second book.</v>

400
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.391
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

401
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be a full time writer.</v>

402
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.883
<v Speaker 2>And it's a little risky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I had already done the risky thing </v>

403
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:09.290
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

404
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 2>just dropping everything and doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>race across America steps.</v>

405
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:12.471
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

406
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this then became really my job.</v>

407
00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I still teach one class a semester at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chapman,</v>

408
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 2>but my main job is writing books and </v>
<v Speaker 2>running the society,</v>

409
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.150
<v Speaker 2>a publishing the magazine skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of a niche market of a,</v>

410
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like my column in scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>

411
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I cover the topics in there that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered in the rest of the magazine,</v>

412
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.463
<v Speaker 2>like cancer quackery or like I'm working</v>
<v Speaker 2>on one now on a Charlie Sheen's a quack </v>

413
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.180
<v Speaker 2>cancer doctor is aids doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

414
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.960
<v Speaker 2>he's got a quack cancer or aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

415
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.680
<v Speaker 2>it's eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

416
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

417
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

418
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:50.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is tiger blood and all that,</v>

419
00:16:50.571 --> 00:16:51.320
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

420
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.000
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no tiger blood.</v>

421
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he got HIV and so he immediately went</v>

422
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:57.860
<v Speaker 2>on the drug cocktail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which works,</v>

423
00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a miracle of modern medicine </v>

424
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:00.614
<v Speaker 2>that kind of just sort of slipped by </v>
<v Speaker 2>without anybody making a big fuss about </v>

425
00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:03.950
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

426
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.783
<v Speaker 2>t huge teams of medical researchers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured out the right cocktail and </v>

427
00:17:07.941 --> 00:17:10.130
<v Speaker 2>then you adjust it for each person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

428
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.023
<v Speaker 2>you can't get rid of the HIV virus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'd knock it down so much that it </v>

429
00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:17.080
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't cause the aids,</v>

430
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms.</v>

431
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:20.980
<v Speaker 2>You get pneumonia or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

432
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

433
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.740
<v Speaker 2>so he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

434
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 2>much to my amazement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

435
00:17:26.181 --> 00:17:27.014
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

436
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Bill Maher on his show a couple of weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

437
00:17:29.431 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I had this guy on this guy from Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 2>who has this cure for aids.</v>

438
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.361
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

439
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:37.250
<v Speaker 2>if you take this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

440
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 2>the blood of an arthritic goat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a goat that has arthritis,</v>

441
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.440
<v Speaker 2>how they determined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that's allegedly charlie,</v>

442
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>went to Mexico and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did the,</v>

443
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 2>the arthritic goat's blood treatment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cured his aides.</v>

444
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of this is true.</v>

445
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he stopped the drug cocktail.</v>

446
00:17:58.021 --> 00:17:58.854
<v Speaker 2>He went down there and stop the normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug cocktail for AIDS HIV and it came </v>

447
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 2>roaring back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

448
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:05.963
<v Speaker 2>if you don't keep taking the drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the virus starts multiplying and it </v>

449
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 2>roars back in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goat,</v>

450
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.083
<v Speaker 2>the goat blood didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he came home and went back on </v>

451
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:14.994
<v Speaker 2>the drug cocktail and he's fine now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he went down there to actually do </v>

452
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:19.560
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went down there to do this.</v>

453
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was probably told,</v>

454
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably scared.</v>

455
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

456
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I understand.</v>

457
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 2>If there's already a drug cocktail that </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely works,</v>

458
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 2>why would you want to stay just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent the aids symptoms from coming on</v>

459
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:32.334
<v Speaker 2>from you getting the diseases you still </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the HIV virus like magic knock it </v>

460
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:38.070
<v Speaker 2>down to an almost undetectable level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

461
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.800
<v Speaker 2>that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's should be good enough.</v>

462
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what Magic Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't even show up in this.</v>

463
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.510
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

464
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Like if he gets tested right now he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>HIV positive or a negative.</v>

465
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

466
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.840
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

467
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.853
<v Speaker 2>Even though they don't guarantee it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>in case it's hiding in the nooks and </v>

468
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.840
<v Speaker 2>crannies of your nervous system or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever.</v>

469
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

470
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

471
00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:58.231
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

472
00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of thing that scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>American would normally cover,</v>

473
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:01.944
<v Speaker 2>but we would cover or conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories like the nine slash 11 truth </v>

474
00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:05.631
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

475
00:19:05.631 --> 00:19:06.464
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the free fall of the </v>

476
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 2>buildings and the puffs of smoke and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>

477
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these are empirical questions we</v>

478
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:12.984
<v Speaker 2>can get at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that normal science journals wouldn't </v>

479
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:16.614
<v Speaker 2>cover that we cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So skeptic has kind of a niche market </v>

480
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:21.930
<v Speaker 2>for fringe claims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Borderlands claims,</v>

481
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

482
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 2>like scientific American deals a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>with global climate change,</v>

483
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:28.810
<v Speaker 2>but they don't deal with the global </v>
<v Speaker 2>warming deniers.</v>

484
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Who are these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are their arguments?</v>

485
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:32.250
<v Speaker 2>So we would take on that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

486
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 2>here's their 10 arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best arguments they have,</v>

487
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.090
<v Speaker 2>and then here's the answers of how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know global warming is real,</v>

488
00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:39.924
<v Speaker 2>how do you know it's human cause how do </v>
<v Speaker 2>we know these things are normal science </v>

489
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:44.610
<v Speaker 2>journalists don't have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

490
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 2>They are already down the path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like okay,</v>

491
00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:48.300
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that sort of thing.</v>

492
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.283
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of our specialty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's an important resource because </v>

493
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.870
<v Speaker 2>whether it's global warming or nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 truther and there's just,</v>

494
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:55.723
<v Speaker 2>there's so much confusion out there when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to trying to figure out what's </v>

495
00:19:58.831 --> 00:19:59.640
<v Speaker 2>real and what's not real.</v>

496
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Someone sends you a link,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like what is this?</v>

497
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's a youtube video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to the youtube,</v>

498
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>you are being lied to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the Hell is going on?</v>

499
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.220
<v Speaker 2>What you don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you watch it,</v>

500
00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:15.440
<v Speaker 2>like global warming is just one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>many ones that,</v>

501
00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that confuse the shit out of people.</v>

502
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:18.270
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:19.104
<v Speaker 2>then you find out that there's companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually have a vested interest in </v>

504
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.640
<v Speaker 2>confusing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

505
00:20:23.641 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen that documentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>merchants of doubt?</v>

506
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.551
<v Speaker 2>I'm in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

507
00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

508
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.193
<v Speaker 2>I'm in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

509
00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I asking you that many documentaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>officially to that,</v>

510
00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 2>the beauty of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a film made by a candidate that is now a</v>

511
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very clever because,</v>

512
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:39.744
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tracked down the same scientists who </v>

513
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 2>were hired by the tobacco companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just the same arguments,</v>

514
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:46.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planting a seed.</v>

515
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:47.993
<v Speaker 2>Some of the times the same people paid </v>
<v Speaker 2>by these front groups and they'd know </v>

516
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:52.684
<v Speaker 2>how to do it through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so theatrical the way they present </v>

517
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:55.234
<v Speaker 2>their arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why I've always </v>

518
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:56.824
<v Speaker 2>hated those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those tough television shows where you </v>

519
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 2>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

520
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a host,</v>

521
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:02.164
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the split window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One person talking over them on this </v>

522
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:07.720
<v Speaker 2>side and one person is on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person isn't the right,</v>

523
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:09.410
<v Speaker 2>literally and figuratively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

524
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.980
<v Speaker 2>They're yelling at each other and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>never get anything done.</v>

525
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:12.814
<v Speaker 2>You never figured out anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the person who's better at </v>

526
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:17.610
<v Speaker 2>expressing that opinion in a real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

527
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.320
<v Speaker 2>three or four minute soundbite of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview,</v>

528
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.493
<v Speaker 2>they get their argument across and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what these merchants of doubt </v>

529
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:24.760
<v Speaker 2>guys were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

530
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got the sound bites.</v>

531
00:21:26.001 --> 00:21:26.834
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the science is not all in the jury is </v>

532
00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:30.124
<v Speaker 2>still out.</v>

533
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.300
<v Speaker 2>What jury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you know it.</v>

534
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.220
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like there's a science are </v>
<v Speaker 2>that calls all the shots.</v>

535
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:37.960
<v Speaker 2>And if we can just find out what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on there,</v>

536
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:38.741
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

537
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:41.050
<v Speaker 2>we're going to blow this stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't how it works.</v>

538
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:41.884
<v Speaker 2>There's 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate scientists working in all these </v>

539
00:21:43.421 --> 00:21:47.260
<v Speaker 2>labs and their findings converge to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same conclusion.</v>

540
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.533
<v Speaker 2>So for there to be conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd all have to be meeting on the </v>

541
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:51.280
<v Speaker 2>weekends going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

542
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

543
00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.270
<v Speaker 2>the parts per million of this particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas is this,</v>

544
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:57.280
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not how it works.</v>

545
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.353
<v Speaker 2>It's a very competitive enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to make a name for yourself </v>

546
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.253
<v Speaker 2>and you're a young scientist just </v>
<v Speaker 2>debunking one of these arguments about </v>

547
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 2>tree ring data or the ice core data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be huge.</v>

548
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.330
<v Speaker 2>And they try it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

549
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like the people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Einstein was wrong.</v>

551
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

552
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 2>there's been 100 years of scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing Einstein.</v>

553
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.480
<v Speaker 2>If he was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would know by now,</v>

554
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>

555
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.350
<v Speaker 2>they're all conspiring to cover the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

556
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't how it works.</v>

557
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.370
<v Speaker 2>There's also this appeal or this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

558
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some reason people are drawn to this</v>

559
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:36.110
<v Speaker 2>idea of being a no nonsense person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the no nonsense person.</v>

560
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.020
<v Speaker 2>You believe in Al Gore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe that you have,</v>

561
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 2>if you've seen an inconvenient truth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

562
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.673
<v Speaker 2>But I find that when I talked to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that like really dismiss global </v>

563
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Speaker 2>climate change or dismiss a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's concerns about those things,</v>

564
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 2>they haven't really researched it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

565
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:53.674
<v Speaker 2>There so definitive on their ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they haven't really researched it </v>

566
00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 2>that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want to be a fool.</v>

567
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.330
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be a lot of the appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to take this hard stance.</v>

568
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like they don't want to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those fools.</v>

569
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:07.630
<v Speaker 2>What do you hippie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

570
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.900
<v Speaker 2>By buy of that nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

571
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

572
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly that,</v>

573
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 2>like one of the appeals of conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories is,</v>

574
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to blow the lid off and I'm </v>

575
00:23:17.921 --> 00:23:21.850
<v Speaker 2>not being fooled by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the Bush administration light and</v>

576
00:23:21.851 --> 00:23:23.040
<v Speaker 2>as yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to.</v>

577
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that's one of the appeals of </v>

578
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:27.550
<v Speaker 2>the nine slash 11 truth movement is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

579
00:23:27.551 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what really happened and,</v>

580
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.000
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush lied,</v>

581
00:23:31.001 --> 00:23:31.834
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe lied about this little thing </v>

582
00:23:33.251 --> 00:23:36.400
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it was misdirection or get bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

583
00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:37.234
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of orchestrating an entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>event like nine slash 11 and </v>

584
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.840
<v Speaker 2>coordinating the flying of the planes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into buildings and you know,</v>

585
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.943
<v Speaker 2>what did they do with the passengers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did get the people into the World </v>

586
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.133
<v Speaker 2>Trade Center buildings to break open the</v>
<v Speaker 2>drywall and plant the explosive devices </v>

587
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:52.424
<v Speaker 2>without anybody noticing how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people would have to be </v>

588
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:55.070
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

589
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.290
<v Speaker 2>You think the federal government could </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull it off?</v>

590
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Something like that when they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even do Watergate.</v>

591
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:01.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it's just a hotel.</v>

592
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Break it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot to bring in a book for.</v>

593
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:04.154
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn it.</v>

594
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.293
<v Speaker 2>I have a doctorate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's sort of a doctor is really a weed </v>

595
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.550
<v Speaker 2>doctor is a doctor that prescribes my </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana.</v>

596
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I get headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting one right now.</v>

597
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.293
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave me this book when I went to </v>

598
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:16.454
<v Speaker 2>visit him and it was a book about Tesla </v>
<v Speaker 2>Technology that was used to take down </v>

599
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 2>the twin towers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

600
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know this sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor's office,</v>

601
00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:26.291
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

602
00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking telling me about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

603
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:31.120
<v Speaker 2>That what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

604
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

605
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the turns concrete </v>
<v Speaker 2>into dust,</v>

606
00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.041
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

607
00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concretes,</v>

608
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.290
<v Speaker 2>it starts out as powder talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of tons of,</v>

609
00:24:40.291 --> 00:24:44.330
<v Speaker 2>of a building that's compressed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling down.</v>

610
00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

611
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine there'd be a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dust for awhile.</v>

612
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Thermite was the big thing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might will melt the.</v>

613
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.953
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then there were tests done and the </v>

614
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.670
<v Speaker 2>thermite and it doesn't burn hot enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get through a whole huge beam.</v>

615
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.833
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they have I think just cut through </v>

616
00:24:57.381 --> 00:24:58.910
<v Speaker 2>an engine block with that stuff though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

617
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these beams are like,</v>

618
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the size of this table,</v>

619
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.640
<v Speaker 2>but if it had a lot of thermite well </v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

620
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.540
<v Speaker 2>So then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's super thermite.</v>

621
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Well it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well where is this super thermal?</v>

622
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:10.460
<v Speaker 2>I never heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's secret super secret.</v>

623
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Super thermite pieces of evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were using or like the cuts,</v>

624
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:17.893
<v Speaker 2>the angular cuts on the beams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was actually done after the </v>

625
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.530
<v Speaker 2>buildings had color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

626
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.110
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to clean it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to cut some of them down and so</v>

627
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:28.340
<v Speaker 2>they were using these photos.</v>

628
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.160
<v Speaker 2>So there was a lot of confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

629
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:32.150
<v Speaker 2>you sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

630
00:25:32.151 --> 00:25:35.180
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>thermite or tesla technology.</v>

631
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 2>We know that the planes hit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>

632
00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:39.530
<v Speaker 2>You can see it on video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see which floors they were at,</v>

633
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.980
<v Speaker 2>the angle of the wings and so forth for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to have happened.</v>

634
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.903
<v Speaker 2>And explosive devices planted at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact floors where they knew ahead of </v>

635
00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:53.530
<v Speaker 2>time what floors and what angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The plane right there stop.</v>

636
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Full Stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

637
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.540
<v Speaker 2>that can't be well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

638
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very unlikely.</v>

639
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Super Unlikely not to mention a g Gordon</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liddy once told me about Watergate,</v>

640
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:04.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

641
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.233
<v Speaker 2>the competency problem and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people can't keep their mouth </v>

642
00:26:07.641 --> 00:26:08.620
<v Speaker 2>shut problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

643
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more people you have involved,</v>

644
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.940
<v Speaker 2>the more they're going to screw up or </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken out or change their mind or then</v>

645
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 2>tell their friends and lovers and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

646
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.853
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the guy that did it and pretty </v>

647
00:26:20.931 --> 00:26:23.970
<v Speaker 2>soon they're on your show telling about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they saw Haka.</v>

648
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:25.430
<v Speaker 2>No one's come out to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

649
00:26:25.431 --> 00:26:26.264
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting there in my office and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw these guys breaking through the dry </v>

650
00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:31.860
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And putting these things inside that you</v>

651
00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:32.694
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean someone like Jesse Ventura </v>

652
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:35.570
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was all done under the cover of a,</v>

653
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.540
<v Speaker 2>of a fixing the elevators in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade center,</v>

654
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:40.543
<v Speaker 2>fixing the elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this would have had to gone for </v>

655
00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>weeks and weeks and I don't</v>

656
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 1>know if Jesse Ventura really believes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

657
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.040
<v Speaker 1>He says this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's selling conspiracy.</v>

658
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:50.874
<v Speaker 1>Now I have A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of people that </v>

659
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy becomes a business and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones,</v>

660
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.220
<v Speaker 1>who's a friend of mine and he's out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his fucking mind.</v>

661
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I know he believes this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or does he just say stuff?</v>

662
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Just to see what comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believes a lot,</v>

663
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.300
<v Speaker 1>but he gets a lot of things right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's unfortunate.</v>

664
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:10.110
<v Speaker 1>The unfortunate thing about conspiracies</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's not all cut and dry.</v>

665
00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:10.983
<v Speaker 1>There was things like operation </v>
<v Speaker 1>northwoods where the government really </v>

666
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:16.740
<v Speaker 1>did plan on orchestrating these </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial attacks,</v>

667
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:17.783
<v Speaker 1>arming Cuban friendlies a bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to blow up a jetliner and </v>

668
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.720
<v Speaker 1>blaming on Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were real actual conspiring or con</v>

669
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.033
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies that we can prove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with the nine slash </v>

670
00:27:32.941 --> 00:27:33.471
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truth is,</v>

671
00:27:33.471 --> 00:27:34.304
<v Speaker 1>or the extreme conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're missing where the real action </v>

672
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:38.011
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

673
00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:38.844
<v Speaker 1>all those third world dictators we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting in the seventies under </v>

674
00:27:41.551 --> 00:27:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Kissinger and Nixon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all real.</v>

675
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 1>This stuff happened and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as sexy as,</v>

676
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:48.594
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking over the world are running the </v>

677
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:52.230
<v Speaker 1>world economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

678
00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 1>it's real and it's affected over in </v>
<v Speaker 1>north.</v>

679
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that,</v>

680
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

681
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.650
<v Speaker 1>when that was going on with the ads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that conspiracy,</v>

682
00:27:58.651 --> 00:28:00.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a real conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a real,</v>

683
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.590
<v Speaker 1>there's real ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

684
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:02.424
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a real one that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently being planned by Dick Cheney </v>

685
00:28:04.861 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 1>on the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

686
00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:08.190
<v Speaker 1>they were planning on doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Iran.</v>

687
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:10.050
<v Speaker 1>They were planning on some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>false flag.</v>

688
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.423
<v Speaker 1>But when people look at operation </v>
<v Speaker 1>northwoods and they look at that where </v>

689
00:28:13.531 --> 00:28:14.364
<v Speaker 1>it would have cost American lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a real conspiracy that </v>

690
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:17.394
<v Speaker 1>President Kennedy vetoed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was actually signed by the Joint </v>

691
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Chiefs of staff that gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets the Bay of pigs.</v>

692
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.150
<v Speaker 1>That was a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

693
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.140
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been real conspiracy,</v>

694
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

695
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.240
<v Speaker 1>So they look at nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

696
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:29.220
<v Speaker 1>this is the grand one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big one,</v>

697
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.173
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how can we tell the difference </v>

698
00:28:31.261 --> 00:28:32.450
<v Speaker 1>between the real ones that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

699
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

700
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.340
<v Speaker 1>so there's certain criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

701
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:40.000
<v Speaker 1>the grander the theory is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less likely it is a real conspiracy,</v>

702
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 1>global domination running the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

703
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.120
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

704
00:28:45.121 --> 00:28:45.954
<v Speaker 1>how about the big Alex Jones one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to cut the population down to </v>

705
00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:50.940
<v Speaker 1>like 500 million people worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

706
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could,</v>

707
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.730
<v Speaker 1>that could happen naturally if we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

708
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:55.873
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated women made them economically </v>

709
00:28:57.451 --> 00:28:59.880
<v Speaker 1>empowered and had access to birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

710
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the solution to they </v>

711
00:29:01.351 --> 00:29:03.090
<v Speaker 1>overpopulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really think that would work.</v>

712
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.650
<v Speaker 1>People still want babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

713
00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:05.131
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

714
00:29:05.131 --> 00:29:06.900
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the replacement level,</v>

715
00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:08.223
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of countries below </v>
<v Speaker 1>the replacement level and we know what </v>

716
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:12.210
<v Speaker 1>the factors are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things I just said,</v>

717
00:29:12.211 --> 00:29:13.044
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being,</v>

718
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.083
<v Speaker 1>being a prosperous democracy in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>women had the franchise and they're </v>

719
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.760
<v Speaker 1>economically empowered and educated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have access to birth control.</v>

720
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Family planning happens naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do the China one child</v>

721
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:26.280
<v Speaker 1>rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do that.</v>

722
00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:28.350
<v Speaker 1>It happens naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

723
00:29:28.351 --> 00:29:29.184
<v Speaker 1>if you're a pro life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so called pro life and you're against </v>

724
00:29:30.841 --> 00:29:31.674
<v Speaker 1>abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you want to reduce the amount </v>

725
00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:36.180
<v Speaker 1>of abortions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just educate women and giving them power</v>

726
00:29:36.181 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and give them choice and access to birth</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and it happens naturally.</v>

727
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird statistic,</v>

728
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>isn't</v>

729
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.500
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the more prosperous cities become,</v>

730
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:45.334
<v Speaker 3>the more the civilization becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>advanced as far as like education and </v>

731
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:49.863
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

732
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.010
<v Speaker 2>You get less birth rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

733
00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's [inaudible] Uzi and malthus was </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

734
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:55.114
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

735
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.020
<v Speaker 2>and Paul Ehrlich with the population </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb wrong and they're still modern.</v>

736
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Neil Matthews that are claiming this </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

737
00:30:01.911 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the club of Rome,</v>

738
00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:05.740
<v Speaker 2>the limits of growth and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

739
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.730
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

740
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get a population lower,</v>

741
00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:12.760
<v Speaker 2>just make the people super prosperous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the women.</v>

742
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:13.773
<v Speaker 2>And it just happens naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is because one reason </v>

743
00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:17.434
<v Speaker 2>people have so many babies in poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries is because they're not likely </v>

744
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:23.080
<v Speaker 2>to survive the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The babies die.</v>

745
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.960
<v Speaker 2>And so you got to have lots of them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get your jeans out there,</v>

746
00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of a biological impulse.</v>

747
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.000
<v Speaker 2>And then also to take care of you when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're old,</v>

748
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.133
<v Speaker 2>you better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better have six or 10 just to make </v>

749
00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 2>sure there's a couple left when year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>to support you.</v>

750
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to do any of that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a prosperous economy.</v>

751
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.470
<v Speaker 2>The effect</v>

752
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.810
<v Speaker 3>though is it's so scary as far as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>overpopulation effect,</v>

753
00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:50.660
<v Speaker 3>when we look at the raw numbers from </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 1970 versus 2016 worldwide,</v>

754
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that long ago in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime while I was alive,</v>

755
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.580
<v Speaker 3>the population has more than doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the United States,</v>

756
00:30:58.581 --> 00:31:01.130
<v Speaker 3>just in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And forget about poor countries.</v>

757
00:31:01.131 --> 00:31:02.990
<v Speaker 3>We've got about China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about India,</v>

758
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.580
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

759
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.413
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

760
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

761
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:06.364
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the population pig works its way </v>

762
00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:12.130
<v Speaker 2>through the python demographic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>python,</v>

763
00:31:12.131 --> 00:31:15.460
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take a while to catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So already country,</v>

764
00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:17.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a number of countries that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>below replacement level,</v>

765
00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:19.510
<v Speaker 2>but what countries are below that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

766
00:31:19.511 --> 00:31:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden,</v>

767
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

768
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:23.644
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's at least a dozen in mostly </v>

769
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:26.644
<v Speaker 2>northern European countries and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means that their population is still </v>

770
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:34.291
<v Speaker 2>growing by the momentum of past decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the current generation will have,</v>

771
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one point nine children on average.</v>

772
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:37.803
<v Speaker 2>Two point one is the replacement level </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I forget how many kinds of 20 </v>

773
00:31:40.241 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 2>something countries are below two point </v>
<v Speaker 2>one replacement level,</v>

774
00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:43.773
<v Speaker 2>but it'll take till about 20 slash 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>before we see the topping off of the </v>

775
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:49.270
<v Speaker 2>population growth and then start to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back down.</v>

776
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.163
<v Speaker 2>It's one reason you almost never see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>curves after 20 slash 50 because if </v>

777
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:57.400
<v Speaker 2>you're a pro environmentalist or pr pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti population organization,</v>

778
00:31:57.401 --> 00:32:00.700
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to show the good news </v>
<v Speaker 2>from 2050 to 2100,</v>

779
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.190
<v Speaker 2>but the UN two of the three you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>projections,</v>

780
00:32:03.191 --> 00:32:08.191
<v Speaker 2>they have like a conservative middle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and then I'm more radical projections</v>

781
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:13.381
<v Speaker 2>and that by 2100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the modest middle one shows us back down</v>

782
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:18.220
<v Speaker 2>to around probably six or 7 billion from</v>
<v Speaker 2>will hit a peak of nine or 10 billion in</v>

783
00:32:18.221 --> 00:32:21.010
<v Speaker 2>2050 back down to where we are now in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2100.</v>

784
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.010
<v Speaker 2>And then by 2100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe one or 2 billion,</v>

785
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:24.963
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

786
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:25.803
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could down to one or two that this </v>

787
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 2>could happen just by if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many variables,</v>

788
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:31.984
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to predict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that could happen if everybody is </v>

789
00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 2>prosperous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly Africa.</v>

790
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things the gates </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation is trying to do is just solve</v>

791
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 2>certain basic,</v>

792
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 1>simple problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

793
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 1>and the UN is trying to get rid of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt governments.</v>

794
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.823
<v Speaker 1>That's what's holding them back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's enough food to feed 7 billion </v>

795
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:50.150
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the distribution.</v>

796
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Green Revolution,</v>

797
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Norman Borlaug and the green revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>

798
00:32:55.141 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the technology to do at Gmos are</v>

799
00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:01.050
<v Speaker 1>good for feeding poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sub,</v>

800
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's the corrupt dictatorships that </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent the distribution of the food and</v>

801
00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:06.044
<v Speaker 1>resources and keeps the population from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being prosperous so they have more </v>

802
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:09.794
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

803
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.960
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the longterm solution.</v>

804
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's two things there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

805
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.383
<v Speaker 1>there's the conspiracy by the elites to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide the fact that we're going to get </v>

806
00:33:18.231 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 1>down to 2 billion people by 2100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got that.</v>

807
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the environmentalist,</v>

808
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:24.863
<v Speaker 1>they're hiding it hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know for sure this is going to </v>

809
00:33:28.311 --> 00:33:29.660
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are projections,</v>

810
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.020
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

811
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 1>a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very fascinating one.</v>

812
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had these guys on from the documentary</v>

813
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:40.130
<v Speaker 1>cowspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is well intended,</v>

814
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:40.964
<v Speaker 1>but apparently got a bunch of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong about how many acres it takes to </v>

815
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.420
<v Speaker 1>have a cow graze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much I'm going to,</v>

816
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:52.600
<v Speaker 1>what are the requirements and what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do with veganism versus what it was.</v>

817
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Essentially they were really heavily </v>
<v Speaker 1>biased and promoting a vegan lifestyle,</v>

818
00:33:56.301 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 1>which is their choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

819
00:33:57.261 --> 00:34:00.290
<v Speaker 1>they could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the big argument today.</v>

820
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:02.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we have enough land?</v>

821
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Do we have enough resources to feed all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people?</v>

822
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 1>My conversation has always been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

823
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.700
<v Speaker 1>are we doing it right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

824
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.830
<v Speaker 1>we're all eating right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the United States.</v>

825
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:13.733
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

826
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.740
<v Speaker 1>we are running out of land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are running out of food.</v>

827
00:34:15.741 --> 00:34:17.420
<v Speaker 1>We are running out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sky is falling,</v>

828
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 1>but are okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we doing it right now?</v>

829
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Are we feeding ourselves right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are right,</v>

830
00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.480
<v Speaker 1>you are really easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

831
00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:27.750
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a surplus,</v>

832
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.843
<v Speaker 1>plenty of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to say that a lot of the methods </v>

833
00:34:30.591 --> 00:34:32.770
<v Speaker 1>we're using aren't disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like factory farming.</v>

834
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Farming is terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible and the,</v>

835
00:34:34.431 --> 00:34:38.030
<v Speaker 1>and then a lot of laws to protect them </v>
<v Speaker 1>or disgusting to like the Ag gag laws.</v>

836
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Those are viable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why can't we keep doing it?</v>

837
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And then then the argument kind of falls</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

838
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Well we were gonna we're gonna run out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>

839
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

840
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:51.590
<v Speaker 1>So in the long run we want to get off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the factory farming.</v>

841
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:54.290
<v Speaker 1>It is according to disgusting habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the poly farms,</v>

842
00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:54.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the happy,</v>

843
00:34:54.921 --> 00:34:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I call them the happy farms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

844
00:34:56.121 --> 00:34:56.954
<v Speaker 1>wherever Joel Salatin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every cow has a name and there's the </v>

845
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:01.240
<v Speaker 1>happy chicken running around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

846
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.400
<v Speaker 1>that gets killed that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a great life until that last day.</v>

847
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:07.243
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of farms cannot support 7 </v>

848
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.653
<v Speaker 1>billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the long run we have to get the </v>

849
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:14.504
<v Speaker 1>numbers down somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the technology of synthetic </v>

850
00:35:17.301 --> 00:35:18.800
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just getting there.</v>

851
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I think we're not five years away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

853
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

854
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.053
<v Speaker 1>we're maybe a couple of decades away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think it's possible to get a </v>

855
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.190
<v Speaker 1>significant number of the people in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country to go vegan?</v>

856
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's gonna happen in the</v>

857
00:35:30.321 --> 00:35:31.154
<v Speaker 1>moral arc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a chapter on animal rights in </v>

858
00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:32.984
<v Speaker 1>which I show that the numbers are still </v>
<v Speaker 1>in single digits or even with all the </v>

859
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>environmental movement and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

860
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.791
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian,</v>

861
00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:39.541
<v Speaker 2>pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian.</v>

862
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:40.374
<v Speaker 2>It's still less than 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like six or seven percent of </v>

863
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:45.150
<v Speaker 2>the population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the population in the United States.</v>

864
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:45.984
<v Speaker 2>And so I liked the reduce attarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements and new word reduce attarian </v>

865
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:49.470
<v Speaker 2>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

866
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 2>meatless Mondays just just cut it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to,</v>

867
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:55.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you shop at whole foods,</v>

868
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:57.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the happy farm meat,</v>

869
00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>

870
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

871
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:01.990
<v Speaker 2>obviously if you can afford a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods,</v>

872
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.910
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the long run,</v>

873
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>markets will drive down prices of say a </v>

874
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 2>synthetic meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now,</v>

875
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:13.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little patty made out of stem cells is</v>

876
00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:16.080
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

877
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:16.914
<v Speaker 2>that course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what computers were in the </v>

878
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.410
<v Speaker 2>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now look,</v>

879
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:24.120
<v Speaker 2>and then this will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not in five years or 10 years.</v>

880
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.980
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in the meantime,</v>

881
00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 2>let's get everybody to go vegan.</v>

882
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.050
<v Speaker 2>This isn't also isn't going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you,</v>

883
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.760
<v Speaker 2>why don't you think it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

884
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think first of all,</v>

885
00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a habit of eating meat.</v>

886
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:36.960
<v Speaker 2>It tastes great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people like it.</v>

887
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

888
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.320
<v Speaker 2>you can get your protein from other </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources.</v>

889
00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a viable argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

890
00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.440
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most people,</v>

891
00:36:43.441 --> 00:36:46.830
<v Speaker 2>they just like it and it's culturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>has still has a lot of momentum.</v>

892
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one thing to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>care about global warming or yeah,</v>

893
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 2>let's drive electric cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

894
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to give up something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

895
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 2>that you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really like,</v>

896
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.590
<v Speaker 2>but food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people really like their meat.</v>

897
00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.513
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

898
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.533
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be okay if everybody went that </v>

899
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:04.560
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not quite there yet myself.</v>

900
00:37:04.561 --> 00:37:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I still have meat now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>

901
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I've reduced it considerably compared to</v>
<v Speaker 2>before was the ethical considerations of</v>

902
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:14.350
<v Speaker 2>the reason why people think that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good way to go and not,</v>

903
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily protein wise or.</v>

904
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

905
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.030
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of people that argue </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

906
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.890
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to get the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of protein,</v>

907
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.920
<v Speaker 2>but then there's also people that argue </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you really don't need the amount of</v>

908
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 2>protein the most people consume anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

909
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can try to change behavior.</v>

910
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nudge people with incentives,</v>

911
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.770
<v Speaker 2>but why not also go the path of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological solutions,</v>

912
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.880
<v Speaker 2>synthetic meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

913
00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:40.950
<v Speaker 2>people are working on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are companies doing it,</v>

914
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funded by a venture capitalists in </v>

915
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:46.223
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the google x projects is to do </v>

916
00:37:47.461 --> 00:37:48.750
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

917
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.820
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe it's like self driving cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>know it's just,</v>

919
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take a few decades before </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is there,</v>

920
00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.740
<v Speaker 2>but I'm optimistic because we're at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least moving in that direction.</v>

921
00:37:59.160 --> 00:37:59.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a real possibility of </v>

922
00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:04.860
<v Speaker 2>headless animals that we've engineered </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the labs and that's where we get our</v>

923
00:38:04.861 --> 00:38:08.280
<v Speaker 2>food from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what will it be as good for you?</v>

924
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tastes as good.</v>

925
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Well that a principle that should just </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a scientific western.</v>

926
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.213
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what,</v>

927
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 2>what's in inmate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

928
00:38:15.271 --> 00:38:17.700
<v Speaker 2>So just put it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your synthetic meat,</v>

929
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.960
<v Speaker 2>just design it with your designer jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

930
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:22.883
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a big difference between </v>

931
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:29.130
<v Speaker 2>cows that eat certain diets versus cows </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat grass fed cows versus health wise.</v>

932
00:38:29.131 --> 00:38:29.964
<v Speaker 2>As far as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

933
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.283
<v Speaker 2>there was a study that was released </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently showing the benefits of grass </v>

934
00:38:34.221 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 2>fed beef versus</v>

935
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 1>corn fed beef just health wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

936
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.051
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

937
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:41.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

938
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:42.690
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

939
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they do create synthetic meat,</v>

940
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will it have the same properties?</v>

941
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.793
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine you could even build in </v>

942
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:51.604
<v Speaker 1>marbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just put fat cells in there to make it </v>

943
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.690
<v Speaker 1>juicy or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that won't be as healthy,</v>

944
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:56.920
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't care.</v>

945
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would be,</v>

946
00:38:58.610 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

947
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between the way it </v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes like a marble,</v>

948
00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:07.171
<v Speaker 1>like a fat from a grass fed cow versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fat from a corn fed cow versus a fat</v>

949
00:39:07.571 --> 00:39:08.404
<v Speaker 1>from a lab built cow going to be yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also just habit of what you used </v>

950
00:39:13.631 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love red meat,</v>

951
00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:17.740
<v Speaker 1>but I almost never eat it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't miss it.</v>

952
00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of get into the pattern of</v>

953
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.640
<v Speaker 1>change in your diet and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

954
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I think we could get there.</v>

955
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:24.963
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that that's the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>avenue to solving the factory farming </v>

956
00:39:28.301 --> 00:39:30.940
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think lowering the population,</v>

957
00:39:30.941 --> 00:39:32.910
<v Speaker 1>synthetic meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing behavior,</v>

958
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.050
<v Speaker 1>just come at it from a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different angles.</v>

959
00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's of the case with every problem,</v>

960
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:38.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

961
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 1>So I call that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it in the moral of that Protopian</v>

962
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:43.370
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

963
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the founder of wired magazine,</v>

964
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.590
<v Speaker 1>he used this term protopia small </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>

965
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.650
<v Speaker 1>tiny little bit of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like last year's nab system,</v>

966
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this year's Nav system in your car,</v>

967
00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:53.854
<v Speaker 1>this one slightly better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has this little feature and this </v>

968
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:55.730
<v Speaker 1>little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

969
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:57.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over many years and decades,</v>

970
00:39:57.371 --> 00:40:01.390
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you've got a super smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>car versus the Jalopies of the fifties,</v>

971
00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:02.950
<v Speaker 1>not a flying car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't go from,</v>

972
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:03.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jalopy to the flying car and one </v>

973
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:08.710
<v Speaker 1>year you go to what we have now </v>
<v Speaker 1>incrementally.</v>

974
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's true in all technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

975
00:40:10.681 --> 00:40:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like the Mac just keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

976
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I've been buying Max for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

977
00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.410
<v Speaker 1>25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He since the late eighties and it's a 30</v>

978
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same pay,</v>

979
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:20.720
<v Speaker 1>the same price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

980
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you got 2,400</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks,</v>

981
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:23.014
<v Speaker 1>you get pretty much the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Double the computer for the same price </v>

982
00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:25.804
<v Speaker 1>every three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what most technologies go </v>

983
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:30.400
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

984
00:40:30.401 --> 00:40:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's one of the cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about following it.</v>

985
00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's so fascinating </v>

986
00:40:34.691 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 1>to me about following technology is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>woo,</v>

987
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:41.821
<v Speaker 1>Samsung has the new galaxy s nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's waterproof and it can show the moon</v>

988
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.810
<v Speaker 1>these days are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so interesting to see where this</v>

989
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.490
<v Speaker 1>innovation is going and when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation is,</v>

990
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:49.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's things like mean essentially </v>

991
00:40:51.221 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I've made the argument that the view </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaf cell phones alone,</v>

992
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:55.480
<v Speaker 1>if everyone's making cell phones right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

993
00:40:55.481 --> 00:40:57.550
<v Speaker 1>so let's just make the same cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

994
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.660
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

995
00:40:58.661 --> 00:41:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you have an iphone six s leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need any more innovation.</v>

996
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:03.844
<v Speaker 1>Let's use that for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for other things mean we'd probably be </v>

997
00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:07.840
<v Speaker 1>pretty happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be all right.</v>

998
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.420
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not how companies working now,</v>

999
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.470
<v Speaker 1>but we're fascinated by innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually,</v>

1000
00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little mad at apple right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the new o s system,</v>

1001
00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I lost half my music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it went and I haven't</v>

1002
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 1>taken the time to figure out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>it back.</v>

1003
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:21.641
<v Speaker 1>And what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1004
00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:23.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not on your phone and the cloud he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>

1005
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 1>They're encouraging use of the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1006
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say guys,</v>

1007
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:31.540
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

1008
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Just okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that that mean there</v>

1009
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.620
<v Speaker 3>is a lot of nonsense that they do when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they update things,</v>

1010
00:41:36.621 --> 00:41:37.454
<v Speaker 3>but that's also because they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to build in new features and their </v>

1011
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 3>planning several steps ahead for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1012
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 3>They want everything to be in the cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of weird.</v>

1013
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electric cars,</v>

1014
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:51.011
<v Speaker 3>I think you go to the Petersen Museum </v>
<v Speaker 3>here and you see electric cars in the 19</v>

1015
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:56.210
<v Speaker 3>twenties happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy kind of oil companies,</v>

1016
00:41:56.211 --> 00:41:57.044
<v Speaker 3>tire company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see the documentary who killed </v>

1017
00:41:58.491 --> 00:41:59.750
<v Speaker 3>the electric car?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1018
00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we should have.</v>

1019
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.513
<v Speaker 3>We should be there now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should have been there decades ago </v>

1020
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 3>then about the fact that Henry Ford's </v>
<v Speaker 3>first car,</v>

1021
00:42:05.631 --> 00:42:08.800
<v Speaker 3>the fenders were made out of hemp and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that.</v>

1022
00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.340
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1023
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:11.174
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you a video of them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really fascinating and pull up </v>

1024
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:18.761
<v Speaker 3>Henry Ford first car hamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used hemp fibers too,</v>

1025
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.413
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was legal back then know it wasn't </v>

1026
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.550
<v Speaker 3>illegal until they came up with a thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the decorticator,</v>

1027
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 3>which will allow them to effectively </v>
<v Speaker 3>process hemp fiber.</v>

1028
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.540
<v Speaker 3>That's when William Randolph hearst </v>
<v Speaker 3>started this propaganda against hemp.</v>

1029
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.590
<v Speaker 3>That was era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:36.830
<v Speaker 3>That's how marijuana became illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had nothing to do with the drug.</v>

1031
00:42:36.831 --> 00:42:37.664
<v Speaker 3>The psychoactive aspect of it had to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the the textiles and using it as </v>

1032
00:42:41.811 --> 00:42:45.680
<v Speaker 3>paper and using it as a commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when it became illegal and it was</v>

1033
00:42:45.681 --> 00:42:46.514
<v Speaker 3>all hearst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>William Randolph hearst was a </v>

1034
00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:48.680
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1035
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:49.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this car is actually made out of </v>

1036
00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:51.584
<v Speaker 3>hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fenders and Lotus did one recently </v>

1037
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.770
<v Speaker 3>where they had an exposed hood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting about this,</v>

1038
00:42:57.771 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 3>we see it a Henry Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's this video,</v>

1039
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:02.090
<v Speaker 3>but he hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hit him with a hammer.</v>

1040
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean incredibly durable.</v>

1041
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Hemp is an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing plant.</v>

1042
00:43:07.071 --> 00:43:09.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever picked up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemp stock,</v>

1043
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's incredibly hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really light,</v>

1044
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.833
<v Speaker 3>like very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different than any other would </v>

1045
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:16.130
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1046
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 3>It's hard like a walnut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1047
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 3>But it's light like a Balsa Wood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

1048
00:43:20.271 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 3>very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very unusual car.</v>

1049
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 3>Pull up the Lotus because it was real </v>
<v Speaker 3>recent,</v>

1050
00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 3>like last year to my car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1051
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:31.580
<v Speaker 3>It would bend like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's lighter and stronger than steel,</v>

1052
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.780
<v Speaker 3>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1053
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.330
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing with how to drugs become</v>

1054
00:43:35.331 --> 00:43:36.640
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a kind of a concern,</v>

1055
00:43:36.641 --> 00:43:37.474
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a conspiracy is a real </v>

1056
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.480
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy because hemp is non </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive.</v>

1057
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:45.350
<v Speaker 3>The fact that it's still illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're just now starting to grow</v>

1058
00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:46.184
<v Speaker 3>it in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We sell him my company on it sells hemp </v>

1059
00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:50.810
<v Speaker 3>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is legal.</v>

1060
00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Non-Psychoactive doesn't have any thc in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1061
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.850
<v Speaker 3>We had a buyer from Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really see this right here.</v>

1062
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.510
<v Speaker 3>This is the new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1063
00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.453
<v Speaker 3>Lotus that is the entire roof if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>show it and see if you could find a </v>

1064
00:44:02.211 --> 00:44:04.310
<v Speaker 3>picture where they show the actual car </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>

1065
00:44:04.311 --> 00:44:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

1066
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:06.463
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these panels are made out of hemp </v>

1067
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.970
<v Speaker 3>and like it's insanely light.</v>

1068
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you show the actual car itself,</v>

1069
00:44:13.311 --> 00:44:15.560
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see maybe go to the front,</v>

1070
00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:18.230
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of the video.</v>

1071
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.480
<v Speaker 3>You could see the actual hood of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

1072
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.690
<v Speaker 3>It's exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1073
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:25.880
<v Speaker 3>So they may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they essentially made a giant percentage</v>

1074
00:44:25.881 --> 00:44:29.250
<v Speaker 3>of the car out of hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the seats that looks,</v>

1075
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.620
<v Speaker 3>that looks lighter than carbon fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1076
00:44:31.621 --> 00:44:33.570
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if anyone's made a hemp </v>
<v Speaker 3>bicycle.</v>

1077
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:35.370
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question because that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1078
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:36.780
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole thing about carbon </v>
<v Speaker 3>fibers.</v>

1079
00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:37.614
<v Speaker 3>So lightweight but strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if what you were saying about him is </v>

1080
00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:40.374
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be heavy bikes on a lot of </v>

1081
00:44:41.671 --> 00:44:44.820
<v Speaker 3>other light things like bows and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>along those lines.</v>

1082
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:45.960
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1083
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 3>that's a real conspiracy conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

1084
00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why,</v>

1085
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.753
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Orson Welles made that movie citizen </v>

1086
00:44:52.711 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Kane Bout William Randolph hearst and </v>
<v Speaker 3>insanely,</v>

1087
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:56.754
<v Speaker 3>insanely powerful and influential man </v>
<v Speaker 3>who didn't really use that influence in </v>

1088
00:44:59.731 --> 00:45:01.350
<v Speaker 3>the best way for society.</v>

1089
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.213
<v Speaker 3>Did it Tuesday he had paper mills and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to convert his paper into </v>

1090
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:06.833
<v Speaker 3>hemp paper and paper was far superior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would have cost them millions of </v>

1091
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:10.403
<v Speaker 3>dollars because he had forests and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>popular science magazine back then and </v>

1092
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 3>see if he could find this color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a hemp,</v>

1093
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:20.130
<v Speaker 3>the new billion dollar crop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bicycle from him.</v>

1094
00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:21.900
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Done.</v>

1095
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good looking bike.</v>

1096
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1097
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a carbon fiber bike.</v>

1098
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll have to start looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1099
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where you buy one of those.</v>

1100
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is there no thc in the hip,</v>

1101
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a female plants in the,</v>

1102
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.820
<v Speaker 3>in the flower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1103
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.673
<v Speaker 3>It's in the flower buds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the female is the one you get </v>

1104
00:45:42.061 --> 00:45:43.780
<v Speaker 3>high off of the mail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your,</v>

1105
00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:47.490
<v Speaker 3>which one is the stock of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not looking for flowers,</v>

1106
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.710
<v Speaker 3>so when you're using it to make things </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1107
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.740
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seeds but hemp,</v>

1108
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 3>it's on the cover of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1109
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.213
<v Speaker 3>of popular science from like way back </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it looks like about 19 thirties or </v>

1110
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:00.510
<v Speaker 3>forties.</v>

1111
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:01.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I believe it was,</v>

1112
00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 3>I want to say 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was 33 or something like that,</v>

1113
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.730
<v Speaker 3>or 35 when it was made illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1114
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.940
<v Speaker 3>they made it illegal and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling it marijuana,</v>

1115
00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:12.774
<v Speaker 3>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is a slang for a Mexican wild </v>

1116
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:17.700
<v Speaker 3>tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even cannabis.</v>

1117
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 3>So when they were making marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal,</v>

1118
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:22.320
<v Speaker 3>they didn't even know that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>making hemp illegal.</v>

1119
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.640
<v Speaker 3>It was very tricky the way they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1120
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:25.703
<v Speaker 3>they made these articles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they printed all these articles about </v>

1121
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans and blacks raping white women </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were high on this new drug.</v>

1122
00:46:32.641 --> 00:46:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also what funded reefer madness,</v>

1123
00:46:34.801 --> 00:46:38.500
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure you've seen it all those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are real conspiracies.</v>

1124
00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:39.363
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's people that had a vested </v>

1125
00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:44.130
<v Speaker 3>financial interest in making something </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal,</v>

1126
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.113
<v Speaker 3>a commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy because the fact that </v>

1127
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 3>marijuana or the cannabis plant is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>versatile,</v>

1128
00:46:51.121 --> 00:46:52.320
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different things.</v>

1129
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:53.453
<v Speaker 3>They figured out a way to attack one </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of it and demonize the entire </v>

1130
00:46:56.731 --> 00:46:57.564
<v Speaker 3>plant and then eliminate competition </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now because it makes a far </v>

1131
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:02.850
<v Speaker 3>superior paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far superior cloth.</v>

1132
00:47:02.851 --> 00:47:04.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like incredibly durable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the paper,</v>

1133
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.110
<v Speaker 3>if you ever had hemp paper in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1134
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 3>it feels like a regular piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really hard to tear.</v>

1135
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.720
<v Speaker 3>It's a really interesting job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Money out of that.</v>

1136
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:13.680
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1137
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 3>what do they make money out of now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1138
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:17.110
<v Speaker 3>it's in fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:18.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1140
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

1141
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.530
<v Speaker 3>there was a documentary on about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1142
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:25.200
<v Speaker 3>public transportation system here in La </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was quite extensive at the thirties</v>

1143
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:26.640
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1144
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 3>electric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electric trolleys and this stuff and</v>

1145
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.070
<v Speaker 2>they all got ripped out and torn down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cars were burned and so on,</v>

1146
00:47:33.071 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 2>just because the automobile industry and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oil industry wanted it,</v>

1147
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like La should be a car down entire</v>

1148
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:40.234
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be a car culture rather than a </v>

1149
00:47:42.011 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 2>public transportation culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife's from Cologne,</v>

1150
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:45.484
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public transportation in Europe is </v>

1151
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:47.914
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really don't need a car for except </v>

1152
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:52.660
<v Speaker 2>for rare occasions here when she moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>here to be with me.</v>

1153
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:53.494
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1154
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.180
<v Speaker 2>got to have a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't get anywhere.</v>

1155
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1156
00:47:57.851 --> 00:47:58.684
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a conspiracy and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the kinds of things we should </v>

1157
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:02.980
<v Speaker 2>be focusing on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And talking about.</v>

1158
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the war on drugs,</v>

1159
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't call it a conspiracy,</v>

1160
00:48:07.271 --> 00:48:08.380
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

1161
00:48:08.381 --> 00:48:10.010
<v Speaker 2>It's been over for decades.</v>

1162
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:10.893
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also so blatant that it's only the </v>

1163
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:14.910
<v Speaker 3>war on some drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1164
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not like we're trying to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's sober,</v>

1165
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:21.190
<v Speaker 3>we're just gonna sell sanctioned drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have tax codes,</v>

1166
00:48:21.191 --> 00:48:22.024
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

1167
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:23.083
<v Speaker 3>that's really what the war is on drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't control and tax and it's </v>

1168
00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:28.740
<v Speaker 3>so blatant and obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1169
00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.350
<v Speaker 3>It might not treat it like an industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like any alcohol industry.</v>

1170
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1171
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like alcohol,</v>

1172
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.003
<v Speaker 3>alcohol's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and unbelievably devastating drug and </v>

1173
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:38.434
<v Speaker 3>readily available almost everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got enough in that back room to </v>

1174
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 3>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to kill yourself.</v>

1175
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Drink right now while the show was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1176
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:47.200
<v Speaker 3>We went in the next hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be dead.</v>

1177
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 3>It'll be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And mentally and no one cares.</v>

1179
00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1180
00:48:52.961 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Michael Shermer drank himself to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1181
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:56.400
<v Speaker 3>poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1182
00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

1183
00:48:57.511 --> 00:48:59.200
<v Speaker 3>he did drugs and he had an old.</v>

1184
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so tragic.</v>

1185
00:49:00.611 --> 00:49:02.010
<v Speaker 3>Drugs are awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1186
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 3>While they're everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every street you go down,</v>

1187
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:05.463
<v Speaker 3>you pass by liquor stores and </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants that sell just molecules in </v>

1188
00:49:08.891 --> 00:49:10.960
<v Speaker 3>your brain and your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1189
00:49:10.961 --> 00:49:12.550
<v Speaker 3>so what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1190
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:13.384
<v Speaker 3>there's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's absolutely real legitimate </v>

1191
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:19.570
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies and I do agree with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that those are the ones to focus on,</v>

1192
00:49:19.571 --> 00:49:23.970
<v Speaker 3>but they're not sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexy ones or Ufo or bigfoot.</v>

1193
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of stuff.</v>

1194
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.500
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Global diamond.</v>

1195
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:27.334
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this show for the Scifi channel </v>

1196
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.550
<v Speaker 3>called Joe Rogan questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything around her that.</v>

1197
00:49:33.551 --> 00:49:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1198
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I went around and I talked to experts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believers,</v>

1199
00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.760
<v Speaker 3>nonbelievers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>

1200
00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:43.450
<v Speaker 3>all these different people about a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of different subjects and boy,</v>

1201
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.373
<v Speaker 3>my desire to do that show before I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started doing it was very high and my </v>

1202
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:49.444
<v Speaker 3>desire to completely avoid any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of that nonsense towards the end of </v>

1203
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:53.164
<v Speaker 3>the show was it was almost like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't do it anymore because I had </v>

1204
00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 3>already recognized what was going on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>so many of these cases that I was like,</v>

1205
00:50:00.401 --> 00:50:01.234
<v Speaker 3>this is just a bunch of people that want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to believe they have these ideas in </v>

1206
00:50:05.591 --> 00:50:07.450
<v Speaker 3>their head and they want to chase these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas down,</v>

1207
00:50:07.451 --> 00:50:11.530
<v Speaker 3>whether it's big foot or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFO and they're not being objective even</v>

1208
00:50:11.531 --> 00:50:12.364
<v Speaker 3>remotely.</v>

1209
00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.273
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>a part of the movement or the community </v>

1210
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:18.083
<v Speaker 3>that like researches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ghosts or research is bigfoot or </v>

1211
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:21.970
<v Speaker 3>researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice people.</v>

1212
00:50:21.971 --> 00:50:22.804
<v Speaker 3>They're not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way they're looking at it right </v>

1213
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 3>is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same whether it's bigfoot</v>

1214
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 2>or chem trails or Ufo or they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

1215
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 2>They're not being objective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going,</v>

1216
00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:33.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this.</v>

1217
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 2>What about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have we considered this?</v>

1218
00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just going.</v>

1219
00:50:37.131 --> 00:50:37.964
<v Speaker 2>We know the evidence is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government has been hiding extra </v>

1220
00:50:40.191 --> 00:50:42.580
<v Speaker 2>terrestrial life in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where,</v>

1221
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:43.520
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the government?</v>

1222
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Where's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the government doing this?</v>

1223
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.033
<v Speaker 2>Where's the evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know from surveys that if you tick </v>

1224
00:50:47.361 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 2>the box that you believe in aliens or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1225
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.090
<v Speaker 2>you'll tick all the boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychics.</v>

1226
00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 2>So there's a certain personality that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravitates toward those kinds of beliefs</v>

1228
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:59.480
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then buys the whole thing.</v>

1229
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Even when their contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they contradict each other,</v>

1230
00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:03.470
<v Speaker 2>like people that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1231
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:05.330
<v Speaker 2>that believed that Princess di was </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>

1232
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.223
<v Speaker 2>Also are morally inclined to say she </v>
<v Speaker 2>faked her death and is still alive </v>

1233
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:10.640
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was hanging out with Tupac.</v>

1234
00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't both be true,</v>

1235
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.470
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1236
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:15.303
<v Speaker 2>so with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some cognitive dissonance that </v>

1237
00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 2>we want a balance between the size of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the event and the size of the cars.</v>

1238
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:21.044
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1239
00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:22.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Holocaust,</v>

1240
00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:24.200
<v Speaker 2>one of the worst thing that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

1241
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:28.340
<v Speaker 2>whereas genocide ever conducted by one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the worst regime,</v>

1242
00:51:28.341 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 2>political regimes in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's kind of a balance there,</v>

1243
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:32.960
<v Speaker 2>but if you haven't like jfk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1244
00:51:32.961 --> 00:51:34.830
<v Speaker 2>the leader of the free world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1245
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate,</v>

1246
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:37.040
<v Speaker 2>handsome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

1247
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:40.040
<v Speaker 2>And he's brought down by who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee Harvey Oswald,</v>

1248
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:41.480
<v Speaker 2>some lone nut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this loser,</v>

1249
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>

1250
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.480
<v Speaker 2>So you've got a pile on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1251
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:45.363
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mafia and the CIA and he wold acted </v>

1252
00:51:47.931 --> 00:51:48.351
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1253
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:49.340
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1254
00:51:49.341 --> 00:51:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No question.</v>

1255
00:51:50.251 --> 00:51:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1256
00:51:51.831 --> 00:51:53.840
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton of evidence that he did do</v>

1257
00:51:53.841 --> 00:51:53.960
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1258
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.680
<v Speaker 2>And most of the JFK conspiracy people </v>
<v Speaker 2>also agree he was involved.</v>

1259
00:51:57.681 --> 00:51:59.180
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was one of the shooters.</v>

1260
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.820
<v Speaker 2>It's one that they think there's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than one shooter,</v>

1261
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.220
<v Speaker 2>but so we have lots of evidence that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>

1262
00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:05.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have his rifle,</v>

1263
00:52:05.211 --> 00:52:07.640
<v Speaker 2>we have the paper trail of what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>bought the rifle.</v>

1264
00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:08.474
<v Speaker 2>His fingerprints are on the rifle that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was found in the fingerprints found </v>

1265
00:52:13.401 --> 00:52:18.401
<v Speaker 2>several days after they found that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had it right away too.</v>

1266
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Is a lot of stuff with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you go to appearance,</v>

1267
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.940
<v Speaker 2>he though that's really slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1268
00:52:22.941 --> 00:52:23.774
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's one of the things that </v>

1269
00:52:24.081 --> 00:52:24.914
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment something takes on great </v>

1270
00:52:25.971 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our mind focuses on little anomalies.</v>

1271
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Like why was there that guy in Dealey </v>
<v Speaker 2>Plaza with the umbrella?</v>

1272
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a sunny day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to rain set.</v>

1273
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was out there protesting,</v>

1274
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:39.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decades later they've tracked this guy </v>

1275
00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:40.850
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1276
00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:43.730
<v Speaker 2>He was called the umbrella man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the cigarette smoking man on x</v>

1277
00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.200
<v Speaker 2>files,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1278
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.033
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the umbrella man and that the </v>

1279
00:52:46.281 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 2>umbrella must have been a gun and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

1280
00:52:48.051 --> 00:52:49.060
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1281
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:53.090
<v Speaker 2>this is a leftover from world war </v>
<v Speaker 2>chamberlain and in his umbrella.</v>

1282
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:55.960
<v Speaker 2>And he sold out to Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

1283
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:58.670
<v Speaker 2>so the umbrella became a protest against</v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

1284
00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.653
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he was protesting Kennedy with </v>

1285
00:53:01.191 --> 00:53:03.290
<v Speaker 2>his umbrella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1286
00:53:03.291 --> 00:53:05.270
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a typical thing.</v>

1287
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares if somebody has an umbrella on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sunny day,</v>

1288
00:53:07.371 --> 00:53:08.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a silly thing,</v>

1289
00:53:08.781 --> 00:53:11.510
<v Speaker 2>but the moment something big happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1290
00:53:11.511 --> 00:53:12.344
<v Speaker 2>What is the meaning of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never even heard of that umbrella </v>

1291
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:15.260
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have researched.</v>

1292
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever read David Lifton's book of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes to evidence?</v>

1293
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty fascinating.</v>

1294
00:53:19.511 --> 00:53:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1295
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:23.450
<v Speaker 2>but Vincent Bugliosi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he dressed all of those claims is last.</v>

1296
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:27.150
<v Speaker 2>One of his last books was a case closed </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1297
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:32.151
<v Speaker 2>That was Gerald Posner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also a good book whose book it was,</v>

1298
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:34.950
<v Speaker 2>like a restoring history or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1299
00:53:34.951 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 2>It's big massive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a shorter version and uh,</v>

1300
00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.020
<v Speaker 2>but he lined up all those claims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1301
00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:40.854
<v Speaker 2>like one of them was that I had it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well get a job at the book depository </v>

1302
00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:44.874
<v Speaker 2>building that was right on the parade </v>
<v Speaker 2>route and he's going to turn right in </v>

1303
00:53:47.191 --> 00:53:48.090
<v Speaker 2>front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Kennedy.</v>

1304
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.690
<v Speaker 2>He must have known he was planted there </v>
<v Speaker 2>by operatives that knew this was going.</v>

1305
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:52.980
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1306
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:53.903
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was posner who track track </v>

1307
00:53:54.871 --> 00:53:55.704
<v Speaker 2>down when the White House determined </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Kennedy was even going to go to </v>

1308
00:53:59.071 --> 00:54:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Dallas and then months later the parade </v>
<v Speaker 2>route is determined.</v>

1309
00:54:02.371 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1310
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.653
<v Speaker 2>just before we went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Oswald had that job there months </v>

1311
00:54:06.001 --> 00:54:07.860
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just pure chance.</v>

1312
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Randomness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much of human history turns on random</v>

1313
00:54:11.551 --> 00:54:12.384
<v Speaker 2>events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the assassination of Franz </v>

1314
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Ferdinand had triggered the first world </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

1315
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 2>This was a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were seven operatives of the black</v>

1316
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:20.094
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was this Serbian nationalist </v>

1317
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:22.583
<v Speaker 2>organization and they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassinate the archduke Franz </v>

1318
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:26.671
<v Speaker 2>Ferdinand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1319
00:54:26.671 --> 00:54:28.260
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know what the,</v>

1320
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:29.094
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went to this house to get the </v>

1321
00:54:29.671 --> 00:54:32.000
<v Speaker 2>weapon and that has to get the grenade </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the rifle and they,</v>

1322
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:33.390
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stand on this corner,</v>

1323
00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:35.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is typically how it goes.</v>

1324
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.740
<v Speaker 2>A couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken that somebody did,</v>

1325
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.910
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went to the house,</v>

1326
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:41.400
<v Speaker 2>the person wasn't there to give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>their weapon,</v>

1327
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.013
<v Speaker 2>cause there's like three of them left </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then one of them through the hand </v>

1328
00:54:45.061 --> 00:54:45.894
<v Speaker 2>grenade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it bounced off the car and went under </v>

1329
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:50.790
<v Speaker 2>another car and damage that car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not the car.</v>

1330
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.480
<v Speaker 2>And then to the whole thing was bungled </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1331
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.960
<v Speaker 2>and off he went and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he gave a speech and then he decided</v>

1332
00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:58.794
<v Speaker 2>to go back to the hospital to visit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were hurt and that and the </v>

1333
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:02.993
<v Speaker 2>trailing car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they took the parade route back </v>

1334
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 2>backwards on the course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's this guy,</v>

1335
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:11.260
<v Speaker 2>prince eps sitting there on the curb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despondent like,</v>

1336
00:55:11.261 --> 00:55:13.930
<v Speaker 2>well that was a screw up and here comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the archduke ban.</v>

1337
00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.010
<v Speaker 2>What was a little more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1338
00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:16.873
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car stalled out because the cars </v>

1339
00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:21.930
<v Speaker 2>back then were really bad at going in </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse.</v>

1340
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.823
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was trying to put the car in </v>

1341
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:24.624
<v Speaker 2>reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The driver of the car is putting it in </v>

1342
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:26.430
<v Speaker 2>reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was convertible,</v>

1343
00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:27.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1344
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 2>He's putting it in reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The car stalled out.</v>

1345
00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:30.024
<v Speaker 2>And at that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy was coming out of a store or a </v>

1346
00:55:31.801 --> 00:55:32.634
<v Speaker 2>restaurant where he had a sandwich </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had something to eat after </v>

1347
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:36.750
<v Speaker 2>it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally walked out.</v>

1348
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:39.450
<v Speaker 2>He was right there and shot him and shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife.</v>

1349
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.860
<v Speaker 2>So that's typically conspiracies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely can happen.</v>

1350
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:48.330
<v Speaker 2>And obviously if Oswald had that job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know long in advance,</v>

1351
00:55:48.331 --> 00:55:50.430
<v Speaker 2>it shows before they have planned that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1352
00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:51.264
<v Speaker 2>It showed that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>randomness involved at Lincoln </v>

1353
00:55:53.251 --> 00:55:55.320
<v Speaker 2>assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a conspiracy.</v>

1354
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:57.320
<v Speaker 2>They were going to assassinate the vice </v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

1355
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:58.560
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice president,</v>

1356
00:55:58.561 --> 00:56:00.330
<v Speaker 2>secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretary of war,</v>

1357
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.030
<v Speaker 2>and they had all the guys going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and they all screwed up in.</v>

1358
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:04.963
<v Speaker 2>The only one that succeeded was booth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we knew that there was a conspiracy </v>

1359
00:56:08.941 --> 00:56:09.774
<v Speaker 2>within hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then within days they got the whole </v>

1360
00:56:10.891 --> 00:56:11.724
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are the people that did this to </v>

1361
00:56:12.871 --> 00:56:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy or nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who were the other operatives?</v>

1362
00:56:15.601 --> 00:56:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Who is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who did it?</v>

1363
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't there a some deathbed confessions</v>

1364
00:56:20.191 --> 00:56:21.750
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was his name hunt.</v>

1365
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Was that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

1366
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.820
<v Speaker 1>guy that they have photos of him that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was arrested at the scene of the crime.</v>

1367
00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.010
<v Speaker 1>You remember the Hobos that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested,</v>

1368
00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:30.844
<v Speaker 1>that were behind the grassy knoll and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so many people that called </v>

1369
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.380
<v Speaker 1>that said that they had heard shots from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grassy knoll.</v>

1370
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:38.680
<v Speaker 1>There's more than one that's possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was an echoing effect.</v>

1371
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Dealey Plaza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's surprisingly small and our magic.</v>

1372
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:44.170
<v Speaker 1>It's weird when you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1373
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.180
<v Speaker 1>and you know there's a museum now on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixth floor of the book.</v>

1374
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.260
<v Speaker 1>You can look right out the window and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the x on the street.</v>

1375
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.620
<v Speaker 1>First shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second shot,</v>

1376
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Howard Hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Howard.</v>

1377
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:55.023
<v Speaker 1>Confessions of Howard Hunt know that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had said that on his deathbed he was a </v>

1378
00:56:59.441 --> 00:57:02.360
<v Speaker 1>CIA spy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on his deathbed he obviously can fit</v>

1379
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.333
<v Speaker 1>convicted Watergate conspirators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that he was involved in the </v>

1380
00:57:06.941 --> 00:57:07.774
<v Speaker 1>assassination.</v>

1381
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 1>He said that on his deathbed he talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how he's an active participant.</v>

1382
00:57:12.881 --> 00:57:13.541
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1383
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Well then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1384
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know this particular one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why would you.</v>

1385
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:18.484
<v Speaker 1>Why would you like be so quick to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that more people weren't involved until </v>

1386
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I was open to the possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1387
00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:24.950
<v Speaker 1>we did this issue of skeptic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1388
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:27.300
<v Speaker 1>on the 50 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1389
00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.760
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what clothes were closed?</v>

1390
00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It was that bookcase closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1391
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and then just one book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1392
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:34.960
<v Speaker 1>and then Boleo sees book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started reading,</v>

1393
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just here's the claim,</v>

1394
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:37.960
<v Speaker 1>here's the explanation here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of things.</v>

1395
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Did they cover hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1396
00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they,</v>

1397
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:42.243
<v Speaker 1>how do they cover the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>magic bullet theory was concocted </v>

1398
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 1>because they had to account for a bullet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hit a curb under the overpass.</v>

1399
00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.493
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1400
00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1401
00:57:51.281 --> 00:57:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Nova did a whole two hour special on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic bullet and you know,</v>

1402
00:57:56.051 --> 00:57:57.460
<v Speaker 1>the seats are not lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like this.</v>

1403
00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:00.040
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have to make a right turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left turn kind of thing.</v>

1404
00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1405
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:01.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1406
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:02.164
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hunt and I shoot guns and bullets do </v>

1407
00:58:04.571 --> 00:58:06.310
<v Speaker 1>weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they hit things,</v>

1408
00:58:06.311 --> 00:58:08.650
<v Speaker 1>they ricochet off stuff and they go left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

1409
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:09.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go all over the place.</v>

1410
00:58:09.911 --> 00:58:10.744
<v Speaker 1>It's you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you are going to act to </v>

1411
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.593
<v Speaker 1>accurately determine when someone shoots</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and hits bone where that </v>

1412
00:58:16.811 --> 00:58:19.960
<v Speaker 1>bullet's going to go next is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do weird things,</v>

1413
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:20.410
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1414
00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:23.470
<v Speaker 1>they come out of people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you shoot someone in the front</v>

1415
00:58:23.471 --> 00:58:24.820
<v Speaker 1>and it had come out the top of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1416
00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.220
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1417
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:27.223
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what doesn't make sense more than </v>

1418
00:58:30.011 --> 00:58:33.730
<v Speaker 1>that is the pristine condition of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet after shattering bone.</v>

1419
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a pristine.</v>

1420
00:58:35.191 --> 00:58:40.191
<v Speaker 1>It was squished and compared to a bullet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hit bone,</v>

1421
00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:41.453
<v Speaker 1>there's like they've shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was another one </v>

1422
00:58:43.121 --> 00:58:47.500
<v Speaker 1>that's shot through the jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also your shot through Joe Shit</v>

1423
00:58:47.501 --> 00:58:48.970
<v Speaker 1>shot bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was shattered.</v>

1424
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:49.804
<v Speaker 1>They've never been able to recreate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a bullet to look like that after it </v>

1425
00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:53.800
<v Speaker 1>shattered bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

1426
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:57.610
<v Speaker 1>When the bullet hit connelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it broke more than one bone in his body.</v>

1427
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Broke three different bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

1428
00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.650
<v Speaker 1>and dislodged or broke his wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's the bullet.</v>

1429
00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not bad.</v>

1430
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at it,</v>

1431
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:07.250
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1432
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.340
<v Speaker 1>it's bulging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a picture of it here,</v>

1433
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:10.890
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

1434
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>

1435
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:14.800
<v Speaker 1>it is compressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you shoot a bullet in the water,</v>

1436
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:16.960
<v Speaker 1>it looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever shot a bullet into water?</v>

1437
00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1438
00:59:18.041 --> 00:59:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

1439
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.530
<v Speaker 1>They don't look when the bullet is </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out and it's,</v>

1440
00:59:21.531 --> 00:59:22.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's</v>

1441
00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:22.780
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1442
00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 3>the gunpowder goes off and it's flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1443
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:26.623
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have some distortion and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a bullet shoots into a pillow or a </v>

1444
00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:31.083
<v Speaker 3>shoots into anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have some distortion </v>

1445
00:59:32.571 --> 00:59:33.404
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just sheer force and velocity of that </v>

1446
00:59:36.021 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 3>bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you shatter bone,</v>

1447
00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 3>when they all get bent up and distorted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't get like that.</v>

1448
00:59:42.051 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 3>That's not something that hit anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion.</v>

1449
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:47.330
<v Speaker 3>I think that if that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1450
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.193
<v Speaker 3>the way they found it on the Gurney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Connolly's Gurney when he was in the </v>

1451
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:52.460
<v Speaker 3>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>

1452
00:59:52.461 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 3>we found the bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

1453
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.780
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That smacks of conspiracy,</v>

1454
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:57.614
<v Speaker 3>that billet bullet more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that I know what </v>

1455
00:59:59.871 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that the reason why they came</v>

1456
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:05.000
<v Speaker 3>up with the fact that one bullet did the</v>
<v Speaker 3>damage,</v>

1457
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.983
<v Speaker 3>not just in Kennedy but also in </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncommonly was because they had an </v>

1458
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:08.924
<v Speaker 3>account for that bullet that hit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underpass and hit the underpass that </v>

1459
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.060
<v Speaker 3>ricocheted hit some guy and that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to the hospital.</v>

1460
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:17.480
<v Speaker 3>They found the bullet hole in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>granite of the,</v>

1461
01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:18.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1462
01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.010
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>curb stone.</v>

1463
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:21.590
<v Speaker 3>So they had to account for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why they came up with.</v>

1464
01:00:21.591 --> 01:00:25.310
<v Speaker 3>It also was Arlen Specter was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys who came up with that theory.</v>

1465
01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:29.450
<v Speaker 3>It was a notorious scumbag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on the Watergate Commissioner,</v>

1466
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.490
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1467
01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:33.320
<v Speaker 3>It's not a funkiness is what I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not,</v>

1468
01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:37.250
<v Speaker 3>but I have been in the past inclined to </v>
<v Speaker 3>gravitate towards some pretty ridiculous</v>

1469
01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:38.084
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that bullet is anybody that knows </v>

1470
01:00:40.491 --> 01:00:41.324
<v Speaker 3>anything about hunting or guns or any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any person that I know that I've talked </v>

1471
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:45.890
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do you,</v>

1472
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 3>is this shot anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone say's no,</v>

1473
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:49.690
<v Speaker 3>everyone says that it hasn't hit.</v>

1474
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 2>But one thing to remember is that in all</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigations are fields of inquiry.</v>

1475
01:00:56.550 --> 01:01:01.420
<v Speaker 2>There's always an a residue of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexplained anomalies that any theory,</v>

1476
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:02.340
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>

1477
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:03.600
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1478
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always.</v>

1479
01:01:04.471 --> 01:01:05.304
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do you explain this one little </v>

1480
01:01:06.001 --> 01:01:06.834
<v Speaker 2>weird thing here that doesn't really get</v>
<v Speaker 2>accounted for by your explanation over </v>

1481
01:01:09.691 --> 01:01:11.220
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

1482
01:01:11.221 --> 01:01:14.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No theory explains everything.</v>

1483
01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.533
<v Speaker 2>But if you have an alternative theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to explain all this stuff over </v>

1484
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:18.924
<v Speaker 2>here that the mainstream theory explains</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the anomalies if you want to be </v>

1485
01:01:22.201 --> 01:01:23.034
<v Speaker 2>taken seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually the focus on the anomalies </v>

1486
01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:26.883
<v Speaker 2>is to the exclusion of all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that is nicely explained by the </v>

1487
01:01:29.701 --> 01:01:31.350
<v Speaker 2>mainstream theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1488
01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:33.930
<v Speaker 2>lone assassin explains a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everything.</v>

1489
01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:36.390
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do with the anomalies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1490
01:01:36.391 --> 01:01:38.490
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do anything with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is,</v>

1491
01:01:38.491 --> 01:01:39.450
<v Speaker 2>it's okay to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1492
01:01:39.451 --> 01:01:41.760
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's keep investigating,</v>

1493
01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:43.890
<v Speaker 2>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to then make the leap.</v>

1494
01:01:43.891 --> 01:01:45.810
<v Speaker 2>But we know there was a second shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1495
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:47.220
<v Speaker 2>we just know there's anonymous.</v>

1496
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:49.340
<v Speaker 3>We definitely don't know there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second shooter.</v>

1497
01:01:49.341 --> 01:01:51.410
<v Speaker 3>If there's no evidence whatsoever that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can say,</v>

1498
01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:52.011
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1499
01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:53.840
<v Speaker 3>we know for a fact there was a second </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooter.</v>

1500
01:01:53.841 --> 01:01:54.920
<v Speaker 3>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing.</v>

1501
01:01:54.921 --> 01:01:55.754
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we also don't know that one bullet </v>

1502
01:01:57.921 --> 01:01:58.754
<v Speaker 3>did all that damage and the only reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>why we believe that one bullet did all </v>

1503
01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:01.814
<v Speaker 3>that damage is because that was what was</v>
<v Speaker 3>presented and that they had this one </v>

1504
01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:06.044
<v Speaker 3>boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said that they found in Connolly's </v>

1505
01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Gurney that caused all this damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems rather unlikely.</v>

1506
01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.330
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unlikely.</v>

1507
01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:14.800
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1508
01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.510
<v Speaker 2>the other thing we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1509
01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.450
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had the,</v>

1510
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>the number of people that heard shots,</v>

1511
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:20.963
<v Speaker 3>four shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you say the number of people </v>

1512
01:02:23.341 --> 01:02:24.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1513
01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:25.164
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't buy eye witness testimony </v>

1514
01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:29.100
<v Speaker 3>in a murder like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds so crazy.</v>

1515
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:29.731
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1516
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:31.410
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's not reliable.</v>

1517
01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>

1518
01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:35.520
<v Speaker 3>there's so much chaos when you're there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the president gets shot.</v>

1519
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:36.354
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>

1520
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's adrenaline's flying.</v>

1521
01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 3>They're running around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard 100 shots.</v>

1522
01:02:40.771 --> 01:02:42.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get outliers.</v>

1523
01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:43.870
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught.</v>

1524
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get some people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have served in the military and are used</v>

1525
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:52.200
<v Speaker 3>to like chaotic events that can recall </v>
<v Speaker 3>it clearly and soberly.</v>

1526
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:53.223
<v Speaker 3>Didn't get a few of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but good luck sifting through all that </v>

1527
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:55.921
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1528
01:02:55.921 --> 01:02:56.754
<v Speaker 3>Eye witness evidence is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that drives me </v>

1529
01:02:58.621 --> 01:02:59.454
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About nine slash 11 when people are </v>

1530
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:02.124
<v Speaker 3>really into the nine slash 11 story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say people heard explosions in the </v>

1531
01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:04.990
<v Speaker 3>buildings.</v>

1532
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.823
<v Speaker 3>This guy said that he saw this and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw they don't know what the fuck they </v>

1533
01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 3>saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These giant buildings are falling down.</v>

1534
01:03:10.501 --> 01:03:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1535
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.070
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told the story once.</v>

1536
01:03:14.071 --> 01:03:14.904
<v Speaker 3>I saw a squirrel in the woods once and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it was a wolf for like two </v>

1537
01:03:18.721 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Canada and I said,</v>

1538
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:23.130
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking squirrel.</v>

1539
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1540
01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.260
<v Speaker 3>like I was worried about wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I thought I saw for like,</v>

1541
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm gonna look legit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>solid.</v>

1542
01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:33.240
<v Speaker 3>Two seconds I got this fucking squirrel </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a wolf,</v>

1543
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:34.763
<v Speaker 3>so I don't buy the eyewitness stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also don't buy these people that </v>

1544
01:03:38.341 --> 01:03:41.610
<v Speaker 3>are trying to like neatly like case </v>
<v Speaker 3>closed.</v>

1545
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1546
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:44.303
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird shit with that </v>

1547
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.313
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy assassination thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also a lot of people that were </v>

1548
01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:49.190
<v Speaker 3>mad at him because.</v>

1549
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1550
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:54.420
<v Speaker 3>he closed it as enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a lot.</v>

1551
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:55.343
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy was a very volatile human being </v>

1552
01:03:57.961 --> 01:03:59.880
<v Speaker 3>more than Obama today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1553
01:03:59.881 --> 01:04:00.714
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually what Kennedy was trying to do </v>

1554
01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:03.540
<v Speaker 3>as far as clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Federal Reserve,</v>

1555
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.870
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to get rid of the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to do a lot.</v>

1556
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:10.050
<v Speaker 3>He was opposed to secret service or </v>
<v Speaker 3>secret societies.</v>

1557
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.433
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that massive speech that he did about </v>

1558
01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:13.464
<v Speaker 3>secret societies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a very fascinating guy and a lot </v>

1559
01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:17.124
<v Speaker 3>of ways and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flawed in many as well and I'm sure if </v>

1560
01:04:20.191 --> 01:04:21.024
<v Speaker 3>he was a president today who would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in probably he be like one of </v>

1561
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:25.500
<v Speaker 3>the most scandalous presidents of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1562
01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.160
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not buying this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1563
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:32.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't think that Lee Harvey</v>

1564
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:32.903
<v Speaker 3>Oswald was an innocent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems pretty obvious that he was </v>

1565
01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:35.304
<v Speaker 3>involved in a lot of totally shit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember he had tried to assassinate </v>

1566
01:04:38.221 --> 01:04:40.870
<v Speaker 3>General Walker just in April before that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1567
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.670
<v Speaker 3>and failed and we just don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was by himself.</v>

1568
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:47.760
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it just really don't think</v>

1569
01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:49.470
<v Speaker 3>that he was the only one involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1570
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:54.500
<v Speaker 3>It just seems the way a lone assassin </v>
<v Speaker 3>could operate that that is the likeliest</v>

1571
01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.000
<v Speaker 3>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a free society,</v>

1572
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:59.430
<v Speaker 3>you can disappear into the nooks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crannies,</v>

1573
01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.010
<v Speaker 3>a big cities and no one will ever notice</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1574
01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:02.844
<v Speaker 3>It's like the nine slash 11 up pilots </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're training to take off but not </v>

1575
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.360
<v Speaker 3>ever learned to land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't we notice that?</v>

1576
01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:10.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1577
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.450
<v Speaker 3>we weren't looking for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too many things going on.</v>

1578
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:13.543
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so easy to be an armchair </v>

1579
01:05:15.301 --> 01:05:16.500
<v Speaker 3>quarterback and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1580
01:05:16.501 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what they would have known</v>

1581
01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.880
<v Speaker 2>should have known well after Pearl </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harbor,</v>

1582
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:22.540
<v Speaker 2>they were conspiracy theories at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roosevelt.</v>

1583
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:23.374
<v Speaker 2>Either new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either orchestrated or knew it would </v>

1584
01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:26.054
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let it happen to squelch the American </v>

1585
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:30.650
<v Speaker 2>firsters movement which was imported by </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1586
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Lindbergh and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1587
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:32.973
<v Speaker 2>and he had promised Churchill support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he can only do so much the </v>

1588
01:05:35.901 --> 01:05:39.220
<v Speaker 2>destroyers and all that we need to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then something happens.</v>

1589
01:05:39.221 --> 01:05:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it looks like,</v>

1590
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:42.940
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he must have been involved because he is</v>

1591
01:05:42.941 --> 01:05:45.880
<v Speaker 2>then able to act and get America into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Second World War.</v>

1592
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:49.840
<v Speaker 2>But usually politicians act in response </v>
<v Speaker 2>to something.</v>

1593
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.733
<v Speaker 2>Now's my opportunity to take advantage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this thing that happened to get my </v>

1594
01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all politicians do that.</v>

1595
01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.060
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean they're conspiring to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make the thing happen to get their way.</v>

1596
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the argument was that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was conspiring.</v>

1597
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:03.754
<v Speaker 2>The argument was that he knew and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled out some of the more major </v>

1598
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.113
<v Speaker 2>warships.</v>

1599
01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.420
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the other attack it.</v>

1600
01:06:09.421 --> 01:06:11.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the August ninth,</v>

1601
01:06:11.621 --> 01:06:16.621
<v Speaker 2>2001 memo from Condoleezza Rice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Osama bin Ladin to attack us soil.</v>

1602
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about that?</v>

1603
01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Clearly Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must have known and you know,</v>

1604
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.673
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what we're forgetting is that the </v>

1605
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:27.370
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands of pieces of Intel </v>
<v Speaker 2>that come in every day,</v>

1606
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:29.600
<v Speaker 2>this could happen as good after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact.</v>

1607
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>You go back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

1608
01:06:30.671 --> 01:06:34.090
<v Speaker 2>there's the one we should have known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with Pearl Harbor.</v>

1609
01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:35.710
<v Speaker 2>You know Japanese might attack in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii.</v>

1610
01:06:35.711 --> 01:06:36.544
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they might attack in the </v>

1611
01:06:36.761 --> 01:06:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might attack Alaska,</v>

1612
01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:39.600
<v Speaker 2>they may attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1613
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:40.583
<v Speaker 2>and so on and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the right one that we're </v>

1614
01:06:42.641 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 2>supposed to then focus our resources on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know until it happens and then</v>

1615
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:46.744
<v Speaker 2>you go back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fired because you should have </v>

1616
01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:49.380
<v Speaker 2>acted on that memo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1617
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:54.160
<v Speaker 2>but that's why I think you would have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be an expert in code as well.</v>

1618
01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.190
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to be an expert and to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to understand what they had,</v>

1619
01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.113
<v Speaker 2>what they had intercepted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would codes it intercepted and what </v>

1620
01:07:00.161 --> 01:07:03.910
<v Speaker 2>information they actually had back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's again,</v>

1621
01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:07.990
<v Speaker 2>one of those things that after the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to draw conclusion saying</v>

1622
01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:09.700
<v Speaker 2>this had to be a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1623
01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:10.534
<v Speaker 2>I think even the history channel had </v>
<v Speaker 2>something where they were saying that </v>

1624
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:15.030
<v Speaker 2>they knew that the attack was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

1625
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.470
<v Speaker 2>they let it happen so that they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into world war two.</v>

1626
01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1627
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a conspiracy theory at the time</v>

1628
01:07:20.951 --> 01:07:22.840
<v Speaker 2>and there was a congressional </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>

1629
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.010
<v Speaker 2>So the equivalent of the Warren report </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that and concluded no,</v>

1630
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:27.223
<v Speaker 2>that there was no conspiracy on the part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the US government or any </v>

1631
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:31.930
<v Speaker 2>administration to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1632
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.270
<v Speaker 2>that should be held responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1633
01:07:34.271 --> 01:07:35.104
<v Speaker 2>a few people I think were fired for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>having the planes in the right place or </v>

1634
01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:38.140
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1635
01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.530
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1636
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.390
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just.</v>

1637
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:41.223
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing we had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>other psychological effect is that we </v>

1638
01:07:43.121 --> 01:07:45.190
<v Speaker 2>tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're on the outside,</v>

1639
01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:48.400
<v Speaker 2>you tend to see big organizations is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more powerful than they really are.</v>

1640
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Big Corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CEO's,</v>

1641
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:51.303
<v Speaker 2>big government agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the administrators that run them </v>

1642
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:55.120
<v Speaker 2>from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like.</v>

1643
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I know they have a lot of power and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do a lot of things,</v>

1644
01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:59.770
<v Speaker 2>but when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get the job,</v>

1645
01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:01.320
<v Speaker 2>then you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1646
01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.373
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things I can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's another one of these </v>

1647
01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:06.790
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be true.</v>

1648
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:07.624
<v Speaker 2>When you get elected president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take you in the back room and they </v>

1649
01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:09.610
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1650
01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:10.443
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what's actually going on and get </v>

1651
01:08:11.241 --> 01:08:13.030
<v Speaker 2>my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's actually going on in Iraq.</v>

1652
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.160
<v Speaker 2>No one knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't pull the troops.</v>

1653
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 2>You can't close the</v>

1654
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.813
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1655
01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1656
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I said I was going to do that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

1657
01:08:19.611 --> 01:08:21.320
<v Speaker 1>They all say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't do it.</v>

1658
01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.193
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1659
01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.273
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of act that goes </v>

1660
01:08:24.111 --> 01:08:28.100
<v Speaker 1>on that you don't find out that we just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know and we could maybe later.</v>

1661
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.963
<v Speaker 1>It's all speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think when you're dealing with </v>

1662
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>something like these massive global </v>
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>

1663
01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:34.213
<v Speaker 1>after they occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every people are always trying to do </v>

1664
01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:38.900
<v Speaker 1>some sort of investigative reporting or </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure it out.</v>

1665
01:08:38.901 --> 01:08:39.734
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to go back over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces and connect things that make </v>

1666
01:08:42.121 --> 01:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>sense and the problem is you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias on both sides.</v>

1667
01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:47.444
<v Speaker 1>You get confirmation bias where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to show very clearly that </v>

1668
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:50.294
<v Speaker 1>there was no conspiracy whatsoever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get people to try and see </v>

1669
01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:56.180
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy and everything and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of these stories,</v>

1670
01:08:56.181 --> 01:08:57.014
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these major events like whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's jfk assassination or many other </v>

1671
01:09:00.891 --> 01:09:01.724
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of weirdness to them that </v>

1672
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.910
<v Speaker 1>make it real hard to wrap up nice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight and when people can't wrap them up</v>

1673
01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:09.350
<v Speaker 1>nice and tight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get very uneasy.</v>

1674
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>

1675
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.050
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1676
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.880
<v Speaker 1>It could be a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>

1677
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1678
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:16.180
<v Speaker 1>keep an open mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1679
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:17.203
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to conspire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to construct a whole </v>

1680
01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>nother world view of operatives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>agents plots.</v>

1681
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:24.980
<v Speaker 1>You could just say that's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

1682
01:09:24.981 --> 01:09:25.814
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's also very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we recognize that there have been </v>

1683
01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:29.564
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies before like nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>by itself as a consensus 19 members of </v>

1684
01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.453
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a bloody and fly planes into </v>

1685
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a conveyance inspired.</v>

1686
01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one.</v>

1687
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:40.730
<v Speaker 1>That's one group that we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also know about,</v>

1688
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:41.803
<v Speaker 1>like we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the operation northwoods and there's </v>

1689
01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:46.520
<v Speaker 1>been some false flag events that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the Gulf of Tonkin.</v>

1690
01:09:46.521 --> 01:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>That's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1691
01:09:47.461 --> 01:09:48.294
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been some lies and we know that </v>

1692
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 1>so it makes the whole thing like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

1693
01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:53.503
<v Speaker 1>But this is me and these were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about actual real events </v>

1694
01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.070
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to like psychics and Tarot </v>
<v Speaker 1>card readers or you know,</v>

1695
01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:03.523
<v Speaker 1>my wife's friend went to a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychic the other day and I had to </v>

1696
01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:06.794
<v Speaker 1>listen to this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were talking to me about the </v>

1697
01:10:08.481 --> 01:10:10.070
<v Speaker 1>psychic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1698
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:11.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went and she knew everything and she </v>

1699
01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:13.883
<v Speaker 1>was so amazing and she was asking me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about my aunt and how could she have </v>

1700
01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:17.901
<v Speaker 1>known like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1701
01:10:17.901 --> 01:10:20.390
<v Speaker 1>fucking Christ first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was there,</v>

1702
01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:21.563
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was there to see what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions she asked and how you </v>

1703
01:10:23.481 --> 01:10:24.440
<v Speaker 1>answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:10:24.441 --> 01:10:25.274
<v Speaker 1>Because usually they tell the psychics </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fed back later while they have </v>

1705
01:10:29.721 --> 01:10:30.554
<v Speaker 1>these leading questions and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>give them partial answers and then they </v>

1706
01:10:33.081 --> 01:10:35.190
<v Speaker 1>fish for more and then before you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it there,</v>

1707
01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:36.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all,</v>

1708
01:10:36.111 --> 01:10:38.960
<v Speaker 1>you're filling in the blanks together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want to believe,</v>

1709
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of times there's like some </v>

1710
01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:41.714
<v Speaker 1>weird social aspect to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hand holding or something like </v>

1711
01:10:44.391 --> 01:10:46.880
<v Speaker 1>that where it's like this intimacy thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you don't,</v>

1712
01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:50.360
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be confrontational </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this person.</v>

1713
01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.710
<v Speaker 1>And so you sort of kind of helped them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1714
01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Your bolt in each other's space because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only like two feet away from each</v>

1715
01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:57.530
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's odd.</v>

1716
01:10:57.531 --> 01:11:00.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of oddness and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>real psychodrama.</v>

1717
01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:01.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who worked the psychic </v>

1718
01:11:02.661 --> 01:11:03.494
<v Speaker 1>friends network line back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties when Dionne Warwick on that </v>

1719
01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:08.280
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1720
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:09.850
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a magician that,</v>

1721
01:11:09.851 --> 01:11:10.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't quite make a decent living </v>

1722
01:11:12.531 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>doing magic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he did</v>

1723
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.080
<v Speaker 2>this on the side and it became fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>lucrative,</v>

1724
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:17.303
<v Speaker 2>so he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1725
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:21.180
<v Speaker 2>he operated from home and you just have </v>
<v Speaker 2>another phone line and they send you the</v>

1726
01:11:21.181 --> 01:11:24.840
<v Speaker 2>calls and you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got sixty cents on the minute</v>

1727
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.201
<v Speaker 2>and the company got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1728
01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:27.690
<v Speaker 2>it was three 95 a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got sixty cents on the minute,</v>

1729
01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:31.590
<v Speaker 2>but they rewarded you the longer you </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep them on the subjects on the line,</v>

1730
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:34.290
<v Speaker 2>the more higher percentage you get of </v>
<v Speaker 2>each minute.</v>

1731
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.693
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he would do this by working through </v>

1732
01:11:37.741 --> 01:11:38.574
<v Speaker 2>different categories and mostly people </v>
<v Speaker 2>call it night and weekends they're </v>

1733
01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:43.010
<v Speaker 2>lonely and need somebody to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1734
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:43.801
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

1735
01:11:43.801 --> 01:11:44.790
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

1736
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.760
<v Speaker 2>especially love relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>

1737
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:48.700
<v Speaker 2>your boss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1738
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.250
<v Speaker 2>people would just Yak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yak,</v>

1739
01:11:50.251 --> 01:11:51.084
<v Speaker 2>Yak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yak.</v>

1740
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 2>And then he got pretty good sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1741
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.430
<v Speaker 2>The analogy I make is like with Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Laura's Colin Talk Show,</v>

1742
01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:57.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sees has a rich database of problems </v>

1743
01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:02.040
<v Speaker 2>that people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they call her and you know,</v>

1744
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.370
<v Speaker 2>every.</v>

1745
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 2>So every call she knows within 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>

1746
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:05.610
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's problem number seven.</v>

1747
01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.713
<v Speaker 2>It's number 16 year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get the one with the guy and he </v>

1748
01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 2>just hone right in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these psychics,</v>

1749
01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:16.941
<v Speaker 2>they have a deep database of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology connected Dr Laura to it.</v>

1750
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was just listen to that show.</v>

1751
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Find similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1752
01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that she's running a psychic scam.</v>

1753
01:12:26.281 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1754
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:28.463
<v Speaker 2>but that the psycho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only so many variations on of </v>

1755
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.793
<v Speaker 2>human psychology and human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do people care the most about </v>

1756
01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:35.880
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1757
01:12:35.881 --> 01:12:36.790
<v Speaker 2>love health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many career.</v>

1758
01:12:36.791 --> 01:12:38.580
<v Speaker 2>So you just work your way through those </v>
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

1759
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:40.710
<v Speaker 2>And then people just open up and pour </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff out,</v>

1760
01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.290
<v Speaker 2>take a few notes and then like 45 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes later.</v>

1761
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about your,</v>

1762
01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:45.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your uncle Bob.</v>

1763
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could he have known about uncle?</v>

1764
01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you told them half an hour ago so people</v>

1765
01:12:50.071 --> 01:12:50.904
<v Speaker 2>forget that.</v>

1766
01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 2>So if you record them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you video tape and more tape recorder.</v>

1767
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:56.280
<v Speaker 2>It's very enlightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1768
01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.193
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a show with John Stossel when he </v>

1769
01:12:58.681 --> 01:13:00.950
<v Speaker 2>was with ABC 20 slash 20 on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1770
01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:01.793
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John and James and Prague and they got </v>

1771
01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:05.723
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't tell Vanpraagh guy was </v>

1772
01:13:06.541 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 2>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they taped them all day,</v>

1773
01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:10.403
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing people in to do readings and </v>

1774
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:16.500
<v Speaker 2>cameras and set up and stuff like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you sit there with a counter,</v>

1775
01:13:16.501 --> 01:13:17.334
<v Speaker 2>like how many times has he asked this </v>
<v Speaker 2>question or say these things and it's </v>

1776
01:13:19.861 --> 01:13:20.694
<v Speaker 2>just hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so his hit rate was maybe less than </v>

1777
01:13:23.911 --> 01:13:26.640
<v Speaker 2>10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they only remembered that,</v>

1778
01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:27.180
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1779
01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:31.320
<v Speaker 2>the handful of the 10 percent and forgot</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hundreds of names he would throw out</v>

1780
01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.100
<v Speaker 2>and comments he would make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a confirmation bias.</v>

1781
01:13:35.101 --> 01:13:35.541
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1782
01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:37.170
<v Speaker 2>a high data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high data rate,</v>

1783
01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.033
<v Speaker 2>you just pouring stuff out and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>people pick out the ones that they </v>

1784
01:13:40.021 --> 01:13:42.600
<v Speaker 2>remember and then we'd catch him </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating once in a while like,</v>

1785
01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1786
01:13:43.591 --> 01:13:44.190
<v Speaker 2>let's take a break.</v>

1787
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:45.023
<v Speaker 2>Everybody break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you leave the camera rolling and </v>

1788
01:13:46.981 --> 01:13:48.480
<v Speaker 2>then he starts chatting with people you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1789
01:13:48.481 --> 01:13:50.950
<v Speaker 2>So who are you here for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my aunt,</v>

1790
01:13:50.951 --> 01:13:51.990
<v Speaker 2>she passed over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1791
01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:52.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like half an hour later I'd </v>

1792
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.600
<v Speaker 2>like to come to this woman here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now don't tell me who you're here for,</v>

1793
01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:59.430
<v Speaker 2>but I'm getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a woman on your,</v>

1794
01:13:59.431 --> 01:14:03.290
<v Speaker 2>over your left shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say sister mother.</v>

1795
01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Is it an aunt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1796
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it looks,</v>

1797
01:14:07.411 --> 01:14:07.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

1798
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:10.740
<v Speaker 2>it's edited and the way it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1799
01:14:10.741 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really getting something.</v>

1800
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.650
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you really see it in operation,</v>

1801
01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>you can see the whole thing unfolds </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely as a psychodrama.</v>

1802
01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had this guy on the show,</v>

1803
01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 1>his name is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's abandoned.</v>

1804
01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.173
<v Speaker 1>I know he's great and it's fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a magician and he does </v>

1805
01:14:28.601 --> 01:14:31.960
<v Speaker 1>those psychic reading things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'll tell you right away,</v>

1806
01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:35.170
<v Speaker 1>this is a trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am really good at it.</v>

1807
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I am not a psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no psychic ability whatsoever,</v>

1808
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:41.770
<v Speaker 1>but I can't tell you how I'm doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know how to do this.</v>

1809
01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:42.633
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was bending spoons and doing all </v>

1810
01:14:44.561 --> 01:14:47.710
<v Speaker 1>this craziness and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did card tricks,</v>

1811
01:14:47.711 --> 01:14:50.200
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of crazy stuff where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is insane,</v>

1812
01:14:50.201 --> 01:14:51.034
<v Speaker 1>how is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was really adamant about letting </v>

1813
01:14:53.861 --> 01:14:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these people that are psychics that</v>

1814
01:14:56.171 --> 01:14:58.120
<v Speaker 1>are telling you about your future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your past,</v>

1815
01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.830
<v Speaker 1>they're all con people.</v>

1816
01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 1>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing terrible things.</v>

1817
01:15:02.141 --> 01:15:02.974
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to pretend that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead relatives are communicating with </v>

1818
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you from the great beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're giving you this sense of hope,</v>

1819
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:11.680
<v Speaker 1>but they're all scammers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1820
01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.280
<v Speaker 1>having a guy like that who's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled at that style of what we.</v>

1821
01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I think he calls it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a mentalist.</v>

1822
01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:20.830
<v Speaker 1>A mentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1823
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to watch though.</v>

1824
01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.280
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is so good at it.</v>

1825
01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Bannon checks one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:15:25.641 --> 01:15:26.474
<v Speaker 1>But he's also one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of one of the leaders of a </v>

1827
01:15:28.121 --> 01:15:29.190
<v Speaker 1>skeptical movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1828
01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Which is ethical magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1829
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:34.540
<v Speaker 1>He's an entertainer and it's not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything horrible.</v>

1830
01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.433
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not ripping anybody off and he's </v>

1831
01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:37.970
<v Speaker 1>really adamant about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1832
01:15:37.971 --> 01:15:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1833
01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:39.723
<v Speaker 1>I love what he was on a cruise with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>on set one of these cruise ship things </v>

1834
01:15:43.571 --> 01:15:44.404
<v Speaker 1>with other skeptics and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he did some of these mentalism stuff </v>

1835
01:15:47.621 --> 01:15:48.454
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me how he did one of them and </v>

1836
01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:50.733
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty good about not telling the </v>

1837
01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:52.204
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really pressed him on this </v>

1838
01:15:53.231 --> 01:15:54.064
<v Speaker 1>particular thing when he would touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody like on the shoulder here and </v>

1839
01:15:56.811 --> 01:15:59.710
<v Speaker 1>then you're blindfolded and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you would say,</v>

1840
01:15:59.711 --> 01:16:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I felt like you touched me on the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1841
01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:02.890
<v Speaker 1>the left shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that right.</v>

1842
01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:03.723
<v Speaker 1>And you had a whole sequence of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things where the other person was </v>

1843
01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.180
<v Speaker 1>picking up on the queue of where he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>being touched.</v>

1844
01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:10.750
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just stunned by this,</v>

1845
01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is he doing this?</v>

1846
01:16:12.071 --> 01:16:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I know he's not really psychic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1847
01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.450
<v Speaker 1>And then he told me how he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1848
01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1849
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.500
<v Speaker 1>that is so good and it's so simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't tell us.</v>

1850
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1851
01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:25.373
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really probably the best </v>

1852
01:16:26.321 --> 01:16:27.154
<v Speaker 1>reason why you don't want to know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the magicians do it because it's almost </v>

1853
01:16:29.261 --> 01:16:31.030
<v Speaker 1>always super simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1854
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.943
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've seen that penn and teller </v>

1855
01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:36.760
<v Speaker 1>was penn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jillette teller really doesn't talk that</v>

1856
01:16:36.761 --> 01:16:37.594
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was an old show that was on </v>

1857
01:16:39.911 --> 01:16:44.320
<v Speaker 1>television in Australia or radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on radio or television,</v>

1858
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was this trick that they did.</v>

1859
01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was the way the pen like,</v>

1860
01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.510
<v Speaker 1>god damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

1861
01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm struggling to remember how exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>it worked,</v>

1862
01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.150
<v Speaker 1>but it was this woman who could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1863
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.220
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could tell the future or she could,</v>

1864
01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.113
<v Speaker 1>she could some sort of psychic ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And penn explained it and the way he </v>

1865
01:17:08.471 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 1>explained it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want to explain</v>

1866
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 2>it like they did it on the rate is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiolab,</v>

1867
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:15.770
<v Speaker 2>radiolab podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they explained it on there.</v>

1868
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a terrible Job explaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1869
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 2>but when you hear the explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't give it out because I don't want</v>

1870
01:17:20.451 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 2>to ruin it for anybody who hasn't heard </v>
<v Speaker 2>it before.</v>

1871
01:17:21.981 --> 01:17:23.600
<v Speaker 2>But when you hear the explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

1872
01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.570
<v Speaker 2>oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1873
01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:29.990
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course fuckers fuckers.</v>

1874
01:17:29.991 --> 01:17:31.460
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having that,</v>

1875
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.520
<v Speaker 2>the ability to sneaky trick people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1876
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:35.743
<v Speaker 2>But you can make a lot of money if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an unethical person and you can </v>

1877
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:41.780
<v Speaker 2>fool a lot of people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like one of the examples I use,</v>

1878
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you know penn and teller do the cups and</v>
<v Speaker 2>balls,</v>

1879
01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:45.043
<v Speaker 2>but they use clear plastic cups so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can see where the ball is and how it's </v>

1880
01:17:49.071 --> 01:17:51.110
<v Speaker 2>being done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you still,</v>

1881
01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:52.690
<v Speaker 2>you still get fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1882
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Because the power of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1883
01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:55.154
<v Speaker 2>the sort of following his gaze or </v>
<v Speaker 2>following the movement of the hand and </v>

1884
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.970
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>

1885
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:03.340
<v Speaker 2>It's done so well that you still miss it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a clear plastic with it.</v>

1886
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:06.440
<v Speaker 2>So this is a good example where even </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing the trick,</v>

1887
01:18:06.441 --> 01:18:07.274
<v Speaker 2>you might still be fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about people that want to </v>

1888
01:18:10.071 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 2>fund the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

1889
01:18:11.490 --> 01:18:14.880
<v Speaker 2>is it something about the search for </v>
<v Speaker 2>human knowledge?</v>

1890
01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:15.723
<v Speaker 2>Like the thing that's always inside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people where they're trying to find out </v>

1891
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:21.680
<v Speaker 2>where's the food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the enemy coming from?</v>

1892
01:18:21.681 --> 01:18:22.514
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen in the future as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be like some search for </v>

1893
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:30.010
<v Speaker 2>human knowledge that is a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's desire to uncover mystery.</v>

1894
01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:31.743
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's almost like a genetic calling </v>

1895
01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.400
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1896
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.960
<v Speaker 2>what it is is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just learning and survival.</v>

1897
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.823
<v Speaker 2>So I call this patternicity the tendency</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find meaningful patterns in both </v>

1898
01:18:42.621 --> 01:18:43.454
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and meaningless noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my thought experiment is imagine </v>

1899
01:18:45.741 --> 01:18:48.590
<v Speaker 2>you're a hominid on the plains of africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>three and a half million years ago,</v>

1900
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:51.320
<v Speaker 2>small brain australopithecine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your name is lucy,</v>

1901
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:53.510
<v Speaker 2>and that you hear a rustle in the grass.</v>

1902
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Is that a dangerous predator or is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the wind?</v>

1903
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:57.403
<v Speaker 2>So if you assume that the rustle in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass is a dangerous predator and it </v>

1904
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:01.610
<v Speaker 2>turns out it's just the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a type one error,</v>

1905
01:19:01.611 --> 01:19:02.444
<v Speaker 2>a false positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you thought a was connected to be but </v>

1906
01:19:04.311 --> 01:19:07.340
<v Speaker 2>but no harm you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just become skiddish and cautious or</v>

1907
01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:09.230
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you assume that the rustle in the</v>

1908
01:19:09.231 --> 01:19:12.920
<v Speaker 2>grass is just the wind and it turns out </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a dangerous predator,</v>

1909
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:13.933
<v Speaker 2>your lunch just been given a darwin </v>
<v Speaker 2>award for taking yourself out of the </v>

1910
01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:20.000
<v Speaker 2>gene pool early before reproducing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>

1911
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 2>it's better to just assume that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you think Are connected,</v>

1912
01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:26.990
<v Speaker 2>all rustles in the grass are dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators and not the wind,</v>

1913
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.880
<v Speaker 2>just in case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's not.</v>

1914
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:31.610
<v Speaker 2>There's not a big cost to pay for making</v>
<v Speaker 2>a type one error,</v>

1915
01:19:31.611 --> 01:19:32.444
<v Speaker 2>a false positive.</v>

1916
01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:35.750
<v Speaker 2>There is a higher cost for making a type</v>
<v Speaker 2>two error or false negative.</v>

1917
01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:39.770
<v Speaker 2>So we assume that this is the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstition and magical thinking.</v>

1918
01:19:39.771 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 2>We just assume that this is connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you pull the slot and you do this,</v>

1919
01:19:43.521 --> 01:19:45.290
<v Speaker 2>you pull the slot machIne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you win or whatever,</v>

1920
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:49.910
<v Speaker 2>and this is what skinner show back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fifties where you just randomly give</v>

1921
01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:50.744
<v Speaker 2>reinforcements to rats and pigeons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they were doing just before </v>

1922
01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.610
<v Speaker 2>they got rewarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll just repeat that behavior.</v>

1923
01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.653
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's like twirling </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterclockwise twice and that's the </v>

1924
01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:03.380
<v Speaker 2>basis of superstition it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with their brains.</v>

1925
01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:07.040
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to find causal </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections between events,</v>

1926
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:10.290
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the basis of survival.</v>

1927
01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 2>So all of us are subject to making those</v>
<v Speaker 2>connections.</v>

1928
01:20:14.371 --> 01:20:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Some are more gullible than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say are more skeptical,</v>

1929
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:22.260
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part all of us can </v>
<v Speaker 2>easIly be fooled if it's done right.</v>

1930
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.300
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the beauty of good cons,</v>

1931
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.940
<v Speaker 2>good scams is that anybody could fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>

1932
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:29.280
<v Speaker 2>even smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if anything,</v>

1933
01:20:29.281 --> 01:20:30.114
<v Speaker 2>smart people are more likely to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird things in this sense that once </v>

1934
01:20:33.751 --> 01:20:35.640
<v Speaker 2>they believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they've drawn a connection.</v>

1935
01:20:35.641 --> 01:20:39.630
<v Speaker 2>They're Better at rationalizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons why they believe than say,</v>

1936
01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:41.610
<v Speaker 2>less educated or less intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1937
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:43.950
<v Speaker 2>And so as people like panacek will tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1938
01:20:43.951 --> 01:20:46.770
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing better than an audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>of scientists at mit.</v>

1939
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:47.663
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can really fool them because they </v>

1940
01:20:50.581 --> 01:20:53.430
<v Speaker 2>think they're so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be full to wow,</v>

1941
01:20:53.431 --> 01:20:55.740
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must be doing something really,</v>

1942
01:20:55.741 --> 01:20:58.860
<v Speaker 2>really super psychic because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm super smart,</v>

1943
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.390
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>

1944
01:21:00.391 --> 01:21:04.140
<v Speaker 2>because all of our sensory apparatus </v>
<v Speaker 2>works the same and magicians know how to</v>

1945
01:21:04.141 --> 01:21:06.980
<v Speaker 2>manipulate your gaze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your attention,</v>

1946
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:08.520
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and had a fool you.</v>

1947
01:21:08.770 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 3>this is so weird how people are drawn to</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to uncover mystery so you know,</v>

1948
01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:14.473
<v Speaker 3>whether it's ghosts or whether it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how many goddamn go shows do they </v>

1949
01:21:17.681 --> 01:21:21.700
<v Speaker 3>have to have where no one ever sees it </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows they stop having go shows.</v>

1950
01:21:21.701 --> 01:21:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I know those things drive me crazy.</v>

1951
01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:27.470
<v Speaker 2>We don't do very many issUes like on </v>
<v Speaker 2>astrology.</v>

1952
01:21:27.471 --> 01:21:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Is it real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we took care of this,</v>

1953
01:21:30.891 --> 01:21:31.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decades ago.</v>

1954
01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:32.960
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing new.</v>

1955
01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Astrology as far as like,</v>

1956
01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:36.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1957
01:21:36.981 --> 01:21:39.740
<v Speaker 3>you're a leo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're inclined to be a leader.</v>

1958
01:21:39.741 --> 01:21:40.574
<v Speaker 3>Like that kind of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is there anything to those really </v>

1959
01:21:44.301 --> 01:21:47.140
<v Speaker 3>complex astrological readings?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were they,</v>

1960
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.560
<v Speaker 3>they look for the time of day you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>born and mercury's and retro.</v>

1961
01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you looked into that?</v>

1962
01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I know nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to it.</v>

1963
01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1964
01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:58.043
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all in the psychology of the </v>

1965
01:21:59.401 --> 01:22:02.490
<v Speaker 2>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you mix up somebody's reading for,</v>

1966
01:22:02.491 --> 01:22:03.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a leo,</v>

1967
01:22:03.481 --> 01:22:04.314
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gave you the virgo reading or </v>

1968
01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:07.360
<v Speaker 2>whatever for that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost everybody go,</v>

1969
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

1970
01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:10.170
<v Speaker 2>that's all total hustle.</v>

1971
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

1972
01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:13.120
<v Speaker 3>What about nancy reagan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She believed,</v>

1973
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:14.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what you're saying.</v>

1974
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God rest her soul.</v>

1975
01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:22.470
<v Speaker 2>God rest her soul didn't use a psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She consulted a little bit.</v>

1976
01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got played up quite a bit,</v>

1977
01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:25.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for ronnie's travel schedule a little </v>

1978
01:22:27.421 --> 01:22:28.081
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1979
01:22:28.081 --> 01:22:28.914
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we can say that state </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions were made based on </v>

1980
01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:32.550
<v Speaker 2>astrological readings</v>

1981
01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.330
<v Speaker 3>and it could've also been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1982
01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:38.140
<v Speaker 3>you always know someone who has a wacky </v>
<v Speaker 3>husband or a wacky wife,</v>

1983
01:22:38.141 --> 01:22:40.480
<v Speaker 3>that believability shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the person sort of like,</v>

1984
01:22:40.481 --> 01:22:42.820
<v Speaker 3>oh dear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you say?</v>

1985
01:22:42.821 --> 01:22:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll listen.</v>

1986
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.793
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I don't think president reaGan was </v>

1987
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:48.090
<v Speaker 2>paying much attention to it.</v>

1988
01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.580
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't paying much attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything towards the end,</v>

1989
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:51.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1990
01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:52.613
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this desire to uncover hidden </v>

1991
01:22:56.821 --> 01:23:00.180
<v Speaker 3>mysteries is always been really </v>
<v Speaker 3>confusing to me because,</v>

1992
01:23:00.181 --> 01:23:01.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself personally,</v>

1993
01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:05.030
<v Speaker 3>I've felt the pole like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especIally like aliens and ufo,</v>

1994
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:06.003
<v Speaker 3>like I went</v>

1995
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:06.701
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

1996
01:23:06.701 --> 01:23:07.930
<v Speaker 2>deep into like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1997
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.280
<v Speaker 2>when I was real young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1998
01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:15.000
<v Speaker 2>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut into the roswell thing and uh,</v>

1999
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.863
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of different connections </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the roswell conspiracy about this </v>

2000
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:24.870
<v Speaker 2>crashed ufo in New Mexico in 1947 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the eye witness reports and boy,</v>

2001
01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:26.733
<v Speaker 2>you go down the rabbit hole of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and you could waste years of your </v>

2002
01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:29.621
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2003
01:23:29.621 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 2>there was a study done In a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a ufo report.</v>

2004
01:23:33.221 --> 01:23:34.054
<v Speaker 2>Then in the late fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 59 on the 500 most </v>

2005
01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:41.380
<v Speaker 2>important ufo cases of the last 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2006
01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Roswell wasn't even on the list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how is it not on the list?</v>

2007
01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Roswell didn't become roswell until 1980</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there was a made for tv movie.</v>

2008
01:23:49.451 --> 01:23:54.451
<v Speaker 2>And then charles berlitz that language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a book publisher,</v>

2009
01:23:55.211 --> 01:23:57.130
<v Speaker 2>he got into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got me those fucks,</v>

2010
01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.930
<v Speaker 2>those books going after van donican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chariots of the gods,</v>

2011
01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:01.780
<v Speaker 2>that bestseller.</v>

2012
01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Then book started pouring out about </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens and ufo.</v>

2013
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:05.623
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember when the chariots of the gods </v>

2014
01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:09.580
<v Speaker 2>of the film was released in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theaters.</v>

2015
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I remember leonard nimoy and search.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2016
01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:15.060
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conjecture and was,</v>

2017
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 2>was a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved that,</v>

2018
01:24:17.021 --> 01:24:18.820
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

2019
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:21.100
<v Speaker 2>that got me in a big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's an example of,</v>

2020
01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:22.900
<v Speaker 2>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2021
01:24:22.901 --> 01:24:25.320
<v Speaker 2>how the popular media drives a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

2022
01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:27.970
<v Speaker 2>What do we really know back then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

2023
01:24:27.971 --> 01:24:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a couple of little anomalous</v>

2024
01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:31.420
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's an example,</v>

2025
01:24:31.421 --> 01:24:32.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>

2026
01:24:32.141 --> 01:24:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the government lied when they said it</v>

2027
01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:35.530
<v Speaker 2>was a weather balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2028
01:24:35.531 --> 01:24:37.900
<v Speaker 2>They did your surprise that governments </v>
<v Speaker 2>lie really?</v>

2029
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Because of course it was an national,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

2030
01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:40.983
<v Speaker 2>it was a high altitude surveillance </v>
<v Speaker 2>balloon listening for the acoustic </v>

2031
01:24:44.441 --> 01:24:47.380
<v Speaker 2>signatures of a nuclear explosion in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>upper atmosphere,</v>

2032
01:24:47.381 --> 01:24:48.214
<v Speaker 2>but it's soviet.</v>

2033
01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:50.640
<v Speaker 2>So of course when this debris came down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2034
01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:54.310
<v Speaker 2>the farmer's field there outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>albuquerque have a roswell,</v>

2035
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.593
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they're not going to come out </v>

2036
01:24:56.621 --> 01:24:57.590
<v Speaker 2>and hold a press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go,</v>

2037
01:24:57.591 --> 01:24:58.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

2038
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Actually what we are doing is launching </v>
<v Speaker 2>this project to listen to soviet.</v>

2039
01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:07.330
<v Speaker 2>It was suspicious too when something </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes not just a story,</v>

2040
01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:08.164
<v Speaker 2>but it also becomes business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And roswell became a giant business so </v>

2041
01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:12.610
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much later.</v>

2042
01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:13.421
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2043
01:25:13.421 --> 01:25:14.254
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a bunch of sightings in the </v>

2044
01:25:15.881 --> 01:25:18.540
<v Speaker 2>forties and fifties and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2045
01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but that's around the time that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a lot of experimental aircraft,</v>

2046
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.940
<v Speaker 2>horse and so whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anybody says,</v>

2047
01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.793
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this triangular shaped black </v>

2048
01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:27.820
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you near an air force base?</v>

2049
01:25:27.821 --> 01:25:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Have you looked at pictures of the b two</v>
<v Speaker 2>bomber,</v>

2050
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:33.850
<v Speaker 2>the stealth bomber?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of a delta shaped wing shaped.</v>

2051
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:35.183
<v Speaker 2>And when it flies right over the rose </v>
<v Speaker 2>parade every January 1st comes right </v>

2052
01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:41.380
<v Speaker 2>over my house and altadena circles right</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes at you,</v>

2053
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:42.483
<v Speaker 2>it's silent and it's this weird black </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they painted that black paint </v>

2054
01:25:45.731 --> 01:25:46.564
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't reflect and if you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about it and you're out in the </v>

2055
01:25:48.881 --> 01:25:53.590
<v Speaker 2>desert and it's dusk and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big kind of spooky.</v>

2056
01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:58.591
<v Speaker 2>Like what I saw one when I was a film </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fear factor in 2002.</v>

2057
01:25:59.261 --> 01:26:01.480
<v Speaker 2>So it was right after september 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not far,</v>

2058
01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 2>not long afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were filming out there</v>

2059
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:09.850
<v Speaker 1>in a way out in the desert area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palm dale,</v>

2060
01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:11.503
<v Speaker 1>I guess it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2061
01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:12.523
<v Speaker 1>And it's real close to the air force </v>
<v Speaker 1>base and we saw a stealth bomber flying </v>

2062
01:26:16.761 --> 01:26:18.850
<v Speaker 1>over and it looks like an alien space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2063
01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.050
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing when you see one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2064
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:21.884
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you didn't know and you had </v>

2065
01:26:23.991 --> 01:26:25.910
<v Speaker 1>never heard one of those before and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked up in the sky,</v>

2066
01:26:25.911 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 1>you'd be sure that that came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another planet.</v>

2067
01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:29.533
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's right out of star </v>

2068
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:34.160
<v Speaker 1>wars in the eighties and nineties there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were ufo sightings in America.</v>

2069
01:26:34.161 --> 01:26:36.530
<v Speaker 1>And the ufo is looked strangely like </v>
<v Speaker 1>blimps.</v>

2070
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:38.210
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2071
01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:39.043
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of thing people see </v>

2072
01:26:40.251 --> 01:26:41.300
<v Speaker 1>weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2073
01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.630
<v Speaker 1>the propensity is not to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw an anomaly.</v>

2074
01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2075
01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.240
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And leave it at that.</v>

2076
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Our mind immediately goes back to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

2077
01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:51.590
<v Speaker 1>We love the mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's concoct this whole thing.</v>

2078
01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:52.503
<v Speaker 1>The martians are coming and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens and there's a whole nother </v>

2079
01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:57.080
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2080
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:58.020
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2081
01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:58.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2082
01:26:59.000 --> 01:26:59.833
<v Speaker 1>there's this anomalous star kic with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of numbers that dims about 20 </v>

2083
01:27:04.161 --> 01:27:06.890
<v Speaker 1>percent every period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>

2084
01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.770
<v Speaker 1>It's about 1400 light years away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2085
01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the astronomers study in this </v>

2086
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.131
<v Speaker 1>decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2087
01:27:13.131 --> 01:27:15.770
<v Speaker 1>it's not planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not comments coming around in front</v>

2088
01:27:15.771 --> 01:27:18.170
<v Speaker 1>of us that dims the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2089
01:27:18.190 --> 01:27:20.060
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so immediately people go to.</v>

2090
01:27:20.061 --> 01:27:20.894
<v Speaker 1>It's a dyson sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gigantic solar collecting array </v>

2091
01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.200
<v Speaker 1>that circles around the planet that </v>
<v Speaker 1>collects energy from the sun.</v>

2092
01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a recent story.</v>

2093
01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2094
01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:33.080
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some radio shows,</v>

2095
01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:34.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>locally about this.</v>

2096
01:27:34.881 --> 01:27:36.940
<v Speaker 1>And immediately the host go to will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2097
01:27:36.941 --> 01:27:38.430
<v Speaker 1>whAt do they like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2098
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 1>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who like the aliens?</v>

2099
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2100
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:41.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2101
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:44.780
<v Speaker 1>All of this we have is just an anomaly </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the light,</v>

2102
01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:47.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signature of this start.</v>

2103
01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:48.360
<v Speaker 1>That's all we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have.</v>

2104
01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:50.780
<v Speaker 1>The Problem also with social media is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes click bait.</v>

2105
01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:51.673
<v Speaker 1>It becomes someone writes a blog or </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone has a thing and there's a video </v>

2106
01:27:54.381 --> 01:27:55.214
<v Speaker 1>that's linked to it and then everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts sending that out to their </v>

2107
01:27:57.561 --> 01:27:59.390
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before you know it,</v>

2108
01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that becomes the narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2109
01:28:00.801 --> 01:28:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2110
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Found some sort of a gigantic satellite </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's orbiting.</v>

2111
01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's like a death star that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading this planet,</v>

2112
01:28:07.251 --> 01:28:08.900
<v Speaker 1>it dims it because it comes into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2113
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:10.800
<v Speaker 1>between us and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2114
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:11.833
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff is very confusing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people because you don't have </v>

2115
01:28:13.941 --> 01:28:16.280
<v Speaker 1>enough time to really research it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2116
01:28:16.281 --> 01:28:17.114
<v Speaker 1>That's why something like what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like skeptic magazine or the entire </v>

2117
01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:22.940
<v Speaker 1>skeptic community is a great resource </v>
<v Speaker 1>and snopes,</v>

2118
01:28:22.941 --> 01:28:23.774
<v Speaker 1>snopes.com.</v>

2119
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Snopes is fantastic where it breaks down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and goes,</v>

2120
01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:27.344
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we absolutely know for a </v>

2121
01:28:29.751 --> 01:28:31.310
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at that.</v>

2122
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2123
01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just always hard to remember that.</v>

2124
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I've always been so confused as to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is about what I mean.</v>

2125
01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I've known grown adults that have spent </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and years with real life,</v>

2126
01:28:46.551 --> 01:28:50.180
<v Speaker 1>like fascinated with big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2127
01:28:50.181 --> 01:28:54.300
<v Speaker 1>fascinated with ufo is fascinated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these mysteries and you,</v>

2128
01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:57.530
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the amount of resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

2129
01:28:57.830 --> 01:29:00.530
<v Speaker 1>they actually expand chasing after these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and say,</v>

2130
01:29:00.531 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 1>well if you that into like something</v>

2131
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.310
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something constructed a,</v>

2132
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:05.820
<v Speaker 2>my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2133
01:29:05.821 --> 01:29:06.540
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

2134
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:07.373
<v Speaker 2>you would do so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I often see that thing about like </v>

2135
01:29:09.571 --> 01:29:11.920
<v Speaker 2>certain scammers and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my god,</v>

2136
01:29:11.921 --> 01:29:14.940
<v Speaker 2>if these people just started a business </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the same amount of enthusiasm,</v>

2137
01:29:14.941 --> 01:29:16.470
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good would they be doing?</v>

2138
01:29:16.471 --> 01:29:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2139
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:18.790
<v Speaker 2>those guys running the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2140
01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet scams and stuff,</v>

2141
01:29:20.761 --> 01:29:22.860
<v Speaker 2>what if they just did a legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

2142
01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:26.160
<v Speaker 2>they'd probably make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about mysteries?</v>

2143
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.230
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the real important things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I wanted to talk to you about.</v>

2144
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.073
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the appeals of the ufo </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens thing is it's kind of a secular </v>

2145
01:29:34.681 --> 01:29:35.514
<v Speaker 2>religion because they're often portrayed</v>
<v Speaker 2>as god like figures and if you don't </v>

2146
01:29:38.611 --> 01:29:41.310
<v Speaker 2>believe in the traditional god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that is kind of,</v>

2147
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:43.500
<v Speaker 2>they're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very powerful.</v>

2148
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:46.100
<v Speaker 2>They know about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're coming to rescue us,</v>

2149
01:29:46.101 --> 01:29:46.830
<v Speaker 2>save us.</v>

2150
01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:49.760
<v Speaker 2>So much of science fiction is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2151
01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:51.890
<v Speaker 2>has these kinds of themes to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2152
01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:54.990
<v Speaker 2>like the day the earth stood still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that classic 1951 film,</v>

2153
01:29:55.530 --> 01:29:56.363
<v Speaker 2>michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randy as klaatu and the ship comes to </v>

2154
01:29:58.861 --> 01:30:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Washington dc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a christ allegory that he's come to</v>

2155
01:30:02.941 --> 01:30:04.320
<v Speaker 2>talk to the authorities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2156
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:07.590
<v Speaker 2>humans are sending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to stop this,</v>

2157
01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:08.453
<v Speaker 2>this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nuclear war and the remake with </v>

2158
01:30:09.361 --> 01:30:10.194
<v Speaker 2>keanu reeves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was global warming and the </v>

2159
01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:13.213
<v Speaker 2>authorities want to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he mingles among the common people </v>

2160
01:30:14.821 --> 01:30:15.654
<v Speaker 2>like jesus did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he takes up with the Patricia </v>

2161
01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Neal character who's the single mom in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the town and uh,</v>

2162
01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:23.953
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he's killed by the authorities </v>

2163
01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:27.810
<v Speaker 2>and he's putting the more you put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this morgue,</v>

2164
01:30:27.811 --> 01:30:28.644
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of like the tomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in that famous scene where </v>

2165
01:30:31.111 --> 01:30:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Patricia Neal goes to the robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's standing there and the pfizer comes</v>

2166
01:30:35.161 --> 01:30:38.380
<v Speaker 2>up and he's going to zapper and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives him the famous message,</v>

2167
01:30:38.381 --> 01:30:40.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gore cloud to burrata,</v>

2168
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.090
<v Speaker 2>nick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically says,</v>

2169
01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.310
<v Speaker 2>go get clapped.</v>

2170
01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.150
<v Speaker 2>At least he's in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in the tomb.</v>

2171
01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:46.333
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he marches over to the tomb and burns a </v>

2172
01:30:48.241 --> 01:30:49.650
<v Speaker 2>hole in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes the body,</v>

2173
01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:52.070
<v Speaker 2>returns it to the ship and resurrection </v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

2174
01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2175
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:56.670
<v Speaker 2>it's his name in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the movie was Mr.</v>

2176
01:30:56.670 --> 01:30:57.503
<v Speaker 2>Carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earthly name mr carmen are interested </v>

2177
01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:01.110
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the original script,</v>

2178
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:02.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2179
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:04.080
<v Speaker 2>we're in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

2180
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.170
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible.</v>

2181
01:31:05.171 --> 01:31:07.680
<v Speaker 2>You mean this is the power of science </v>
<v Speaker 2>and technology in the future,</v>

2182
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:09.030
<v Speaker 2>and the original script,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

2183
01:31:09.031 --> 01:31:10.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where it's gone,</v>

2184
01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:14.680
<v Speaker 2>but the brain censorship board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1951 said you can't say that,</v>

2185
01:31:14.710 --> 01:31:16.530
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>americans will be offended by this.</v>

2186
01:31:16.531 --> 01:31:19.260
<v Speaker 2>So they changed the line and now he says</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

2187
01:31:19.261 --> 01:31:19.980
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2188
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.110
<v Speaker 2>no one has the power over life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

2189
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Only the great spirit can determine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2190
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:27.590
<v Speaker 2>was just some bologna line and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2191
01:31:27.591 --> 01:31:28.910
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so much of,</v>

2192
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:32.490
<v Speaker 2>of the way we talk about aliens is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>

2193
01:31:32.491 --> 01:31:35.280
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call them deities are atheists,</v>

2194
01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:38.250
<v Speaker 2>they're like gods and the chariots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gods.</v>

2195
01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's kind of that thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not so far fetched in the sense</v>

2196
01:31:42.421 --> 01:31:45.180
<v Speaker 2>that if not that they've come here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably haven't come here,</v>

2197
01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:48.240
<v Speaker 2>but if they're out there and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably are,</v>

2198
01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:49.553
<v Speaker 2>there's good reasons to think there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraterrestrials and if we encountered </v>

2199
01:31:52.371 --> 01:31:53.204
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be behind us </v>

2200
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:57.450
<v Speaker 2>technologically because we wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter them otherwise.</v>

2201
01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:02.780
<v Speaker 2>So if we do find a signal or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be from an advance how far</v>

2202
01:32:02.801 --> 01:32:05.500
<v Speaker 2>advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the chances of them being in parallel</v>

2203
01:32:05.501 --> 01:32:08.770
<v Speaker 2>with us on an evolutionary timescale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually zero,</v>

2204
01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.673
<v Speaker 2>you know they're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they're out of sync by just a </v>

2205
01:32:10.991 --> 01:32:13.360
<v Speaker 2>little bit from when they started on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their planet evolving,</v>

2206
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:15.790
<v Speaker 2>it would be millions of years in </v>
<v Speaker 2>advance.</v>

2207
01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:16.803
<v Speaker 2>And look what we've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplish just in say a hundred years </v>

2208
01:32:19.091 --> 01:32:22.510
<v Speaker 2>of of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years of computer technical.</v>

2209
01:32:22.511 --> 01:32:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Why would it have to be millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years in advanced?</v>

2210
01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't it just be 100 or 100 years in </v>
<v Speaker 2>advance of us?</v>

2211
01:32:27.371 --> 01:32:30.520
<v Speaker 2>If we're thinking about colonizing mars </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next few decades,</v>

2212
01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:31.573
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get some sort of an advanced </v>

2213
01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:33.874
<v Speaker 2>civilization that has less conflict in </v>
<v Speaker 2>us because of how long it takes to get </v>

2214
01:32:37.121 --> 01:32:37.954
<v Speaker 2>from bacterial grade life to an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent communicating like probably </v>

2215
01:32:41.351 --> 01:32:43.690
<v Speaker 2>three and a half billion years is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>long it took here.</v>

2216
01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.690
<v Speaker 2>So wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever your plant it starts,</v>

2217
01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.553
<v Speaker 2>the chances of it going to be in perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>synchrony of every step along the way </v>

2218
01:32:50.471 --> 01:32:54.010
<v Speaker 2>from bacterial grade life to big brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>

2219
01:32:54.011 --> 01:32:57.460
<v Speaker 2>it's probably going to be millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of difference in timescale,</v>

2220
01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:58.953
<v Speaker 2>just just on the biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just randomly meet even to get to </v>

2221
01:33:01.931 --> 01:33:05.650
<v Speaker 2>where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be a million plus or minus just</v>

2222
01:33:05.651 --> 01:33:06.484
<v Speaker 2>to reach this level correct where we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>reached just whatever billion years it </v>

2223
01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:12.970
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have to be.</v>

2224
01:33:12.971 --> 01:33:13.610
<v Speaker 2>That number.</v>

2225
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:14.443
<v Speaker 2>Could have been much longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have been shorter or just started </v>

2226
01:33:16.421 --> 01:33:17.820
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started earlier.</v>

2227
01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:19.173
<v Speaker 2>We'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to deal with the impact that </v>

2228
01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:24.760
<v Speaker 2>killed the dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be all the random events that</v>

2229
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:25.990
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

2230
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.790
<v Speaker 2>they could be on a planet that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have any random events like that or it'd</v>

2231
01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.633
<v Speaker 2>be way ahead of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they could be on one that has a lot </v>

2232
01:33:32.261 --> 01:33:33.094
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the answer to the fermi paradox that </v>

2233
01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:35.553
<v Speaker 2>whereas everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they should have happened </v>

2234
01:33:36.341 --> 01:33:38.420
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably,</v>

2235
01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:39.363
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe timi with bacterial grade </v>

2236
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:41.854
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the number of steps to get from </v>

2237
01:33:43.961 --> 01:33:47.650
<v Speaker 2>there all the way to communicating </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological society is enormous.</v>

2238
01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:48.603
<v Speaker 2>And so that winnows down the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities you can get all the way </v>

2239
01:33:52.451 --> 01:33:54.490
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to neanderthals like here on earth,</v>

2240
01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:55.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're big brain,</v>

2241
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:58.600
<v Speaker 2>1500 ccs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the size of our brain maybe a little</v>

2242
01:33:58.660 --> 01:33:59.493
<v Speaker 2>bit larger.</v>

2243
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:00.720
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2244
01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:02.860
<v Speaker 2>they had fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had tools.</v>

2245
01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm at tesco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything but disco,</v>

2246
01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:09.363
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had europe to themselves are </v>

2247
01:34:10.721 --> 01:34:11.554
<v Speaker 2>about 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and there's no advancement in </v>

2248
01:34:13.211 --> 01:34:15.220
<v Speaker 2>their toolkits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all pretty much the same.</v>

2249
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:16.663
<v Speaker 2>They never had cave paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't look like they had symbolic </v>

2250
01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:19.954
<v Speaker 2>art like a homo sapiens did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe their brains were larger </v>

2251
01:34:22.811 --> 01:34:25.510
<v Speaker 2>though to deal with their larger bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2252
01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:30.010
<v Speaker 2>even when you correct for body size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theiR brains are slightly larger,</v>

2253
01:34:30.011 --> 01:34:30.844
<v Speaker 2>but only slightly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be the brain size may not make </v>

2254
01:34:32.621 --> 01:34:34.570
<v Speaker 2>any difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe brain modularity,</v>

2255
01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:37.480
<v Speaker 2>maybe they didn't have language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if they did,</v>

2256
01:34:37.481 --> 01:34:40.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe they didn't have communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolic language.</v>

2257
01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.690
<v Speaker 2>We don't know why they went extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when humans,</v>

2258
01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.800
<v Speaker 2>homo sapiens arrived in europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within a few tens of thousands of years,</v>

2259
01:34:47.801 --> 01:34:48.634
<v Speaker 2>there was no more a neanderthals gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went extinct and there's a big </v>

2260
01:34:51.941 --> 01:34:53.740
<v Speaker 2>debate paleoanthropology circles.</v>

2261
01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Why so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2262
01:34:55.410 --> 01:34:56.243
<v Speaker 2>but my point is thAt you could have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>three and a half billion years of </v>

2263
01:34:58.731 --> 01:35:02.360
<v Speaker 2>evolution on a planet and get all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to neanderthals who have stone tools</v>

2264
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:04.220
<v Speaker 2>and it just stops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For whatever reason,</v>

2265
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:06.590
<v Speaker 2>they never developed symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

2266
01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:08.900
<v Speaker 2>They have opposable thumbs so they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make stuff,</v>

2267
01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:11.630
<v Speaker 2>they can make tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they never make the next step.</v>

2268
01:35:11.850 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people disagree with that.</v>

2269
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:15.050
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2270
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:19.730
<v Speaker 2>they think that had a homo sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not dominated europe when they came in.</v>

2271
01:35:19.731 --> 01:35:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Neanderthals might have gotten there </v>
<v Speaker 2>within a few centuries more maybe,</v>

2272
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.620
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2273
01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:25.453
<v Speaker 2>we don't know that well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also the thought that even </v>

2274
01:35:26.451 --> 01:35:28.160
<v Speaker 2>though the unIverse is infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2275
01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:32.690
<v Speaker 2>that it had some sort of a beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you buy or don't buy,</v>

2276
01:35:32.691 --> 01:35:34.310
<v Speaker 2>that there's actually been some </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>

2277
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there some arguments recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

2278
01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:39.080
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the universe didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning or an end,</v>

2279
01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.520
<v Speaker 2>but that it's been an eternal.</v>

2280
01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:43.140
<v Speaker 2>That's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be eternally cycling there,</v>

2281
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:45.770
<v Speaker 2>there could be multiple big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was never.</v>

2282
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:46.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea could possibly be that if </v>

2283
01:35:50.781 --> 01:35:51.770
<v Speaker 2>that is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2284
01:35:51.771 --> 01:35:52.604
<v Speaker 2>So if you have an event and from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>event things become more and more </v>

2285
01:35:56.301 --> 01:35:58.010
<v Speaker 2>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start getting single cell life,</v>

2286
01:35:58.011 --> 01:35:59.810
<v Speaker 2>multicellular life like we have here on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

2287
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:05.060
<v Speaker 2>There has to be a first like us first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to.</v>

2288
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Somebody has to be first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe first.</v>

2289
01:36:06.951 --> 01:36:07.784
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2290
01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Like if I exist multigenerational our </v>
<v Speaker 2>stars.</v>

2291
01:36:11.091 --> 01:36:11.924
<v Speaker 2>And so there's been many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many generations of stars older than </v>

2292
01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:15.810
<v Speaker 2>ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the pheromone.</v>

2293
01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:16.873
<v Speaker 2>Where is everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there should have been somebody </v>

2294
01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:19.813
<v Speaker 2>made it for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you think about how complex </v>

2295
01:36:21.261 --> 01:36:23.510
<v Speaker 2>life is on earth and how many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>varieties of it,</v>

2296
01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:24.344
<v Speaker 2>and there's only one human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only one technologically </v>

2297
01:36:26.331 --> 01:36:29.750
<v Speaker 2>communicating species and where it so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so is it possible?</v>

2298
01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2299
01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:35.420
<v Speaker 2>You got to have a planet teaming with </v>
<v Speaker 2>life with dolphins and chimpanzees,</v>

2300
01:36:35.541 --> 01:36:39.590
<v Speaker 2>big brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they lots of puppies and they never,</v>

2301
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:40.990
<v Speaker 2>they never built it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2302
01:36:40.991 --> 01:36:42.410
<v Speaker 2>they no laptops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2303
01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is possible that we,</v>

2304
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.660
<v Speaker 2>since we exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is possible the,</v>

2305
01:36:47.661 --> 01:36:49.660
<v Speaker 2>we're the only ones that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2306
01:36:49.730 --> 01:36:51.620
<v Speaker 2>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible.</v>

2307
01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.020
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't know.</v>

2308
01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.033
<v Speaker 2>but that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The seti argument that search for </v>

2309
01:36:57.561 --> 01:36:59.030
<v Speaker 2>extraterrestrial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

2310
01:36:59.031 --> 01:37:02.060
<v Speaker 2>these aren't the ufo people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are their counter argument to that</v>

2311
01:37:02.061 --> 01:37:02.894
<v Speaker 2>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are so many planets now that </v>

2312
01:37:04.731 --> 01:37:05.564
<v Speaker 2>we know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually every star in the galaxy of </v>

2313
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:08.783
<v Speaker 2>100 billion stars has planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking hundreds and hundreds </v>

2314
01:37:11.991 --> 01:37:12.824
<v Speaker 2>of billions of planets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chances that it never happened </v>

2315
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:16.550
<v Speaker 2>anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2316
01:37:16.551 --> 01:37:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a small,</v>

2317
01:37:17.610 --> 01:37:19.670
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they probably out there somewhere,</v>

2318
01:37:19.671 --> 01:37:23.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's a vast empty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2319
01:37:23.241 --> 01:37:26.150
<v Speaker 2>cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that there's a lot that we know</v>

2320
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.510
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't have intelligent life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of plants,</v>

2321
01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:31.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have one planet that we know of,</v>

2322
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.850
<v Speaker 2>that as intelligent life at all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plants we've ever discovered.</v>

2323
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:37.610
<v Speaker 2>And obviously there's some that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered that are so far out there,</v>

2324
01:37:37.611 --> 01:37:40.490
<v Speaker 2>we only get glimpses of what their </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere contains.</v>

2325
01:37:40.670 --> 01:37:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next generation,</v>

2326
01:37:41.571 --> 01:37:42.170
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

2327
01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:44.030
<v Speaker 2>they'll be able to get the atmospheres,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2328
01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the webb space telescope will,</v>

2329
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm told they just getting it from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>light spectrum.</v>

2330
01:37:48.630 --> 01:37:50.810
<v Speaker 2>now in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the spectrum,</v>

2331
01:37:50.811 --> 01:37:52.550
<v Speaker 2>you could see if there's oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2332
01:37:52.551 --> 01:37:53.384
<v Speaker 2>in methane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they must have cows that are </v>

2333
01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.370
<v Speaker 2>forwarding methane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Methane,</v>

2334
01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 1>the british say to sound intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to use british.</v>

2335
01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:02.653
<v Speaker 1>You spelled tires with a y t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y r e s c u under the hitchens and </v>

2336
01:38:08.431 --> 01:38:10.490
<v Speaker 1>dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got that british accent.</v>

2337
01:38:10.491 --> 01:38:13.800
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super things and late night tv.</v>

2338
01:38:13.801 --> 01:38:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:16.861
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

2340
01:38:16.861 --> 01:38:18.480
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2341
01:38:18.481 --> 01:38:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked about us about the mystery.</v>

2342
01:38:20.281 --> 01:38:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2343
01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:24.720
<v Speaker 1>there's not quite sure why our brains go</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward that.</v>

2344
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure my dog has a good life,</v>

2345
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.150
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he contemplates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>

2346
01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Does dogs a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's time for food.</v>

2347
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.430
<v Speaker 1>When I was trying to get at though is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>

2348
01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:41.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing that we do where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just.</v>

2349
01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2350
01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:45.090
<v Speaker 1>there's the longing for extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrestrial life,</v>

2351
01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:47.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the search for the technological daddy,</v>

2352
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2353
01:38:47.941 --> 01:38:48.401
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2354
01:38:48.401 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 1>advanced alien daddy that's out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to show us the error of our</v>

2355
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:51.960
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

2356
01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.100
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that pole.</v>

2357
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.233
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also this weird poll </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we want to believe that these </v>

2358
01:38:57.841 --> 01:38:58.674
<v Speaker 1>intelligent beings from another planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>can recognize who our elected leaders </v>

2359
01:39:02.131 --> 01:39:02.964
<v Speaker 1>are and be In cahoots with them as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they give a shit about obama or </v>

2360
01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:07.861
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2361
01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:10.350
<v Speaker 1>if you like descended upon an ant </v>
<v Speaker 1>colony,</v>

2362
01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:13.200
<v Speaker 1>would you have a deal with the queen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2363
01:39:13.201 --> 01:39:14.034
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're the one who in charge of </v>

2364
01:39:15.811 --> 01:39:18.400
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll talk to you this election.</v>

2365
01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:23.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be super secretive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you are so moral and ethical,</v>

2366
01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't lie to your people at all.</v>

2367
01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:26.393
<v Speaker 1>I'm only gonna communicate with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in exchange for technological </v>

2368
01:39:29.761 --> 01:39:30.594
<v Speaker 1>secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like some dna like is so </v>

2369
01:39:32.491 --> 01:39:33.324
<v Speaker 1>preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid idea that they would come down </v>

2370
01:39:35.881 --> 01:39:38.040
<v Speaker 1>and they would talk to the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders,</v>

2371
01:39:38.250 --> 01:39:43.250
<v Speaker 1>especially military leaders from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1940 [inaudible] who knew almost nothing</v>

2372
01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:45.540
<v Speaker 1>about technology or this idea that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2373
01:39:45.541 --> 01:39:46.374
<v Speaker 1>at roswell know we capture when their </v>
<v Speaker 1>spacecraft and back engineered their </v>

2374
01:39:49.471 --> 01:39:52.410
<v Speaker 1>technology and that's where it's silicon</v>
<v Speaker 1>chips and computers came from.</v>

2375
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about the american computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>company?</v>

2376
01:39:55.110 --> 01:39:55.943
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever hear about these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a company called the american </v>

2377
01:39:57.931 --> 01:40:00.120
<v Speaker 1>computer company and this was back </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the,</v>

2378
01:40:00.121 --> 01:40:00.954
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>art bell days of a coast to coast with </v>

2379
01:40:03.601 --> 01:40:04.434
<v Speaker 1>heartfelt wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved coming home many that I've been </v>

2380
01:40:08.191 --> 01:40:09.024
<v Speaker 1>on it once to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the one of the highlights of my </v>

2381
01:40:10.141 --> 01:40:10.974
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was recently when he came back on the </v>

2382
01:40:12.391 --> 01:40:13.224
<v Speaker 1>radio or internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was driving home from the comedy </v>

2383
01:40:15.391 --> 01:40:16.650
<v Speaker 1>store one night and they had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2384
01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:21.090
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about this american </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer company and this guy that rents</v>

2385
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.800
<v Speaker 1>american computer company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

2386
01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:28.630
<v Speaker 1>he's out of his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he apparently he had this theory and</v>

2387
01:40:29.281 --> 01:40:32.280
<v Speaker 1>this whole website dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's up anymore,</v>

2388
01:40:32.281 --> 01:40:33.114
<v Speaker 1>they might have taken it down with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is dedicated to showing the timeline of </v>

2389
01:40:36.181 --> 01:40:40.140
<v Speaker 1>the creation of the transistor and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this came out of bell labs,</v>

2390
01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:41.123
<v Speaker 1>which is where they had the air force </v>
<v Speaker 1>base outside of bell labs to protect it </v>

2391
01:40:45.631 --> 01:40:48.540
<v Speaker 1>from alien invasion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2392
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:51.510
<v Speaker 1>And that this is where all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology came from.</v>

2393
01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>The we're supposed to Believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens were</v>

2394
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.843
<v Speaker 2>only about five to 10 years more </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced than us from vacuum tubes to </v>

2395
01:40:58.781 --> 01:41:02.080
<v Speaker 2>the silicon transistors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2396
01:41:02.081 --> 01:41:04.610
<v Speaker 2>really that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fiber optics.</v>

2397
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.823
<v Speaker 2>They managed to traverse the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>instance of interstellar space with </v>

2398
01:41:08.471 --> 01:41:09.304
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just barely better than vacuum tubes </v>

2399
01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.280
<v Speaker 2>with agera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pay attention to that.</v>

2400
01:41:12.281 --> 01:41:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Robert lasar guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

2401
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bizarre ones.</v>

2402
01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:17.800
<v Speaker 2>He's a bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds so good.</v>

2403
01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:20.030
<v Speaker 2>I think there are some people that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>make stuff up.</v>

2404
01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:23.170
<v Speaker 2>He's so good at it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also smart,</v>

2405
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.200
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking really scary because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy came up with a hydrogen powered</v>

2406
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:30.610
<v Speaker 2>engine for his corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2407
01:41:30.611 --> 01:41:31.930
<v Speaker 2>which people have done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2408
01:41:31.931 --> 01:41:32.764
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people are developing hydrogen </v>

2409
01:41:34.931 --> 01:41:38.800
<v Speaker 2>power plants for cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had this like decades ago.</v>

2410
01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:40.980
<v Speaker 2>So he's obviously a very smart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>

2411
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.823
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2412
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:44.220
<v Speaker 2>doesn't protect you from believing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird things.</v>

2413
01:41:44.221 --> 01:41:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that bizarre?</v>

2414
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:46.900
<v Speaker 2>They are not just believing in weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2415
01:41:46.901 --> 01:41:48.160
<v Speaker 2>but bullshitting ps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2416
01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2417
01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Well then somebody who's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>educated is going to be better at,</v>

2418
01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.750
<v Speaker 2>at bullshitting people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2419
01:41:52.751 --> 01:41:55.150
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bullshitted people about is education</v>

2420
01:41:55.151 --> 01:41:56.980
<v Speaker 2>too though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was part of the problem.</v>

2421
01:41:56.981 --> 01:41:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I think some people went back and looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>through his education,</v>

2422
01:41:59.710 --> 01:42:00.071
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2423
01:42:00.071 --> 01:42:01.930
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence that you ever went </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the school.</v>

2424
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.410
<v Speaker 2>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that through some monkey wrenches into.</v>

2425
01:42:05.630 --> 01:42:06.463
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty one guys were saying worked at </v>

2426
01:42:08.081 --> 01:42:08.970
<v Speaker 2>area 51.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2427
01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>area 51 is a top secret.</v>

2428
01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:14.960
<v Speaker 2>A military base or they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2429
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:16.630
<v Speaker 2>you and I aren't gonna be able to drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2430
01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Go wherever we're doing a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to blow the lid off these crazy.</v>

2431
01:42:18.930 --> 01:42:20.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still not coming in here.</v>

2432
01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:21.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2433
01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.870
<v Speaker 2>So what are you hiding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2434
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:23.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there,</v>

2435
01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:24.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be interesting to know now that we </v>

2436
01:42:25.781 --> 01:42:26.614
<v Speaker 2>know about the b two stealth bomber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing now that we won't </v>

2437
01:42:29.471 --> 01:42:30.304
<v Speaker 2>find out for 20 more years that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are seeing out in the desert in the </v>

2438
01:42:32.651 --> 01:42:33.370
<v Speaker 2>middle of the night?</v>

2439
01:42:33.370 --> 01:42:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I saw this spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

2440
01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it works.</v>

2441
01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:40.240
<v Speaker 2>We find out eventually in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>

2442
01:42:40.241 --> 01:42:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing.</v>

2443
01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:42.311
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

2444
01:42:42.311 --> 01:42:42.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2445
01:42:42.850 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 2>the oddest part about it is this belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're in,</v>

2446
01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.550
<v Speaker 2>in conspiracy with our elected leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2447
01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:49.453
<v Speaker 2>that one to me has been so strange that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they will land somewhere and they have </v>

2448
01:42:52.901 --> 01:42:57.450
<v Speaker 2>these meetings and these elected leaders</v>
<v Speaker 2>make deals with the ufo.</v>

2449
01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.890
<v Speaker 2>How amazing would that be though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that was true courage?</v>

2450
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:04.360
<v Speaker 2>They're reptilians are running the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country from New Mexico.</v>

2451
01:43:06.250 --> 01:43:10.980
<v Speaker 2>people love this idea of blowing the lid</v>
<v Speaker 2>off of it.</v>

2452
01:43:10.990 --> 01:43:13.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that people love.</v>

2453
01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:14.193
<v Speaker 2>They love investigating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love the investigative journalism </v>

2454
01:43:17.681 --> 01:43:21.280
<v Speaker 2>aspect of blowing the lid off this </v>
<v Speaker 2>global conspiracy.</v>

2455
01:43:21.730 --> 01:43:22.563
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what drives some of the </v>

2456
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:28.250
<v Speaker 2>kind of anti medical establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti big pharma anti-vaccination,</v>

2457
01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:29.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys,</v>

2458
01:43:29.261 --> 01:43:31.690
<v Speaker 2>they're behind closed or the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful people,</v>

2459
01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:36.720
<v Speaker 2>cOrporations and government agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cdc and this company and the ceo and</v>

2460
01:43:37.271 --> 01:43:37.790
<v Speaker 2>the politic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2461
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:40.090
<v Speaker 2>they're all and they want to make money </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2462
01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:40.963
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

2463
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.823
<v Speaker 2>they first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they're more powerful than </v>

2464
01:43:43.091 --> 01:43:43.924
<v Speaker 2>they really are.</v>

2465
01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.300
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not how the world works.</v>

2466
01:43:46.301 --> 01:43:47.134
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are not tryinG to keep us </v>

2467
01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:51.100
<v Speaker 2>poisoned or keep us sick so they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make money.</v>

2468
01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

2469
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.960
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the real conspiracies are,</v>

2470
01:43:53.961 --> 01:43:55.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we can't get our drugs cheaper?</v>

2471
01:43:56.050 --> 01:43:56.571
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2472
01:43:56.571 --> 01:43:57.330
<v Speaker 1>those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2473
01:43:57.330 --> 01:44:00.170
<v Speaker 1>what sort of behind the door deals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being done.</v>

2474
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:01.371
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2475
01:44:01.371 --> 01:44:03.290
<v Speaker 1>that prevent healthcare from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper.</v>

2476
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:05.570
<v Speaker 1>That's where the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real conspiracy.</v>

2477
01:44:05.571 --> 01:44:06.404
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to tell me they already have a </v>

2478
01:44:07.731 --> 01:44:08.564
<v Speaker 1>cure for cancer or they just don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to have the cure because then </v>

2479
01:44:11.331 --> 01:44:13.010
<v Speaker 1>they'll know the money's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment.</v>

2480
01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I gO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think the same person has the</v>

2481
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:16.814
<v Speaker 1>cure as the the same people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling the treatment really think </v>

2482
01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:21.970
<v Speaker 1>they're the same person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2483
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any people work in the field</v>
<v Speaker 1>of creating new medicine?</v>

2484
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:26.923
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so ridiculous that it would be </v>

2485
01:44:27.630 --> 01:44:28.463
<v Speaker 1>the one person of the tens of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of employees at amgen or wherever is </v>

2486
01:44:32.001 --> 01:44:32.420
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2487
01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:33.460
<v Speaker 1>leave and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2488
01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I found something out and I'm coming on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your show to tell you I took pictures.</v>

2489
01:44:37.190 --> 01:44:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Here's was not one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2490
01:44:38.991 --> 01:44:42.140
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't make any sense that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the same person.</v>

2491
01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:45.200
<v Speaker 1>The odds of it being the same person or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same company,</v>

2492
01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.353
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different people that </v>

2493
01:44:47.181 --> 01:44:49.850
<v Speaker 1>work in the pharmaceutical industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many different people that are trying</v>

2494
01:44:49.851 --> 01:44:50.684
<v Speaker 1>to do research on new medications and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much money involved in it </v>

2495
01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:55.793
<v Speaker 1>that there's one company would come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a cure and they would like to keep </v>

2496
01:44:58.491 --> 01:44:59.324
<v Speaker 1>it under wraps because they are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cahoots with the other company that's </v>

2497
01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:03.620
<v Speaker 1>got the treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2498
01:45:03.621 --> 01:45:04.251
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2499
01:45:04.251 --> 01:45:07.670
<v Speaker 1>if this were true then then all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were sick from polio and all</v>

2500
01:45:07.671 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 1>the Businesses and companies that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>making money from polio patients,</v>

2501
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:13.520
<v Speaker 1>how come they didn't stop the polio </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccine?</v>

2502
01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>

2503
01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:16.220
<v Speaker 1>just pick any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2504
01:45:16.221 --> 01:45:17.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any particular industry like that where </v>

2505
01:45:18.591 --> 01:45:19.940
<v Speaker 1>we have made real progress.</v>

2506
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:22.490
<v Speaker 1>but then there are some things where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2507
01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:23.413
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely too many people that </v>

2508
01:45:26.271 --> 01:45:28.270
<v Speaker 1>are getting prescribed pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2509
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:30.710
<v Speaker 1>What is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is the conspiracy that I've,</v>

2510
01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:31.573
<v Speaker 1>I've had conversations with people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to doctors now they have something </v>

2511
01:45:34.821 --> 01:45:36.650
<v Speaker 1>wrong with them and the doctor wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribe them.</v>

2512
01:45:36.651 --> 01:45:37.484
<v Speaker 1>I had a fucking nose operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a deviated septum repaired and my </v>

2513
01:45:40.521 --> 01:45:43.790
<v Speaker 1>doctor gave me not one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but two different opiates to take.</v>

2514
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

2515
01:45:45.210 --> 01:45:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2516
01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.840
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be in pain.</v>

2517
01:45:47.841 --> 01:45:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you man,</v>

2518
01:45:48.850 --> 01:45:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's barely uncomfortable.</v>

2519
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so again,</v>

2520
01:45:51.861 --> 01:45:53.630
<v Speaker 1>we know how some of this works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2521
01:45:53.631 --> 01:45:54.464
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drug companies take the doctors out </v>

2522
01:45:55.731 --> 01:45:58.160
<v Speaker 1>on their golfing trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give them free samples and this and</v>

2523
01:45:58.161 --> 01:45:58.551
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2524
01:45:58.551 --> 01:46:03.050
<v Speaker 1>my wife's mom was a nurse and they used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take them out to dinner.</v>

2525
01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:06.620
<v Speaker 1>These pharmaceutical reps would talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they want.</v>

2526
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:08.990
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2527
01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:11.540
<v Speaker 1>we want you to tell these people to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>our drugs.</v>

2528
01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:12.673
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became friendly and they did nice </v>

2529
01:46:14.781 --> 01:46:15.614
<v Speaker 1>things to them and it was almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood that in exchange you would </v>

2530
01:46:18.771 --> 01:46:23.170
<v Speaker 1>talk well about their drug or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle of reciprocity for you.</v>

2531
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Now you owe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to say it.</v>

2532
01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:27.080
<v Speaker 1>They wanted those trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want.</v>

2533
01:46:27.110 --> 01:46:29.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's interesting.</v>

2534
01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:33.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to say it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're making money and that's,</v>

2535
01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:34.710
<v Speaker 1>that's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2536
01:46:34.711 --> 01:46:35.544
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sheer volume of pain pills that </v>

2537
01:46:37.821 --> 01:46:40.310
<v Speaker 1>they've sold in this country since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties.</v>

2538
01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:43.880
<v Speaker 1>It's stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also I saw this when my,</v>

2539
01:46:43.881 --> 01:46:45.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my step dad was ill for,</v>

2540
01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.753
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 10 years of just going through </v>

2541
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 1>in his eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just melting down one thing after</v>

2542
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.680
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was the one taking them around all</v>

2543
01:46:52.681 --> 01:46:55.460
<v Speaker 2>the different docs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could sort of see how it works.</v>

2544
01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:55.951
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2545
01:46:55.951 --> 01:46:57.810
<v Speaker 2>the dogs go look a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2546
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:59.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2547
01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.750
<v Speaker 2>can you give me something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in pain right?</v>

2548
01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Well doc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

2549
01:47:04.591 --> 01:47:06.090
<v Speaker 2>I just drove down here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right here,</v>

2550
01:47:06.330 --> 01:47:07.520
<v Speaker 2>take this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

2551
01:47:07.670 --> 01:47:09.870
<v Speaker 2>So they kind of feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I got to do something.</v>

2552
01:47:09.871 --> 01:47:12.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do,</v>

2553
01:47:12.181 --> 01:47:13.290
<v Speaker 2>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's asking me,</v>

2554
01:47:13.291 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give him some painkillers.</v>

2555
01:47:14.611 --> 01:47:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll give him this or that makes it feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2556
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:17.670
<v Speaker 2>And my dad would take it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2557
01:47:17.671 --> 01:47:20.220
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly that.</v>

2558
01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:22.920
<v Speaker 2>There's also certainly incompetent </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors.</v>

2559
01:47:23.130 --> 01:47:23.963
<v Speaker 2>There's doctors that are really willing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to prescribe ssri antidepressants like </v>

2560
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:31.140
<v Speaker 2>with alarming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2561
01:47:31.141 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Consistency.</v>

2562
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:32.783
<v Speaker 2>So there you have the medicalization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what are really probably just social </v>

2563
01:47:35.611 --> 01:47:38.160
<v Speaker 2>behavioral issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2564
01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:39.473
<v Speaker 2>when we were kids in school and a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>johnny was super active and had high </v>

2565
01:47:42.661 --> 01:47:43.920
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2566
01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:44.843
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now he's a great athlete or he's </v>

2567
01:47:46.201 --> 01:47:48.420
<v Speaker 2>doing this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now he's like,</v>

2568
01:47:48.421 --> 01:47:49.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with him?</v>

2569
01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he has this medical pro.</v>

2570
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a d,</v>

2571
01:47:53.041 --> 01:47:53.640
<v Speaker 2>h,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d.</v>

2572
01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.473
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2573
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:55.141
<v Speaker 2>that's a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2574
01:47:55.141 --> 01:47:56.490
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a medical issue.</v>

2575
01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:57.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2576
01:47:57.901 --> 01:47:59.060
<v Speaker 2>what can we give them for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2577
01:47:59.061 --> 01:48:00.140
<v Speaker 2>we'll give them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2578
01:48:00.141 --> 01:48:02.640
<v Speaker 2>these drugs here and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all of a sudden,</v>

2579
01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:03.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hyperactive little kid who's just </v>

2580
01:48:05.161 --> 01:48:09.180
<v Speaker 2>kind of fun and maybe a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>disruptive is now medicalized.</v>

2581
01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:10.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2582
01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.120
<v Speaker 2>the autism spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2583
01:48:12.121 --> 01:48:12.840
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2584
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:14.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase in vaccinations.</v>

2585
01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.710
<v Speaker 2>There's been an increase in autism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

2586
01:48:16.711 --> 01:48:19.800
<v Speaker 2>The category got larger and it became </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicalized,</v>

2587
01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:20.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

2588
01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:21.633
<v Speaker 2>So there's no increase in autism cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the increase in the diagnoses of </v>

2589
01:48:25.261 --> 01:48:26.094
<v Speaker 2>them at a more people paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it and be the categories much bigger </v>

2590
01:48:30.181 --> 01:48:33.090
<v Speaker 2>than it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it's called a spectrum.</v>

2591
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:34.103
<v Speaker 2>So when people make the correlation </v>
<v Speaker 2>between that and the increase in the </v>

2592
01:48:36.841 --> 01:48:39.570
<v Speaker 2>amount of vaccinations to children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a false correlation.</v>

2593
01:48:39.571 --> 01:48:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says it's not true that the,</v>

2594
01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.790
<v Speaker 2>that autism rates have gone up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that in the,</v>

2595
01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:48.300
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties it's suddenly started </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming a thing,</v>

2596
01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:49.590
<v Speaker 2>autism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spectrum,</v>

2597
01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:50.453
<v Speaker 2>talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so somebody that was like so called </v>

2598
01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 2>asperger's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a little socially awkward.</v>

2599
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Is that a word burglary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2600
01:48:56.821 --> 01:48:57.654
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I've heard the dude's a </v>

2601
01:49:02.101 --> 01:49:04.800
<v Speaker 2>little ass burglary when someone's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>really smart,</v>

2602
01:49:04.801 --> 01:49:09.750
<v Speaker 2>but socially to go to caltech or mit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2603
01:49:09.751 --> 01:49:14.150
<v Speaker 2>the big bang theory is not so far off on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nerdy fact.</v>

2604
01:49:14.150 --> 01:49:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2605
01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.113
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes along with being false </v>

2606
01:49:17.191 --> 01:49:19.290
<v Speaker 2>correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with being a little nerdy?</v>

2607
01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.153
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's,</v>

2608
01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.940
<v Speaker 2>you're on the autism spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2609
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:24.300
<v Speaker 2>You're on the spectrum that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the autistic,</v>

2610
01:49:24.301 --> 01:49:27.150
<v Speaker 2>yet you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have a disease and we have drugs</v>

2611
01:49:27.151 --> 01:49:28.380
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And before you know it,</v>

2612
01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:31.170
<v Speaker 2>the categories bigger than there's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the box.</v>

2613
01:49:31.650 --> 01:49:33.510
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like it got bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't.</v>

2614
01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:36.690
<v Speaker 2>If you're easily distracted also add.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2615
01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a disease,</v>

2616
01:49:38.401 --> 01:49:39.660
<v Speaker 2>you have add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir,</v>

2617
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:43.230
<v Speaker 2>you need to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it a dos to attention deficit.</v>

2618
01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:43.591
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2619
01:49:43.591 --> 01:49:45.300
<v Speaker 2>shiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2620
01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2621
01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.090
<v Speaker 2>but there have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's</v>

2622
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:48.933
<v Speaker 3>also the very real problem with human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings in that there's so much </v>

2623
01:49:52.781 --> 01:49:53.614
<v Speaker 3>biological diversity that medication </v>
<v Speaker 3>that affects one person is going to </v>

2624
01:49:56.021 --> 01:49:57.670
<v Speaker 3>affect another person that totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>

2625
01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:01.600
<v Speaker 3>So if they give you a medication or your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body has no problem with that medication</v>

2626
01:50:01.601 --> 01:50:02.434
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give that same medication to </v>

2627
01:50:03.731 --> 01:50:05.320
<v Speaker 3>another person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be some issues.</v>

2628
01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:06.700
<v Speaker 3>And when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2629
01:50:06.970 --> 01:50:10.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my child got vaccinated and some,</v>

2630
01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:13.060
<v Speaker 3>there was some adverse reaction to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>vaccination.</v>

2631
01:50:13.650 --> 01:50:14.483
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that want to immediately </v>

2632
01:50:15.401 --> 01:50:16.300
<v Speaker 3>dismiss that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2633
01:50:16.301 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 3>that's malarkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's junk science.</v>

2634
01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:19.113
<v Speaker 3>But there is a very real situation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens with human beings where they </v>

2635
01:50:21.851 --> 01:50:24.310
<v Speaker 3>take medication where it does not agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with some of them.</v>

2636
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:25.383
<v Speaker 3>Sort of how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some people have allergies to </v>

2637
01:50:27.401 --> 01:50:29.500
<v Speaker 3>things that are completely innocuous to </v>
<v Speaker 3>were I,</v>

2638
01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2639
01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:33.910
<v Speaker 3>a certain type of nut to jamie and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>might die.</v>

2640
01:50:34.090 --> 01:50:34.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2641
01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:38.640
<v Speaker 3>there's a reality to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at the,</v>

2642
01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:39.633
<v Speaker 3>this is what I've tried to explain to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you talking about </v>

2643
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:43.040
<v Speaker 3>vaccinations being dangerous and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2644
01:50:43.150 --> 01:50:46.360
<v Speaker 3>we don't need vaccinations than other </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible the people.</v>

2645
01:50:46.361 --> 01:50:47.194
<v Speaker 3>And all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people that have like think </v>

2646
01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:50.470
<v Speaker 3>about how many people you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2647
01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:55.270
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about 300 million in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country alone.</v>

2648
01:50:55.630 --> 01:50:56.463
<v Speaker 3>How many cases have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are people that have vaccInations where </v>

2649
01:51:00.311 --> 01:51:03.160
<v Speaker 3>things go wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a thousand a year?</v>

2650
01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:04.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it is a thousand a year,</v>

2651
01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:07.470
<v Speaker 3>do you know how low that is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that's not low.</v>

2652
01:51:07.471 --> 01:51:09.220
<v Speaker 3>If it's your child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awful.</v>

2653
01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I know it's not love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 10 a year.</v>

2654
01:51:11.291 --> 01:51:12.610
<v Speaker 3>If it's your child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awful.</v>

2655
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.600
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of fucking People that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are being vaccinated.</v>

2656
01:51:16.601 --> 01:51:17.434
<v Speaker 3>If there really was this global epidemic</v>
<v Speaker 3>of you give kids vaccinations and they </v>

2657
01:51:21.911 --> 01:51:23.240
<v Speaker 3>turn into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2658
01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:24.910
<v Speaker 3>the decrepitude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2659
01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:28.630
<v Speaker 3>mentally disabled child boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be a lot bigger.</v>

2660
01:51:28.830 --> 01:51:29.663
<v Speaker 3>Be a lot bigger than it is because so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people were getting vaccinated </v>

2661
01:51:31.650 --> 01:51:34.810
<v Speaker 3>exactly the right way to think about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million to one odds happened 300 times a</v>

2662
01:51:34.811 --> 01:51:35.790
<v Speaker 3>day in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2663
01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a lot of people.</v>

2664
01:51:38.441 --> 01:51:40.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of people just want to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>explain to people.</v>

2665
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:43.240
<v Speaker 3>When we talk about just the raw numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>of stupidity,</v>

2666
01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.093
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's really conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>and really kind to say that one out of </v>

2667
01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:53.560
<v Speaker 3>100 people are fucking idiots and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a damn thing to do.</v>

2668
01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:55.880
<v Speaker 3>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's openminded.</v>

2669
01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:57.940
<v Speaker 3>That's really looking at the bright side</v>
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>

2670
01:51:57.941 --> 01:51:59.890
<v Speaker 3>That's a glass half full perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2671
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:05.070
<v Speaker 3>That means there's 3 million morons in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this country and we know where they are.</v>

2672
01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:09.100
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people.</v>

2673
01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:11.590
<v Speaker 3>It's the sheer numbers that we deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2674
01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2675
01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:15.250
<v Speaker 3>when people started throwing these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2676
01:52:15.251 --> 01:52:19.180
<v Speaker 3>these theories around and they use this </v>
<v Speaker 3>as their evidence.</v>

2677
01:52:19.690 --> 01:52:23.080
<v Speaker 3>I always try to just try to put it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>that perspective.</v>

2678
01:52:23.110 --> 01:52:25.510
<v Speaker 3>You just stop and think about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

2679
01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:26.523
<v Speaker 3>If you could see it on a board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could see 7 billion human beings </v>

2680
01:52:31.421 --> 01:52:34.900
<v Speaker 3>just as little dots on a board and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2681
01:52:34.901 --> 01:52:36.060
<v Speaker 3>then let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's find them.</v>

2682
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:37.510
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then let's,</v>

2683
01:52:37.511 --> 01:52:39.160
<v Speaker 3>let's look at the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at the.</v>

2684
01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we're dealing with.</v>

2685
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:41.343
<v Speaker 3>We're dealing with is almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>insurmountable numbers be like a cancer </v>

2686
01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:46.460
<v Speaker 3>cluster who accepted to be a stupidity</v>

2687
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.560
<v Speaker 2>cluster because they're going to cluster</v>
<v Speaker 2>in various places,</v>

2688
01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:49.394
<v Speaker 2>easily cities probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll find each other and then </v>

2689
01:52:52.431 --> 01:52:54.620
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the confirmation bias that comes</v>

2690
01:52:54.621 --> 01:52:58.460
<v Speaker 2>from the groups getting together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>only sharing information that correlates</v>

2691
01:52:58.461 --> 01:52:59.294
<v Speaker 2>to their beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's big photo ufo lfos or </v>

2692
01:53:00.981 --> 01:53:04.200
<v Speaker 2>psychics or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it seems like you know,</v>

2693
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:07.910
<v Speaker 2>any of these groups that have people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big foot people or whatever it seems</v>

2694
01:53:07.911 --> 01:53:08.241
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2695
01:53:08.241 --> 01:53:09.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2696
01:53:09.441 --> 01:53:10.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2697
01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:13.100
<v Speaker 2>there's maybe $100 a night club or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

2698
01:53:13.101 --> 01:53:16.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's a small number of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to the whole population.</v>

2699
01:53:16.370 --> 01:53:20.810
<v Speaker 2>will they get so mad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get so mad when you bring this up.</v>

2700
01:53:20.811 --> 01:53:24.110
<v Speaker 2>If you bring up these facts or this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these thoughts,</v>

2701
01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.780
<v Speaker 2>these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you tell these people that you don't</v>

2702
01:53:26.781 --> 01:53:27.614
<v Speaker 2>believe in ufos or you don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've ever been visited thinking </v>

2703
01:53:31.670 --> 01:53:34.400
<v Speaker 2>emotionally men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are connected.</v>

2704
01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:36.650
<v Speaker 2>They're connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet they're,</v>

2705
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.790
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2706
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:38.623
<v Speaker 2>they're connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who they are is connected to these </v>

2707
01:53:40.731 --> 01:53:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Beliefs and the more psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>invested you are in unbelief,</v>

2708
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:46.480
<v Speaker 2>the harder it is to change your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this was,</v>

2709
01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:47.353
<v Speaker 2>this is again an example of cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissonance which was discovered by leon </v>

2710
01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:54.710
<v Speaker 2>festinger and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>december of 1954 on the 21st,</v>

2711
01:53:54.711 --> 01:53:55.544
<v Speaker 2>he went to the top of a hill with a ufo </v>
<v Speaker 2>cult who was waiting for the mothership </v>

2712
01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:02.330
<v Speaker 2>to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wanted to see,</v>

2713
01:54:02.331 --> 01:54:03.164
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presumably the mothership is not going </v>

2714
01:54:04.101 --> 01:54:05.510
<v Speaker 2>to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world won't come to an end.</v>

2715
01:54:05.511 --> 01:54:07.430
<v Speaker 2>What will they do afterwards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he thought,</v>

2716
01:54:07.431 --> 01:54:08.121
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2717
01:54:08.121 --> 01:54:08.954
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just changed their mind when they </v>

2718
01:54:09.471 --> 01:54:10.304
<v Speaker 2>go home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2719
01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:14.540
<v Speaker 2>So he recorded this and wrote a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it called when prophecY fails.</v>

2720
01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:18.590
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is they doubled down on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their belief that they say,</v>

2721
01:54:18.591 --> 01:54:19.850
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a dumb idea.</v>

2722
01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Let's go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2723
01:54:21.111 --> 01:54:21.944
<v Speaker 2>they went home and started recruiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>more people and while we miscalculated </v>

2724
01:54:24.731 --> 01:54:26.210
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was eastern standard time.</v>

2725
01:54:26.211 --> 01:54:27.044
<v Speaker 2>It was tomorrow night or it's next year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to carry the one when we did </v>

2726
01:54:29.631 --> 01:54:31.520
<v Speaker 2>our end of the world calculations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2727
01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:34.460
<v Speaker 2>and so they recruit more people to join </v>
<v Speaker 2>the group,</v>

2728
01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:37.070
<v Speaker 2>so he called this cognitive dissonance </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2729
01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:37.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a Belief that conflicts </v>

2730
01:54:39.051 --> 01:54:40.950
<v Speaker 2>with the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2731
01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:41.953
<v Speaker 2>what gives well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the facts have to give because the </v>

2732
01:54:44.121 --> 01:54:46.700
<v Speaker 2>belief is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to get a spin doctor,</v>

2733
01:54:46.701 --> 01:54:47.750
<v Speaker 2>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2734
01:54:47.751 --> 01:54:48.584
<v Speaker 2>we know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the rationalizations are just </v>

2735
01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:52.750
<v Speaker 2>while we prayed and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2736
01:54:52.751 --> 01:54:53.584
<v Speaker 2>and therefore god saved us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or this was a test of our faith and god </v>

2737
01:54:56.571 --> 01:54:59.330
<v Speaker 2>allowed us to live or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or my favorite.</v>

2738
01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.890
<v Speaker 2>The world didn't end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the new space.</v>

2739
01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:03.380
<v Speaker 2>It was a spiritual and dean.</v>

2740
01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:04.213
<v Speaker 2>And we're in the new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the loophole that the December </v>

2741
01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:09.520
<v Speaker 2>21st,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2012 people.</v>

2742
01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2743
01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one was one of my essay.</v>

2744
01:55:13.170 --> 01:55:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah.</v>

2745
01:55:15.170 --> 01:55:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Spiritually in this new beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new beginning.</v>

2746
01:55:18.951 --> 01:55:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2747
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:20.203
<v Speaker 2>I had a guy that I had a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>with who really was absolutely adamant </v>

2748
01:55:23.991 --> 01:55:26.240
<v Speaker 2>that the world was going to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>december 20,</v>

2749
01:55:26.241 --> 01:55:27.650
<v Speaker 2>first 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2750
01:55:27.651 --> 01:55:29.780
<v Speaker 2>it is undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>

2751
01:55:30.010 --> 01:55:31.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you say that?</v>

2752
01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:32.803
<v Speaker 2>How can anybody say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely going to happen because </v>

2753
01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.510
<v Speaker 2>it did change the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started getting longer after on December</v>

2754
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:39.343
<v Speaker 2>22nd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also that the people that came </v>

2755
01:55:41.481 --> 01:55:42.314
<v Speaker 2>up with this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their culture doesn't even exist </v>

2756
01:55:43.951 --> 01:55:44.670
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2757
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:45.503
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the mayan </v>

2758
01:55:45.811 --> 01:55:48.150
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful,</v>

2759
01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:49.313
<v Speaker 1>spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced civilization that did all this </v>

2760
01:55:51.601 --> 01:55:52.434
<v Speaker 1>amazing architecture and they had these </v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool statues that they had built </v>

2761
01:55:56.581 --> 01:56:00.870
<v Speaker 1>and really interesting language that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like hieroglyphic,</v>

2762
01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:02.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2763
01:56:02.230 --> 01:56:03.150
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it called?</v>

2764
01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:03.993
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a what does the type of language </v>

2765
01:56:07.921 --> 01:56:09.600
<v Speaker 1>that they use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like where each,</v>

2766
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.823
<v Speaker 1>each symbol symbol a symbol simpler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but each symbol has a certain sound </v>

2767
01:56:15.901 --> 01:56:16.734
<v Speaker 1>that's attached to it so you can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>those symbols connected in different </v>

2768
01:56:20.041 --> 01:56:20.874
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting when there was </v>

2769
01:56:23.131 --> 01:56:23.964
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believer as a national geographic </v>

2770
01:56:25.831 --> 01:56:29.040
<v Speaker 1>documentary on trying to decode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called.</v>

2771
01:56:29.970 --> 01:56:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these guys were,</v>

2772
01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:33.084
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to figure out exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what these people were writing and how </v>

2773
01:56:35.761 --> 01:56:36.930
<v Speaker 1>they wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

2774
01:56:36.931 --> 01:56:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2775
01:56:38.130 --> 01:56:40.710
<v Speaker 1>cycling trading partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicco his father,</v>

2776
01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.600
<v Speaker 1>michael coe at yale university.</v>

2777
01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:44.380
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy that first crack the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayan code,</v>

2778
01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:48.930
<v Speaker 1>so I blamed his dad for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all this end of the world stuff.</v>

2779
01:56:48.931 --> 01:56:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically it was a.</v>

2780
01:56:50.011 --> 01:56:50.844
<v Speaker 1>It was a cyclical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a time cycle instead of a times arrow </v>

2781
01:56:53.791 --> 01:56:57.480
<v Speaker 1>that is these ages repeat themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these long,</v>

2782
01:56:57.540 --> 01:57:00.840
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long form cycles and that december 20,</v>

2783
01:57:00.841 --> 01:57:04.440
<v Speaker 1>first 2012 was to whatever extent it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to an end.</v>

2784
01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:05.274
<v Speaker 1>It was just a period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost like our year comes to an </v>

2785
01:57:07.651 --> 01:57:08.484
<v Speaker 1>end and a new year start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alls it is is the calendar is rolling </v>

2786
01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:12.413
<v Speaker 1>over the next phase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the long count for the long </v>

2787
01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:18.510
<v Speaker 1>couch and what happened is those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2788
01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:20.170
<v Speaker 1>They just quit talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2789
01:57:20.171 --> 01:57:21.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost no one ever says,</v>

2790
01:57:21.421 --> 01:57:22.620
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong.</v>

2791
01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:26.550
<v Speaker 1>People just sort of drop it and go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into that anymore.</v>

2792
01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an industry that december,</v>

2793
01:57:28.561 --> 01:57:32.130
<v Speaker 1>21st thing was in industry for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it was awesome.</v>

2794
01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was cool.</v>

2795
01:57:33.751 --> 01:57:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I even had a license plate and it said </v>
<v Speaker 1>December,</v>

2796
01:57:36.570 --> 01:57:37.403
<v Speaker 1>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a license plate he did because I </v>

2797
01:57:38.401 --> 01:57:39.900
<v Speaker 1>thought it was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is hilarious,</v>

2798
01:57:39.930 --> 01:57:43.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's also cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's kind of fun to think that it's</v>

2799
01:57:43.051 --> 01:57:45.900
<v Speaker 1>really going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people have these ideas.</v>

2800
01:57:46.050 --> 01:57:47.580
<v Speaker 1>That's when the aliens are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>return.</v>

2801
01:57:47.581 --> 01:57:49.410
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're going to become self </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware.</v>

2802
01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:50.603
<v Speaker 1>I think terence mckenna believed that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people are going to come up with a </v>

2803
01:57:52.201 --> 01:57:53.034
<v Speaker 1>time machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bunch of like really </v>

2804
01:57:54.871 --> 01:57:57.810
<v Speaker 1>fascinating ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell was going to go down.</v>

2805
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.823
<v Speaker 1>But there seems to be this longing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have for an event that we're </v>

2806
01:58:02.161 --> 01:58:04.050
<v Speaker 1>building towards an event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2807
01:58:04.051 --> 01:58:04.884
<v Speaker 1>the idea is there's two dueling ideas is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of progress in history and </v>

2808
01:58:07.861 --> 01:58:08.970
<v Speaker 1>decline in history.</v>

2809
01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:10.253
<v Speaker 1>And so when people write about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually we're in a period of </v>

2810
01:58:13.081 --> 01:58:14.370
<v Speaker 1>decline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2811
01:58:14.490 --> 01:58:16.000
<v Speaker 1>like republicans right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2812
01:58:16.410 --> 01:58:19.140
<v Speaker 1>America is the greatest nation ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>except it's in a shit hole.</v>

2813
01:58:19.141 --> 01:58:22.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst it's ever been now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this guy.</v>

2814
01:58:22.411 --> 01:58:22.990
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2815
01:58:22.990 --> 01:58:25.440
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we're going to return back to</v>

2816
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:26.580
<v Speaker 1>the way it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2817
01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So every generation has this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ours is the special generation,</v>

2818
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:31.703
<v Speaker 1>either ours is culminating in this great</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's going to happen or things </v>

2819
01:58:35.281 --> 01:58:37.530
<v Speaker 1>are terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we could get through that,</v>

2820
01:58:37.531 --> 01:58:39.540
<v Speaker 1>they were the ones that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out the other side,</v>

2821
01:58:39.541 --> 01:58:41.110
<v Speaker 1>the born again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2822
01:58:41.111 --> 01:58:42.460
<v Speaker 1>the left behind hers,</v>

2823
01:58:42.850 --> 01:58:43.511
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2824
01:58:43.511 --> 01:58:43.950
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2825
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:45.400
<v Speaker 2>the christian apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2826
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:47.530
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of secular versions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2827
01:58:47.531 --> 01:58:49.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark'S has had this idea that,</v>

2828
01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:50.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of capitalism in the beginning </v>

2829
01:58:51.611 --> 01:58:54.490
<v Speaker 2>of socialism and communism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a big stage thing.</v>

2830
01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2831
01:58:56.230 --> 01:58:58.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fiction is like this,</v>

2832
01:58:58.620 --> 01:58:59.080
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2833
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:02.950
<v Speaker 2>it makes a drama better when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning point and end point.</v>

2834
01:59:03.290 --> 01:59:06.910
<v Speaker 2>We're at this crisis moment and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to be great again or,</v>

2835
01:59:06.970 --> 01:59:07.803
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they're going to come to an end and </v>

2836
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:09.343
<v Speaker 2>they'll be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's always that tension between </v>

2837
01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:12.544
<v Speaker 2>decline and progress with is also this </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization that there will be an end </v>

2838
01:59:15.911 --> 01:59:18.460
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we are finite beings.</v>

2839
01:59:18.461 --> 01:59:20.080
<v Speaker 2>We have a beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're born,</v>

2840
01:59:20.081 --> 01:59:22.300
<v Speaker 2>we have an end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we die and it's gonna happen.</v>

2841
01:59:22.330 --> 01:59:24.850
<v Speaker 2>So when is it happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm fucking scared.</v>

2842
01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.170
<v Speaker 2>It's something coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2843
01:59:26.171 --> 01:59:27.370
<v Speaker 2>it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The apocalypse.</v>

2844
01:59:27.371 --> 01:59:27.971
<v Speaker 2>All,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus.</v>

2845
01:59:27.971 --> 01:59:28.804
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we find this thing and if </v>

2846
01:59:29.951 --> 01:59:30.784
<v Speaker 2>you're really inclined to be gullible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you get sucked into like the </v>

2847
01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 2>heaven's gate folks think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2848
01:59:37.001 --> 01:59:37.834
<v Speaker 2>the way it's going to happen is there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a ufo behind this media and what we got </v>

2849
01:59:40.541 --> 01:59:41.374
<v Speaker 2>to do is when the comment is near,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gotta kill ourselves and wear purple </v>

2850
01:59:44.471 --> 01:59:45.304
<v Speaker 2>nike's and then we'll live our art bell </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a little bit of culpability in that </v>

2851
01:59:50.021 --> 01:59:50.854
<v Speaker 2>because he was promoting the hale bopp </v>
<v Speaker 2>comet ufo theory for quite a while on </v>

2852
01:59:55.241 --> 01:59:59.050
<v Speaker 2>his show and they used to listen to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>show and that's when they bought.</v>

2853
01:59:59.140 --> 01:59:59.973
<v Speaker 2>They went down and bought a a telescope </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to see if they could see it and </v>

2854
02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:05.180
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm in.</v>

2855
02:00:05.190 --> 02:00:06.023
<v Speaker 2>I'm not blind to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got into it by listening to that </v>

2856
02:00:08.381 --> 02:00:08.980
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

2857
02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Promoted our bell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2858
02:00:10.930 --> 02:00:14.330
<v Speaker 2>So then when marshall applewhite said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2859
02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I think this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all going to come with the comet</v>

2860
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:22.960
<v Speaker 2>and comedy albums and little competition</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to cult leaders,</v>

2861
02:00:23.230 --> 02:00:26.140
<v Speaker 2>it seems like once a cult leader has </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that position,</v>

2862
02:00:26.530 --> 02:00:27.363
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they very rarely get forced out of the </v>

2863
02:00:28.751 --> 02:00:29.740
<v Speaker 2>board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2864
02:00:29.741 --> 02:00:30.431
<v Speaker 2>No one says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2865
02:00:30.431 --> 02:00:31.870
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marshall's out of his fucking mind.</v>

2866
02:00:31.930 --> 02:00:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not cutting my hair off because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were treating themselves and you know,</v>

2867
02:00:37.751 --> 02:00:39.200
<v Speaker 2>and he was obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nadine,</v>

2868
02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:40.113
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you not have one person in that </v>

2869
02:00:41.471 --> 02:00:42.970
<v Speaker 2>group that you might have thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2870
02:00:42.971 --> 02:00:43.804
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe mike's got some better ideas in </v>

2871
02:00:45.041 --> 02:00:47.350
<v Speaker 2>martial arts and mike doesn't work that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2872
02:00:47.970 --> 02:00:48.803
<v Speaker 2>Usually those ones get purged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the mormon fundamentalist </v>

2873
02:00:51.401 --> 02:00:52.234
<v Speaker 2>mormons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just purge anybody that wants to </v>

2874
02:00:53.561 --> 02:00:55.470
<v Speaker 2>challenge the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elite,</v>

2875
02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:56.313
<v Speaker 2>the profit.</v>

2876
02:00:57.130 --> 02:01:01.960
<v Speaker 2>But so there's a critical point and </v>
<v Speaker 2>every cult when the leader dies a well,</v>

2877
02:01:02.010 --> 02:01:02.890
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>

2878
02:01:02.891 --> 02:01:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Usually the cults just die with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the case of scientology,</v>

2879
02:01:07.130 --> 02:01:08.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2880
02:01:08.690 --> 02:01:10.490
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientology is a call.</v>

2881
02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2882
02:01:11.981 --> 02:01:13.690
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in hollywood.</v>

2883
02:01:13.730 --> 02:01:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I do know that once you watch your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>

2884
02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:18.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2885
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:20.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Joseph Smith was killed,</v>

2886
02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:23.230
<v Speaker 2>that could have been the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mormon church,</v>

2887
02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:24.970
<v Speaker 2>but bring them young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took over the reigns.</v>

2888
02:01:24.971 --> 02:01:27.040
<v Speaker 2>So if there's another charismatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader,</v>

2889
02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:31.380
<v Speaker 2>david miscavige and david miscavige took</v>
<v Speaker 2>over from l,</v>

2890
02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:32.233
<v Speaker 2>ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was charismatic and people turn </v>

2891
02:01:33.731 --> 02:01:34.201
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2892
02:01:34.201 --> 02:01:36.010
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they acknowledged him as the,</v>

2893
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:39.770
<v Speaker 2>as the new leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of my favorite moments in all of</v>

2894
02:01:39.771 --> 02:01:40.340
<v Speaker 2>comedy</v>

2895
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>is when miscavige and tom cruise or on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and they salute l ron hubbard,</v>

2896
02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>lrh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they saluted.</v>

2897
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:49.670
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of testosterone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there on that stage like,</v>

2898
02:01:49.671 --> 02:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2899
02:01:51.650 --> 02:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>he's got a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic embarrassing.</v>

2900
02:01:56.220 --> 02:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Not embarrassing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So wonderful to me when this,</v>

2901
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2902
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>the human folly of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2903
02:02:04.191 --> 02:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>the belief system of anybody that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent person by the way,</v>

2904
02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>massively successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially financially,</v>

2905
02:02:11.121 --> 02:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>both of them financially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tom cruise culturally massively,</v>

2906
02:02:14.601 --> 02:02:19.601
<v Speaker 1>massively successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing a big gold plate on his neck and</v>

2907
02:02:20.721 --> 02:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>saluting one of the worst science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction authors of all time.</v>

2908
02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is amazing.</v>

2909
02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2910
02:02:28.110 --> 02:02:31.400
<v Speaker 1>he was a packed up with antidepressants </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other drugs.</v>

2911
02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2912
02:02:33.050 --> 02:02:33.970
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2913
02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:34.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2914
02:02:34.761 --> 02:02:35.594
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about the fact that he lived for a </v>

2915
02:02:37.131 --> 02:02:37.964
<v Speaker 1>long time on a boat off the shore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he owed so much taxes they </v>

2916
02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:41.473
<v Speaker 1>couldn't land.</v>

2917
02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:42.373
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that's where all the c corp and </v>

2918
02:02:43.671 --> 02:02:44.504
<v Speaker 1>all that crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote more books than anyone who's </v>

2919
02:02:47.391 --> 02:02:50.630
<v Speaker 1>ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote more fiction than anyone ever.</v>

2920
02:02:50.650 --> 02:02:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mad fiction.</v>

2921
02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Horrible fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2922
02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Harlan ellison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I know is a science fiction writer,</v>

2923
02:02:58.071 --> 02:03:00.240
<v Speaker 1>says he was there at the meeting when l </v>
<v Speaker 1>ron.</v>

2924
02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2925
02:03:01.170 --> 02:03:02.003
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meme is that he said if you really </v>

2926
02:03:03.261 --> 02:03:05.060
<v Speaker 1>want to make money writing science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>

2927
02:03:05.061 --> 02:03:05.894
<v Speaker 1>you started your own religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually was according to harlan </v>

2928
02:03:08.091 --> 02:03:08.924
<v Speaker 1>ellison is there was a group of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of sitting around complaining </v>

2929
02:03:12.171 --> 02:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2930
02:03:13.450 --> 02:03:14.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2931
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:16.460
<v Speaker 1>the fees that people paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Writers.</v>

2932
02:03:16.461 --> 02:03:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Like all of us writers complained about </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't make enough money.</v>

2933
02:03:19.130 --> 02:03:21.440
<v Speaker 1>And so that's when somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2934
02:03:21.441 --> 02:03:22.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2935
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:24.630
<v Speaker 1>if we started a religion and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll run,</v>

2936
02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:25.790
<v Speaker 1>kind of jumped in and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2961
02:04:18.131 --> 02:04:21.110
<v Speaker 1>then on top of that the internet is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed it for what it really is.</v>

02:05:18.631 --> 02:05:21.180
<v Speaker 1>stuff trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get ahead in this life,</v>

2982

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young man and I ordered that dianetics </v>

2983

<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people never stopped sending me </v>

2984
02:05:27.151 --> 02:05:27.984
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never stopped sending me invites and </v>

2985
02:05:29.650 --> 02:05:30.483
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did they get the numbers so we have </v>

2986
02:05:31.651 --> 02:05:33.720
<v Speaker 1>millions of followers because anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ever,</v>

2987
02:05:33.790 --> 02:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm a farmer on the list or was </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2988
02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't have my new address.</v>

2989
02:05:38.590 --> 02:05:41.840
<v Speaker 1>You can still go clear if you would like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2990
02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:43.800
<v Speaker 1>to be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a neighbor,</v>

2991
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:46.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor guy,</v>

2992
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:47.303
<v Speaker 1>nice guy.</v>

2993
02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:48.353
<v Speaker 1>But his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2994
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I think poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he still lives down the street,</v>

2995
02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:52.410
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his um,</v>

2996
02:05:52.650 --> 02:05:55.740
<v Speaker 1>there was a plot of land that he wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy and we were talking about it,</v>

2997
02:05:55.741 --> 02:05:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

2998
02:05:56.641 --> 02:05:59.700
<v Speaker 1>well we can't do it right now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nancy's about to go clear.</v>

2999
02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:00.593
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3000
02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.880
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what it meant.</v>

3001
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3002
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>wouLd have been okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3003
02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I only knew this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3004
02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:07.173
<v Speaker 1>it was probably [inaudible] 98.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only knew a little bit about </v>

3005
02:06:09.181 --> 02:06:09.930
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3006
02:06:09.930 --> 02:06:13.020
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean go and clear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both were scientologists.</v>

3007
02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I go going clear how much that cost </v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,000.</v>

3008
02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:20.100
<v Speaker 1>$50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like some ceremony.</v>

3009
02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:20.881
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3010
02:06:20.881 --> 02:06:22.590
<v Speaker 1>what does it involve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3011
02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:25.290
<v Speaker 1>she's no longer affected by external </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

3012
02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:29.070
<v Speaker 1>so once she goes clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing will bother her.</v>

3013
02:06:29.071 --> 02:06:29.904
<v Speaker 1>Like you can say anything to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could insult her and nothing will </v>

3014
02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:34.800
<v Speaker 1>get in and she will write.</v>

3015
02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.940
<v Speaker 1>But that's what everybody wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3016
02:06:35.970 --> 02:06:37.590
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3017
02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:39.660
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to be autonomous,</v>

3018
02:06:39.661 --> 02:06:41.310
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just completely,</v>

3019
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.940
<v Speaker 1>completely free of any bullshit in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

3020
02:06:44.941 --> 02:06:48.540
<v Speaker 1>this distress and the worry and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negativity.</v>

3021
02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:49.493
<v Speaker 1>So they sell you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these are the things you need to </v>

3022
02:06:52.051 --> 02:06:53.040
<v Speaker 1>get rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3023
02:06:53.041 --> 02:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3024
02:06:54.201 --> 02:06:55.170
<v Speaker 1>part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made her thing,</v>

3025
02:06:55.171 --> 02:06:55.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

3026
02:06:55.950 --> 02:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it's just measuring the voltage between </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hands and skin conductance.</v>

3027
02:07:01.050 --> 02:07:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3028
02:07:02.191 --> 02:07:03.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about your mother.</v>

3029
02:07:03.451 --> 02:07:04.284
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about my wu spiked because </v>

3030
02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I squeezed his hand slightly more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

3031
02:07:07.141 --> 02:07:08.040
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3032
02:07:08.041 --> 02:07:08.874
<v Speaker 1>everybody has issues with parents with x</v>
<v Speaker 1>levers and spouses and bosses and you </v>

3033
02:07:13.710 --> 02:07:16.170
<v Speaker 1>can find something and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you like to get rid of that bad?</v>

3034
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:16.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3035
02:07:16.681 --> 02:07:19.260
<v Speaker 1>if you go meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you go to a buddhist center,</v>

3036
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:20.103
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're focusing on the negative of your </v>

3037
02:07:22.261 --> 02:07:23.094
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to clear that out by </v>

3038
02:07:24.181 --> 02:07:27.450
<v Speaker 1>meditating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're all very various forms of the</v>

3039
02:07:27.451 --> 02:07:29.070
<v Speaker 1>same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody has.</v>

3040
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Like the psychic hotlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has problems,</v>

3041
02:07:31.471 --> 02:07:32.131
<v Speaker 1>love health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

3042
02:07:32.131 --> 02:07:32.964
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got some issue and we're </v>

3043
02:07:34.621 --> 02:07:35.740
<v Speaker 1>going to help for</v>

3044
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:36.881
<v Speaker 2>a fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3045
02:07:36.881 --> 02:07:40.150
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating about l ron is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like l rom was nuts.</v>

3046
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:43.840
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't use the word not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had some mental problems,</v>

3047
02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:45.393
<v Speaker 2>mental problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems like part of what </v>

3048
02:07:46.961 --> 02:07:47.794
<v Speaker 2>scientology was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was his attempt at self help and that </v>

3049
02:07:50.441 --> 02:07:51.274
<v Speaker 2>was one of the things that Lawrence </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wright went into that it seems pretty </v>

3050
02:07:53.531 --> 02:07:54.364
<v Speaker 2>clear that this guy used all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>available psychological techniques at </v>

3051
02:07:59.171 --> 02:08:03.940
<v Speaker 2>the time to try to cure himself self </v>
<v Speaker 2>help thing.</v>

3052
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy because they themselves,</v>

3053
02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:09.130
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3054
02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:10.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have issues that they're dealing with.</v>

3055
02:08:10.890 --> 02:08:11.723
<v Speaker 2>When I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the only thing that was </v>

3056
02:08:12.401 --> 02:08:13.234
<v Speaker 2>interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was psychology was interesting to me </v>

3057
02:08:15.011 --> 02:08:16.600
<v Speaker 2>because I was trying to figure out my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own brain.</v>

3058
02:08:16.601 --> 02:08:17.061
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

3059
02:08:17.061 --> 02:08:20.410
<v Speaker 2>I got a great fucking thing under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under wraps being handled.</v>

3060
02:08:20.650 --> 02:08:23.230
<v Speaker 2>So that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the one thing.</v>

3061
02:08:23.490 --> 02:08:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Robin's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3062
02:08:25.361 --> 02:08:30.361
<v Speaker 2>they kind of have a tracking the line </v>
<v Speaker 2>between being a con artist.</v>

3063
02:08:31.151 --> 02:08:35.440
<v Speaker 2>He's not but selling something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could maybe help people maybe.</v>

3064
02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:38.650
<v Speaker 2>But if you follow his direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

3065
02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:40.310
<v Speaker 2>he's more positive than negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3066
02:08:40.311 --> 02:08:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

3067
02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of this stuff is pretty basic,</v>

3068
02:08:43.361 --> 02:08:44.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set goals and write them down and don't </v>

3069
02:08:46.781 --> 02:08:48.880
<v Speaker 2>get distracted from these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay focused,</v>

3070
02:08:48.881 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pretty basic stuff that actually is</v>

3071
02:08:51.281 --> 02:08:53.050
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works if you work at,</v>

3072
02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:54.363
<v Speaker 2>and we did a story on the self help </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement and skeptic by a guy wrote a </v>

3073
02:08:59.441 --> 02:09:02.860
<v Speaker 2>book called sham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the self help and actualization movement</v>

3074
02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:07.720
<v Speaker 2>and the pr and this guy he used to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>for rodale press,</v>

3075
02:09:07.721 --> 02:09:08.554
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the big publishers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>self help books and in the marketing </v>

3076
02:09:11.501 --> 02:09:12.334
<v Speaker 2>department said that the number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictor of anybody who would buy one </v>

3077
02:09:14.801 --> 02:09:18.190
<v Speaker 2>of these self help books is somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 2>had already bought a self help book.</v>

3078
02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they work,</v>

3079
02:09:19.871 --> 02:09:23.890
<v Speaker 2>why do you need to keep buying the tapes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the books and all that stuff.</v>

3080
02:09:23.891 --> 02:09:25.680
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it?</v>

3081
02:09:25.850 --> 02:09:30.070
<v Speaker 2>They only Work temporarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you bring tony robbins into your</v>

3082
02:09:30.071 --> 02:09:30.904
<v Speaker 2>corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is for sure going to get your sales </v>

3083
02:09:33.131 --> 02:09:34.960
<v Speaker 2>force really motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3084
02:09:34.961 --> 02:09:38.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make some common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make 50 calls a day rather than 30 calls</v>

3085
02:09:38.291 --> 02:09:39.124
<v Speaker 2>a day and I'm going to really do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they see a spike for a while and </v>

3086
02:09:42.431 --> 02:09:43.264
<v Speaker 2>then people go back to their baseline </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they were and that's why you got </v>

3087
02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:48.450
<v Speaker 2>to keep listening to the tapes and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3088
02:09:48.451 --> 02:09:51.490
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and listening to the music and the books</v>

3089
02:09:51.491 --> 02:09:53.380
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff to kind of keep it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

3090
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:58.030
<v Speaker 2>So it only works to a certain extent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a limited period of time.</v>

3091
02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Well it's very difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change behavior patterns.</v>

3092
02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:02.530
<v Speaker 2>You have this pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very comfortable.</v>

3093
02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:04.760
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to change too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3094
02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:05.763
<v Speaker 2>Don't they say it's like 90 days of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something all the time for it </v>

3095
02:10:09.311 --> 02:10:10.144
<v Speaker 2>becomes a habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can kind of ingrain a new </v>

3096
02:10:11.981 --> 02:10:15.160
<v Speaker 2>path probably longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why diets are so difficult to work.</v>

3097
02:10:15.161 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lifetime of,</v>

3098
02:10:16.810 --> 02:10:20.020
<v Speaker 2>you have this fat level and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of food your body's used to.</v>

3099
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:21.090
<v Speaker 2>And to shift it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3100
02:10:21.230 --> 02:10:23.050
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to happen in weeks or </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

3101
02:10:23.051 --> 02:10:25.750
<v Speaker 2>He really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lifestyle change for forever.</v>

3102
02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:26.584
<v Speaker 2>It really turned into a dial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can commit to a diet for a long </v>

3103
02:10:30.611 --> 02:10:32.860
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people in the community,</v>

3104
02:10:32.890 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 2>like I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a diet</v>

3105
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:38.150
<v Speaker 1>right now for 60 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark sisson's primal blueprint.</v>

3106
02:10:38.210 --> 02:10:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a ketogenic diet.</v>

3107
02:10:39.831 --> 02:10:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Based,</v>

3108
02:10:41.710 --> 02:10:44.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly hit a lot of fucking avocados.</v>

3109
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avocados,</v>

3110
02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:49.880

<v Speaker 1>a lot of coconut oil,</v>

3111
02:10:49.881 --> 02:10:52.100
<v Speaker 1>almond butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of healthy fats.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that weight.</v>

3118
02:11:08.530 --> 02:11:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't be pended.</v>

3119
02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he do?</v>

3120
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:15.350
<v Speaker 1>He's vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went vegan is all plants.</v>

3121
02:11:15.351 --> 02:11:19.320
<v Speaker 1>He says basically huge salads a twice a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3122
02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:21.650
<v Speaker 1>That's just great for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

3123
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:22.940
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great for you.</v>

3124
02:11:22.941 --> 02:11:25.130
<v Speaker 1>If you can eat more plants more the </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

3125
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure adding more than plants.</v>

3126
02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:29.660
<v Speaker 1>So coconut butter and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3127
02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:34.720
<v Speaker 1>the idea of systems idea is an system </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a big ultra endurance guy as well.</v>

3128
02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:36.173
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea is that your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions more efficiently on high fat </v>

3129
02:11:41.331 --> 02:11:45.110
<v Speaker 1>content and it does on a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate content.</v>

3130
02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:47.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's very low carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no added sugar,</v>

3131
02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:49.610
<v Speaker 1>no grains whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3132
02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:51.170
<v Speaker 1>No pastas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3133
02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's interesting about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3134
02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:56.120
<v Speaker 1>the mental clarity aspect of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>

3135
02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3136
02:11:57.490 --> 02:11:58.323
<v Speaker 1>And I had a few friends that have tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same diet and it was one of the </v>

3137
02:12:00.681 --> 02:12:01.514
<v Speaker 1>things they pointed out and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of brain fog </v>

3138
02:12:05.271 --> 02:12:07.910
<v Speaker 1>that comes from heavy carbohydrate meals</v>
<v Speaker 1>you avoid,</v>

3139
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:09.583
<v Speaker 1>you avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once Your body becomes into a </v>

3140
02:12:11.151 --> 02:12:11.984
<v Speaker 1>state of ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think takes like 20 something </v>

3141
02:12:13.971 --> 02:12:16.730
<v Speaker 1>days or there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different supplements</v>

3142
02:12:16.731 --> 02:12:19.850
<v Speaker 1>like see this stuff right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a keto genic cream.</v>

3143
02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:24.280
<v Speaker 1>The product that you can add to coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different.</v>

3144
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:26.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're putting in ketones </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3145
02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:27.673
<v Speaker 1>That is actually just because this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>is coffee with mct oil and grass fed </v>

3146
02:12:32.271 --> 02:12:34.130
<v Speaker 1>butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had that step before?</v>

3147
02:12:34.410 --> 02:12:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3148
02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:39.160
<v Speaker 1>from um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3149
02:12:39.170 --> 02:12:40.003
<v Speaker 1>robb wolf invention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he figured out how to add grass fed </v>

3150
02:12:42.801 --> 02:12:44.900
<v Speaker 1>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mct oil,</v>

3151
02:12:44.901 --> 02:12:45.734
<v Speaker 1>which is a medium chain triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the healthiest aspects of </v>

3152
02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:50.840
<v Speaker 1>coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My headaches gone,</v>

3153
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:51.830
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel better?</v>

3154
02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:53.233
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a healthy fats and mixed in </v>

3155
02:12:55.731 --> 02:12:58.020
<v Speaker 1>with coffee mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3156
02:12:58.360 --> 02:12:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3157
02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:00.753
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

3158
02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:01.693
<v Speaker 1>But mostly I'm hearing my theory on </v>
<v Speaker 1>diets that they work because you're </v>

3159
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:07.603
<v Speaker 1>doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actively involved in keeping </v>

3160
02:13:09.381 --> 02:13:12.860
<v Speaker 1>track of how many calories you go in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start cutting out the bad foods.</v>

3161
02:13:12.861 --> 02:13:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Definitely junk food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugars,</v>

3162
02:13:15.230 --> 02:13:16.310
<v Speaker 1>grained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

3163
02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:17.653
<v Speaker 1>And they work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it's this </v>

3164
02:13:19.011 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 1>particular one here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>

3165
02:13:20.190 --> 02:13:23.180
<v Speaker 1>the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the doing something about a problem</v>

3166
02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:25.520
<v Speaker 1>that that is what really works it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3167
02:13:25.521 --> 02:13:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

3168
02:13:26.751 --> 02:13:27.584
<v Speaker 1>Just try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it just because I wanted to feel </v>

3169
02:13:28.881 --> 02:13:30.040
<v Speaker 1>what it would be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3170
02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>try this diet because I had</v>

3171
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.813
<v Speaker 3>read about citizen and he's a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting guy and then I'd also </v>

3172
02:13:34.591 --> 02:13:35.424
<v Speaker 3>listened to a tim ferris podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim ferriss had this great podcast With </v>

3173
02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:42.780
<v Speaker 3>dr d'agostino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe his name is who is.</v>

3174
02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:47.781
<v Speaker 3>I'm heavily into ketosis ketogenetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diets and the science behind it.</v>

3175
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.823
<v Speaker 3>He's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really brilliant guy and fascinating </v>

3176
02:13:50.761 --> 02:13:52.650
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to listen to it like 10 times in</v>

3177
02:13:52.651 --> 02:13:53.484
<v Speaker 3>a row and take notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things that they brought </v>

3178
02:13:54.901 --> 02:13:56.670
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really interesting is the,</v>

3179
02:13:56.671 --> 02:13:57.504
<v Speaker 3>the mental benefits of it and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it helps children with epilepsy </v>

3180
02:14:00.691 --> 02:14:05.610
<v Speaker 3>when they put them on a ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It stops epilepsy in its tracks.</v>

3181
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:07.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3182
02:14:07.591 --> 02:14:08.220
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

3183
02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:08.880
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3184
02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:10.470
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've researched it.</v>

3185
02:14:10.471 --> 02:14:11.880
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fascinating.</v>

3186
02:14:11.881 --> 02:14:15.450
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the main things they do to </v>
<v Speaker 3>children that have child's epilepsy.</v>

3187
02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Other thing that people do when they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>on dice,</v>

3188
02:14:18.181 --> 02:14:21.130
<v Speaker 3>they also start exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has other benefits.</v>

3189
02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:23.760
<v Speaker 3>That's tons of benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I did that already too.</v>

3190
02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:26.830
<v Speaker 3>So for me it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just wanting to try,</v>

3191
02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:27.943
<v Speaker 3>want to try it for the athletic benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to try it for the physical </v>

3192
02:14:30.181 --> 02:14:32.370
<v Speaker 3>benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I lost a lot of body fat.</v>

3193
02:14:32.490 --> 02:14:33.360
<v Speaker 3>You did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3194
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:34.343
<v Speaker 3>And I wasn't fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I definitely could have lost a </v>

3195
02:14:36.241 --> 02:14:37.650
<v Speaker 3>little bit of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3196
02:14:37.651 --> 02:14:39.600
<v Speaker 3>but I mean not compared to like I still </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a six pack,</v>

3197
02:14:39.610 --> 02:14:43.680
<v Speaker 3>like you can see my abs before I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I lost 10 pounds.</v>

3198
02:14:43.681 --> 02:14:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm down to one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was one 93 this morning and I</v>

3199
02:14:46.901 --> 02:14:48.390
<v Speaker 3>was somewhere around two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh four before.</v>

3200
02:14:48.391 --> 02:14:50.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kinda kinda fascinating.</v>

3201
02:14:50.250 --> 02:14:51.450
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you have for lunch?</v>

3202
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3203
02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:54.960
<v Speaker 3>it depends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no grains.</v>

3204
02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.940
<v Speaker 3>That's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big one is no grains,</v>

3205
02:14:58.080 --> 02:14:59.520
<v Speaker 3>no pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3206
02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:00.660
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3207
02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.100
<v Speaker 3>just very low carbs.</v>

3208
02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm getting my protein from mostly </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild game.</v>

3209
02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Mostly a elk and deer and things along </v>
<v Speaker 3>those lines while hunting here.</v>

3210
02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Shoot your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily do it all here.</v>

3211
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:15.730
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3212
02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:16.673
<v Speaker 3>Santa monica canoga park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not really a lot of meat to you </v>

3213
02:15:19.631 --> 02:15:22.290
<v Speaker 3>if you had out here walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do.</v>

3214
02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:23.153
<v Speaker 3>But when you shoot an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get hundreds of pounds of meat to </v>

3215
02:15:25.651 --> 02:15:27.350
<v Speaker 3>commercial freezers in the backfield.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3216
02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:28.321
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live nearby.</v>

3217
02:15:28.321 --> 02:15:29.310
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3218
02:15:29.370 --> 02:15:30.690
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'S great for you too.</v>

3219
02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:31.441
<v Speaker 3>All rIght.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3220
02:15:31.441 --> 02:15:32.274
<v Speaker 3>it's organic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent free of any </v>

3221
02:15:34.621 --> 02:15:37.540
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics like bullshit buffalo and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fosterage.</v>

3222
02:15:37.590 --> 02:15:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Ostrich meat is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

3223
02:15:38.911 --> 02:15:41.820
<v Speaker 3>very good for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very lean and healthy and it's a rich,</v>

3224
02:15:41.850 --> 02:15:45.270
<v Speaker 3>dark red meat filled with iron and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrients.</v>

3225
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:46.610
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3226
02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:47.663
<v Speaker 3>the idea behind it is that you get your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body to burn fat instead of </v>

3227
02:15:50.491 --> 02:15:53.170
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates because that's primarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>with human.</v>

3228
02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:54.033
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's not to be confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the problem with the whole concept </v>

3229
02:15:57.421 --> 02:15:58.860
<v Speaker 3>of paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3230
02:15:58.861 --> 02:16:00.160
<v Speaker 3>the paleo diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3231
02:16:00.610 --> 02:16:03.450
<v Speaker 3>the term can be debunked pretty easily </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they say,</v>

3232
02:16:03.630 --> 02:16:05.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the paleolithic period,</v>

3233
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:08.490
<v Speaker 3>people ate a lot of bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat a lot of state,</v>

3234
02:16:08.491 --> 02:16:09.860
<v Speaker 3>whatever they could find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3235
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:11.030
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3236
02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.870
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and most hunter gatherers,</v>

3237
02:16:12.871 --> 02:16:15.720
<v Speaker 3>most of their calories come from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gathering part,</v>

3238
02:16:15.721 --> 02:16:18.750
<v Speaker 3>not the hunting part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to hunt animals.</v>

3239
02:16:18.751 --> 02:16:21.270
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

3240
02:16:21.271 --> 02:16:25.320
<v Speaker 3>especially back then they shitty bows </v>
<v Speaker 3>and arrows and they didn't have guns was</v>

3241
02:16:25.321 --> 02:16:29.740
<v Speaker 3>very difficult unless you stumbled upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>a herd of blind buffalo,</v>

3242
02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:31.850
<v Speaker 1>throw a spear out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3243
02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3244
02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:37.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult today.</v>

3245
02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Defined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really healthy.</v>

3246
02:16:39.670 --> 02:16:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you wanna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to hunt it yourself,</v>

3247
02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:44.580
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of effort.</v>

3248
02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3249
02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:50.370
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to actually find really </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy meat other than grass fed beef,</v>

3250
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:53.080
<v Speaker 1>their options are pretty severely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about alcohol?</v>

3251
02:16:53.081 --> 02:16:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you drink?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very little because every now and then,</v>

3252
02:16:55.931 --> 02:16:57.160
<v Speaker 1>but there's sugar in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3253
02:16:57.220 --> 02:16:58.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3254
02:16:58.180 --> 02:16:59.013
<v Speaker 1>It converts to sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the idea is that cookies and ice </v>

3255
02:17:01.511 --> 02:17:02.920
<v Speaker 1>cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's got sugar is gone.</v>

3256
02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:04.030
<v Speaker 1>So the dairies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3257
02:17:04.031 --> 02:17:05.480
<v Speaker 1>milk a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3258
02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:07.500
<v Speaker 1>you can have belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not really sure.</v>

3259
02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:08.353
<v Speaker 1>I've never liked milk cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since I'm not eating cookies and </v>

3260
02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:12.230
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3261
02:17:12.730 --> 02:17:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Milk guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3262
02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind raw milk and milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3263
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I felt like homogenized and pasteurized </v>
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>

3264
02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:21.813
<v Speaker 1>Once you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's great as far as you could </v>

3265
02:17:23.891 --> 02:17:27.100
<v Speaker 1>store it in a store and it lasts for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>

3266
02:17:27.101 --> 02:17:29.260
<v Speaker 1>but you're cooking out all the enzymes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3267
02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:31.330
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the best thing for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

3268
02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:32.343
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem also is if you don't do that </v>

3269
02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:36.250
<v Speaker 1>then it's only good for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

3270
02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:37.240
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3271
02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:40.330
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get sick and eggs.</v>

3272
02:17:40.630 --> 02:17:41.411
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to hear that.</v>

3273
02:17:41.411 --> 02:17:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I like eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eggs are good for you,</v>

3274
02:17:42.761 --> 02:17:43.594
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3275
02:17:43.630 --> 02:17:44.463
<v Speaker 1>Eggs aren't bad and certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol is actually important for </v>

3276
02:17:46.571 --> 02:17:48.600
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Produce testosterone.</v>

3277
02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:50.320
<v Speaker 1>This actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3278
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:53.640
<v Speaker 1>for cellular growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3279
02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:57.670
<v Speaker 1>So and eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one I get from my chickens,</v>

3280
02:17:57.671 --> 02:17:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I have chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do?</v>

3281
02:17:58.850 --> 02:18:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

3282
02:18:00.730 --> 02:18:01.730
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

3283
02:18:01.731 --> 02:18:04.000
<v Speaker 1>It's 22 chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about supplements?</v>

3284
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:07.460
<v Speaker 1>That takes up my fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multivitamins,</v>

3285
02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:10.480
<v Speaker 1>omega,</v>
<v Speaker 1>omega six to three.</v>

3286
02:18:11.210 --> 02:18:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took a lot of.</v>

3287
02:18:12.190 --> 02:18:15.130
<v Speaker 1>That is something that can go too far or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like ray kurzweil it takes to.</v>

3288
02:18:15.131 --> 02:18:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements a day,</v>

3289
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:18.820
<v Speaker 1>but he's just trying to stay alive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist.</v>

3290
02:18:18.821 --> 02:18:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Sheens take right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I interviewed him for example,</v>

3291
02:18:22.211 --> 02:18:23.044
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's almost like a secular guru because </v>

3292
02:18:26.261 --> 02:18:29.050
<v Speaker 1>he's constructed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the second coming is coming,</v>

3293
02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:30.220
<v Speaker 1>the singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 20,</v>

3294
02:18:30.221 --> 02:18:30.911
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

3295
02:18:30.911 --> 02:18:32.260
<v Speaker 1>41,</v>
<v Speaker 1>42.</v>

3296
02:18:32.290 --> 02:18:35.680
<v Speaker 1>If you could make it till the year 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>47 or 2014.</v>

3297
02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:37.653
<v Speaker 1>I went to a conference in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the same for the same show for </v>

3298
02:18:40.331 --> 02:18:41.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3299
02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:42.640
<v Speaker 1>joe rogan questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3300
02:18:42.641 --> 02:18:45.160
<v Speaker 1>We went to New York and they had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>big conference.</v>

3301
02:18:45.161 --> 02:18:46.180
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3302
02:18:46.210 --> 02:18:47.820
<v Speaker 1>the singularity summit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3303
02:18:47.821 --> 02:18:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 20 slash 40 something.</v>

3304
02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

3305
02:18:51.761 --> 02:18:52.594
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just pick a day when they think </v>

3306
02:18:54.371 --> 02:18:55.450
<v Speaker 1>that it's all going to happen.</v>

3307
02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:56.313
<v Speaker 1>But they had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a russian billionaire character who </v>

3308
02:18:58.941 --> 02:19:03.340
<v Speaker 1>would develop some artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some thing that,</v>

3309
02:19:03.430 --> 02:19:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was uh,</v>

3310
02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:07.660
<v Speaker 1>gonna unveil that was like a robot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3311
02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:09.820
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

3312
02:19:09.821 --> 02:19:11.280
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3313
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:14.890
<v Speaker 1>say even if thAt will come eventually I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

3314
02:19:14.891 --> 02:19:19.840
<v Speaker 1>But even if they did accomplish that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be you or just a copy of.</v>

3315
02:19:19.841 --> 02:19:20.674
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you go to sleep and you wake </v>

3316
02:19:22.601 --> 02:19:23.650
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a little groggy,</v>

3317
02:19:23.651 --> 02:19:24.484
<v Speaker 1>but there's a continuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still your memories and your </v>

3318
02:19:26.171 --> 02:19:28.460
<v Speaker 1>personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go under general anesthesia,</v>

3319
02:19:28.461 --> 02:19:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you're groggy after you wake up and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

3320
02:19:30.291 --> 02:19:33.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a continuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they shut off your brain and turn</v>

3321
02:19:33.711 --> 02:19:37.170
<v Speaker 1>it back on inside a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you wake up and go,</v>

3322
02:19:37.171 --> 02:19:37.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3323
02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:38.293
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like waking up or would it just </v>

3324
02:19:39.411 --> 02:19:40.244
<v Speaker 1>be you're gone and it's just a copy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this copy's just functioning completely </v>

3325
02:19:43.641 --> 02:19:44.474
<v Speaker 1>on its own and it has no idea what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing because it's not connected to </v>

3326
02:19:47.811 --> 02:19:48.620
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>

3327
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not connected to all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should,</v>

3328
02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:51.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's like a leap of faith they </v>

3329
02:19:52.281 --> 02:19:55.940
<v Speaker 1>have to make before they hit the switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that that.</v>

3330
02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:56.953
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem of identity is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious one for people in terms of </v>

3331
02:20:00.681 --> 02:20:01.514
<v Speaker 1>longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of immortality will not only </v>

3332
02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:03.794
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the fact that if I can make </v>

3333
02:20:04.581 --> 02:20:05.540
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>michael shermer,</v>

3334
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:10.570
<v Speaker 1>if I can copy you have one or I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>spam you when I spam you all over europe</v>

3335
02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:13.400
<v Speaker 1>have a million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael shermer is all throughout India.</v>

3336
02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:15.350
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real problem,</v>

3337
02:20:15.351 --> 02:20:15.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3338
02:20:15.861 --> 02:20:16.694
<v Speaker 1>if you can mAke a copy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be immortal and you want </v>

3339
02:20:19.551 --> 02:20:20.384
<v Speaker 1>a copy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's to stop someone from making </v>

3340
02:20:21.411 --> 02:20:25.120
<v Speaker 1>multiple copies with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop Donald Trump and right?</v>

3341
02:20:25.430 --> 02:20:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far nobody.</v>

3342
02:20:26.391 --> 02:20:27.224
<v Speaker 1>But if he wants to make a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>donald trump's maniac was just the </v>

3343
02:20:31.491 --> 02:20:34.520
<v Speaker 1>moment you turn on the new copy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3344
02:20:34.521 --> 02:20:35.354
<v Speaker 1>they start having different memories </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're in a different </v>

3345
02:20:36.921 --> 02:20:39.830
<v Speaker 1>environment than a different body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're having different interactions.</v>

3346
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:40.663
<v Speaker 1>And so if it's a bioLogical system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's new neural connections </v>

3347
02:20:43.281 --> 02:20:46.310
<v Speaker 1>growing that are different than yours </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the joe rogan copy.</v>

3348
02:20:46.750 --> 02:20:50.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's no longer you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have the same past memories,</v>

3349
02:20:50.031 --> 02:20:52.220
<v Speaker 1>but you're now going to have different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like twins.</v>

3350
02:20:52.270 --> 02:20:53.103
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody thinks twins are identical in </v>

3351
02:20:55.351 --> 02:20:59.480
<v Speaker 1>person in personhood illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're treated as separate entities.</v>

3352
02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that is right.</v>

3353
02:21:01.491 --> 02:21:05.960
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's really what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what copies a ai copies will be.</v>

3354
02:21:05.961 --> 02:21:08.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just like twins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

3355
02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:09.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

3356
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:10.483
<v Speaker 1>the good point is from here on out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have different life </v>

3357
02:21:12.441 --> 02:21:13.274
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you made it an exact duplicate of </v>

3358
02:21:15.201 --> 02:21:16.034
<v Speaker 1>yourself at this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one went to New York and the other </v>

3359
02:21:18.351 --> 02:21:21.350
<v Speaker 1>one moved to miami,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have totally different lives,</v>

3360
02:21:21.351 --> 02:21:22.184
<v Speaker 1>totally different experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different blends going to be </v>

3361
02:21:23.661 --> 02:21:25.080
<v Speaker 1>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's going to be conservative,</v>

3362
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:26.923
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make different </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusions based on your life </v>

3363
02:21:28.311 --> 02:21:29.144
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just the reality of being a </v>

3364
02:21:30.951 --> 02:21:31.784
<v Speaker 1>person is that we're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulating data and processing it and </v>

3365
02:21:35.451 --> 02:21:36.284
<v Speaker 1>then also it's the environment that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>surround yourself with as far as the </v>

3366
02:21:38.931 --> 02:21:41.750
<v Speaker 1>unique individuals that you choose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate with.</v>

3367
02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:44.240
<v Speaker 1>They flavor who you are so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>RIght.</v>

3368
02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:46.190
<v Speaker 1>It's almost inseparable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

3369
02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:47.263
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult to look at a person as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual because every individual </v>

3370
02:21:50.811 --> 02:21:53.900
<v Speaker 1>is profoundly influenced by all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people around them.</v>

3371
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take this individual,</v>

3372
02:21:55.791 --> 02:21:56.624
<v Speaker 1>you move them to montreal and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>surround them with a bunch of people </v>

3373
02:21:58.941 --> 02:22:01.250
<v Speaker 1>that are totally different from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They learned french,</v>

3374
02:22:01.251 --> 02:22:05.680
<v Speaker 1>they started speaking with the quebecois</v>
<v Speaker 1>and next thing you know they're there.</v>

3375
02:22:05.681 --> 02:22:07.430
<v Speaker 1>It does a totally different human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3376
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:10.370
<v Speaker 1>You become different because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>People that you're around.</v>

3377
02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:11.141
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3378
02:22:11.141 --> 02:22:13.220
<v Speaker 1>you don't even exist in a vacuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3379
02:22:13.221 --> 02:22:15.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in terms of like trying to achieve in</v>

3380
02:22:15.451 --> 02:22:16.284
<v Speaker 1>mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the military ones or the </v>

3381
02:22:17.550 --> 02:22:19.650
<v Speaker 1>transhumanists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3382
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:22.100
<v Speaker 1>or the extropians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're against entropy.</v>

3383
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3384
02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 1>What's their theory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit</v>

3385
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:26.873
<v Speaker 2>like the transhumanist that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to slowly replace our body parts and in </v>

3386
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:32.850
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just new joints,</v>

3387
02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:33.713
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you would replace your nerve cells </v>

3388
02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:38.580
<v Speaker 2>and as long as you still have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the continuity,</v>

3389
02:22:38.581 --> 02:22:39.414
<v Speaker 2>it's still you as a person in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just uploading it to another </v>

3390
02:22:43.321 --> 02:22:44.630
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>

3391
02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:46.290
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going to do it.</v>

3392
02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The johnny depp inside the computer.</v>

3393
02:22:50.250 --> 02:22:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Turn it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Transcendence theory is.</v>

3394
02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that can happen right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may be wrong.</v>

3395
02:22:55.471 --> 02:22:58.590
<v Speaker 2>There are people that do think this can </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen but doesn't have to be you.</v>

3396
02:22:58.610 --> 02:23:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Can it be like something you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you personally one,</v>

3397
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:04.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'S like woody allen said,</v>

3398
02:23:04.171 --> 02:23:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to live on through my work </v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to live on,</v>

3399
02:23:06.481 --> 02:23:08.080
<v Speaker 2>in my apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3400
02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:11.960
<v Speaker 2>somebody said one of his many lines </v>
<v Speaker 2>about immortality.</v>

3401
02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3402
02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:16.890
<v Speaker 2>you inside the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the copy of you,</v>

3403
02:23:17.350 --> 02:23:19.650
<v Speaker 2>a copy of you is just the extension of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your work,</v>

3404
02:23:19.780 --> 02:23:20.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3405
02:23:20.310 --> 02:23:22.620
<v Speaker 2>this is a little bit of a copy of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my books and so on,</v>

3406
02:23:22.621 --> 02:23:23.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3407
02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:26.100
<v Speaker 2>and after I'm gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the books are still around,</v>

3408
02:23:26.101 --> 02:23:29.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like I'm still going.</v>

3409
02:23:29.770 --> 02:23:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Isn't there a problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in evolution,</v>

3410
02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:33.713
<v Speaker 2>which I assume you do and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you assume that people are going to </v>

3411
02:23:36.871 --> 02:23:41.490
<v Speaker 2>continue to change shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to continue.</v>

3412
02:23:41.491 --> 02:23:42.324
<v Speaker 2>I mean if we used to be multicell </v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms that are coming out of the </v>

3413
02:23:44.671 --> 02:23:48.360
<v Speaker 2>muck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primordial ooze and now were people,</v>

3414
02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:49.673
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to be a million years </v>

3415
02:23:50.611 --> 02:23:51.444
<v Speaker 2>from now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we going to stifle that and just </v>

3416
02:23:52.921 --> 02:23:56.160
<v Speaker 2>lock ourselves into this form?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a perfect form.</v>

3417
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.943
<v Speaker 2>One of the arguments is that we should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should take over evolution and we </v>

3418
02:24:00.481 --> 02:24:02.580
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so genetic engineering for examPle,</v>

3419
02:24:02.610 --> 02:24:04.420
<v Speaker 2>right now everybody's afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3420
02:24:04.421 --> 02:24:05.640
<v Speaker 2>they're going to make ariens or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3421
02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just,</v>

3422
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:09.480
<v Speaker 2>let's just allow it to happen to solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>alzheimer's,</v>

3423
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:11.040
<v Speaker 2>cure cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

3424
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Then we can worry about uploading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3425
02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:15.800
<v Speaker 2>more intelligence into our cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say for,</v>

3426
02:24:15.850 --> 02:24:18.330
<v Speaker 2>for what if we do to people what we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done to tomatoes,</v>

3427
02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:20.240
<v Speaker 2>make them boring and flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flavor,</v>

3428
02:24:20.390 --> 02:24:22.740
<v Speaker 2>flavor to last longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could happen.</v>

3429
02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:27.090
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

3430
02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:29.700
<v Speaker 2>we did tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fucked up tomatoes,</v>

3431
02:24:29.701 --> 02:24:30.780
<v Speaker 2>but they last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3432
02:24:31.150 --> 02:24:33.990
<v Speaker 2>in a way with international travel in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the internet now,</v>

3433
02:24:33.991 --> 02:24:37.140
<v Speaker 2>you know the poorest borders in </v>
<v Speaker 2>centuries or so,</v>

3434
02:24:37.580 --> 02:24:38.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone will look like tiger woods or </v>

3435
02:24:39.181 --> 02:24:40.130
<v Speaker 2>something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3436
02:24:41.130 --> 02:24:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I think the racial barriers will </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually dissolved.</v>

3437
02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Well then we'll find some new way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate each other.</v>

3438
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

3439
02:24:47.071 --> 02:24:48.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are super good at that,</v>

3440
02:24:49.390 --> 02:24:53.760
<v Speaker 2>but if we colonize another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say we started colony on mars in,</v>

3441
02:24:53.770 --> 02:24:57.870
<v Speaker 2>in a way that's a founder population </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can then begin to diverge away from</v>

3442
02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:02.250
<v Speaker 2>the earthly population and in a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>years you'd have two different species.</v>

3443
02:25:02.251 --> 02:25:03.084
<v Speaker 2>Say they could maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they'd probably still be able to </v>

3444
02:25:05.941 --> 02:25:08.100
<v Speaker 2>integrate because there's still </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections.</v>

3445
02:25:08.430 --> 02:25:09.263
<v Speaker 2>You'd also have a movable men that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a whole civilization to </v>

3446
02:25:11.171 --> 02:25:13.890
<v Speaker 2>people so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They decided to move to mars.</v>

3447
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:16.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a self selecting group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably.</v>

3448
02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:18.930
<v Speaker 2>They're probably not typical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not.</v>

3449
02:25:18.931 --> 02:25:19.764
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're also going to have to do </v>

3450
02:25:21.091 --> 02:25:24.450
<v Speaker 2>some crazy geoengineering and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to hope that that keeps it</v>

3451
02:25:25.170 --> 02:25:26.003
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scenario would be what kind of </v>

3452
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:27.543
<v Speaker 2>government would they set up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of economic system and </v>

3453
02:25:30.010 --> 02:25:31.960
<v Speaker 2>assuming they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of them were religious.</v>

3454
02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:33.880
<v Speaker 2>If he came back a thousand years from </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

3455
02:25:33.881 --> 02:25:37.870
<v Speaker 2>would they have a shrine to a god and </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and all this.</v>

3456
02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:42.920
<v Speaker 2>It happened again and then we'd have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>history archetype a.</v>

3457
02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:44.950
<v Speaker 2>It'd be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the interesting things about</v>

3458
02:25:44.951 --> 02:25:45.784
<v Speaker 2>scientology in the mormon church is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a clear recent history and a </v>

3459
02:25:49.330 --> 02:25:51.670
<v Speaker 2>paper trail to see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Videos,</v>

3460
02:25:51.970 --> 02:25:52.803
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have for christianity is </v>

3461
02:25:55.121 --> 02:25:55.954
<v Speaker 2>that it's old enough that it's lost in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the murkiness of time and it so you can </v>

3462
02:25:59.351 --> 02:26:02.230
<v Speaker 2>kind of fill in the blanks with miracles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>

3463
02:26:02.650 --> 02:26:03.483
<v Speaker 2>Here we know Joseph Smith was killed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then brigham young move to Utah to get </v>

3464
02:26:06.551 --> 02:26:07.384
<v Speaker 2>away from the authorities and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know exactly how it all unfolded </v>

3465
02:26:11.111 --> 02:26:13.870
<v Speaker 2>and so you can diagram how to start a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

3466
02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:14.733
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the whole mitt romney story </v>

3467
02:26:15.581 --> 02:26:17.050
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his family in Mexico,</v>

3468
02:26:17.051 --> 02:26:17.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3469
02:26:17.350 --> 02:26:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

3470
02:26:18.311 --> 02:26:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about that.</v>

3471
02:26:19.271 --> 02:26:20.104
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll move to Mexico when they couldn't </v>

3472
02:26:20.951 --> 02:26:22.290
<v Speaker 2>have 100 wives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3473
02:26:22.370 --> 02:26:23.081
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

3474
02:26:23.081 --> 02:26:23.914
<v Speaker 2>We're out of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swears his dad bringing me on was </v>

3475
02:26:26.381 --> 02:26:28.570
<v Speaker 2>originally against polygamy until.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3476
02:26:28.571 --> 02:26:30.250
<v Speaker 2>until he tried it and then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3477
02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:32.193
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite books is john </v>

3478
02:26:35.290 --> 02:26:37.930
<v Speaker 2>krakauer is under the banner of heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a great writer,</v>

3479
02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:39.393
<v Speaker 2>but he has a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of reconstructs the moment when </v>

3480
02:26:40.841 --> 02:26:41.674
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Smith tells his wife emma that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>got this revelation from god about </v>

3481
02:26:45.251 --> 02:26:47.440
<v Speaker 2>polygamy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Celestial marriage.</v>

3482
02:26:47.441 --> 02:26:48.274
<v Speaker 2>He called it and it basically is already</v>
<v Speaker 2>having an affair with this woman down </v>

3483
02:26:50.501 --> 02:26:51.730
<v Speaker 2>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically he goes,</v>

3484
02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:53.000
<v Speaker 2>well honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3485
02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to god and he told me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to have sex with so and so.</v>

3486
02:26:59.170 --> 02:27:01.270
<v Speaker 2>I know I couldn't believe it either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my friends,</v>

3487
02:27:01.271 --> 02:27:01.900
<v Speaker 2>they were all there.</v>

3488
02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:04.660
<v Speaker 2>They heard it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're telling their wives right now.</v>

3489
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ama says something like,</v>

3490
02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:08.133
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that case I'm going to have a extra </v>

3491
02:27:09.221 --> 02:27:10.054
<v Speaker 2>husbands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3492
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:12.550
<v Speaker 2>now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god was really clear about this.</v>

3493
02:27:12.551 --> 02:27:17.551
<v Speaker 2>It's just for the guys as this gets sold</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a viable,</v>

3494
02:27:17.810 --> 02:27:19.870
<v Speaker 2>a declaration of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3495
02:27:19.930 --> 02:27:21.820
<v Speaker 2>of revelations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's written down.</v>

3496
02:27:22.210 --> 02:27:25.060
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the first page of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book of mormon,</v>

3497
02:27:25.061 --> 02:27:26.240
<v Speaker 2>it's an affidavit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3498
02:27:26.241 --> 02:27:28.570
<v Speaker 2>we are the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw the gold tablets and so on.</v>

3499
02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with the revelation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>polygamy all the way until 18,</v>

3500
02:27:32.350 --> 02:27:35.140
<v Speaker 2>94 when the state of Utah wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a state.</v>

3501
02:27:35.141 --> 02:27:37.660
<v Speaker 2>And the federal government said not with</v>
<v Speaker 2>polygamy.</v>

3502
02:27:38.410 --> 02:27:39.243
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly they got a new revelation </v>
<v Speaker 2>from god changed my mind about the </v>

3503
02:27:41.651 --> 02:27:44.230
<v Speaker 2>polygamy thing back to monogamy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3504
02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:45.071
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3505
02:27:45.071 --> 02:27:47.140
<v Speaker 2>It could be a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not mitt romney's parents.</v>

3506
02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:48.190
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're out of here.</v>

3507
02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:49.690
<v Speaker 2>So you go to the fringes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3508
02:27:49.691 --> 02:27:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Colorado city and that was in the news </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday.</v>

3509
02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently the whole police force,</v>

3510
02:27:55.001 --> 02:27:55.834
<v Speaker 2>the courts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody that lives in this town is </v>

3511
02:27:57.671 --> 02:27:59.770
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're polygamous fan.</v>

3512
02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:01.200
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado cities.</v>

3513
02:28:01.460 --> 02:28:03.460
<v Speaker 2>That's right on the border of Utah and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona,</v>

3514
02:28:04.270 --> 02:28:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Colorado city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona.</v>

3515
02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:06.970
<v Speaker 2>I think art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's in Utah,</v>

3516
02:28:06.971 --> 02:28:11.130
<v Speaker 2>it's right on that road that goes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kayak and um,</v>

3517
02:28:11.410 --> 02:28:13.420
<v Speaker 2>and we've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We race across America.</v>

3518
02:28:13.421 --> 02:28:15.610
<v Speaker 2>used to go through on a route to get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>

3519
02:28:15.611 --> 02:28:18.160
<v Speaker 2>We'd go through northern Arizona in </v>
<v Speaker 2>southern Colorado.</v>

3520
02:28:18.250 --> 02:28:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Did they tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>

3521
02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:22.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

3522
02:28:22.050 --> 02:28:25.620
<v Speaker 1>drive through there and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at you and it's like,</v>

3523
02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:28.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like being in a twilight zone or </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiles episode,</v>

3524
02:28:28.361 --> 02:28:29.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they drive somewhere.</v>

3525
02:28:29.430 --> 02:28:33.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody's a little weird and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the dress.</v>

3526
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Clothing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is off a little bit.</v>

3527
02:28:36.201 --> 02:28:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Even like at the gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the denny's,</v>

3528
02:28:38.331 --> 02:28:40.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's something not quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

3529
02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:41.950
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go.</v>

3530
02:28:42.050 --> 02:28:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right now.</v>

3531
02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:45.420
<v Speaker 1>It's really a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:28:45.450 --> 02:28:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the polygamy should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

3533
02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I really don't because it's not illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live with 20 women.</v>

3534
02:28:50.420 --> 02:28:51.253
<v Speaker 1>If you just you who hugh hefner it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you decided to have like 20 women live </v>

3535
02:28:54.321 --> 02:28:55.430
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a king,</v>

3536
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:58.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you signed paperwork with them,</v>

3537
02:28:58.550 --> 02:29:00.380
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3538
02:29:00.381 --> 02:29:01.214
<v Speaker 1>the way they do it as they marry one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them legally and then the rest are so </v>

3539
02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:04.633
<v Speaker 1>called sister wives and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually married to them so they're not </v>

3540
02:29:07.041 --> 02:29:10.070
<v Speaker 1>breaking the law and there's no law </v>
<v Speaker 1>against having,</v>

3541
02:29:10.071 --> 02:29:11.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living with a bunch of women.</v>

3542
02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:14.630
<v Speaker 1>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the law only exists in terms of all</v>

3543
02:29:14.631 --> 02:29:18.020
<v Speaker 1>the other people outside of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>community or their neighborhood or their</v>

3544
02:29:18.021 --> 02:29:22.070
<v Speaker 1>family recognizing it and it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with if every.</v>

3545
02:29:22.110 --> 02:29:25.040
<v Speaker 1>If you have a law that says this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody in the town,</v>

3546
02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:28.610
<v Speaker 1>including the police captain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the courts,</v>

3547
02:29:28.730 --> 02:29:30.500
<v Speaker 1>well the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all in on it.</v>

3548
02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:31.393
<v Speaker 1>They're all in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I have conflicting feelings </v>

3549
02:29:34.341 --> 02:29:38.120
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about my libertarian tendencies.</v>

3550
02:29:38.121 --> 02:29:38.810
<v Speaker 1>We go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3551
02:29:38.810 --> 02:29:40.340
<v Speaker 1>adult people should do whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

3552
02:29:40.370 --> 02:29:42.950
<v Speaker 1>but why is the government in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage business in the first place?</v>

3553
02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:43.843
<v Speaker 1>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is when you study the </v>

3554
02:29:45.681 --> 02:29:47.280
<v Speaker 1>polygamous mormons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they.</v>

3555
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:49.130
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are young girls,</v>

3556
02:29:49.131 --> 02:29:50.120
<v Speaker 1>this warren jeffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jessica.</v>

3557
02:29:50.121 --> 02:29:53.450
<v Speaker 1>He was marrying twelve-year-olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was having sex with 11 year olds.</v>

3558
02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a proBlem.</v>

3559
02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:56.360
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3560
02:29:56.361 --> 02:29:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Well that's just a problem period with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's a grown adult who's having</v>

3561
02:29:59.991 --> 02:30:00.950
<v Speaker 1>sex with a young kid.</v>

3562
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:03.980
<v Speaker 1>That's obviously that goes without </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3563
02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:06.710
<v Speaker 1>but as long as the person's 21 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3564
02:30:06.711 --> 02:30:07.544
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think he should probably be 21 </v>

3565
02:30:08.481 --> 02:30:10.290
<v Speaker 1>before you even allowed to get married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3566
02:30:10.490 --> 02:30:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have got married if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was 18.</v>

3567
02:30:12.530 --> 02:30:14.240
<v Speaker 1>My girlfriend when I was 18 at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

3568
02:30:14.241 --> 02:30:15.440
<v Speaker 1>marry me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm breaking up with you.</v>

3569
02:30:15.441 --> 02:30:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

3570
02:30:16.530 --> 02:30:17.363
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3571
02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was lost.</v>

3572
02:30:18.910 --> 02:30:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too young.</v>

3573
02:30:19.971 --> 02:30:23.810
<v Speaker 1>You don't have enough information to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to do anything until they're 30.</v>

3574
02:30:24.290 --> 02:30:25.123
<v Speaker 1>Probably not even might be fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that you could tell some </v>

3575
02:30:29.780 --> 02:30:33.950
<v Speaker 1>adult that they can't sign a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper with another adult.</v>

3576
02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3577
02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:38.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just as preposterous to say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same sex marriage should be illegal,</v>

3578
02:30:38.700 --> 02:30:39.533
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

3579
02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:40.813
<v Speaker 1>Who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as they're not brainwashed when </v>

3580
02:30:43.251 --> 02:30:44.990
<v Speaker 1>they're little that they should be.</v>

3581
02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then maybe you're 21.</v>

3582
02:30:48.590 --> 02:30:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Are you really making a rational choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your future or are you there?</v>

3583
02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:55.730
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a problem with cults and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also the problem,</v>

3584
02:30:56.430 --> 02:30:57.590
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3585
02:30:57.591 --> 02:30:59.210
<v Speaker 1>well where's the line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get gray.</v>

3586
02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a mormon can't do it,</v>

3587
02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:03.770
<v Speaker 1>if you can't take someone when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really young,</v>

3588
02:31:03.771 --> 02:31:07.490
<v Speaker 1>raise them as a mormon and then wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become of age and they become an adult.</v>

3589
02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:08.593
<v Speaker 1>Tell them now you can get married and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be involved in this polygamous </v>

3590
02:31:12.411 --> 02:31:15.290
<v Speaker 1>marriage and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grew up in this religion.</v>

3591
02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Are they brainwash even though they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>are grown adult?</v>

3592
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>

3593
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 1>but what</v>

3594
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.903
<v Speaker 2>about alice ism or whatever and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the government can't be in the </v>

3595
02:31:24.001 --> 02:31:26.670
<v Speaker 2>business of judging that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a,</v>

3596
02:31:26.671 --> 02:31:27.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3597
02:31:27.350 --> 02:31:29.910
<v Speaker 2>it's a fine line there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough when you put your hand on the</v>

3598
02:31:29.911 --> 02:31:32.430
<v Speaker 2>bible when you swear to be in a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

3599
02:31:32.431 --> 02:31:33.264
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious weakens bible it still </v>

3600
02:31:35.431 --> 02:31:36.420
<v Speaker 2>lincoln's bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3601
02:31:36.421 --> 02:31:38.580
<v Speaker 2>that's who obama used was the lincoln's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bible.</v>

3602
02:31:38.581 --> 02:31:39.414
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3603
02:31:39.470 --> 02:31:40.303
<v Speaker 2>I am i.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I remembering that was at martin </v>

3604
02:31:42.571 --> 02:31:43.950
<v Speaker 2>luther king's bible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3605
02:31:43.951 --> 02:31:45.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mlk is bible.</v>

3606
02:31:45.631 --> 02:31:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

3607
02:31:46.891 --> 02:31:47.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3608
02:31:47.461 --> 02:31:49.100
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very telematic.</v>

3609
02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:52.620
<v Speaker 2>We're touching the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So dumb as if,</v>

3610
02:31:52.650 --> 02:31:53.483
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old testament is a font of moral </v>

3611
02:31:55.081 --> 02:31:57.270
<v Speaker 2>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the old testament they use?</v>

3612
02:31:57.540 --> 02:31:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing,</v>

3613
02:31:59.220 --> 02:32:00.053
<v Speaker 2>but is it the new testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old testament that he puts his hand </v>

3614
02:32:01.681 --> 02:32:02.441
<v Speaker 2>on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's both.</v>

3615
02:32:02.441 --> 02:32:05.790
<v Speaker 2>It's the bible that includes both that </v>
<v Speaker 2>polygamy was,</v>

3616
02:32:05.791 --> 02:32:07.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the great patriarchs.</v>

3617
02:32:07.170 --> 02:32:12.140
<v Speaker 2>There was a study by Helen Fisher now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a different anthropologist on um,</v>

3618
02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:13.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationshiP between power and sex </v>

3619
02:32:15.811 --> 02:32:16.644
<v Speaker 2>in the old testament and basically the </v>
<v Speaker 2>more power you had more women and wives </v>

3620
02:32:20.311 --> 02:32:22.590
<v Speaker 2>and girlfriends and concubines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>children you had,</v>

3621
02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:25.020
<v Speaker 2>how unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And solomon was the,</v>

3622
02:32:25.021 --> 02:32:25.854
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going for wilt chamberlains </v>

3623
02:32:26.461 --> 02:32:28.710
<v Speaker 2>record there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had 700 wives,</v>

3624
02:32:28.711 --> 02:32:30.540
<v Speaker 2>300 concubines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3625
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:32.640
<v Speaker 2>thousands of kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

3626
02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly,</v>

3627
02:32:34.650 --> 02:32:35.690
<v Speaker 2>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

3628
02:32:35.691 --> 02:32:36.301
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3629
02:32:36.301 --> 02:32:37.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>600 years old.</v>

3630
02:32:37.411 --> 02:32:38.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3631
02:32:39.180 --> 02:32:40.013
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the stuff probably didn't </v>

3632
02:32:40.741 --> 02:32:43.620
<v Speaker 2>actually happen in the old testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably moses never existed,</v>

3633
02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but the point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the way men treated women,</v>

3634
02:32:47.071 --> 02:32:47.904
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the patriarchal society at the </v>

3635
02:32:49.201 --> 02:32:50.670
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slavery was legal,</v>

3636
02:32:50.671 --> 02:32:53.700
<v Speaker 2>polygamy was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more power you had,</v>

3637
02:32:53.701 --> 02:32:55.920
<v Speaker 2>the more wealth you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more women you have,</v>

3638
02:32:55.921 --> 02:32:57.630
<v Speaker 2>the more children you had it.</v>

3639
02:32:57.890 --> 02:33:01.130
<v Speaker 2>That was the world of the old testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3640
02:33:01.140 --> 02:33:04.890
<v Speaker 2>and that's not the world we live in now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why are we still using this book?</v>

3641
02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3642
02:33:06.030 --> 02:33:06.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3643
02:33:06.570 --> 02:33:07.740
<v Speaker 2>nobody would embrace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3644
02:33:07.741 --> 02:33:11.070
<v Speaker 2>christian today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would embrace most of the stuff that's</v>

3645
02:33:11.071 --> 02:33:12.270
<v Speaker 2>in the bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just wouldn't.</v>

3646
02:33:12.271 --> 02:33:14.220
<v Speaker 2>So when they say I get my morals from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bible,</v>

3647
02:33:14.221 --> 02:33:14.730
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3648
02:33:14.730 --> 02:33:15.563
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

3649
02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:18.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting your morals from the same</v>

3650
02:33:18.421 --> 02:33:20.040
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We nonbelievers get it.</v>

3651
02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3652
02:33:21.151 --> 02:33:25.410
<v Speaker 2>we were inculcating it from culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the enlightenment secular values.</v>

3653
02:33:25.470 --> 02:33:26.303
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glaD you brought that up because </v>

3654
02:33:26.611 --> 02:33:29.910
<v Speaker 2>that was an article that I've read that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had written about islam,</v>

3655
02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:33.370
<v Speaker 2>that islam was the only religion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had not gone through the advertisement.</v>

3656
02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3657
02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:34.873
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting article and a very </v>

3658
02:33:36.451 --> 02:33:37.284
<v Speaker 2>important point.</v>

3659
02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:38.340
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>

3660
02:33:38.341 --> 02:33:40.470
<v Speaker 2>they used to be head jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3661
02:33:40.471 --> 02:33:42.770
<v Speaker 2>and witches were burned at the stake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3662
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean the kinds of stuff isis does </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

3663
02:33:44.521 --> 02:33:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Christians used to do that centuries </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

3664
02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:49.500
<v Speaker 2>It's very common and they stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3665
02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law changed.</v>

3666
02:33:51.051 --> 02:33:51.884
<v Speaker 2>That culture changed and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment era ushered in secular </v>

3667
02:33:55.501 --> 02:33:56.334
<v Speaker 2>values that all people should be treated</v>
<v Speaker 2>equally under the law that people are </v>

3668
02:33:58.741 --> 02:34:00.960
<v Speaker 2>born with equal rights and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3669
02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:02.160
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

3670
02:34:02.180 --> 02:34:03.013
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that all changed everything and </v>

3671
02:34:05.131 --> 02:34:06.930
<v Speaker 2>everybody is incorporate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just thinking about,</v>

3672
02:34:07.010 --> 02:34:10.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm a member when the owners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a former owner,</v>

3673
02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:13.110
<v Speaker 2>the clippers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>donald sterling made these remarks,</v>

3674
02:34:13.460 --> 02:34:16.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most old guys thought like that just</v>

3675
02:34:16.381 --> 02:34:18.430
<v Speaker 2>50 years ago and weren't particularly.</v>

3676
02:34:19.330 --> 02:34:22.390
<v Speaker 1>His remarks were pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty innocuous.</v>

3677
02:34:22.450 --> 02:34:24.400
<v Speaker 1>What he has said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a girlfriend,</v>

3678
02:34:24.430 --> 02:34:25.263
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing has been blown out of </v>

3679
02:34:26.021 --> 02:34:26.854
<v Speaker 1>proportion so bad and yet he had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and he asked her not to take </v>

3680
02:34:31.181 --> 02:34:33.850
<v Speaker 1>pictures with these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These black guys.</v>

3681
02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.910
<v Speaker 1>He said in the same sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fuck them.</v>

3682
02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't take pictures with them.</v>

3683
02:34:39.730 --> 02:34:40.720
<v Speaker 1>It was already said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3684
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:43.360
<v Speaker 1>they need to clear that part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Print any of that.</v>

3685
02:34:43.361 --> 02:34:44.194
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody was talking about the the </v>

3686
02:34:45.890 --> 02:34:46.723
<v Speaker 1>don't take pictures of the black eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he knew what he was saying was </v>

3687
02:34:49.991 --> 02:34:52.480
<v Speaker 1>that you're sticking it in my face that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking on these guys.</v>

3688
02:34:52.650 --> 02:34:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't take pictures of.</v>

3689
02:34:54.750 --> 02:34:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3690
02:34:55.790 --> 02:34:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Saying this to his girlfriend in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>privacy of his house.</v>

3691
02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:02.920
<v Speaker 1>He didn't use any racial slurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say anything terrible.</v>

3692
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:03.783
<v Speaker 1>All he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take pictures of these guys </v>

3693
02:35:05.650 --> 02:35:08.470
<v Speaker 1>because she was a slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly,</v>

3694
02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:09.693
<v Speaker 1>she's banging a bunch of dudes and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't care because he's like 80 years </v>

3695
02:35:11.801 --> 02:35:12.634
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like buying or condos and rolls </v>

3696
02:35:14.171 --> 02:35:15.220
<v Speaker 1>royces and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

3697
02:35:15.370 --> 02:35:17.110
<v Speaker 1>he just wants to keep banging her </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she's hot,</v>

3698
02:35:17.170 --> 02:35:18.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

3699
02:35:18.041 --> 02:35:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't care for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3700
02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:23.560
<v Speaker 1>you're still have higher standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's,</v>

3701
02:35:23.830 --> 02:35:25.390
<v Speaker 1>he looks like jabba the hutt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3702
02:35:25.391 --> 02:35:27.140
<v Speaker 1>his face has fallen off his bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3703
02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:31.330
<v Speaker 1>So for that poor guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that last him,</v>

3704
02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:32.530
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his team,</v>

3705
02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:35.200
<v Speaker 1>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it shows you how far we've come.</v>

3706
02:35:35.201 --> 02:35:36.130
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>

3707
02:35:36.131 --> 02:35:36.964
<v Speaker 1>most old guys in the fifties would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought nothing about saying that </v>

3708
02:35:39.310 --> 02:35:40.150
<v Speaker 1>publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3709
02:35:40.151 --> 02:35:40.984
<v Speaker 1>But apparently he was pretty racist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what they caught him with a small </v>

3710
02:35:45.941 --> 02:35:48.160
<v Speaker 1>little slice of what he had done.</v>

3711
02:35:48.310 --> 02:35:50.510
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously allegedly blah blah </v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

3712
02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:51.693
<v Speaker 1>But apparently it wasn't a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why this was so reinforced and </v>

3713
02:35:55.330 --> 02:35:57.360
<v Speaker 1>why people went after him so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3714
02:35:57.370 --> 02:35:58.203
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got him which has run with this and </v>

3715
02:35:59.411 --> 02:36:03.070
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's a pr nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3716
02:36:03.071 --> 02:36:05.890
<v Speaker 1>people evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think now in today's day and age,</v>

3717
02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:10.920
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thinking like racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking justifiably so is gross.</v>

3718
02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:15.880
<v Speaker 1>It's frowned upon absolute learning we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are learning yet.</v>

3719
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean the moral arc,</v>

3720
02:36:17.231 --> 02:36:18.740
<v Speaker 1>that's what that's about tracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3721
02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:20.950
<v Speaker 1>how much moral progress we've made over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the centuries,</v>

3722
02:36:20.980 --> 02:36:24.130
<v Speaker 1>particularly just the last 50 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the civil rights movement.</v>

3723
02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:27.070
<v Speaker 1>It's one reason why I think all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>campus protests,</v>

3724
02:36:27.071 --> 02:36:27.904
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten so out of hand there so </v>
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate because the students </v>

3725
02:36:30.581 --> 02:36:31.414
<v Speaker 1>have a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a module there still passionate about </v>

3726
02:36:34.210 --> 02:36:37.930
<v Speaker 1>making the world a better place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the big stuff's been taken.</v>

3727
02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:40.990
<v Speaker 1>It's all done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it down to halloween costumes,</v>

3728
02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:44.200
<v Speaker 1>taco tuesdays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wore a sombrero.</v>

3729
02:36:44.470 --> 02:36:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Cultural appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3730
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:50.020
<v Speaker 1>they're all fired up about what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>view it as just like safe spaces.</v>

3731
02:36:50.021 --> 02:36:51.520
<v Speaker 1>That's where ideas go to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3732
02:36:51.521 --> 02:36:52.354
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's safe spaces such such a stupid </v>

3733
02:36:54.011 --> 02:36:57.290
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any argument that's worth it,</v>

3734
02:36:57.300 --> 02:36:58.133
<v Speaker 1>it has to stand on its own merits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to discuss things </v>

3735
02:37:00.641 --> 02:37:03.550
<v Speaker 1>like having a university where you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss ideas,</v>

3736
02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:07.390
<v Speaker 1>would even even bad ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad ideas should be debated.</v>

3737
02:37:08.050 --> 02:37:12.850
<v Speaker 1>The idea that they won't let these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives perform or speeches at the</v>

3738
02:37:12.851 --> 02:37:15.040
<v Speaker 1>universities and they tried to shut them</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

3739
02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:16.280
<v Speaker 1>scream at people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

3740
02:37:16.281 --> 02:37:18.560
<v Speaker 1>They hit fire alarms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3741
02:37:18.561 --> 02:37:19.740
<v Speaker 1>it's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3742
02:37:19.810 --> 02:37:20.643
<v Speaker 1>it's everything that you're not supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do when you're defending and </v>

3743
02:37:22.701 --> 02:37:24.710
<v Speaker 1>exploring ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the deeper,</v>

3744
02:37:24.711 --> 02:37:25.544
<v Speaker 1>the deepest cause of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the asymmetry between left and right </v>

3745
02:37:29.991 --> 02:37:31.100
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the academy?</v>

3746
02:37:31.130 --> 02:37:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in some of these departments.</v>

3747
02:37:34.071 --> 02:37:38.150
<v Speaker 1>It's 20 to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a liberal conservative democrat,</v>

3748
02:37:38.151 --> 02:37:39.410
<v Speaker 1>republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3749
02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:41.750
<v Speaker 1>only in the economics department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social sciences.</v>

3750
02:37:41.751 --> 02:37:44.720
<v Speaker 1>do you get something like a balance </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere else it's super slanted.</v>

3751
02:37:45.260 --> 02:37:46.240
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

3752
02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:47.540
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting this added.</v>

3753
02:37:47.570 --> 02:37:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what the truth is.</v>

3754
02:37:49.211 --> 02:37:50.044
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't know what the truth is </v>

3755
02:37:51.321 --> 02:37:52.154
<v Speaker 1>and you need to listen to the other side</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what has driven science </v>

3756
02:37:55.551 --> 02:37:56.384
<v Speaker 1>and reason and the enlightenment is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is open open debate because I might not </v>

3757
02:37:59.961 --> 02:38:00.794
<v Speaker 1>be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the only way to find out is if I </v>

3758
02:38:02.151 --> 02:38:05.360
<v Speaker 1>ask you your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I tell my students,</v>

3759
02:38:05.361 --> 02:38:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>

3760
02:38:06.291 --> 02:38:08.690
<v Speaker 1>you gotta read the wall street journal </v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to the New York times,</v>

3761
02:38:08.691 --> 02:38:10.390
<v Speaker 1>you got to listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3762
02:38:10.430 --> 02:38:13.880
<v Speaker 1>conservative talk radio in addition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>npr and you gotta you gotta hear it,</v>

3763
02:38:13.881 --> 02:38:15.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he listened to rush limbaugh.</v>

3764
02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:16.213
<v Speaker 1>Oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he's a knuckle dragging a mouth </v>

3765
02:38:17.331 --> 02:38:18.164
<v Speaker 1>breather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But somebody on that side just to see </v>

3766
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:23.580
<v Speaker 1>what listening to larry elder there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like larry elder.</v>

3767
02:38:23.581 --> 02:38:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a conservative,</v>

3768
02:38:25.131 --> 02:38:27.350
<v Speaker 1>but he's a little bit more rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot more,</v>

3769
02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:32.000
<v Speaker 1>little more libertarian arguments are </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

3770
02:38:32.260 --> 02:38:33.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to know what the other </v>

3771
02:38:34.371 --> 02:38:37.280
<v Speaker 1>side really thinks because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why do they believe that?</v>

3772
02:38:37.310 --> 02:38:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to listen to their arguments to</v>

3773
02:38:40.101 --> 02:38:42.050
<v Speaker 1>at least be able to articulate why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wrong.</v>

3774
02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:43.013
<v Speaker 1>If you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you really don't know why they're </v>

3775
02:38:44.301 --> 02:38:45.320
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3776
02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And find,</v>

3777
02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:48.033
<v Speaker 1>try to like balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like look at things through their </v>

3778
02:38:50.391 --> 02:38:51.224
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't agree with their </v>

3779
02:38:51.861 --> 02:38:53.750
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just relax yourself,</v>

3780
02:38:53.780 --> 02:38:54.613
<v Speaker 1>relax yourself and allow you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allow yourself To explore the way they </v>

3781
02:38:57.681 --> 02:38:58.910
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3782
02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I follow a bunch of wackadoos on twitter</v>

3783
02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:06.440
<v Speaker 1>just so I can listen to them read their </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3784
02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I follow this one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a young earth christian who,</v>

3785
02:39:09.801 --> 02:39:10.634
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day we'll talk about how horrible </v>

3786
02:39:11.961 --> 02:39:12.794
<v Speaker 1>obama obama's the death in this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will follow this guy and follow </v>

3787
02:39:16.221 --> 02:39:19.220
<v Speaker 1>people who retweet him and go to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>links and go to their blogs,</v>

3788
02:39:19.230 --> 02:39:20.063
<v Speaker 1>read their blog or what the fuck just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm just trying to explore how </v>

3789
02:39:24.831 --> 02:39:27.980
<v Speaker 1>their mind works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to try to piece together how much</v>

3790
02:39:27.981 --> 02:39:31.760
<v Speaker 1>of it is just a bold blanket hatred of </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals.</v>

3791
02:39:31.950 --> 02:39:34.490
<v Speaker 1>How much of it is racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is this,</v>

3792
02:39:34.491 --> 02:39:35.324
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just trying to objectively assess </v>

3793
02:39:37.821 --> 02:39:41.510
<v Speaker 1>where their mindset is and what the root</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their thinking is.</v>

3794
02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:42.913
<v Speaker 1>That's what I did back in the nineties </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the holocaust denial movement </v>

3795
02:39:45.081 --> 02:39:45.914
<v Speaker 1>started taking off and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys were appearing on montel </v>

3796
02:39:48.441 --> 02:39:51.290
<v Speaker 1>williams and donahue and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3797
02:39:51.291 --> 02:39:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this about?</v>

3798
02:39:52.431 --> 02:39:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Turns out they're in their offices in </v>
<v Speaker 1>costa mesa.</v>

3799
02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:58.520
<v Speaker 1>So I drove down there and I just sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>down with the.</v>

3800
02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:01.970
<v Speaker 1>They have a little journal of historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>review and it's like,</v>

3801
02:40:01.971 --> 02:40:03.110
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are these guys?</v>

3802
02:40:03.470 --> 02:40:05.480
<v Speaker 1>So we had beer and pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3803
02:40:05.481 --> 02:40:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I just started to get them to open up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

3804
02:40:06.691 --> 02:40:08.620
<v Speaker 1>what is your story here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3805
02:40:08.690 --> 02:40:10.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way to find out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3806
02:40:10.260 --> 02:40:12.100
<v Speaker 1>what's really behind their arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3807
02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:13.830
<v Speaker 1>They have these arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why they're wrong.</v>

3808
02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3809
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.903
<v Speaker 2>but why are they making these arguments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way to find out is actually </v>

3810
02:40:17.191 --> 02:40:18.024
<v Speaker 2>talked to them and why were they making </v>
<v Speaker 2>their arguments if some of it's at pure </v>

3811
02:40:20.641 --> 02:40:21.474
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also there's some conspiratorial </v>

3812
02:40:23.971 --> 02:40:24.661
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3813
02:40:24.661 --> 02:40:26.970
<v Speaker 2>the jews are doing this but not just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jews,</v>

3814
02:40:26.971 --> 02:40:28.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media that this.</v>

3815
02:40:28.021 --> 02:40:28.854
<v Speaker 2>And that is one of those exposing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery thing because it's a little bit </v>

3816
02:40:31.441 --> 02:40:32.210
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3817
02:40:32.210 --> 02:40:33.330
<v Speaker 2>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3818
02:40:33.331 --> 02:40:35.500
<v Speaker 2>they don't want us to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>

3819
02:40:35.530 --> 02:40:36.390
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the thing?</v>

3820
02:40:36.430 --> 02:40:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Because that's us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3821
02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

3822
02:40:38.530 --> 02:40:42.690
<v Speaker 2>they have the super power and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of that behind there.</v>

3823
02:40:42.691 --> 02:40:44.200
<v Speaker 2>And then also there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3824
02:40:44.220 --> 02:40:48.380
<v Speaker 2>basically I can get attention by saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>this wacko back,</v>

3825
02:40:48.381 --> 02:40:49.214
<v Speaker 2>the wackadoodle kind of stuff and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>people pay attention to me and that </v>

3826
02:40:52.081 --> 02:40:53.730
<v Speaker 2>feels good and so I'll run with it.</v>

3827
02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:55.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>david irvine was there,</v>

3828
02:40:55.191 --> 02:40:56.770
<v Speaker 2>a big intellectual and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3829
02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:00.000
<v Speaker 2>he was self trained historian but also a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty smart guy,</v>

3830
02:41:00.001 --> 02:41:02.400
<v Speaker 2>good writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote some,</v>

3831
02:41:02.430 --> 02:41:04.950
<v Speaker 2>his early stuff on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on gerbils and,</v>

3832
02:41:04.951 --> 02:41:06.890
<v Speaker 2>and some of the stuff on the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>world war was,</v>

3833
02:41:06.891 --> 02:41:07.860
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was quite good.</v>

3834
02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:11.520
<v Speaker 2>But then he found he wasn't in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>academies,</v>

3835
02:41:11.850 --> 02:41:12.683
<v Speaker 2>self-taught and just published his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>books and kind of made a living doing </v>

3836
02:41:15.181 --> 02:41:16.014
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he found that when he started </v>

3837
02:41:18.061 --> 02:41:19.290
<v Speaker 2>migrating toward this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3838
02:41:19.291 --> 02:41:20.124
<v Speaker 2>maybe hitler didn't know about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>holocaust and it was really gerbils and </v>

3839
02:41:23.251 --> 02:41:25.740
<v Speaker 2>himmler and they're the ones that did it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hitler didn't know.</v>

3840
02:41:25.741 --> 02:41:28.770
<v Speaker 2>You've all of a sudden he gets all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and then he,</v>

3841
02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:30.033
<v Speaker 2>he concocts this idea of I'll give a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars to anybody that can </v>

3842
02:41:32.881 --> 02:41:36.510
<v Speaker 2>show me the order from hitler to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to orchestrate the holocaust.</v>

3843
02:41:36.511 --> 02:41:38.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hereby command,</v>

3844
02:41:38.161 --> 02:41:39.690
<v Speaker 2>we exterminate the jews.</v>

3845
02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no such order,</v>

3846
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:42.983
<v Speaker 2>there's no single point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole conglomerate of little </v>

3847
02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:45.773
<v Speaker 2>steps along the way from sterilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the feebleminded in the early </v>

3848
02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:53.280
<v Speaker 2>thirties all the way up to gassing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3849
02:41:53.281 --> 02:41:56.100
<v Speaker 2>There's like a hundred steps in between </v>
<v Speaker 2>so there is no single order,</v>

3850
02:41:56.490 --> 02:41:59.640
<v Speaker 2>but that got him all this attention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden he's a big star at these</v>

3851
02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:00.653
<v Speaker 2>conferences where these people meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went to some of these and it's </v>

3852
02:42:03.241 --> 02:42:04.051
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

3853
02:42:04.051 --> 02:42:04.884
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is being worshiped as this great </v>

3854
02:42:06.211 --> 02:42:09.420
<v Speaker 2>scholar and and you could sort of see </v>
<v Speaker 2>how it fed,</v>

3855
02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:12.030
<v Speaker 2>fed the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of attention.</v>

3856
02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:13.193
<v Speaker 2>So I think that we can't discount it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just appear psychology of getting some </v>

3857
02:42:16.741 --> 02:42:17.574
<v Speaker 2>attention for your views as pushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people further than they would normally </v>

3858
02:42:20.401 --> 02:42:21.121
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3859
02:42:21.121 --> 02:42:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that'S a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good point because there's a,</v>

3860
02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:24.513
<v Speaker 2>there's a massive attraction to that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are massively attracted to </v>

3861
02:42:28.770 --> 02:42:31.890
<v Speaker 2>anything that can get them a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

3862
02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Even for a ridiculously controversial </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

3863
02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:35.873
<v Speaker 2>Have you paid attention lately and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the most confusing things </v>

3864
02:42:38.751 --> 02:42:39.584
<v Speaker 2>that's been going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a gang of people that believe </v>

3865
02:42:42.211 --> 02:42:44.100
<v Speaker 2>the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

3866
02:42:44.780 --> 02:42:46.440
<v Speaker 2>They're paying attention to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>

3867
02:42:46.441 --> 02:42:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that in 2016,</v>

3868
02:42:50.011 --> 02:42:50.844
<v Speaker 2>this is really a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there is a movement that believes </v>

3869
02:42:53.041 --> 02:42:53.874
<v Speaker 2>that all of the iss pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are all fake and that all the </v>

3870
02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:02.550
<v Speaker 2>pictures are just getting attention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing more.</v>

3871
02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they really believe I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched some videos.</v>

3872
02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:06.330
<v Speaker 2>these fucking people bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3873
02:43:06.331 --> 02:43:09.000
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who believes it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>loosely based friend.</v>

3879
02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:22.960

<v Speaker 2>free speech.</v>

3880
02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:24.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people should not be centered.</v>

3881
02:43:24.551 --> 02:43:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Let them say what they want to say and </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

3888
02:43:38.470 --> 02:43:40.180

<v Speaker 2>when there's an eclipse,</v>

3889
02:43:40.181 --> 02:43:42.820
<v Speaker 2>you can see the shadow of the earth on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon.</v>

02:43:44.561 --> 02:43:47.050
<v Speaker 2>it's current.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the government with a projector.</v>

3892
02:43:47.130 --> 02:43:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3893
02:43:48.490 --> 02:43:50.640
<v Speaker 2>but you can go out in your own backyard </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no good.</v>

3894
02:43:50.641 --> 02:43:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NoW what they'll say is,</v>

3895
02:43:51.641 --> 02:43:54.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's round like a pizza flat round.</v>

3896
02:43:54.190 --> 02:43:55.023
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3897
02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:56.920
<v Speaker 2>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that were true,</v>

3898
02:43:56.921 --> 02:43:59.110
<v Speaker 2>then why are all the continents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3899
02:43:59.130 --> 02:44:01.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't all the continents located on</v>

3900
02:44:01.181 --> 02:44:02.320
<v Speaker 2>the one side of the pizza?</v>

3901
02:44:02.770 --> 02:44:03.603
<v Speaker 2>And if they're on the flip side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get from one continent to </v>

3902
02:44:06.101 --> 02:44:08.320
<v Speaker 2>another when you do a transcontinental </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight?</v>

3903
02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:09.393
<v Speaker 2>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3904
02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:10.293
<v Speaker 2>you're curving around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not all of a sudden hitting an </v>

3905
02:44:12.131 --> 02:44:14.350
<v Speaker 2>edge and then flipping around to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>backside of the pizza.</v>

3906
02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:16.880
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a second reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3907
02:44:17.530 --> 02:44:19.540
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're high up and you look out,</v>

3908
02:44:19.541 --> 02:44:22.480
<v Speaker 2>you can see the mass of a ship sailing </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

3909
02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:23.713
<v Speaker 2>The whole goes first and then you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mass last because it's curved and </v>

3910
02:44:28.570 --> 02:44:29.081
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

3911
02:44:29.081 --> 02:44:29.914
<v Speaker 2>So there's all these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you put a stick here and 500 miles </v>

3912
02:44:33.971 --> 02:44:34.660
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it.</v>

3913
02:44:34.660 --> 02:44:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tucumcari New Mexico that's a thousand</v>

3914
02:44:37.630 --> 02:44:39.280
<v Speaker 2>miles from la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put a stick there at noon,</v>

3915
02:44:39.281 --> 02:44:43.810
<v Speaker 2>at the same time they'll have different </v>
<v Speaker 2>shadows because the earth is curved,</v>

3916
02:44:43.811 --> 02:44:47.200
<v Speaker 2>so they're good at 12 noon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually 1:00</v>

3917
02:44:47.201 --> 02:44:48.034
<v Speaker 2>in New Mexico when it's 12 noon in la </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we have time zones </v>

3918
02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:52.180
<v Speaker 2>because it's curved.</v>

3919
02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3920
02:44:53.890 --> 02:44:56.290
<v Speaker 2>and when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you want to watch a rocket,</v>

3921
02:44:56.291 --> 02:44:59.590
<v Speaker 2>a space x rocket or nasa rocket launch </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Florida,</v>

3922
02:44:59.890 --> 02:45:00.723
<v Speaker 2>it arcs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's arcane because it's going into </v>

3923
02:45:02.651 --> 02:45:04.990
<v Speaker 2>orbit and the earth is curved so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to arch out.</v>

3924
02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it would just go straight up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't do that anyway.</v>

3925
02:45:08.291 --> 02:45:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Those are five different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3926
02:45:09.551 --> 02:45:10.384
<v Speaker 2>quick reasons is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you sound like a shill for this </v>

3927
02:45:13.601 --> 02:45:17.020
<v Speaker 2>round bullshit government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

3928
02:45:17.021 --> 02:45:17.854
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of the co-discovered natural </v>

3929
02:45:19.601 --> 02:45:21.700
<v Speaker 2>selection with darwin guy named alfred </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell Wallace.</v>

3930
02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.030
<v Speaker 2>He was nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was way out there.</v>

3931
02:45:24.031 --> 02:45:24.864
<v Speaker 2>I wrote my biography on him and he came </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with a dream that connected darwin's </v>

3932
02:45:30.251 --> 02:45:31.084
<v Speaker 2>theories together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is darwin's theories and his </v>

3933
02:45:34.571 --> 02:45:37.480
<v Speaker 2>theories came together like darwin had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

3934
02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:38.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With natural selection.</v>

3935
02:45:39.010 --> 02:45:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Who's trying to figure out how to piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>it all together.</v>

3936
02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:44.000
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His ideas were not quite there.</v>

3937
02:45:44.001 --> 02:45:45.670
<v Speaker 2>There is a conspiracy theory about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3938
02:45:45.671 --> 02:45:46.360
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3939
02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:48.320
<v Speaker 2>that darwin cribbed from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3940
02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:50.200
<v Speaker 2>from wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the case,</v>

3941
02:45:50.201 --> 02:45:51.034
<v Speaker 2>what it is for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that they sort of combined the </v>

3942
02:45:53.270 --> 02:45:55.870
<v Speaker 2>simultaneous thing and they were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>correspondence.</v>

3943
02:45:56.170 --> 02:45:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Wallace actually incorporated some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>darwin's work.</v>

3944
02:45:58.391 --> 02:45:59.224
<v Speaker 2>Darwin was older than him and he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>already done quite a bit more work than </v>

3945
02:46:01.331 --> 02:46:03.280
<v Speaker 2>wallace head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in any case,</v>

3946
02:46:03.281 --> 02:46:04.114
<v Speaker 2>wallace was super open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example of being too open </v>

3947
02:46:06.981 --> 02:46:10.580
<v Speaker 2>minded in darwin was open and he came up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with new ideas,</v>

3948
02:46:10.581 --> 02:46:14.060
<v Speaker 2>but he's also very skeptical of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole spiritual seance movement that was</v>

3949
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:16.550
<v Speaker 2>getting big in england.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walsh's wallace,</v>

3950
02:46:16.551 --> 02:46:17.384
<v Speaker 2>he would go to these seances and hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands and the table would levitate </v>

3951
02:46:20.561 --> 02:46:22.510
<v Speaker 2>in darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't hear about darwin.</v>

3952
02:46:22.511 --> 02:46:24.470
<v Speaker 2>We'd just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to us say,</v>

3953
02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:25.940
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking kidding me?</v>

3954
02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:27.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>

3955
02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:29.960
<v Speaker 2>And Thomas Henry huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other great scientists said,</v>

3956
02:46:29.970 --> 02:46:31.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay,</v>

3957
02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:33.920
<v Speaker 2>pay five shillings to talk to bottle to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dead.</v>

3958
02:46:33.921 --> 02:46:34.754
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

3959
02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:36.020
<v Speaker 2>but wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

3960
02:46:36.021 --> 02:46:36.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3961
02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:39.190
<v Speaker 2>this might be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3962
02:46:39.270 --> 02:46:43.910
<v Speaker 2>so he was in and then he made the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake of answering an ad in a magazine</v>

3963
02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:47.210
<v Speaker 2>for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of one of these flat earthers who said,</v>

3964
02:46:47.211 --> 02:46:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I give fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3965
02:46:47.910 --> 02:46:49.790
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds to 500 pounds,</v>

3966
02:46:49.791 --> 02:46:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can prove the earth is round.</v>

3967
02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:54.170
<v Speaker 2>So what year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was 18.</v>

3968
02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:56.870
<v Speaker 2>This was the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a psa.</v>

3969
02:46:56.990 --> 02:46:59.510
<v Speaker 2>18 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so while I said,</v>

3970
02:46:59.511 --> 02:47:00.344
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do it.</v>

3971
02:47:00.770 --> 02:47:01.603
<v Speaker 2>So they went to the old bedford canal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like 20 miles straight without </v>

3972
02:47:06.231 --> 02:47:07.064
<v Speaker 2>a band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could set up two little </v>

3973
02:47:09.140 --> 02:47:10.200
<v Speaker 2>telescopes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3974
02:47:10.210 --> 02:47:12.500
<v Speaker 2>those little survey or telescopes.</v>

3975
02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:14.850
<v Speaker 2>And they put a mark on a bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3976
02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:18.590
<v Speaker 2>And so when I'm looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's one,</v>

3977
02:47:18.591 --> 02:47:19.580
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three marks.</v>

3978
02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:22.100
<v Speaker 2>If it's straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it should be all lined up.</v>

3979
02:47:22.101 --> 02:47:22.934
<v Speaker 2>If it's curved than the one here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly three feet above the </v>

3980
02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:26.090
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this one here,</v>

3981
02:47:26.091 --> 02:47:28.850
<v Speaker 2>that's five miles down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the canal,</v>

3982
02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:30.560
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be lined up.</v>

3983
02:47:30.561 --> 02:47:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Or if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dropped a little bit.</v>

3984
02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:33.133
<v Speaker 2>And in five miles you could actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure a little bit of the earth's </v>

3985
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:36.350
<v Speaker 2>curve by like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3986
02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:38.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like a centimeter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a centimeter or something.</v>

3987
02:47:38.450 --> 02:47:39.201
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is,</v>

3988
02:47:39.201 --> 02:47:39.891
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

3989
02:47:39.891 --> 02:47:40.724
<v Speaker 2>There's the old bedford canal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wallace did that and they had a </v>

3990
02:47:43.221 --> 02:47:46.550
<v Speaker 2>neutral judge who looked through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>telescope and said,</v>

3991
02:47:46.551 --> 02:47:47.510
<v Speaker 2>yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's curved,</v>

3992
02:47:47.511 --> 02:47:49.010
<v Speaker 2>it's dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3993
02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:52.330
<v Speaker 2>and this guy that flatter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they refuse to look through the,</v>

3994
02:47:52.350 --> 02:47:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to look through there.</v>

3995
02:47:53.450 --> 02:47:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I know you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3996
02:47:55.480 --> 02:47:56.450
<v Speaker 2>and wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3997
02:47:56.600 --> 02:47:59.630
<v Speaker 2>so he had to sue this guy to collect the</v>
<v Speaker 2>prize money.</v>

3998
02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:01.033
<v Speaker 2>This is why you shouldn't get involved </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a wackadoodle people too far </v>

3999
02:48:03.471 --> 02:48:04.304
<v Speaker 2>because he spent 15 years dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy and this guy was sending crazy </v>

4000
02:48:09.201 --> 02:48:12.020
<v Speaker 2>letters to his wife and to the natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>geographical.</v>

4001
02:48:12.130 --> 02:48:15.020
<v Speaker 2>I actually found some of these letters </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the national geographical society,</v>

4002
02:48:15.410 --> 02:48:16.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy threatening,</v>

4003
02:48:16.851 --> 02:48:17.684
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got this crazy man wallace </v>

4004
02:48:19.461 --> 02:48:20.600
<v Speaker 2>working for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on,</v>

4005
02:48:21.430 --> 02:48:21.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

4006
02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:24.290
<v Speaker 2>some of these people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a little mentally,</v>

4007
02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:26.430
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a changed.</v>

4008
02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:29.060
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wallace,</v>

4009
02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:30.073
<v Speaker 2>his ideas converged with darwin's ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it kind of helped darwin's theory </v>

4010
02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:37.170
<v Speaker 2>would disown them eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4011
02:48:37.171 --> 02:48:37.511
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

4012
02:48:37.511 --> 02:48:38.050
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

4013
02:48:38.050 --> 02:48:38.883
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what really happened was it accelerated </v>

4014
02:48:40.521 --> 02:48:42.550
<v Speaker 2>darwin to get his work done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get the book done.</v>

4015
02:48:42.570 --> 02:48:45.470
<v Speaker 2>He was just sort of lollygagging around </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing his research.</v>

4016
02:48:46.010 --> 02:48:49.220
<v Speaker 2>And one reason for that is I'm in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>44,</v>

4017
02:48:49.221 --> 02:48:52.670
<v Speaker 2>there was a book on evolution published </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the vestiges of creation.</v>

4018
02:48:53.330 --> 02:48:57.410
<v Speaker 2>It was published anonymously and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trashed by the scientific community.</v>

4019
02:48:57.840 --> 02:48:59.930
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so darwin got back from the galapagos in</v>

4020
02:48:59.931 --> 02:49:01.810
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>36 throughout the 1840.</v>

4021
02:49:01.850 --> 02:49:05.060
<v Speaker 2>He was just taking notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>composing his ideas,</v>

4022
02:49:05.061 --> 02:49:08.880
<v Speaker 2>running experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got married and had 10 kids.</v>

4023
02:49:08.881 --> 02:49:09.714
<v Speaker 2>And he was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a lot of money invested in the </v>

4024
02:49:11.461 --> 02:49:12.294
<v Speaker 2>railroad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was a pretty active independent </v>

4025
02:49:13.921 --> 02:49:15.510
<v Speaker 2>scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4026
02:49:15.511 --> 02:49:16.344
<v Speaker 2>and so I just started taking his sweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>time about developing this theory and </v>

4027
02:49:18.481 --> 02:49:19.314
<v Speaker 2>also he didn't want to be embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and come out with a book that wasn't </v>

4028
02:49:22.291 --> 02:49:24.930
<v Speaker 2>very solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he would be criticized,</v>

4029
02:49:24.931 --> 02:49:29.160
<v Speaker 2>so he was just compiling anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day he gets this letter from wallace</v>

4030
02:49:29.340 --> 02:49:31.560
<v Speaker 2>from the other side of the world is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the malaya archipelagos.</v>

4031
02:49:32.370 --> 02:49:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I came up with a few ideas that he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a feverish nightmare from malaria.</v>

4032
02:49:38.390 --> 02:49:39.223
<v Speaker 2>And he hatched this natural selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some species compete with others as the </v>

4033
02:49:43.111 --> 02:49:46.220
<v Speaker 2>populations increase in a and way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4034
02:49:46.340 --> 02:49:48.990
<v Speaker 2>and so not all of them can survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some will survive.</v>

4035
02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Differential reproductive success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural selection.</v>

4036
02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he outlines this to darwin.</v>

4037
02:49:53.391 --> 02:49:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Darwin is reading this going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh crap,</v>

4038
02:49:55.260 --> 02:49:56.730
<v Speaker 2>this is my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4039
02:49:56.731 --> 02:49:58.890
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sort of outlined like my book.</v>

4040
02:49:59.430 --> 02:50:03.630
<v Speaker 2>So then he rushed into print.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I gotta get this done.</v>

4041
02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:06.570
<v Speaker 2>So they weren't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborating.</v>

4042
02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:09.120
<v Speaker 2>They weren't exactly collaborating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they had communicated.</v>

4043
02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:10.013
<v Speaker 2>And also darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only was wallace not upset about </v>

4044
02:50:12.241 --> 02:50:13.410
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was thrilled.</v>

4045
02:50:13.411 --> 02:50:14.760
<v Speaker 2>He wrote his mom and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

4046
02:50:14.761 --> 02:50:16.950
<v Speaker 2>the great charles darwin wrote me back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so cool.</v>

4047
02:50:17.430 --> 02:50:18.263
<v Speaker 2>And then darwin went to charles lyell </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of the other big scientists at </v>

4048
02:50:21.331 --> 02:50:24.110
<v Speaker 2>the time and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this letter from,</v>

4049
02:50:24.310 --> 02:50:26.190
<v Speaker 2>from this guy on the other side and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

4050
02:50:26.191 --> 02:50:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I've been working on this.</v>

4051
02:50:28.110 --> 02:50:31.080
<v Speaker 2>This is really similar and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I do?</v>

4052
02:50:31.410 --> 02:50:32.230
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

4053
02:50:32.230 --> 02:50:34.260
<v Speaker 2>we'll publish both of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>

4054
02:50:34.261 --> 02:50:37.290
<v Speaker 2>And they did on July 1st 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>58 at the linnean society.</v>

4055
02:50:37.291 --> 02:50:40.950
<v Speaker 2>They both presented both papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of darwin's notes and,</v>

4056
02:50:41.090 --> 02:50:41.923
<v Speaker 2>and essays he had written in wallaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no letter to darwin with a little </v>

4057
02:50:45.181 --> 02:50:48.300
<v Speaker 2>handwritten paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they entered in both into the record</v>

4058
02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:49.350
<v Speaker 2>the same day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>july,</v>

4059
02:50:49.351 --> 02:50:50.310
<v Speaker 2>first 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>58,</v>

4060
02:50:50.370 --> 02:50:51.870
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneous discovery,</v>

4061
02:50:52.230 --> 02:50:53.063
<v Speaker 2>wallace darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then spent the next basically nine </v>

4062
02:50:55.381 --> 02:50:56.214
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the pen moves mighty fast when </v>

4063
02:50:58.501 --> 02:50:59.700
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>scooped,</v>

4064
02:50:59.800 --> 02:51:00.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4065
02:51:01.050 --> 02:51:02.640
<v Speaker 2>And he goT his book done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

4066
02:51:02.641 --> 02:51:05.970
<v Speaker 2>november 18 slash 59 origin species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rest is history.</v>

4067
02:51:06.210 --> 02:51:07.800
<v Speaker 2>And wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote again,</v>

4068
02:51:07.801 --> 02:51:08.491
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

4069
02:51:08.491 --> 02:51:09.690
<v Speaker 2>this is so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4070
02:51:09.740 --> 02:51:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm part of this great movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then only later,</v>

4071
02:51:12.691 --> 02:51:13.524
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much later did other people start to </v>

4072
02:51:14.671 --> 02:51:14.971
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4073
02:51:14.971 --> 02:51:17.370
<v Speaker 2>he ripped you off and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

4074
02:51:17.371 --> 02:51:19.010
<v Speaker 2>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's [inaudible].</v>

4075
02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Wallace wrote his great book in 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties called darwinism.</v>

4076
02:51:24.540 --> 02:51:25.373
<v Speaker 2>So what's really fascinating that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>came up with that theory based on a </v>

4077
02:51:30.151 --> 02:51:33.400
<v Speaker 2>dream from being in a fever state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

4078
02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:35.490
<v Speaker 2>How amazing it went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4079
02:51:35.491 --> 02:51:36.330
<v Speaker 2>but that often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4080
02:51:36.331 --> 02:51:40.380
<v Speaker 2>the spark of a scientific genius or </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity in any field.</v>

4081
02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:43.580
<v Speaker 2>I was taking a shower and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea came to me.</v>

4082
02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I was on a walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's some theories about this that</v>

4083
02:51:46.290 --> 02:51:49.230
<v Speaker 2>if you think too hard and focused on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific problem,</v>

4084
02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:52.110
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to sort of relax your brain,</v>

4085
02:51:52.740 --> 02:51:57.740
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means by doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else that's non focused meditation,</v>

4086
02:51:58.170 --> 02:51:59.670
<v Speaker 2>taking a shower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going for a walk,</v>

4087
02:51:59.671 --> 02:52:00.900
<v Speaker 2>going for a bike ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

4088
02:52:01.140 --> 02:52:01.973
<v Speaker 2>anything that's just sort of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the problem and that we </v>

4089
02:52:04.471 --> 02:52:07.210
<v Speaker 2>don't know what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some neurons just started to start</v>

4090
02:52:07.211 --> 02:52:08.470
<v Speaker 2>firing and interacting.</v>

4091
02:52:08.470 --> 02:52:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Different neural networks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This memory of that,</v>

4092
02:52:10.810 --> 02:52:12.100
<v Speaker 2>this memory of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this book,</v>

4093
02:52:12.110 --> 02:52:14.170
<v Speaker 2>you read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing you saw on the internet,</v>

4094
02:52:14.171 --> 02:52:14.561
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

4095
02:52:14.561 --> 02:52:15.460
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come together.</v>

4096
02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:17.900
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how that happens.</v>

4097
02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:18.743
<v Speaker 2>It's this writers like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like to write and then they go for </v>

4098
02:52:20.921 --> 02:52:21.754
<v Speaker 2>a walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4099
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:23.640
<v Speaker 2>And then after the they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4100
02:52:23.770 --> 02:52:24.603
<v Speaker 2>they're done writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go walk and they try not to think </v>

4101
02:52:25.901 --> 02:52:29.050
<v Speaker 2>about anything and then the ideas will </v>
<v Speaker 2>just pop into their head or a correction</v>

4102
02:52:29.051 --> 02:52:31.570
<v Speaker 2>and the idea or a new revelation and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

4103
02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just always been amazing to me.</v>

4104
02:52:34.750 --> 02:52:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Ideas that come out of dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the origins of creativity,</v>

4105
02:52:38.801 --> 02:52:41.790
<v Speaker 2>like where are these thoughts emanating </v>
<v Speaker 2>from what?</v>

4106
02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:42.993
<v Speaker 2>Like descartes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of science came from a </v>

4107
02:52:46.331 --> 02:52:49.050
<v Speaker 2>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dream of uh,</v>

4108
02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in an elevator,</v>

4109
02:52:50.890 --> 02:52:51.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in an elevator and the </v>

4110
02:52:52.271 --> 02:52:53.104
<v Speaker 2>elevator drops at just the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity and you let go of your pin or </v>

4111
02:52:57.101 --> 02:52:57.934
<v Speaker 2>your coffee mug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just kinda hover there like you're </v>

4112
02:52:59.981 --> 02:53:02.440
<v Speaker 2>hovering inside the elevator as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>drops.</v>

4113
02:53:02.830 --> 02:53:03.663
<v Speaker 2>So thE,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the acceleration of the elevator at </v>

4114
02:53:05.591 --> 02:53:09.640
<v Speaker 2>the speed of gravity means there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity and that's where he came up with</v>

4115
02:53:09.641 --> 02:53:10.474
<v Speaker 2>this idea of relativity in the elevator </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the frame of reference that you and </v>

4116
02:53:14.291 --> 02:53:15.124
<v Speaker 2>the cup or in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is what weightlessness is </v>

4117
02:53:17.471 --> 02:53:19.420
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do the vomit comet,</v>

4118
02:53:19.421 --> 02:53:21.580
<v Speaker 2>basically lg as you go up high enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>drop.</v>

4119
02:53:22.050 --> 02:53:25.660
<v Speaker 2>And so the plane is plunging down for </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a minute or two,</v>

4120
02:53:25.661 --> 02:53:26.494
<v Speaker 2>I guess I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you and the camera and whoever else </v>

4121
02:53:29.501 --> 02:53:32.710
<v Speaker 2>is in there is just floating because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole frame is dropping.</v>

4122
02:53:33.620 --> 02:53:37.840
<v Speaker 2>And so to do this in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the space shuttle for example,</v>

4123
02:53:37.841 --> 02:53:38.890
<v Speaker 2>it has to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

4124
02:53:38.891 --> 02:53:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Seventeen thousand 500 miles an hour to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain,</v>

4125
02:53:42.510 --> 02:53:43.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same speed at which accelerating at </v>

4126
02:53:45.641 --> 02:53:46.474
<v Speaker 2>which it would also drop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going straightforward and </v>

4127
02:53:48.251 --> 02:53:48.910
<v Speaker 2>straight down.</v>

4128
02:53:48.910 --> 02:53:52.540
<v Speaker 2>The halfway in between is 17,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour for our planet.</v>

4129
02:53:52.570 --> 02:53:54.660
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically it.</v>

4130
02:53:54.661 --> 02:53:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I create zero gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to go to mars and,</v>

4131
02:53:57.291 --> 02:53:57.881
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4132
02:53:57.881 --> 02:54:00.340
<v Speaker 2>and have some gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just spin the spaceship.</v>

4133
02:54:00.970 --> 02:54:04.030
<v Speaker 2>So that yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that the floor is the outside wall,</v>

4134
02:54:04.240 --> 02:54:06.460
<v Speaker 2>that's why in and that's how you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your gravity.</v>

4135
02:54:06.461 --> 02:54:08.860
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get to grab it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in 2000,</v>

4136
02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:10.570
<v Speaker 2>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or one of them.</v>

4137
02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:11.720
<v Speaker 2>But space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

4138
02:54:11.740 --> 02:54:14.440
<v Speaker 2>the thing spinning the space station was</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning.</v>

4139
02:54:14.740 --> 02:54:17.920
<v Speaker 2>So by spinning it creates a false sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of gravity.</v>

4140
02:54:18.370 --> 02:54:19.203
<v Speaker 2>Uh oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what it was in 2001 where he was </v>

4141
02:54:20.621 --> 02:54:24.710
<v Speaker 2>running along that curved interior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

4142
02:54:24.750 --> 02:54:26.860
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's spinning like this,</v>

4143
02:54:26.861 --> 02:54:30.940
<v Speaker 2>so it presses against the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like those old carnival,</v>

4144
02:54:31.090 --> 02:54:31.923
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things where you go in and you're </v>

4145
02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:34.900
<v Speaker 2>standing on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drops out,</v>

4146
02:54:34.901 --> 02:54:36.640
<v Speaker 2>is it spin and you spent on the outside.</v>

4147
02:54:36.650 --> 02:54:38.870
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same principle there.</v>

4148
02:54:38.890 --> 02:54:39.723
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4149
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:43.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's just amazing that ideas can come</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of nowhere.</v>

4150
02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:45.100
<v Speaker 2>The origin of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4151
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:48.370
<v Speaker 2>that's a fascinating thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like creativity where,</v>

4152
02:54:48.430 --> 02:54:51.430
<v Speaker 2>how does one person come up with a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea for a movie?</v>

4153
02:54:51.431 --> 02:54:54.520
<v Speaker 2>How does someone come up with an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea for an invention?</v>

4154
02:54:54.730 --> 02:54:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Like where are these ideas emanating </v>
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>

4155
02:54:58.180 --> 02:54:58.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4156
02:54:58.871 --> 02:55:01.630
<v Speaker 2>you have to have some knowledge of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is you're trying to create,</v>

4157
02:55:01.660 --> 02:55:04.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I have a knowledge of evolution.</v>

4158
02:55:04.801 --> 02:55:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he read quite a bit.</v>

4159
02:55:05.781 --> 02:55:06.614
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was totally into this for years as </v>

4160
02:55:07.671 --> 02:55:09.740
<v Speaker 2>was darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the dream state,</v>

4161
02:55:09.741 --> 02:55:10.810
<v Speaker 2>even mozart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4162
02:55:10.811 --> 02:55:14.600
<v Speaker 2>he was composing since the age of four </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his father was a composer.</v>

4163
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:16.520
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like this comes out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vacuum.</v>

4164
02:55:16.521 --> 02:55:18.530
<v Speaker 2>There's not abused that pops into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

4165
02:55:19.170 --> 02:55:20.001
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4166
02:55:20.001 --> 02:55:23.190
<v Speaker 2>you and I are going to come up with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>einstein type dream because we're not an</v>

4167
02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:25.590
<v Speaker 2>einstein and we're not physicists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4168
02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:28.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to have the balance seems to</v>

4169
02:55:28.041 --> 02:55:28.874
<v Speaker 2>be being ensconced in a field to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the problems are to be solved and </v>

4170
02:55:33.201 --> 02:55:35.030
<v Speaker 2>what the details are and what's already </v>
<v Speaker 2>been done.</v>

4171
02:55:35.031 --> 02:55:36.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried this to drive this,</v>

4172
02:55:36.351 --> 02:55:37.184
<v Speaker 2>this didn't work and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not be so entrenched in it that you </v>

4173
02:55:40.161 --> 02:55:44.740
<v Speaker 2>can't see outside the box and no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows what that is.</v>

4174
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.943
<v Speaker 2>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4175
02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:47.810
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting.</v>

4176
02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Creativity in and of itself is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because boom,</v>

4177
02:55:51.290 --> 02:55:52.370
<v Speaker 2>an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4178
02:55:52.371 --> 02:55:54.560
<v Speaker 2>like where's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that take place?</v>

4179
02:55:54.561 --> 02:55:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the birth of the idea,</v>

4180
02:55:57.680 --> 02:55:58.513
<v Speaker 2>what are the mechanisms that are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on inside the mind that allow the </v>

4181
02:56:01.431 --> 02:56:02.264
<v Speaker 2>imagination to give birth to this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so it's so poorly understood and </v>

4182
02:56:07.401 --> 02:56:09.650
<v Speaker 2>part of the problem of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it is the,</v>

4183
02:56:09.710 --> 02:56:11.120
<v Speaker 2>what I call the biography by us.</v>

4184
02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:13.570
<v Speaker 2>We only know abouT the successful people</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

4185
02:56:13.571 --> 02:56:16.040
<v Speaker 2>So steve jobs and bill gates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4186
02:56:16.041 --> 02:56:17.660
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is you go to college and </v>
<v Speaker 2>drop out,</v>

4187
02:56:17.661 --> 02:56:20.270
<v Speaker 2>you move into your parents' house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start a company in your garage,</v>

4188
02:56:20.271 --> 02:56:21.500
<v Speaker 2>and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4189
02:56:21.530 --> 02:56:22.363
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people did this back in the </v>

4190
02:56:23.511 --> 02:56:24.344
<v Speaker 2>seventies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't even know who they are </v>

4191
02:56:25.461 --> 02:56:26.294
<v Speaker 2>because they failed all those venture </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital startup companies that went out </v>

4192
02:56:29.451 --> 02:56:30.161
<v Speaker 2>of business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4193
02:56:30.161 --> 02:56:34.010
<v Speaker 2>all these great ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

4194
02:56:34.011 --> 02:56:34.844
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4195
02:56:34.970 --> 02:56:37.660
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what the formula is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4196
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:38.503
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what made you who you are right now at </v>

4197
02:56:41.150 --> 02:56:42.110
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4198
02:56:42.111 --> 02:56:45.290
<v Speaker 2>seven was a March 7th or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell it is.</v>

4199
02:56:45.470 --> 02:56:46.580
<v Speaker 2>What made you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4200
02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:50.090
<v Speaker 2>you're 60 plus years of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

4201
02:56:50.650 --> 02:56:52.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being awake for,</v>

4202
02:56:52.420 --> 02:56:55.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 hours plus a day doing this,</v>

4203
02:56:55.401 --> 02:56:56.234
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

4204
02:56:56.390 --> 02:56:59.650
<v Speaker 2>what chain of events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what foods did you eat,</v>

4205
02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:01.070
<v Speaker 2>how much sleep did you get?</v>

4206
02:57:01.310 --> 02:57:02.143
<v Speaker 2>What led these ideas to cross each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bank and a little fire gets lit and </v>

4207
02:57:06.381 --> 02:57:07.214
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you write it down on a napkin </v>

4208
02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:11.930
<v Speaker 2>and your life changes and yet nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows too many variables.</v>

4209
02:57:11.931 --> 02:57:14.240
<v Speaker 2>So fascinaTing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fascinating.</v>

4210
02:57:14.990 --> 02:57:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Just the mind and the way the mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

4211
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:19.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

4212
02:57:19.340 --> 02:57:20.173
<v Speaker 2>it's such a mystery and yet there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much information about it at the same </v>

4213
02:57:23.241 --> 02:57:23.960
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

4214
02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the hardest problem I think in all</v>

4215
02:57:26.571 --> 02:57:28.250
<v Speaker 2>of science consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brain.</v>

4216
02:57:28.251 --> 02:57:30.140
<v Speaker 2>How does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not we know how it works,</v>

4217
02:57:30.390 --> 02:57:32.630
<v Speaker 2>how the neuro neurons communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

4218
02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Neurochemically and how say that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>visual cortex is see stuff,</v>

4219
02:57:37.671 --> 02:57:38.504
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is it that you and I are doing </v>

4220
02:57:39.981 --> 02:57:40.814
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just we're experiencing this </v>

4221
02:57:42.501 --> 02:57:44.270
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that happen?</v>

4222
02:57:44.340 --> 02:57:45.173
<v Speaker 2>And that no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a cogent theory of </v>

4223
02:57:48.171 --> 02:57:49.004
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why then people step in with </v>

4224
02:57:50.900 --> 02:57:53.260
<v Speaker 2>quantum consciousness or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4225
02:57:53.330 --> 02:57:57.350
<v Speaker 2>They have all these theories because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know those people get.</v>

4226
02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:01.980
<v Speaker 2>They get me baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a few of those people and have</v>

4227
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:04.350
<v Speaker 1>conversations with people about quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and you're like,</v>

4228
02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:04.760
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4229
02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:05.593
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if you know what </v>

4230
02:58:06.811 --> 02:58:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

4231
02:58:08.821 --> 02:58:11.300
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics is a,</v>

4232
02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:15.810
<v Speaker 1>it is difficult in spooky and </v>
