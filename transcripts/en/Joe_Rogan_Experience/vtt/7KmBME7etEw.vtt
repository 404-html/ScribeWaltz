<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back to when the power went out,</v>

3
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:03.931
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about Hicks.</v>

5
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.631
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.990

9
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you thanked him on a CD because you got ahold of one of his,</v>

10
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.951
<v Speaker 1>but you never,</v>

13
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>you guys never actually toured together,</v>

14
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but you can't close to what we planned on it.</v>

15
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>It was basically a plan.</v>

16
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>We were kind of setting into motion in like mid 93,</v>

17
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18

19
00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>when he came down and that was kind of part of why he was coming down.</v>

20
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure out what we were going to do.</v>

21
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Comedians and rock musicians like that.</v>

22
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:32.041
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

23
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird combination of bobcat.</v>

24
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Goldthwait did a lot of,</v>

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>We have him in here and he told some hilarious stories about the,</v>

32
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.550

<v Speaker 1>I actually approached the David Cross a couple of years ago.</v>

38
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:54.211
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

45
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.271

46
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not right it with coins and stuff.</v>

47
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>It was all sort of weird combination.</v>

48
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not providing them what they're there to see you.</v>

49
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>You've got attorney me might work.</v>

53
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>it's just that the nature of that project.</v>

54
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:19.224
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's silly.</v>

55
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

56
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>there's just all this different stuff going on.</v>

57
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>You've got film and you've got,</v>

58
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.240
<v Speaker 1>you've got video and you've got animation.</v>

59
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>You've got the one too where we had a Neil hamburger opened up for us.</v>

60
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

61
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

62
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>so that's just,</v>

63
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>and then in the middle of our study would come out and interrupt and go,</v>

64
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I forgot a joke.</v>

65
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

66
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>from the audience out for a minute and then wander off.</v>

67
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>And when I can take my drink and my chair and sit down and like in my spot and</v>

68
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>take up space for western,</v>

69
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:46.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I saw Hicks at the comedy connection and uh,</v>

72
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I saw him because he was on the Rodney Dangerfield special and,</v>

73
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I was a aspiring comedians.</v>

76
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>So I went to see everybody was on the Rodney Dangerfield special when they came</v>

77
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>through town and Boston was one of those pit stops.</v>

78
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.101
<v Speaker 1>It was like Chicago,</v>

79
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:02.641
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>

80
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:02.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>there was places where people would come through and you know,</v>

82
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>you would guarantee that they would be in your town eventually.</v>

83
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.031
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

84
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:09.864
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Hicks went up.</v>

86
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>He went up at the comedy connection,</v>

87
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>or the first time I actually saw him was at Nick's comedy stop.</v>

88
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>And he went up after this guy was a incredible hack.</v>

89
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:20.364
<v Speaker 1>The guy was like,</v>

90
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>cop donut jokes,</v>

91
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.771
<v Speaker 1>cartoons,</v>

92
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.521
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot,</v>

93
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>and make them all the most hackneyed obvious premises.</v>

94
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>And he was Callin audiences filled idiots.</v>

95
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew who Hicks was.</v>

96
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Me and maybe 50 other comedians in the back of the room at a 300 people who were</v>

97
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>in the audience places packed by 20 minutes in this show,</v>

98
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>half the people have left,</v>

99
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally cleared out at least 50% by the end event.</v>

101
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>It was maybe a hundred people left and it was a 50 audience members and 50</v>

102
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>comedians and we,</v>

103
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't give a fuck.</v>

104
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>He never came.</v>

105
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

106
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>if one joke would go wrong for me,</v>

107
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I would go into a tailspin.</v>

108
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.393
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

109
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I would go the,</v>

110
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I would rush my jokes.</v>

111
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>I would say fuck too much.</v>

112
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:04.631
<v Speaker 1>I would just,</v>

113
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

114
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I would not have any confidence.</v>

115
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.700
<v Speaker 1>He's in the middle of this bit about how Satan fugs John Davidson who don't</v>

116
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.510

117
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:14.440

118
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.600
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

119
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.380
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>one of them was like the Internet before there was the internet.</v>

122
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's the demon with his thorny cock is fucking John Davidson in the ass.</v>

<v Speaker 1>or Geraldo Rivera,</v>

128
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>depending on where Hicks was at.</v>

129
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>And so Hicks's standing onstage shitting.</v>

130
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.830
<v Speaker 1>So he's pausing going,</v>

131
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.631

135
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>just straining and people just getting up and leaving and he looks up in the</v>

136
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.034
<v Speaker 1>middle of it goes.</v>

137
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

138
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>It's usually clear as a room</v>

139
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>and we're just crying,</v>

140
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.811
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

141
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:09.811
<v Speaker 1>And I got to see him bomb horribly but yet still kill for 50 to a hundred</v>

142
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:11.591
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

143

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.423
<v Speaker 1>the whole crowd.</v>

148
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.440
<v Speaker 1>But what an interesting guy.</v>

149
00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like he was doing something that nobody else was doing.</v>

150
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

151
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

152
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>he was injecting Noam Chomsky and know and philosophy and Terence Mckenna.</v>

153
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

154
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

155
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

156
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.591
<v Speaker 1>like what was,</v>

157
00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even like when I first saw Kennison Kinison was the first time I ever</v>

159
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>thought I could do comedy.</v>

160
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

161
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I thought saw these guys rolling up their sleeves,</v>

163
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:40.024
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

164
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>did you ever notice?</v>

165
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.703
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

166
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

167
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I kind of get kind of could do that.</v>

168
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I guess I kind of could do that if I had to do that.</v>

169
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 1>But then I start Kennison and,</v>

170
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

171
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.700
<v Speaker 1>fucking scream and I was married,</v>

172
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.823
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

173
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>And he was angry and it was funny and I was laughing.</v>

174
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

175
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.863
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

176
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a comedy for me,</v>

177
00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can find my comedy.</v>

178
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

179
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And then when I saw Hicks,</v>

180
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

181
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.951
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

182
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>this guy just flipped the whole fucking thing on its head.</v>

183
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Now it's now it's,</v>

184
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:08.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:13.891
<v Speaker 1>it's about formulating a philosophy on life and that there is a possibility</v>

186
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>outside of the direction that we're going in and then it is possible for the</v>

187
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>human beings and the,</v>

188
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:20.401
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

189
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.920
<v Speaker 1>the human civilization to rise up and,</v>

191
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>and be about love and be about understanding and be about intellectual curiosity</v>

192
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:29.321
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

193
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 1>and it to be free of judgment.</v>

194
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

195
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a fucking comedian.</v>

196
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the craziest Shit I've ever seen.</v>

197
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like his jokes were an afterthought to inject his philosophy and to</v>

198
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:40.481
<v Speaker 1>the audience.</v>

199
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

200
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it.</v>

201
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

202
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.963
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

203
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.620
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

204
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

205
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.441
<v Speaker 2>what I've loved,</v>

206
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

207
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:45.481
<v Speaker 2>I kind like,</v>

209
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:46.314
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

210
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.940
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

211
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>spend a little,</v>

213
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I spent all the time in that little comedy world for awhile.</v>

214
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 2>It was very always very inspiring to me to watch comedians like him.</v>

215
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

216
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 2>basically just stick to their guns and finish their act without getting that</v>

217
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:58.551
<v Speaker 2>nervous sweat.</v>

218
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was always inspiring too to see that.</v>

219
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:05.561
<v Speaker 2>And it's always my favorite comedy clubs to go to where the ones that you end</v>

220
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

221
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.040
<v Speaker 2>if you're sitting out front of,</v>

222
00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

223
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 2>the Mann's Chinese,</v>

224
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 2>they give you tickets to go to this free comedy club go then.</v>

225
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Because if it's a good comedian on you can like take bets to see how quickly the</v>

226
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 2>room's going to clear,</v>

227
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

228

<v Speaker 2>And we had,</v>

229
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 2>I think I remember one time he hit Andy kindler did a whole thing where he</v>

230
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 2>brought everybody he knew down there kind of have like a little a side,</v>

231
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:30.461
<v Speaker 2>you know sides,</v>

232
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 2>seats with all the comedians that he had a big sleeve and they did a whole like</v>

233
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.030
<v Speaker 2>debunking comedy and like a like a hack hack a class and they had everybody come</v>

234
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:44.410
<v Speaker 2>up and just do like the hack thing in front of this audience and this,</v>

235

237
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand like that's funny.</v>

238
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

239
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Why is that hack?</v>

240
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:53.804
<v Speaker 2>Let's funny like,</v>

241
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 2>and then you know that whole thing went on for like an hour,</v>

242
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.201
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half.</v>

243
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 2>I was just in the back of the room,</v>

244
00:06:58.881 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 2>just peeing myself,</v>

245
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 2>watching them go through this and then some dude gets up after the meds,</v>

246
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 2>their act and does everything that they just went through and the audience is</v>

247
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

248
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.650
<v Speaker 1>oh that's so funny.</v>

249
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Can I have another break?</v>

250
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 2>And then David Cross gets up and then just clears the room was awesome.</v>

251
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.351
<v Speaker 2>Opening line.</v>

252
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:17.531
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

253
00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:18.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I saw Schindler's list the other day and Schindler's list finally saw it.</v>

255
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

256
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.743
<v Speaker 2>it's not that funny.</v>

257
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.260
<v Speaker 2>This whole table of people just get up and out the door like,</v>

258
00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:26.651
<v Speaker 2>and it just,</v>

259
00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 2>every joke that he said,</v>

260
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:28.361
<v Speaker 2>it was like we're watching.</v>

261
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Like he just set off a bomb there.</v>

262
00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 2>He just set off a bomb there,</v>

263
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.393
<v Speaker 2>cleared the room.</v>

264
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.090
<v Speaker 1>David Cross is a rarely credited,</v>

265
00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:38.310
<v Speaker 1>but in my opinion of watching it all happen,</v>

266
00:07:38.311 --> 00:07:42.660
<v Speaker 1>he's the originator of the idea of alternative comedy because I saw him do an</v>

267
00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:47.130
<v Speaker 1>alternative comedy in 1988 he was in Boston and Cambridge.</v>

268
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.140
<v Speaker 1>He would go up and he would do,</v>

269
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time it was doing this,</v>

270
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.953
<v Speaker 1>this uh,</v>

271
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.300
<v Speaker 1>exercise video where it would teach you,</v>

272
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.740
<v Speaker 1>teach you how to stretch.</v>

273
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.760
<v Speaker 1>So you've played the exercise video two stretches that I really do feel as trach</v>

274
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.890
<v Speaker 1>and he was like doing this like long and people like nervously giggling and not</v>

275
00:08:04.891 --> 00:08:05.670
<v Speaker 1>showing where,</v>

276
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 1>not sure where it was going and it never went anywhere and everywhere.</v>

277
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.310
<v Speaker 1>But it was amusing and I felt,</v>

278
00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I felt he was like a better version of what I'm Andy Kaufman was doing.</v>

279
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Andy Kaufman would get up in front of like colleges and like read the great</v>

280
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Gatsby and I was like,</v>

281
00:08:21.421 --> 00:08:22.560
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of fucked.</v>

282
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not really funny at all.</v>

283
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.610
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of crazy like it is now.</v>

284
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:26.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

285
00:08:26.941 --> 00:08:27.661
<v Speaker 1>it is now.</v>

286
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like a delayed reaction to like witness it as great longterm absorption.</v>

288
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

289
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.250
<v Speaker 1>but cross was d he was funny why it was doing,</v>

290
00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:35.670
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

291
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:36.331
<v Speaker 1>it was weird.</v>

292
00:08:36.331 --> 00:08:37.470
<v Speaker 1>It was just so silly.</v>

293
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.360
<v Speaker 1>It was actually funny why he was doing it.</v>

294
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you like comedy?</v>

295
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I like music because I'm completely unmusical.</v>

296
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any skill.</v>

297
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any talent.</v>

298
00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:49.494
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>

299
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

300
00:08:50.941 --> 00:08:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

301
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>I see those bars that might as well be Tibetan know Sanskrit.</v>

302
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

303
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>So when I see someone perform music,</v>

304
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

305
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>when I'm in awe,</v>

306
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

307
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 1>to me it's a beautiful,</v>

308
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>wonderful experience.</v>

309
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel the same way about comedy because you don't do comedy?</v>

310
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch comedy and just get a like a free sense of enjoyment that you might</v>

311
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>not get from watching something that you actually,</v>

312
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I generally enjoy more a scripted like a film calming and when I see a group of</v>

313
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:21.500
<v Speaker 2>guys who have figured out,</v>

314
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.311
<v Speaker 2>not a formula,</v>

315
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:23.300
<v Speaker 2>but there's just a,</v>

316
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.230
<v Speaker 2>there's a rhythm to their comedy and they've actually created a character</v>

317
00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:27.651
<v Speaker 2>behind,</v>

318
00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:27.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.160
<v Speaker 2>that actor brings something to the table that you want to look at.</v>

320
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.090
<v Speaker 2>And then their timing in this scenario where it's clearly they are just play</v>

321
00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:35.480
<v Speaker 2>acting.</v>

322
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:35.751
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

323
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:35.901
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

324
00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:36.920
<v Speaker 2>we're just playing dress up,</v>

325
00:09:36.921 --> 00:09:40.460
<v Speaker 2>pretend and you still laugh because the writing solid,</v>

326
00:09:40.461 --> 00:09:42.670
<v Speaker 2>but the what they bring to the table with the writing of solid.</v>

327
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

328
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.700
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're seeing things like the movie super troopers,</v>

329
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.150
<v Speaker 2>it's just like those guys had to have a lot of fun making that film because</v>

330
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:50.931
<v Speaker 2>everything was just like,</v>

331
00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:52.130
<v Speaker 2>the writing was perfect.</v>

332
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a quotable film.</v>

333
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like every step of the way.</v>

334
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.090
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

335
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.490
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

336
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.640
<v Speaker 2>every scene is quotable and they're just having fun.</v>

337
00:09:58.641 --> 00:09:59.474
<v Speaker 2>And then you see,</v>

338
00:09:59.780 --> 00:09:59.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

339
00:09:59.961 --> 00:10:02.300
<v Speaker 2>almost almost any will Ferrell filling the tank.</v>

340
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Those guys just,</v>

341
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.153
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

342
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

343
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.540
<v Speaker 2>John C.</v>

344
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Reilly is like just a master.</v>

345
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.300
<v Speaker 2>It just bringing his thing to the table and then making your script come alive.</v>

346
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

347
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.950
<v Speaker 2>it's just a great,</v>

348
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:13.790
<v Speaker 2>that to me is like,</v>

349
00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:14.091
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

350
00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:15.230
<v Speaker 2>and I look at that and I go,</v>

351
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.970
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck did you do that?</v>

352
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.940
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how they did that and I have no idea how to be funny.</v>

353
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.060
<v Speaker 2>And just so I'm watching them just like nail these things out of the park.</v>

354
00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Like you could put all that script on the paper and show it to me and I would</v>

355
00:10:26.211 --> 00:10:27.044
<v Speaker 2>just go,</v>

356
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.913
<v Speaker 2>which I have.</v>

357
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.611
<v Speaker 2>Where do I start?</v>

358
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

359
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

360
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.440
<v Speaker 2>how is this funny?</v>

361
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.100
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite all time Comedians is Mitch Hedberg.</v>

362
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And One of the reasons why Mitch is one of my favorites is cause none of his</v>

363
00:10:36.641 --> 00:10:37.930
<v Speaker 1>stuff was funny on paper.</v>

364
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.430
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make any sense.</v>

365
00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Like you would see.</v>

366
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.553
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

367
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.821
<v Speaker 1>somebody asked me,</v>

369
00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:44.470
<v Speaker 1>do I want a frozen banana?</v>

370
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.041
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

371
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:45.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

372
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 1>but I want a regular banana later.</v>

373
00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:49.120
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>

374
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Now if you saw that on paper and be like,</v>

375
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.000
<v Speaker 1>why is that funny?</v>

376
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.901
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is,</v>

377
00:10:55.901 --> 00:10:57.160
<v Speaker 1>I might have butchered his joke.</v>

378
00:10:57.161 --> 00:10:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's good thing.</v>

379
00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.133
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty close.</v>

380
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.060
<v Speaker 1>But I love that.</v>

381
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I love that he redefined comedy in a certain way too,</v>

382
00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>because he made some,</v>

383
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.693
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

384
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I was a heroin addict and he had only clean comedy.</v>

385
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean his stuff was squeaky clean.</v>

386
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:14.763
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be what?</v>

387
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:19.360
<v Speaker 1>He was gang green and his leg because he was fucking shooting in the same vein</v>

388
00:11:19.361 --> 00:11:20.194
<v Speaker 1>too many times.</v>

389
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.470
<v Speaker 1>It was a really a strange guy.</v>

390
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.760
<v Speaker 1>And his material was all so odd.</v>

391
00:11:27.761 --> 00:11:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And if you loved Mitch Hedberg,</v>

392
00:11:30.371 --> 00:11:31.270
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>

393
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.620
<v Speaker 1>But like Mitch Hedberg would go on after these guys that would like sing and</v>

394
00:11:35.621 --> 00:11:38.000
<v Speaker 1>dance and do song parodies and you know,</v>

395
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.450
<v Speaker 1>they would close with a rap and he would eat.</v>
