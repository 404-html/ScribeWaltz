1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience were bananas.</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:03.781
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you know what it is though.</v>

4
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Here's the real victims of ending the drug war would be all those prisons that</v>

5
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.100
<v Speaker 1>would no longer be full of young black men.</v>

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.411
<v Speaker 1>You say this,</v>

7
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>but what if your business is running prisons,</v>

8
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's your business is prison guards.</v>

10
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.123
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's</v>

11
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>someone think of the prison,</v>

12
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>the prison industrial complex prison guards lobby against drug legalizations</v>

13
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>cause do it because they want to stay in office.</v>

14
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep their jobs and how many lives has to be ruined in the process.</v>

15
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy to vampire system.</v>

16
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>So horrible vampire system and it's a system that's brought out of it's,</v>

17
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>it's based on these reverberations are these vibrations from the past.</v>

18
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>It's all like this scramble when a people were retarded,</v>

19
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>when they came over on boats and this is just how they did things.</v>

20
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>They throw in a jail,</v>

21
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>he'll fucking scoundrel.</v>

22
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>You were smoking marijuana or whatever.</v>

23
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>The rule that you broke is that they realize that they can do it.</v>

24
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 1>So they do do it and they throw you in some fucking cage in 2014 the fact that</v>

25
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>that's still going on and that people are actually profiting from it.</v>

26
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

27
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>these are more things that the Internet has a huge fucking problem with.</v>

28
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause the Internet's guys like you is young fellas that are very smart and</v>

29
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>unconventional and seeing the system and being like,</v>

30
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:18.481
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

31
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.314
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it.</v>

32
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>

33
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>there's shit that people I knew growing up that were adults,</v>

34
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I knew they were fucking idiots and they knew they made bad choices.</v>

35
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm looking at the,</v>

36
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the repercussions of this everywhere.</v>

37
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at an item saying,</v>

38
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

39
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>this is dumb.</v>

40
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

41
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>so this is one of the things,</v>

42
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>especially talking to college students that I love bringing up,</v>

43
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.821
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

44
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>and I'm the first to admit that like I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.</v>

45
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>99% of the time eat.</v>

46
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Especially when I got started,</v>

47
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>I still don't know.</v>

48
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:45.931
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>

49
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I've come to realize like I've got,</v>

50
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>I've got been lucky enough to meet some pretty like successful,</v>

51
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:51.661
<v Speaker 1>impressive people.</v>

52
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>But like you dig under the surface,</v>

53
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>we're all just hacking it.</v>

54
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.163
<v Speaker 1>Like we're all just figure,</v>

55
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.741
<v Speaker 1>expertise,</v>

56
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:56.461
<v Speaker 1>experience those things.</v>

57
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll help.</v>

58
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>But like every one of us is a fallible human,</v>

59
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>all the conventions and rules and status quo we know were created by other</v>

60
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>fallible humans.</v>

61
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason not to look at that and go,</v>

62
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

63
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>does it have to be that way?</v>

64
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Or why is it that way?</v>

65
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>And if the reason why is low,</v>

66
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>that's the way it is.</v>

67
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a terrible reason,</v>

68
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.701
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

69
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.534
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

70
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>and when you see the world as being that hackable,</v>

71
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.593
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

72
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>like you start to realize,</v>

73
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:20.011
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

74
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:20.431
<v Speaker 1>well let's just,</v>

75
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>let's actually question stuff.</v>

76
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:21.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

77
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>and for,</v>

78
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was a freshman at Uva when nine 11 happened for this generation of</v>

80
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:28.584
<v Speaker 1>millennials coming up.</v>

81
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>We mow nearly all of us.</v>

82
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>One of our first really vivid memories of the world was nine 11 this awful</v>

83
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:34.914
<v Speaker 1>tragedy.</v>

84
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>And then we get into these two wars and then think of all the authority figures</v>

85
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>we've had in our life since that moment.</v>

86
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>They've all at one point,</v>

87
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>other either misled us,</v>

88
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>this sort of deceived us.</v>

89
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.431
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you've got the financial crisis,</v>

91
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>you've got the housing bubble,</v>

92
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>all these conventions.</v>

93
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:48.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

94
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.291
<v Speaker 1>trust us,</v>

95
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:49.801
<v Speaker 1>we know what we're doing.</v>

96
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:50.371
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing,</v>

97
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:51.570
<v Speaker 1>the American dream is buying a home,</v>

98
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.553
<v Speaker 1>go to college,</v>

99
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>take on that student loan debt.</v>

100
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.241
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry,</v>

101
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a job waiting for you.</v>

102
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.371
<v Speaker 1>Every single one.</v>

103
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 1>These conventions from,</v>

104
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>from all these people in power have not held up.</v>

105
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And so I think in particular,</v>

106
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>millennials,</v>

107
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>millennials look at that very skeptically cause we're like,</v>

108
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:04.121
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

109
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:04.954
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

110
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>So the conventional stuff didn't work out for anything.</v>

111
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Like we have no choice but to realize,</v>

112
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

113
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.791
<v Speaker 1>we're all just hacking it.</v>

114
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

115
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>let's really,</v>

116
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>let's dive into the passion.</v>

117
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

118
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>let's figure out a better way to do something.</v>

119
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Not Settle for the way it always been.</v>

120
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I think you're completely right.</v>

121
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:18.281
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

122
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

123
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>first of all I'm slightly annoyed by this new statement and I'm forced to absorb</v>

124
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>millennials.</v>

125
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I know it's terrible for you.</v>

126
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

127
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

128
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm not buying,</v>

129
00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>you can rebrand this.</v>

130
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.983
<v Speaker 1>I think we should,</v>

131
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.611
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

132
00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:29.861
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

133
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a divisiveness or there's a separation that comes when you start</v>

134
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>labeling people by like what era they were born in.</v>

135
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a state of mind more than anything else.</v>

136
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

137
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:41.861
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

138
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's horse shit,</v>

139
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>generation x generation to fuck up.</v>

140
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.111
<v Speaker 1>It's just human.</v>

141
00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's this idea of putting things in a label generalization.</v>

142
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>The human brace is evolving.</v>

143
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Watch father knows best and then watch game of Thrones.</v>

144
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

145
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>shit's different now.</v>

146
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to come up with names for the generations and your generation y</v>

147
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>and there was fucking Jamie from the laugh factory.</v>

148
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Tried to tell my friend,</v>

149
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

151
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Todd Parker,</v>

152
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Todd Parker's a standup comic that I started out with.</v>

153
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was like,</v>

154
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

155
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>you have to be generation x guy.</v>

156
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>This is what you would do.</v>

157
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>You'd go on stage and everything.</v>

158
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.790
<v Speaker 1>My generation,</v>

159
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>generation x,</v>

160
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>think that's going to be your hook.</v>

161
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>And I remember him trying to explain it to change and I'm in the background</v>

162
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:24.484
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

163
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.360
<v Speaker 2>did you hear what he told Tony to do?</v>

164
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.870
<v Speaker 2>What he tell tidy?</v>

165
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.080
<v Speaker 2>You must always wear a cowboy hat.</v>

166
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.500
<v Speaker 2>That was just thinking.</v>

167
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.530
<v Speaker 2>He would just look like woody from toy story cause he needed the hat.</v>
