1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're live.</v>

2
00:00:01.731 --> 00:00:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Before you take any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Dr Gordon's advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to know folks.</v>

4
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 1>He's scared of shrimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shellfish,</v>

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>pork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never had wild game and he refuses </v>

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>to eat outside of a very narrowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary discipline.</v>

7
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>He's got like a very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

8
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>You really do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really eat?</v>

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat pork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't eat pork?</v>

10
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>No pork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

11
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>But you know about Bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time you've had it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey?</v>

13
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Bacon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A day?</v>

14
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had Turkey Bacon.</v>

15
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just pathetic.</v>

16
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Turkey sausage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey sex with two condoms on a totally</v>

17
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.580
<v Speaker 1>some of us don't even use that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how could you eat Turkey bacon and </v>

19
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>not eat the real Bacon Bacon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to eat it,</v>

20
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>but after getting sick and no one got </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick ever in the history of the world </v>

21
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>from Bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you eat bread?</v>

22
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no problems with gluten?</v>

23
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with gluten.</v>

24
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:58.401
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that do have a </v>

25
00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:58.401
<v Speaker 1>problem with gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:58.401
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any problems with pig.</v>

27
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:03.281
<v Speaker 1>How sure are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My school doesn't look as good as it </v>

28
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:03.281
<v Speaker 1>does when I'm not on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

29
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Go look over your stool with a fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>tooth comb.</v>

30
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here.</v>

31
00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>We're with</v>

32
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Gordon,</v>

33
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 2>my good friend and his friend Andrew </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marr,</v>

34
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:18.801
<v Speaker 2>who is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your position in the Warrior </v>

35
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Angels Foundation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found it,</v>

36
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

37
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

38
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>founder and former Greenberg and tell us</v>

39
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 2>all about what it's about and what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mission is.</v>

40
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

41
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mission is to get no cost,</v>

42
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 2>a traumatic brain injury treatment to </v>
<v Speaker 2>veterans who need it,</v>

43
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:37.491
<v Speaker 2>so it's an alternative means for to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys treatment outside of the medical </v>

44
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:42.261
<v Speaker 2>model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is predicated on a medication and </v>

45
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:46.101
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it does not improve quality of </v>

46
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that changing at all because of,</v>

47
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the work that Dr Gordon has been </v>

48
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.871
<v Speaker 2>doing and there's been a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard outside of you even mention </v>

49
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:57.831
<v Speaker 2>of your name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people bring up your therapies and </v>

50
00:01:57.831 --> 00:01:57.831
<v Speaker 2>things that you've been promoting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>several years.</v>

51
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that changing in the community at </v>

52
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 2>all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're working to change it actively,</v>

53
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

54
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have a meeting next month</v>

55
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 2>with some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 2>some top people and the active duty side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the house.</v>

57
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.670
<v Speaker 2>We're also meeting with our and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and works of getting with the Veterans </v>

58
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Administration and working that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going,</v>

59
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 2>they're going to know everything across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the board about these protocols,</v>

60
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 2>why they work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they're better,</v>

61
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 2>how they're cost efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they're time efficient,</v>

62
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 2>how this can not only improve as </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldier's life,</v>

63
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 2>but the life of the family child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second order effects go on and on and </v>

64
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the evidence is out there,</v>

65
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 2>the science is behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't false hope we're not offering</v>

66
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 2>any false hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is science,</v>

67
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 2>evidence based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

68
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 2>reporting that we're doing and based off</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Gordon's clinical application of </v>

69
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 2>years and years of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the short answer is yes,</v>

70
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:53.601
<v Speaker 2>they're hearing about it and we have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>five year plan to overtake the system </v>

71
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 2>and have them implement these on both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides of the house.</v>

72
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 2>So to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

73
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:59.190
<v Speaker 2>for people who haven't heard any of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts before,</v>

74
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>haven't heard your discussion</v>

75
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one of the biggest issues that we're</v>

76
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>experiencing with soldiers coming back </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Afghanistan and Iraq is if you hear</v>

77
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:13.561
<v Speaker 1>my voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a little bit of a cold ladies </v>

78
00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a traumatic brain injury elk a lot.</v>

79
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's big bacon,</v>

80
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a clam.</v>

81
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of soldiers are coming back from </v>

82
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.260
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these wars with injuries that may have </v>

83
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.891
<v Speaker 1>been fatal in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're no longer because of all these </v>

84
00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>advancements in medical technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still still dealing with the</v>

85
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>ongoing effects of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traumatic brain injury.</v>

86
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have found and many others have</v>

87
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.870
<v Speaker 1>supported this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a lot of this is there's damage </v>

88
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>to the pituitary gland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stops the production of hormones.</v>

89
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.840
<v Speaker 1>This leads to deep depression and leads </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some pretty significant issues that </v>

90
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.681
<v Speaker 1>soldiers are facing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you could just fill people in on </v>

91
00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:55.681
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

92
00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we found is that,</v>

93
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the body armor being so </v>

94
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.500
<v Speaker 3>efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the blast damage,</v>

95
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:06.501
<v Speaker 3>instead of killing someone is leaving </v>
<v Speaker 3>them with trauma to the brain in any </v>

96
00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:08.340
<v Speaker 3>form of trauma to the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's a blast trauma being</v>

97
00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:09.720
<v Speaker 3>hit on the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slip and fall,</v>

98
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:14.721
<v Speaker 3>a automobile accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turning upside down or whatever the </v>

99
00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 3>situation might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

100
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.910
<v Speaker 3>the brain changes its chemistry because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of inflammation and that's from tearing </v>

101
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.441
<v Speaker 3>of little nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not only the pituitary and that's </v>

102
00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:26.220
<v Speaker 3>been some of the problem that we've had </v>
<v Speaker 3>is focusing as I focus on narrow kind of</v>

103
00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>focusing in on just the pituitary,</v>

104
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:34.071
<v Speaker 3>but what we found is a group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemistry in the brain called neuro </v>

105
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:38.030
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which regulate our personality in some </v>

106
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.460
<v Speaker 3>of those neuro steroids have names like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stasia drone or dihydrotestosterone,</v>

107
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 3>estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnenolone and the literature has been</v>

108
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:47.670
<v Speaker 3>around since about 1986 showing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these regulate our brain function.</v>

109
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.590
<v Speaker 3>So head trauma of any sort can cause it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to decrease number one.</v>

110
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with any form of damage to the brain,</v>

111
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:59.120
<v Speaker 3>you get inflammation and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation expands.</v>

112
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Let's say if there was a small area of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tear in the brain or a bullet that </v>

113
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 3>penetrate a penetrating injury to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>

114
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.440
<v Speaker 3>that area where the bullet or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign object a diminished amount of </v>

115
00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:13.710
<v Speaker 3>brain tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it grows larger because of inflammation.</v>

116
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.980
<v Speaker 3>It destroys more and more neurons in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>more cells in the brain that are called </v>

117
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.331
<v Speaker 3>neurons are destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The greater the onset of cognitive </v>

118
00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:27.620
<v Speaker 3>impairment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ability to use your brain in a </v>

119
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.320
<v Speaker 3>function and then emotionality changes.</v>

120
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you get involved in this and how</v>

121
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:35.621
<v Speaker 1>did you figure out what so many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't figured out what this the with </v>

122
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:37.520
<v Speaker 1>the emphasis on therapy and pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication,</v>

123
00:05:37.521 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you see through that?</v>

124
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't discover anything.</v>

126
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.680
<v Speaker 3>All I did was in reading the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as I read it,</v>

127
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.750
<v Speaker 3>saw that people had already laid the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathway for me to follow and I've </v>

128
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.210
<v Speaker 3>followed it intensely for the past 21 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years doing endocrinology in the past 10</v>

129
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:56.490
<v Speaker 3>years doing specifically </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroendocrinology,</v>

130
00:05:56.491 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 3>which deals the brain and it's in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>population of patients.</v>

131
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:05.741
<v Speaker 3>I used to see them for hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficiency and then started going back </v>

132
00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 3>asking them those were the hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficiency,</v>

133
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 3>if they've had any kind of head trauma </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first book that I wrote,</v>

134
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.180
<v Speaker 3>which had the first introduction for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>to write about traumatic brain injury </v>

135
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 3>and hormone deficiency was the young kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the name Michael,</v>

136
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 3>who had been in a um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had come to me.</v>

137
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:23.610
<v Speaker 3>His parents brought him in and he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormone deficiency and we correct it,</v>

138
00:06:23.611 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 3>is personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>improved his quality of life,</v>

139
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:31.031
<v Speaker 3>improve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then read an article which I've </v>

140
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:33.940
<v Speaker 3>shared with you in the past which came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of a Turkey about pugilists who had </v>

141
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 3>the specific growth hormone deficiency.</v>

142
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 3>And that was my epiphany article where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>started looking further and further into</v>

143
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 3>literature and Moo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moo tie.</v>

144
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 3>They had a hormone deficiency and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

145
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 3>all the hormone deficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this kid,</v>

146
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I went back to him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever had any trauma of any </v>

147
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.900
<v Speaker 3>kind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

148
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was 17,</v>

149
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 3>he was 21 at the time when he was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in a motorcycle accident,</v>

150
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.430
<v Speaker 3>was in a coma for three days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out of the coma,</v>

151
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 3>and his neurologist said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

152
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 3>you'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He progressively got worse.</v>

153
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 3>So that set the stage for me to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at this relationship between any</v>

154
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 3>kind of head trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then 2007.</v>

155
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my first military was a green baret.</v>

156
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I met the wife who was a emergency room </v>
<v Speaker 3>doc in North Carolina and she called me </v>

157
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.250
<v Speaker 3>and told me about her husband who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>six towards the duty was having some </v>

158
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.250
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

159
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:32.110
<v Speaker 3>We ran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We donated the money for him to get the </v>

160
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.751
<v Speaker 3>full testing and turn out who's hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficient when we correct it is </v>

161
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:35.160
<v Speaker 3>hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was back in the good.</v>

162
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.330
<v Speaker 3>A good light with the military was </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting ready to get kicked out for </v>

163
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 3>insubordination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that progressed on 2009,</v>

164
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with opening up our practice to </v>

165
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 3>military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just kept on repeating itself the</v>

166
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:50.860
<v Speaker 3>same pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same head trauma blast,</v>

167
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 3>a blast injury and hormone deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now,</v>

168
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 3>how's this being received?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the rest of the medical community?</v>

169
00:07:58.971 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

170
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 3>this is an uphill battle because the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's being treated presently,</v>

171
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the literature from 2012,</v>

172
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:12.530
<v Speaker 3>410,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>service servicemen came back as veterans</v>

173
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.800
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

174
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 3>were diagnosed with ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now a posttraumatic stress disorder is </v>

175
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:24.251
<v Speaker 3>usually perceived as being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological psychologically </v>

176
00:08:24.251 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 3>precipitated event where they witnessed </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that was horrifying to them,</v>

177
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 3>a death of a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loss of a limb or whatever the situation</v>

178
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:32.460
<v Speaker 3>might have been to stimulate it.</v>

179
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.300
<v Speaker 3>And that immediately opened him up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple treatment here,</v>

180
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 3>take this packet of antidepressants and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get better.</v>

181
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't get better,</v>

182
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 3>so they didn't get better because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were having what's called treatment </v>

183
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.511
<v Speaker 3>resistant depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which now we find is due to hormonal </v>

184
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 3>deficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the civilian population,</v>

185
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 3>people with hormone to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with treatment resistant depression,</v>

186
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 3>you check them out and the testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficient or estrogen overdose,</v>

187
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 3>or low progesterone or low pregnenolone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other chemicals that are in our brain.</v>

188
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

189
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 3>these individuals have been the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

190
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.620
<v Speaker 3>the foundation of what I do in trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>find a simple way to replenish them.</v>

191
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 3>What you have to do is test them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not being done.</v>

192
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.950
<v Speaker 3>It's so much easier just to hand a </v>
<v Speaker 3>packet and say you have ptsd when the </v>

193
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 3>majority of them are traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>injury,</v>

194
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.520
<v Speaker 3>and I was on Dr drew show with one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our patients who was a army corpsman and</v>

195
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have a single scratch on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

196
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 3>but within two years of leaving a </v>
<v Speaker 3>separating from the service,</v>

197
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 3>he started developing depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mood swings,</v>

198
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 3>explosive personality.</v>

199
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.980
<v Speaker 3>He ends up coming into our program and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we find out he has two and a half </v>

200
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 3>hormone deficiencies and the pattern is </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicative of having had head trauma.</v>

201
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Well turned out he would walk behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abramson tanks as they were just </v>

202
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 3>charging their shells and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

203
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 3>my body would shut her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was around javelin missiles.</v>

204
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:05.961
<v Speaker 3>He was around repetitive gunfire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He personally didn't have a scratch on </v>

205
00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible that just the recoil,</v>

206
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:08.140
<v Speaker 3>just a boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christa,</v>

207
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.190
<v Speaker 3>the sonic boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the impact that that,</v>

208
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shocking.</v>

209
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:13.700
<v Speaker 3>His body can do that too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

210
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 3>There are books out and the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>has lots of books out on blast trauma.</v>

211
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the amazing things for me to have</v>

212
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:24.621
<v Speaker 3>read was the army did a study on </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals who had had blast damage,</v>

213
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.790
<v Speaker 3>blast trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no physical Amma just blast,</v>

214
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:34.791
<v Speaker 3>and they put them on a simple product </v>
<v Speaker 3>called NSC assisting Nac and those that </v>

215
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:39.171
<v Speaker 3>were on it got better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how come we're not hearing about </v>

216
00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 3>what is that stuff in a sealed system?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a precursor to glutathione,</v>

217
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.330
<v Speaker 3>which is the number one </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti-inflammatory,</v>

218
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti free radical,</v>

219
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.480
<v Speaker 3>a antioxidant system in our brain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a becomes deficient.</v>

220
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 3>It's indogenous within our system of </v>
<v Speaker 3>glutathione is the same stuff that you.</v>

221
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.830
<v Speaker 3>You recommend taking booze it well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet glutathione helps with metabolism in</v>

222
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:03.500
<v Speaker 3>the liver to detoxify.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

223
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing about Nac though also </v>
<v Speaker 2>that mark told me and I'm on that </v>

224
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.490
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if if I was be a.</v>

225
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 2>If I was taking that while I was still </v>
<v Speaker 2>operating and the problems that I had </v>

226
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.091
<v Speaker 2>never would have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have cut it off so we can </v>

227
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Speaker 2>essentially cut off these problems just </v>
<v Speaker 2>by being proactive and preventative in </v>

228
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.161
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we were right now today to </v>

229
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:26.620
<v Speaker 2>administer to all special operations </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers in AC,</v>

230
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.780
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the problems that we're having </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the window,</v>

231
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.340
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy,</v>

232
00:11:31.341 --> 00:11:32.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true medicine,</v>

233
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on is all,</v>

234
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to catch up,</v>

235
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.550
<v Speaker 3>always trying to catch up with what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is proactive.</v>

236
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.580
<v Speaker 3>We see patterns in the blood that if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>let them keep on sliding until they're </v>

237
00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:49.370
<v Speaker 3>sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll get even,</v>

238
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely sick in the medical model </v>

239
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:54.560
<v Speaker 3>right now is right this second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're</v>

240
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.070
<v Speaker 1>not sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's wait until you get sick before we </v>

241
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.931
<v Speaker 1>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the more shocking things in </v>

242
00:12:00.931 --> 00:12:02.380
<v Speaker 1>working with the UFC is we got involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

243
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 1>We do these events called fight for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops.</v>

244
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.310
<v Speaker 1>We do them on basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

245
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.480
<v Speaker 1>we uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got involved with the intrepid </v>

246
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>foundation for Intrepid Foundation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent.</v>

247
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.660
<v Speaker 1>You find out how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how little money the government gives </v>

248
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:21.660
<v Speaker 1>them and how much they have to raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and,</v>

249
00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:26.661
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing functions like these big UFC </v>

250
00:12:26.661 --> 00:12:29.971
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that to me was one of the most </v>

251
00:12:29.971 --> 00:12:30.370
<v Speaker 1>disturbing things about those events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

252
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.430
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible that we can have all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this money for all these different </v>

253
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.331
<v Speaker 1>missions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this money for all these different </v>

254
00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:41.071
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have money to take care of </v>

255
00:12:41.071 --> 00:12:41.071
<v Speaker 1>these guys when they come back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems.</v>

256
00:12:41.071 --> 00:12:44.290
<v Speaker 1>That seems criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in unethical.</v>

257
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a minimum,</v>

258
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>at a minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the highest level?</v>

259
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

260
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:56.630
<v Speaker 1>if you count on soldiers to do what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask of them and put their body on the </v>

261
00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:03.961
<v Speaker 1>line to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to complete missions and then you don't </v>

262
00:13:03.961 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 1>take take care of them when they come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

263
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 1>How do you ever expect anybody to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriotic?</v>

264
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

265
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was millions of dollars spent</v>

266
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:15.031
<v Speaker 2>on me personally on my training and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't put a number on that </v>

267
00:13:15.031 --> 00:13:15.031
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

268
00:13:15.031 --> 00:13:17.770
<v Speaker 2>So to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce a special operations soldier,</v>

269
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.160
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it makes sense to put in proper </v>

270
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 2>preventative programs to make sure those</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are forming,</v>

271
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 2>performing at elite levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

272
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:28.840
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do that for our weapons </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

273
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:31.270
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do that for our vehicles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for aircraft.</v>

274
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Why would we not do that for the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing as our guys,</v>

275
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.450
<v Speaker 2>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not waiting for anybody else to </v>

276
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:39.450
<v Speaker 2>come up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

277
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:39.450
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

278
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.621
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm following Dr Gordon's lead started </v>

279
00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:43.621
<v Speaker 2>the foundation and we're doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

280
00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna we're changing it from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside out,</v>

281
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.540
<v Speaker 2>from top to bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom to top.</v>

282
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe it takes guys like you </v>

283
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:52.680
<v Speaker 1>that are on the inside to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the bureaucrats,</v>

284
00:13:52.681 --> 00:13:57.681
<v Speaker 1>the people that are in the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioned offices that are deciding </v>

285
00:13:57.681 --> 00:13:58.590
<v Speaker 1>where money goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't,</v>

286
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.750
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a stake in it.</v>

287
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.930
<v Speaker 2>They're disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're disconnected.</v>

288
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 2>So they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't feel it and they don't </v>

289
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 2>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

290
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.191
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's simple because we're providing </v>

291
00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:11.191
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence based solutions,</v>

292
00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:11.780
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not bitching.</v>

293
00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Are Griping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining,</v>

294
00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.950
<v Speaker 2>offering solutions based on science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how long have you been involved in </v>

295
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.550
<v Speaker 2>with this foundation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

296
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.000
<v Speaker 2>we started January one of this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

297
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.090
<v Speaker 2>So just taking off just get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

298
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.430
<v Speaker 2>I was just medically retired and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>June,</v>

299
00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:26.810
<v Speaker 2>so I started up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually,</v>

300
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 2>I had to go outside of the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical system to get alternative </v>

301
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.980
<v Speaker 2>treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative being not medication,</v>

302
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 2>not psychotherapy and medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very similar to when magazine was on </v>

303
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the navy seal.</v>

304
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I was on 13 different meds and for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

305
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.130
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>

306
00:14:43.131 --> 00:14:48.131
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not the person that you used to </v>

307
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:48.131
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

308
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:50.921
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on elite up capable of performing at an </v>

309
00:14:50.921 --> 00:14:53.450
<v Speaker 2>elite level in situations of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death consistently and reliably.</v>

310
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And then all of sudden I have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

311
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.830
<v Speaker 2>handling things that just don't add up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

312
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:04.970
<v Speaker 2>your behavior is not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember things driving home,</v>

313
00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five years,</v>

314
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I've driven that route every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden they look up,</v>

315
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:11.350
<v Speaker 2>you don't know where you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Writing a sentence in the middle,</v>

316
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

317
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm writing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

318
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:19.091
<v Speaker 2>So those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was easy for me to put my hand up </v>

319
00:15:19.091 --> 00:15:19.091
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

320
00:15:19.091 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is psalms going on here,</v>

321
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 2>this is not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was basically saying,</v>

322
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on fire,</v>

323
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:25.630
<v Speaker 2>somebody has put this fire out and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kept throwing medication and medication,</v>

324
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.670
<v Speaker 2>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you start having anxiety </v>

325
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.670
<v Speaker 2>attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was completely foreign to me.</v>

326
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was something that some other </v>

327
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.110
<v Speaker 2>person a week person's problem as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived it.</v>

328
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.520
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm having these anxiety attacks</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm breaking down emotionally and </v>

329
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:39.520
<v Speaker 2>crying in public and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

330
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I have no control over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

331
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.210
<v Speaker 2>and happening in front of my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife and my kids,</v>

332
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.260
<v Speaker 2>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

333
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:47.420
<v Speaker 2>enough is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And going out,</v>

334
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 2>trying to find different things led me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to let me demark Dr Gordon.</v>

335
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.330
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

336
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.360
<v Speaker 2>he introduced me to his protocols.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually sent me an email and the </v>

337
00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:58.360
<v Speaker 2>first line he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Andrew,</v>

338
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm this and we're doing this and I'm </v>

339
00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:03.041
<v Speaker 2>not a coop by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

340
00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:03.041
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that,</v>

341
00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that guy.</v>

342
00:16:05.121 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very debatable introduction.</v>

343
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

344
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:12.941
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kooks will always tell you they're not </v>

345
00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:12.941
<v Speaker 2>kooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

346
00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:13.580
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I was drawn to him,</v>

347
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.510
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

348
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

349
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.420
<v Speaker 2>So do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have a specific injury or a </v>

350
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.270
<v Speaker 2>specific moment where things changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

351
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was an explosive breacher so I was in </v>

352
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:28.430
<v Speaker 2>around explosions for my entire career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

353
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:31.700
<v Speaker 2>I was only knocked unconscious one time </v>
<v Speaker 2>in combat.</v>

354
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that mark was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just,</v>

355
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.410
<v Speaker 2>this goes outside the veteran </v>
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

356
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:38.060
<v Speaker 2>this goes with anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

357
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:42.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the symptoms can come in months,</v>

358
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

359
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:44.960
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

360
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

361
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:48.170
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't attributed to any one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

362
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:50.210
<v Speaker 2>So six months later after my last </v>
<v Speaker 2>deployment,</v>

363
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to have these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're starting to manifest and when </v>

364
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.961
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm bringing this up to the </v>

365
00:16:58.961 --> 00:16:58.961
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:16:58.961 --> 00:16:58.961
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

367
00:16:58.961 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 2>well this is a psychological issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

368
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing this for a long time.</v>

369
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Speaker 2>This is what I want to be doing.</v>

370
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.560
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a psychological issue and </v>

371
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 2>here's why I wouldn't be able to perform</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this and all of a sudden I just </v>

372
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 2>can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

373
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

374
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.780
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just very frustrating,</v>

375
00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that regard,</v>

376
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:15.570
<v Speaker 2>trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>

377
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 2>to come out and try to find some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some real answers and only like mark </v>

378
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.851
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it takes is an individualized </v>

379
00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:24.851
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

380
00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that uses evidence based diagnostics</v>

381
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:28.670
<v Speaker 2>to pinpoint and treat the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition.</v>

382
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.270
<v Speaker 2>But nobody was trying to figure out my </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole story.</v>

383
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

384
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.870
<v Speaker 2>and when you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just take,</v>

385
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.410
<v Speaker 2>find out what the symptoms are and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>treat those symptoms with medication,</v>

386
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 2>then you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing anything to fix it.</v>

387
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

388
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:45.560
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of why it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

389
00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:46.690
<v Speaker 2>for I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

390
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 2>the medical community understand it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now because if you a problem</v>

391
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 3>and you can't necessarily attribute that</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a major accident or a major injury or</v>

392
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:56.730
<v Speaker 3>a major explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's like,</v>

393
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we don't know what it is.</v>

394
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:03.050
<v Speaker 3>It's a psychological problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to put them on packet a and </v>

395
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:03.560
<v Speaker 3>we'll see how he is in two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

396
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.080
<v Speaker 3>that expression psychological issue is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real tricky one,</v>

397
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:12.081
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because your psychological makeup a lot </v>

398
00:18:12.081 --> 00:18:15.891
<v Speaker 3>of times is dependent upon your physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>health and what's going on in your body </v>

399
00:18:15.891 --> 00:18:20.601
<v Speaker 3>can greatly affect your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when someone says psychological </v>

400
00:18:20.601 --> 00:18:21.900
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for a guy like you,</v>

401
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:23.430
<v Speaker 3>what they're trying to say is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're weak,</v>

402
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to say that you can't </v>

403
00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:28.560
<v Speaker 3>handle the pressure salute and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're cracking and this is what it is,</v>

404
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.700
<v Speaker 3>the integrity of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called Comorbid and this is an </v>

405
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.361
<v Speaker 3>argument that's going back between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatric world and the non </v>

406
00:18:38.361 --> 00:18:38.700
<v Speaker 3>psychiatric world.</v>

407
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 3>We're in Comorbid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which came first,</v>

408
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:46.730
<v Speaker 3>the situation that precipitated </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression with the depression that's </v>

409
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.020
<v Speaker 3>develops the situation in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular instance relative to Andrew </v>

410
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.720
<v Speaker 3>is his chemistry of his body was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>great until he had that group of insults</v>

411
00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:03.981
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not it was that huge trump </v>

412
00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:05.901
<v Speaker 3>that got blown up 100 feet in the air </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've got the shockwave that </v>

413
00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:05.901
<v Speaker 3>knocked you out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

414
00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:09.420
<v Speaker 3>or the repetitive gunfire that you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the breaching.</v>

415
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.090
<v Speaker 3>How many licks does it take to get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the center of a tootsie roll?</v>

416
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different for everybody.</v>

417
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is so different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is as you start losing </v>

418
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.351
<v Speaker 3>these hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the hormones that I've </v>

419
00:19:21.351 --> 00:19:21.351
<v Speaker 3>repeated a number of times in our repeat</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

420
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.480
<v Speaker 3>pregnenolone has been found to control </v>
<v Speaker 3>the anxiety affect in the body,</v>

421
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
<v Speaker 3>in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So morning anxiety or pregnenolone or </v>

422
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.000
<v Speaker 3>social anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

423
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 3>can be affected.</v>

424
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.360
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have patients who have been in auto </v>

425
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.720
<v Speaker 3>accidents who never had anxiety attacks </v>
<v Speaker 3>or panic attacks,</v>

426
00:19:42.721 --> 00:19:46.890
<v Speaker 3>and they wake up six months after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>injury and they've got morning anxiety.</v>

427
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:52.220
<v Speaker 3>They are pregnenolone levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of being average about 110 are </v>

428
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 3>down at six or seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You correct them back 110,</v>

429
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:56.100
<v Speaker 3>their anxiety disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is pregnant?</v>

430
00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Pregnenolone is called the mother of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones.</v>

431
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:06.020
<v Speaker 3>It comes from cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the first hormone or steroid </v>

432
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.491
<v Speaker 3>hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>official steroid hormone that comes off </v>

433
00:20:10.491 --> 00:20:12.711
<v Speaker 3>of cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we interrupt cholesterol in our </v>

434
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lose pregnenolone,</v>

435
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.930
<v Speaker 3>which becomes the precursor to the Aga </v>
<v Speaker 3>and testosterone on one side and pro </v>

436
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.660
<v Speaker 3>progesterone and cortisol and another </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

437
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:27.110
<v Speaker 3>So with low pregnenolone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can lead to all the hormones that </v>

438
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:30.090
<v Speaker 3>help to regulate our brain function and </v>
<v Speaker 3>our life.</v>

439
00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have cortisol,</v>

440
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:36.861
<v Speaker 3>you get a syndrome called Addison's </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease and you can die and most people </v>

441
00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 3>associate cortisol with high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it being problematic,</v>

442
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:39.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stress,</v>

443
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress related,</v>

444
00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:42.810
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody thinks it's emotional stress,</v>

445
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:47.811
<v Speaker 3>but there are five stressors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know there's emotional or </v>

446
00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 3>intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional stress,</v>

447
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:53.401
<v Speaker 3>physical stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutritional stress can precipitate high </v>

448
00:20:53.401 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 3>amount of cortisol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're fasting,</v>

449
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.440
<v Speaker 3>cortisol goes up and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical stress like a chemotherapy or </v>

450
00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.950
<v Speaker 3>certain medication that you take alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

451
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Certain drugs can do it and they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence the adrenal glands.</v>

452
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Production of Cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is called an adaptogen,</v>

453
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.030
<v Speaker 3>which allows you to go from one level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical functioning,</v>

454
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 3>mental functioning to another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It adapts,</v>

455
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.690
<v Speaker 3>helps you to adapt,</v>

456
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:14.990
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

457
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I gotta tell you when I have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations with you about this issue,</v>

458
00:21:18.171 --> 00:21:20.490
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of frustrating to me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you're.</v>

459
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.330
<v Speaker 1>You're making all this sense and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this.</v>

460
00:21:23.331 --> 00:21:28.331
<v Speaker 1>This is broad spectrum of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones and all these different </v>

461
00:21:28.331 --> 00:21:32.171
<v Speaker 1>variables that exist in the human mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how importantly are to maintain </v>

462
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:33.290
<v Speaker 1>proper levels of them for how for </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

463
00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.890
<v Speaker 1>But you're just not a lot of people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out there.</v>

464
00:21:36.891 --> 00:21:40.320
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're saying is,</v>

465
00:21:40.321 --> 00:21:44.870
<v Speaker 1>is a fairly controversial treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Gordon to me like this,</v>

466
00:21:44.871 --> 00:21:47.420
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like 1960 and we're saying we're</v>

467
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.020
<v Speaker 1>going to put a man on the moon by 1969 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody says you guys are bat shit</v>

468
00:21:51.021 --> 00:21:52.460
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

469
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.020
<v Speaker 1>That that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where we're at.</v>

470
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:59.370
<v Speaker 1>It's it seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because there's not a lot of </v>

471
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:03.530
<v Speaker 1>motivation for innovation when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to treatment or is it a.</v>

472
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:08.550
<v Speaker 1>is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the resistance to understanding </v>

473
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:08.550
<v Speaker 1>all these different variables?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If for 30 years</v>

474
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 3>plus years you've been told that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>treat depression by giving this pill,</v>

475
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:18.150
<v Speaker 3>that's either an Ssri or an Abcd or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is you're going to give that</v>

476
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:21.640
<v Speaker 3>pill and if someone comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a coupe comes in and says,</v>

477
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:25.030
<v Speaker 3>look at the literature for the past 35 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

478
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.770
<v Speaker 3>even as far back as 1958 with Dah da Dah</v>
<v Speaker 3>da,</v>

479
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 3>his antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You come in with these natural products </v>

480
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.290
<v Speaker 3>that have no patents on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can walk into a GNC,</v>

481
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:43.291
<v Speaker 3>you can get it from onnit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get it from any of these </v>

482
00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:45.721
<v Speaker 3>companies and take it natural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent natural coming from Mexican </v>

483
00:22:45.721 --> 00:22:50.101
<v Speaker 3>wild yams and it fixes your depression </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it costs you three cents a day,</v>

484
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:56.011
<v Speaker 3>five cents a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ten cents a day as opposed to the cost </v>

485
00:22:56.011 --> 00:22:56.770
<v Speaker 3>for some of these other medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are you going to believe?</v>

486
00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:01.890
<v Speaker 3>This Kook who talks about over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>counter product or the pharmaceutical </v>

487
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 3>rep who talks about this prescription </v>
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>

488
00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:04.520
<v Speaker 1>That is the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

489
00:23:04.521 --> 00:23:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Official sounding names and designations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and correct.</v>

490
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.080
<v Speaker 3>I got it and it's an uphill battle in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that I approach it with my </v>

491
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.840
<v Speaker 3>science background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just medical,</v>

492
00:23:14.841 --> 00:23:19.841
<v Speaker 3>but the science research I did in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning is to line up all the </v>

493
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:24.491
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>irrefutable information and hand it to </v>

494
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:24.980
<v Speaker 3>someone and read it.</v>

495
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:30.430
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a dummy like me who's obviously in </v>

496
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.490
<v Speaker 1>the outside of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I get you in trouble?</v>

497
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.710
<v Speaker 1>You got me in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put that picture.</v>

498
00:23:33.711 --> 00:23:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Will you have lunch together and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>split here with the brilliant Dr Gordon.</v>

499
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of shit from your people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

500
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Because they said that you know you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a smart guy,</v>

501
00:23:43.041 --> 00:23:44.900
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely brilliant.</v>

502
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a dummy dummy.</v>

503
00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:54.150
<v Speaker 1>They think I'm smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because if they think I'm smart </v>

504
00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:54.150
<v Speaker 1>because they're done with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call me dumb please.</v>

505
00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:59.140
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is like for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like me that has zero science </v>

506
00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.771
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I always assume is that the way </v>

507
00:24:02.771 --> 00:24:06.251
<v Speaker 1>things got better and the way people </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure things out is that they just </v>

508
00:24:06.251 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 1>looked at the facts and then when new </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts came in,</v>

509
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:13.001
<v Speaker 1>they adjusted accordingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like there's resistance </v>

510
00:24:13.001 --> 00:24:13.001
<v Speaker 1>against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

511
00:24:13.001 --> 00:24:17.370
<v Speaker 3>The status quo is very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hand everybody this antidepressant.</v>

512
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.310
<v Speaker 3>We're not gonna hand them this natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>product that's been shown since 1986,</v>

513
00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:26.311
<v Speaker 3>1958 on another large group of research </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be beneficial blind washout studies </v>

514
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.450
<v Speaker 3>for benefit and depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural product.</v>

515
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to use natural products </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's in.</v>

516
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:37.060
<v Speaker 3>It's in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I see it stating that,</v>

517
00:24:37.061 --> 00:24:42.061
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really need the </v>

518
00:24:42.061 --> 00:24:42.370
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just get a natural product,</v>

519
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.760
<v Speaker 1>so do you think there's just so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money involved in pushing the </v>

520
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.581
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical drugs that these doctors </v>
<v Speaker 1>are reluctant to go against it or not </v>

521
00:24:50.581 --> 00:24:52.000
<v Speaker 1>prescribe it or step out on a limb?</v>

522
00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the the medical community,</v>

523
00:24:56.201 --> 00:25:01.201
<v Speaker 3>the medical boards of every state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the standard of care in your </v>

524
00:25:01.201 --> 00:25:05.071
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that if there are 100 </v>

525
00:25:05.071 --> 00:25:08.191
<v Speaker 3>doctors in a community of physicians and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the standard for 99 percent of them is </v>

526
00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:15.241
<v Speaker 3>to use a SSRI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one doctor who uses a non ssr are I </v>

527
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:21.210
<v Speaker 3>can be pulled into the medical board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has practicing outside the scope of the </v>

528
00:25:21.491 --> 00:25:26.491
<v Speaker 3>medical community as well as doctors in </v>
<v Speaker 3>general don't want to be looked at as </v>

529
00:25:26.501 --> 00:25:30.370
<v Speaker 3>being that one person who is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce something new,</v>

530
00:25:30.371 --> 00:25:32.590
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's worth something.</v>

531
00:25:32.591 --> 00:25:37.591
<v Speaker 3>They worked very diligently at for 21 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years to show the science and the </v>

532
00:25:37.591 --> 00:25:41.971
<v Speaker 3>clinical cases that it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a maverick and our medical society </v>

533
00:25:41.971 --> 00:25:44.050
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work with Mavericks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works with mass.</v>

534
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of forces that are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stacked up against it,</v>

535
00:25:47.471 --> 00:25:51.190
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason to cower and not stand up to it.</v>

536
00:25:51.191 --> 00:25:56.191
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's either it's either right or </v>

537
00:25:56.191 --> 00:25:56.640
<v Speaker 2>it isn't right and we're saying Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gordon is right and we're going to.</v>

538
00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:01.690
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna fight it to do our last </v>
<v Speaker 2>breath to change it into 300 million </v>

539
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.760
<v Speaker 2>people in America on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

540
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.180
<v Speaker 2>if you're on an antidepressant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still depressed,</v>

541
00:26:07.181 --> 00:26:08.680
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not.</v>

542
00:26:08.681 --> 00:26:10.240
<v Speaker 2>That's probably not the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition.</v>

543
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:15.330
<v Speaker 2>It's what science has shown us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Its a hormonal imbalance or able to </v>

544
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.830
<v Speaker 2>interdict that and effectively treat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is,</v>

545
00:26:17.831 --> 00:26:19.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using the term hormone,</v>

546
00:26:19.301 --> 00:26:21.880
<v Speaker 2>I've been slowly getting away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroactive steroids,</v>

547
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.140
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these neuro active neuroactive steroids </v>

548
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:28.140
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say neuro steroids.</v>

549
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:28.540
<v Speaker 2>It was</v>

550
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:32.790
<v Speaker 3>found in 1986 by a Dr blue out of bay </v>
<v Speaker 3>loop out of Paris,</v>

551
00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:37.470
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the brain has the chemistry to take</v>

552
00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:40.320
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol and to make it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone,</v>

553
00:26:40.321 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 3>make it into pregnenolone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it into progesterone in the brain.</v>

554
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.110
<v Speaker 3>For many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years,</v>

555
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:49.260
<v Speaker 3>biopsies of the brain would find </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone it and they thought it came</v>

556
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:54.261
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know your testicles or thyroid in </v>

557
00:26:54.261 --> 00:26:54.261
<v Speaker 3>the that came from your thyroid gland in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neck.</v>

558
00:26:54.261 --> 00:26:59.000
<v Speaker 3>What we're finding is neuro steroids are</v>
<v Speaker 3>made what we called the Nova within the </v>

559
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:04.221
<v Speaker 3>brain itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you have trauma or </v>

560
00:27:04.221 --> 00:27:04.221
<v Speaker 3>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose that,</v>

561
00:27:04.221 --> 00:27:09.021
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I believe based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading the literature and my </v>

562
00:27:09.021 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 3>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what can be faulted.</v>

563
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:14.331
<v Speaker 3>How I interpret it is that that is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause for all the transitions in the </v>

564
00:27:14.331 --> 00:27:18.561
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are receptors in the brain </v>

565
00:27:18.561 --> 00:27:22.280
<v Speaker 3>that regulate how nerves conduct and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they found is these nerves have not</v>

566
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 3>only magnesium.</v>

567
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Zinc is a volume receptor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they found a pregnenolone receptor,</v>

568
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.880
<v Speaker 3>so they found a receptor which </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnenolone works to regulate,</v>

569
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:37.881
<v Speaker 3>to smooth out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to calm you down so that you're not </v>

570
00:27:37.881 --> 00:27:39.960
<v Speaker 3>having panic attacks or emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>turpitude and yelling,</v>

571
00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:44.961
<v Speaker 3>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and picking up a gun and shooting </v>

572
00:27:44.961 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 3>someone or throwing something or yelling</v>
<v Speaker 3>or beating someone up,</v>

573
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:50.421
<v Speaker 3>getting assaulted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her sympathetic nervous system has just </v>

574
00:27:50.421 --> 00:27:50.880
<v Speaker 3>gone crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole,</v>

575
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 3>the entire nervous system goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in a sense,</v>

576
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying is there's different </v>
<v Speaker 3>types of testosterone,</v>

577
00:27:57.991 --> 00:28:02.991
<v Speaker 3>different types of hormones that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced in different areas of the body </v>

578
00:28:02.991 --> 00:28:03.190
<v Speaker 3>that it's not just your testicles that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are doing it.</v>

579
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.980
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same testosterone.</v>

580
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people talk about bio equivalent bio.</v>

581
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bio identical hormones,</v>

582
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.820
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be testosterone has to be equal </v>

583
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.150
<v Speaker 3>bioequivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the brain produces the same </v>

584
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:20.460
<v Speaker 3>testosterone as the testicles.</v>

585
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 3>The brain produces same pregnenolone as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cholesterol elsewhere in the city.</v>

586
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:30.410
<v Speaker 3>When the brain is injured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it no longer produces it at the correct </v>

587
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:31.080
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

588
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.200
<v Speaker 3>You lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In studies that are done in Alzheimer's </v>

589
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.751
<v Speaker 3>patients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found the frontal lobes of the </v>

590
00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:38.751
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which regulates executive function,</v>

591
00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 3>making sure that you make the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>

592
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 3>You're able to make the coffee in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right sequence,</v>

593
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:47.610
<v Speaker 3>making sure the butters at the end is </v>
<v Speaker 3>all regulated by the frontal part of the</v>

594
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:52.611
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the most common area that is </v>

595
00:28:52.611 --> 00:28:54.951
<v Speaker 3>damaged in to and fro kind of auto </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidents or explosions throw you back,</v>

596
00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.060
<v Speaker 3>so they found pregnenolone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pregnenolone deficiency,</v>

597
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:02.250
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're finding in boxers,</v>

598
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.920
<v Speaker 3>in pugilists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in MMA and everybody,</v>

599
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:09.921
<v Speaker 3>there's a deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think I shared with you a nfl did </v>

600
00:29:09.921 --> 00:29:13.311
<v Speaker 3>a study where they found that 19 times </v>
<v Speaker 3>faster box of nfl players are 19 times </v>

601
00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:21.990
<v Speaker 3>more prone to develop Alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease between 30 and 50 years of age.</v>

602
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.180
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a second.</v>

603
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Thirty years of age developing </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alzheimer's.</v>

604
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that recent study that said </v>
<v Speaker 3>96 percent of all former players have a </v>

605
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.640
<v Speaker 3>gte?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

606
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Ninety six percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety six percent.</v>

607
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.480
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

608
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was 97 out of 98.</v>

609
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.890
<v Speaker 3>People have brains that were tested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had cte,</v>

610
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.880
<v Speaker 3>which I guess is 96 percent phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why don't they do the same testing </v>

611
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:52.820
<v Speaker 3>for military and soldiers?</v>

612
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Dr Gordon was saying about all the </v>

613
00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:58.560
<v Speaker 2>different neuro steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

614
00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.651
<v Speaker 2>like cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying as a precursor to </v>

615
00:30:01.651 --> 00:30:01.651
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

616
00:30:01.651 --> 00:30:02.680
<v Speaker 2>but if you take a stat and drug that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lowers your cholesterol,</v>

617
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The byproduct that is,</v>

618
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.460
<v Speaker 2>it messes up your testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

619
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.220
<v Speaker 2>what we're understanding is our </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemistry is all linked,</v>

620
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.420
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all together.</v>

621
00:30:10.421 --> 00:30:12.760
<v Speaker 2>If you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just treat testosterone.</v>

622
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 2>If the stuff above it isn't as affected </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not treating that well,</v>

623
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:17.620
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The military model doesn't even test for</v>

624
00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:21.070
<v Speaker 2>that and if you're not treating things </v>
<v Speaker 2>below testosterone that,</v>

625
00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:23.170
<v Speaker 2>that produces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at that level with it.</v>

626
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:28.290
<v Speaker 2>If it's deficient or insufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're not going to get what you </v>

627
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:28.290
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So until you look at your body,</v>

628
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.490
<v Speaker 2>your chemistry as a whole and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>interdicted accordingly,</v>

629
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.690
<v Speaker 2>you're going to continue to have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mass problems across the board and</v>

630
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:37.870
<v Speaker 2>the ones that are manifesting and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with soldiers,</v>

631
00:30:37.871 --> 00:30:39.850
<v Speaker 2>with fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with football players.</v>

632
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.640
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end if you take these drugs,</v>

633
00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.890
<v Speaker 2>alter it then with the civilian </v>
<v Speaker 2>population as well.</v>

634
00:30:44.891 --> 00:30:47.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a niche market here,</v>

635
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 2>it's everybody is affected by this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the,</v>

636
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:52.090
<v Speaker 2>what's amazing about what Dr Warren's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

637
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.130
<v Speaker 2>It could fix a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

638
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:59.190
<v Speaker 3>the things that has just come up on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>table is looking back at the thousand </v>

639
00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:04.260
<v Speaker 3>plus people that we've put on a program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately we only have about 50 </v>

640
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:04.840
<v Speaker 3>veterans on program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rest are civilians.</v>

641
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:10.290
<v Speaker 3>What we're seeing is those that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted to opioids or narcotics or </v>

642
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.290
<v Speaker 3>alcohol addiction are able to get off at</v>
<v Speaker 3>rapidly.</v>

643
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:19.710
<v Speaker 3>When Matthew was on here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matthew was on 15 different drugs of </v>

644
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.981
<v Speaker 3>that grouping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on eight oxycotton a day and I </v>

645
00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:23.110
<v Speaker 3>spoke to him recently specifically about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

646
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:26.740
<v Speaker 3>He was taking it for 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on morphine 40 tablets.</v>

647
00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:29.740
<v Speaker 3>It's either 40 or 60 milligrams per </v>
<v Speaker 3>tablet and then fentanyl,</v>

648
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.840
<v Speaker 3>fentanyl patch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fentanyl patch,</v>

649
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.620
<v Speaker 3>which is a pain patch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in six weeks he was off of 14 of the</v>

650
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.480
<v Speaker 3>15 medications,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pain patch on top of all those pills,</v>

651
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.590
<v Speaker 3>but he had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had surgery on his jaw with six pins.</v>

652
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.770
<v Speaker 3>He had treadmill pulled out of his list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left Occiput,</v>

653
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:53.040
<v Speaker 3>and he had his left leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was shot out and he had </v>

654
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.461
<v Speaker 3>chronic pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he was on all these pain </v>

655
00:31:56.461 --> 00:31:56.461
<v Speaker 3>medications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's off all of that now.</v>

656
00:31:56.461 --> 00:31:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

657
00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:01.950
<v Speaker 3>vitamin D deficiency has been found to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a cause for inflammation.</v>

658
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.280
<v Speaker 3>It also low vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a very low pain threshold.</v>

659
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Increasing vitamin D improves that </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone changes how we perceive </v>

660
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.390
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm stabilizing the pregnenolone and all</v>

661
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:16.030
<v Speaker 3>those hormones in the brain changes how </v>
<v Speaker 3>we perceive life.</v>

662
00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 3>When you're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you perceive pain,</v>

663
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 3>very little pain as big pain when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not depressed.</v>

664
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

665
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Bump yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get better.</v>

666
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

667
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.550
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we were having this conversation at</v>

668
00:32:29.551 --> 00:32:31.320
<v Speaker 2>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about this,</v>

669
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:36.350
<v Speaker 2>you were bringing up stem cells and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effect that stem cells are having </v>

670
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 2>and stem cell injections on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on people that have all sorts</v>

671
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 3>of serious traumatic injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that with the brain as well?</v>

672
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have they figured out how to squirt that</v>

673
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:50.690
<v Speaker 3>shit into your dome in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>

674
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.960
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2012.</v>

675
00:32:53.961 --> 00:32:58.961
<v Speaker 3>I went to Germany to Dusseldorf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany to work for the doctors who was </v>

676
00:32:58.961 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 3>taking autologous stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He take out of the patient's stem cells,</v>

677
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 3>send them to Israel to get an augmented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to increase the amount and get them back</v>

678
00:33:05.961 --> 00:33:10.961
<v Speaker 3>in 48 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this absolutely incredible </v>

679
00:33:10.961 --> 00:33:14.300
<v Speaker 3>three dimensional positioning needle </v>
<v Speaker 3>that use three dimension,</v>

680
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:15.410
<v Speaker 3>three axis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these x,</v>

681
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:16.040
<v Speaker 3>y,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Z.</v>

682
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:21.190
<v Speaker 3>and was able to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We drilled a hole in the skull and we </v>

683
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.360
<v Speaker 3>put a needle in directly into the fourth</v>
<v Speaker 3>ventricle,</v>

684
00:33:23.361 --> 00:33:28.361
<v Speaker 3>which is that fluid compartment in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain and injected the stem cells and </v>

685
00:33:28.361 --> 00:33:30.080
<v Speaker 3>it's spread out to the brain to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain stem,</v>

686
00:33:30.081 --> 00:33:33.020
<v Speaker 3>because this gentleman had a brainstem </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemorrhage,</v>

687
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:38.210
<v Speaker 3>and within 48 hours to 72 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started having these improvements,</v>

688
00:33:38.211 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 3>hearing improved physical functioning.</v>

689
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.640
<v Speaker 3>He was in a wheelchair with a belt to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold them in place.</v>

690
00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.080
<v Speaker 3>Three days later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not using a belt for 12 years since</v>

691
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 3>he had his stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't able to pick up a coffee cup,</v>

692
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.270
<v Speaker 3>a coffee Mug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hold it.</v>

693
00:33:53.271 --> 00:33:58.271
<v Speaker 3>He can only use a straw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was picking up his Coffee Cup and </v>

694
00:33:58.271 --> 00:33:58.760
<v Speaker 3>drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>

695
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:04.120
<v Speaker 3>there are places around the planet that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are using stem cells and people with </v>

696
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with als,</v>

697
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 3>with traumatic brain injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's getting benefits.</v>

698
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:12.650
<v Speaker 3>There are benefits in my projects in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Beijing,</v>

699
00:34:12.651 --> 00:34:17.651
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stem cells called Mesenchymal stem </v>

700
00:34:17.651 --> 00:34:19.730
<v Speaker 3>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are the ones that loved the organs</v>

701
00:34:19.731 --> 00:34:20.790
<v Speaker 3>come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

702
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:25.850
<v Speaker 3>in diabetics injecting one injection of </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 million mesenchymal cells into the </v>

703
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:31.250
<v Speaker 3>patient through an IV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 percent of them lost their diabetes,</v>

704
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:36.470
<v Speaker 3>a 45 percent and had a decrease in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>insulin requirement and 25 percent of </v>

705
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:37.400
<v Speaker 3>them didn't have any effect.</v>

706
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:43.540
<v Speaker 3>And this is a center with 26 md phds in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Beijing that tops in their field.</v>

707
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.230
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of hope in that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

708
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems like something that would,</v>

709
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.190
<v Speaker 3>if you're injecting it directly into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>traumatic,</v>

710
00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.650
<v Speaker 3>the area has experienced trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

711
00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.430
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

712
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:00.050
<v Speaker 3>orthopedic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a buddy of mine,</v>

713
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.720
<v Speaker 3>a sentinel sentinel who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

714
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:08.410
<v Speaker 3>was using autologous stem cells that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out a patient and injected into </v>

715
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.110
<v Speaker 3>the knees and get rebuild of the knees </v>
<v Speaker 3>without needing surgery.</v>

716
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:15.280
<v Speaker 3>What I'm hearing too is about rebuilding</v>
<v Speaker 3>cartloads that people have had bone on </v>

717
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:15.280
<v Speaker 3>bone cartilage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're rebuilding it.</v>

718
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a couple of protocols.</v>

719
00:35:17.811 --> 00:35:22.811
<v Speaker 3>There was one by a Dr Allen are done out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Miami orthopedic surgeon who showed </v>

720
00:35:24.471 --> 00:35:29.471
<v Speaker 3>that if you go in with the arthroscopic </v>
<v Speaker 3>scope and you use a bird,</v>

721
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:34.990
<v Speaker 3>which is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sandpaper device and you rubbed the </v>

722
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.951
<v Speaker 3>bone and then injected with growth </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormone that he was able to get five to </v>

723
00:35:38.951 --> 00:35:38.951
<v Speaker 3>10</v>

724
00:35:38.951 --> 00:35:42.000
<v Speaker 4>millimeters of regeneration of cartilage</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our office.</v>

725
00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 4>We use prolific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge significant,</v>

726
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.640
<v Speaker 4>and he did a Harvard study that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>publication Kane at Harvard.</v>

727
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 4>He patented the toe thick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 millimeters.</v>

728
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.220
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Ten centimeters.</v>

729
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Ten millimeter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty $5 a.</v>

730
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.410
<v Speaker 4>that's a pad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

731
00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:00.120
<v Speaker 4>It's a nice thickness that developed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So um,</v>

732
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:05.180
<v Speaker 4>but no one's doing that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>illegal to use growth hormone in that </v>

733
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:09.351
<v Speaker 4>fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A growth hormone has a very restricted </v>

734
00:36:09.351 --> 00:36:09.420
<v Speaker 4>use parameters on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>

735
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:11.130
<v Speaker 4>Because like baseball players and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

736
00:36:11.131 --> 00:36:14.310
<v Speaker 4>I think that had a lot to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Public Impressions of it.</v>

737
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.320
<v Speaker 4>This stuff works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works phenomenally well.</v>

738
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.820
<v Speaker 4>That's so frustrating to me when </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's really,</v>

739
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:25.821
<v Speaker 4>really effective gets illegal because </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletes are using it and becoming more </v>

740
00:36:25.821 --> 00:36:26.500
<v Speaker 4>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

741
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.800
<v Speaker 4>it's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a complete misconception.</v>

742
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:31.660
<v Speaker 4>It's ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the goal is,</v>

743
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 4>if the true altruistic goal in medicine </v>
<v Speaker 4>is to fix people,</v>

744
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:41.570
<v Speaker 4>then why are we being restricted in </v>
<v Speaker 4>using the things that we see fixing </v>

745
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:41.570
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>

746
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stem cell stuff was everybody was </v>

747
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.781
<v Speaker 4>always worried that people were going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get it from fetuses and then somehow </v>

748
00:36:47.781 --> 00:36:51.111
<v Speaker 4>it's going to encourage abortions until </v>
<v Speaker 4>they figured out how to get it from </v>

749
00:36:51.111 --> 00:36:52.510
<v Speaker 4>other means and once they figured out </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to like get it from.</v>

750
00:36:52.511 --> 00:36:54.660
<v Speaker 4>And then now that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that debates off the table,</v>

751
00:36:54.661 --> 00:36:56.700
<v Speaker 4>but for the longest time that was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>big issue.</v>

752
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Like during the Bush administration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

753
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 4>They held back stem cell research </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the right wing Christians.</v>

754
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's one cell,</v>

755
00:37:05.161 --> 00:37:06.620
<v Speaker 4>single cell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>single cell,</v>

756
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.100
<v Speaker 4>single cell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

757
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's what,</v>

758
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:13.650
<v Speaker 4>10 years that they put the moratorium on</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing any research in stem cells,</v>

759
00:37:13.651 --> 00:37:17.250
<v Speaker 4>which is giving Switzerland is giving </v>
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

760
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.520
<v Speaker 4>is giving Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

761
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:23.580
<v Speaker 4>massive advantage to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be diagnosed clinically as dead,</v>

762
00:37:23.581 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 4>you have to be brain dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if there's not even a brain in there,</v>

763
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:27.090
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can you say that?</v>

764
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Taking a single cell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean picking your nose is going to </v>

765
00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:33.360
<v Speaker 4>kill more single cells then doing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>for stem cell research,</v>

766
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.540
<v Speaker 4>but the reaper cut real quick killing </v>
<v Speaker 4>your single cells.</v>

767
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 4>But the repercussion of that could be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>game changer across the for everything.</v>

768
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:41.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

769
00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:43.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to think of stem cells as well.</v>

770
00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:44.870
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

771
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:49.320
<v Speaker 4>some future therapy that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>cool until I got a shot into my shoulder</v>

772
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy fuck.</v>

773
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.810
<v Speaker 4>Like this is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this shoulder is bothering me for a</v>

774
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.280
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Bothering me at all anymore.</v>

775
00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.920
<v Speaker 4>How quick turnaround is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A couple of weeks.</v>

776
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.840
<v Speaker 4>Within a couple of weeks I started </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling great.</v>

777
00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.390
<v Speaker 4>Now it's two months out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's been two months out.</v>

778
00:38:03.391 --> 00:38:06.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>PRP or stem cells,</v>

779
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.000
<v Speaker 4>stem cells where they get the stem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>placenta,</v>

780
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:12.630
<v Speaker 4>placenta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a technique which is prp,</v>

781
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:15.810
<v Speaker 4>which is platelet rich plasma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is similar to.</v>

782
00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.190
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets a of cope.</v>

783
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's similar to a Regena cane,</v>

784
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Except that they don't,</v>

785
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:25.700
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Regeneca is that stuff that Dr Peter </v>

786
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 4>Welling figured out in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the blood spinning procedure that</v>

787
00:38:27.451 --> 00:38:31.830
<v Speaker 4>heat up the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a more advanced version of platelet</v>

788
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 4>rich plasma and what they do and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>it Australia,</v>

789
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:40.651
<v Speaker 4>they expose it to a specials frequency </v>
<v Speaker 4>of ultraviolet light to take care of any</v>

790
00:38:41.621 --> 00:38:46.621
<v Speaker 4>of the inflammatory chemistry that's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there through a photo of the activation </v>

791
00:38:46.621 --> 00:38:51.510
<v Speaker 4>and the PRP works very well seen as </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's more acceptable than </v>

792
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:57.811
<v Speaker 4>doing autologous stem cell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which there's a number of ways to do it </v>

793
00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:57.811
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the point.</v>

794
00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 4>There's a number of different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get stem cells.</v>

795
00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well a lot of UFC fighters getting it </v>

796
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:05.251
<v Speaker 1>now and what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good percentage of them or they get </v>

797
00:39:05.251 --> 00:39:06.070
<v Speaker 1>their fat sucked out of their body out </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed.</v>

798
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.790
<v Speaker 1>They're turning that into stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then shooting into their knees and their</v>

799
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 1>shoulders and what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having incredible results.</v>

800
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:15.610
<v Speaker 1>A lot of MMA fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of grapplers are doing it.</v>

801
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I need to get that done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

802
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:18.370
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you man,</v>

803
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

804
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know if mine's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated incident,</v>

805
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.850
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so blown away.</v>

806
00:39:24.851 --> 00:39:26.920
<v Speaker 1>I was on the verge of surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>

807
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be out for three months.</v>

808
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:30.560
<v Speaker 1>We'll be in a sling for eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baba,</v>

809
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I was going over my head how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>downtime,</v>

810
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:35.170
<v Speaker 1>what can I do during that downtime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

811
00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I was preparing to have a useless </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>

812
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Now all of a sudden I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

813
00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean with zero pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

814
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.250
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some weird noise is still,</v>

815
00:39:43.251 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no pain and no limit,</v>

816
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 1>no restriction in movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no it doesn't,</v>

817
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.270
<v Speaker 1>there's no impingements no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

818
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Jerking off is no problem.</v>

819
00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.370
<v Speaker 4>I have a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

820
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.170
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mark.</v>

821
00:39:57.171 --> 00:39:58.550
<v Speaker 4>I have a non union,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my left Fibula,</v>

822
00:39:58.551 --> 00:40:01.520
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's broken and I would love to do that.</v>

823
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.990
<v Speaker 4>Non Union and your fibula.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fibula is a small bowl or non white non </v>

824
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.990
<v Speaker 4>weight bearing bone in two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a metal,</v>

825
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.130
<v Speaker 4>a titanium plate and it got broken to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pieces on my first deployment and I just</v>

826
00:40:13.131 --> 00:40:16.880
<v Speaker 4>never had it fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the plates broken to place broken and</v>

827
00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:17.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I've been,</v>

828
00:40:17.511 --> 00:40:20.420
<v Speaker 4>they've wanted to fix it but they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like nine month rehab and I was like,</v>

829
00:40:20.421 --> 00:40:21.770
<v Speaker 4>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nine months.</v>

830
00:40:21.771 --> 00:40:22.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

831
00:40:22.581 --> 00:40:24.230
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work now.</v>

832
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

833
00:40:25.191 --> 00:40:29.270
<v Speaker 4>So they would take the titanium plate </v>
<v Speaker 4>out a re a graph.</v>

834
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:34.340
<v Speaker 4>It had the graph,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the graph it take stuff for my hip </v>

835
00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:34.520
<v Speaker 4>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was just like,</v>

836
00:40:34.521 --> 00:40:36.020
<v Speaker 4>it's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to keep on,</v>

837
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:37.100
<v Speaker 4>keep on keeping on.</v>

838
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:42.490
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I knew I found out about stem </v>

839
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:42.490
<v Speaker 4>cells and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna wait till I can do that.</v>

840
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:43.600
<v Speaker 4>We'll be back next week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And can the stem cells fix that?</v>

841
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.570
<v Speaker 4>They can help with the bones that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>non.</v>

842
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.780
<v Speaker 4>If they're close enough help with </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonunion fusion.</v>

843
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Helped with fusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

844
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.270
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could help regenerate.</v>

845
00:40:53.271 --> 00:40:54.810
<v Speaker 4>And then the speed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

846
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.430
<v Speaker 4>the therapy time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the turnaround time for your.</v>

847
00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.020
<v Speaker 4>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

848
00:40:58.021 --> 00:40:58.740
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if it's,</v>

849
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.010
<v Speaker 4>know if it's nine months now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's three months.</v>

850
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.420
<v Speaker 4>It's just so frustrating when you hear </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how much time they spent</v>

851
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:11.890
<v Speaker 1>banning stem cell research because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new research that they're doing now </v>

852
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:12.470
<v Speaker 1>and regenerating things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

853
00:41:12.471 --> 00:41:12.750
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

854
00:41:12.751 --> 00:41:17.751
<v Speaker 1>they've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've sequenced the gene of the </v>

855
00:41:17.751 --> 00:41:18.260
<v Speaker 1>flatworm and they think they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to figure out within x amount of</v>

856
00:41:18.261 --> 00:41:20.570
<v Speaker 1>years how to regenerate limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

857
00:41:20.571 --> 00:41:21.890
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

858
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:27.860
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're getting into some really crazy </v>

859
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.040
<v Speaker 4>area with state of science and medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do we do?</v>

860
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:33.050
<v Speaker 4>We stop using all the technology that </v>
<v Speaker 4>can help people today waiting for the </v>

861
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.230
<v Speaker 4>technology decade</v>

862
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.110
<v Speaker 3>from now on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's even sillier.</v>

863
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happened.</v>

864
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.690
<v Speaker 3>It's so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No reasons being applied this problem.</v>

865
00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

866
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

867
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:48.100
<v Speaker 3>that stem cells would be a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>one for people with traumatic brain </v>

868
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:48.100
<v Speaker 3>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

869
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:48.650
<v Speaker 3>when you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

870
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 3>I think stem cells is a good option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

871
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is it that you're looking at?</v>

872
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 3>You look at someone who has had a loss </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a segment of their brain,</v>

873
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.720
<v Speaker 3>you want to try and regenerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

874
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.220
<v Speaker 3>we know that possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

875
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.090
<v Speaker 3>we know from studies that were done back</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1911,</v>

876
00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a Dr Kegel.</v>

877
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>28 is a doc up in mcgill university,</v>

878
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:16.030
<v Speaker 3>a guru,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a total girl who's does regenerative </v>

879
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.991
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason why nerves can </v>

880
00:42:19.991 --> 00:42:22.660
<v Speaker 3>regenerate is because they're in a non </v>
<v Speaker 3>permissive environment is what I call it</v>

881
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 3>lecture.</v>

882
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:28.450
<v Speaker 3>I give on this specific topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there are so many chemicals in </v>

883
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:32.390
<v Speaker 3>the brain that are trying to foster </v>
<v Speaker 3>regeneration of nerves.</v>

884
00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:37.391
<v Speaker 3>Like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually I just doing a study on a </v>

885
00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 3>byproduct of progesterone called Aloe </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnenolone,</v>

886
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:42.110
<v Speaker 3>which is neuro regenerative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a snapped agentic,</v>

887
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:46.070
<v Speaker 3>which means that the connection from one</v>
<v Speaker 3>nerve to another nerve is a synapse.</v>

888
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.620
<v Speaker 3>If it's damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can regenerate.</v>

889
00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:53.621
<v Speaker 3>It also pray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allopregnanolone is a free radical </v>

890
00:42:53.621 --> 00:42:53.780
<v Speaker 3>scavenger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As we age,</v>

891
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.740
<v Speaker 3>as our biochemistry changes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy production in our brain,</v>

892
00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.920
<v Speaker 3>through mitochondria changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot more of oxidation occurs or free </v>

893
00:43:03.021 --> 00:43:08.021
<v Speaker 3>radicals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's called oxidative stress and </v>

894
00:43:08.021 --> 00:43:11.021
<v Speaker 3>it's believed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in great articles by a </v>

895
00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:11.021
<v Speaker 3>gentleman at USC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a caliphate.</v>

896
00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Finch talks about aging of the brain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>loss of our functioning due to this </v>

897
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:20.831
<v Speaker 3>oxidative stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he believes that oxidative stress </v>

898
00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:24.341
<v Speaker 3>leads to hormone deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leads to physical deficiency and death </v>

899
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:28.400
<v Speaker 3>and recent group of articles showed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

900
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:33.350
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing a lot of a type of diabetes</v>
<v Speaker 3>called insulin resistant diabetes.</v>

901
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Were you making too much insulin because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not being recognized by the cells.</v>

902
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:42.740
<v Speaker 3>So they found in these group of articles</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out that if there's inflammation of</v>

903
00:43:42.741 --> 00:43:44.360
<v Speaker 3>an area of the brain called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothalamus,</v>

904
00:43:44.361 --> 00:43:48.710
<v Speaker 3>which regulates our energy use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it can predispose you to developing</v>

905
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:53.480
<v Speaker 3>this situation called insulin resistant </v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetes or the Metabolic Syndrome.</v>

906
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:57.860
<v Speaker 3>So we've been tracking our patient </v>
<v Speaker 3>population who have had significant head</v>

907
00:43:57.861 --> 00:44:02.861
<v Speaker 3>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's blast with physical </v>

908
00:44:02.861 --> 00:44:05.321
<v Speaker 3>injury or blunt head injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who fell off a second story and </v>

909
00:44:05.321 --> 00:44:06.410
<v Speaker 3>hit their head was unconscious for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>

910
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:07.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're developed,</v>

911
00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:12.911
<v Speaker 3>they've developed or they came into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>office already with this insulin </v>

912
00:44:12.911 --> 00:44:17.051
<v Speaker 3>resistance and it's easy to fix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct their hormones given chromate </v>

913
00:44:17.051 --> 00:44:18.290
<v Speaker 3>and monitor them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's chromium?</v>

914
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Chromium is a mineral metal which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>important for insulin recognition at the</v>

915
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 3>cell wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was called by c Everett Koop,</v>

916
00:44:28.641 --> 00:44:29.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

917
00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.480
<v Speaker 3>the insulin tolerant factor back in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>late nineties.</v>

918
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:38.720
<v Speaker 3>So this chromium hooked up to a nice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>called chromium poly.</v>

919
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Nakota donated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trade name is called chromate.</v>

920
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we use it for our patients with type two</v>

921
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:48.810
<v Speaker 3>diabetes called insulin resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they all reverse.</v>

922
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.310
<v Speaker 3>They all get better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their blood sugar stabilized,</v>

923
00:44:51.311 --> 00:44:53.760
<v Speaker 3>the fats get better and their insulin </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes down.</v>

924
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.240
<v Speaker 3>So we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact one of our neighbors had an </v>

925
00:44:59.240 --> 00:44:59.240
<v Speaker 3>insulin level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred 17.</v>

926
00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.410
<v Speaker 3>It should be less than 25 once we </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct it,</v>

927
00:45:01.411 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 3>is two stops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drone and his chromium,</v>

928
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.120
<v Speaker 3>his levels dropped down below 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is where you'd like to have it.</v>

929
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:13.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to this radio lab </v>

930
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:13.310
<v Speaker 3>podcast recently and they were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about lithium.</v>

931
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.340
<v Speaker 3>There was a woman who takes lithium </v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's a,</v>

932
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:19.550
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's bipolar and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know lithium is just a salt </v>

933
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.180
<v Speaker 3>lithium chloride sodium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

934
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:24.810
<v Speaker 3>It's just an element.</v>

935
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.260
<v Speaker 3>And coordinate takes this and she's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

936
00:45:28.261 --> 00:45:31.530
<v Speaker 3>I haven't looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are people,</v>

937
00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:33.830
<v Speaker 3>you can buy it over the counter now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but very low.</v>

938
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lithium,</v>

939
00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:36.750
<v Speaker 3>you can buy over the counter ended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't.</v>

940
00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:41.360
<v Speaker 3>For what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I need to go learn lithium.</v>

941
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it seems like for me,</v>

942
00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 3>ignorantly when I heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

943
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:50.511
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought lithium was some hardcore </v>

944
00:45:50.511 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 3>Prozac type drug that they put people on</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're out of their fucking mind.</v>

945
00:45:52.471 --> 00:45:57.471
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it was just a salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's metal or was it beneficial Dr </v>

946
00:45:57.471 --> 00:46:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Gordon or cannot be used for official.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starting to what started it was I would </v>

947
00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.820
<v Speaker 3>see patients coming in with bipolar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being on lithium and then started seeing</v>

948
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:07.850
<v Speaker 3>patients who are coming in on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

949
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.860
<v Speaker 3>just taking it as because of articles </v>
<v Speaker 3>and life extension magazine or one of </v>

950
00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.881
<v Speaker 3>those other science based journals or </v>
<v Speaker 3>magazines.</v>

951
00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 3>But I haven't had a chance to go and </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it closely,</v>

952
00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:24.120
<v Speaker 3>but it's very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the metals,</v>

953
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:29.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a magnesium works on one of </v>

954
00:46:29.121 --> 00:46:29.940
<v Speaker 3>the brain receptors that if you take </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnesium,</v>

955
00:46:29.941 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 3>it'll make you calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Magnesium metal,</v>

956
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about a solid magnesium </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbonate magnesium.</v>

957
00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.310
<v Speaker 3>Zinc makes your testosterone goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

958
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.350
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zincs involved in 300 processes in the </v>

959
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:42.660
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's anti viral and anti cancer and it's</v>

960
00:46:42.661 --> 00:46:46.050
<v Speaker 3>anti Alzheimer's and 300 processes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the body.</v>

961
00:46:46.051 --> 00:46:48.450
<v Speaker 3>One of them is a natural Roman tastes </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhibitor,</v>

962
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:53.660
<v Speaker 3>so I've never used the idexx in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice or an astros salt in my </v>

963
00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:53.660
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

964
00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Aromatase inhibitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aromatase swelled.</v>

965
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Testosterone converts to Estradiol </v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally and it's the body adapts to </v>

966
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:06.531
<v Speaker 3>what we do to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you give an overwhelming amount of </v>

967
00:47:06.531 --> 00:47:06.531
<v Speaker 3>testosterone to the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body says,</v>

968
00:47:06.531 --> 00:47:07.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now what am I going to do with this?</v>

969
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 3>So it will either send it down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>estrogen,</v>

970
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.510
<v Speaker 3>Estradiol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it'll send it to another thing called</v>

971
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:16.870
<v Speaker 3>dihydrotestosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Estrodial obviously get man boobs.</v>

972
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.020
<v Speaker 3>She got crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whipping and so forth.</v>

973
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:24.470
<v Speaker 3>And dht causes hair loss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>causes testicles to show how you looked </v>

974
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:25.510
<v Speaker 3>at my head when you said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

975
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.260
<v Speaker 3>saddleback back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

976
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are side effects.</v>

977
00:47:31.031 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

978
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.060
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in replenishing testosterone,</v>

979
00:47:34.061 --> 00:47:35.830
<v Speaker 3>you have to be careful with the balance </v>
<v Speaker 3>you use.</v>

980
00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you start throwing things in </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an astro which blocks Esta dial,</v>

981
00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 3>which is extremely important for </v>
<v Speaker 3>generating growth hormone in the brain,</v>

982
00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:47.850
<v Speaker 3>helping blood flow and keeping the </v>
<v Speaker 3>immune system unique to the brain </v>

983
00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:48.230
<v Speaker 3>functional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

984
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:53.310
<v Speaker 3>everything we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always a risk to benefit factor </v>

985
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.461
<v Speaker 3>that needs to be looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that some of the risk </v>

986
00:47:56.461 --> 00:47:56.461
<v Speaker 3>factors are being ignored.</v>

987
00:47:56.461 --> 00:47:57.080
<v Speaker 1>This woman in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

988
00:47:57.110 --> 00:48:02.110
<v Speaker 1>this radiolab podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was having an issue with kidney </v>

989
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:02.930
<v Speaker 1>failure and they were going to make her </v>
<v Speaker 1>get off of the lithium.</v>

990
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:05.760
<v Speaker 1>The lithium has a negative publicity,</v>

991
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has toxicity and it's dose dependent </v>

992
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:14.261
<v Speaker 3>toxicity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the uniqueness of the person's </v>

993
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:14.540
<v Speaker 3>biochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make a very low amount toxic for</v>

994
00:48:14.541 --> 00:48:16.670
<v Speaker 3>you or another person and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningless</v>

995
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.100
<v Speaker 1>to silver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman who was this massive conflict</v>

996
00:48:19.101 --> 00:48:24.101
<v Speaker 1>because this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff was saving her when she had </v>

997
00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.300
<v Speaker 1>allowed her to be herself and now all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden they were telling her,</v>

998
00:48:26.301 --> 00:48:31.301
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to get off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had been off of it before and </v>

999
00:48:31.301 --> 00:48:34.481
<v Speaker 1>just lost her marbles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving her and killing her at the same </v>

1000
00:48:34.481 --> 00:48:34.481
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:48:34.481 --> 00:48:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1002
00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:40.241
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there another way that people can </v>

1003
00:48:40.241 --> 00:48:40.300
<v Speaker 1>avoid that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>

1004
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:41.510
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is another way that it could have.</v>

1005
00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.520
<v Speaker 1>They could avoid the effects of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar,</v>

1006
00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:44.720
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

1007
00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:45.480
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1008
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:47.870
<v Speaker 1>do you want to say anything about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew?</v>

1009
00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1010
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:55.530
<v Speaker 3>we think that you can treat that by </v>
<v Speaker 3>treating a neuroactive steroids in the </v>

1011
00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:55.530
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1012
00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:55.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1013
00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:59.780
<v Speaker 3>it's been shown that it's been backed up</v>
<v Speaker 3>by evidence and proof and his clinical </v>

1014
00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.630
<v Speaker 3>application as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's very much the case.</v>

1015
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:07.500
<v Speaker 3>So how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm testosterone is a generally </v>

1016
00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:12.460
<v Speaker 3>perceived as being a sex hormone or </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a reproductive hormone.</v>

1017
00:49:12.461 --> 00:49:17.461
<v Speaker 3>What we're finding is that it's involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an incredible array of different </v>

1018
00:49:17.461 --> 00:49:19.040
<v Speaker 3>processes in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1019
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 3>studies on the emotional center of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

1020
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:27.721
<v Speaker 3>The limbic system found that it helps to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stabilize a panic and also anger and </v>

1021
00:49:28.421 --> 00:49:31.270
<v Speaker 3>aggression in reactiveness to our </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1022
00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.700
<v Speaker 3>If it's slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hyper reactive.</v>

1023
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.300
<v Speaker 3>They're finding that in a Anorexia </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nervosa,</v>

1024
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women who are starving themselves,</v>

1025
00:49:40.391 --> 00:49:43.870
<v Speaker 3>who do have a psychological issues to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1026
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.620
<v Speaker 3>if they don't respond to treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving them testosterone improves it.</v>

1027
00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:52.980
<v Speaker 3>So what we're starting to see is these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a neuro steroids and neuroactive </v>

1028
00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:57.340
<v Speaker 3>steroids have influence on an array of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1029
00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:02.580
<v Speaker 3>psychological or mood disorders and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them is in bipolar in the case that </v>

1030
00:50:03.161 --> 00:50:06.520
<v Speaker 3>we're just touching on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1031
00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 3>gentleman who was diagnosed with bipolar</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the military and was put onto lithium</v>

1032
00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:16.330
<v Speaker 3>and also add at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1033
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:21.870
<v Speaker 3>and then what happened was he was given </v>
<v Speaker 3>a challenge test with a low dose of </v>

1034
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:25.621
<v Speaker 3>testosterone and within 32 hours or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dana has symptoms disappeared.</v>

1035
00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.860
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1036
00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:34.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the combination of things working </v>

1037
00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.601
<v Speaker 1>together synergistically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the most incredible parts </v>

1038
00:50:36.601 --> 00:50:36.601
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct it.</v>

1039
00:50:36.601 --> 00:50:40.020
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems that a lot of people just </v>

1040
00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:40.020
<v Speaker 1>simply not aware of.</v>

1041
00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The analogy that I use is,</v>

1042
00:50:41.681 --> 00:50:43.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brand new corvettes,</v>

1043
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:48.670
<v Speaker 3>absolutely bitch and cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like having a corvette with </v>

1044
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:52.411
<v Speaker 3>four flat tires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now all we're going to do is going to </v>

1045
00:50:52.411 --> 00:50:53.860
<v Speaker 3>fill up one of the tires with air and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to try and drive the car.</v>

1046
00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:55.600
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to be able to drive the</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

1047
00:50:55.601 --> 00:50:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Let's fill up the front two tires and </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive.</v>

1048
00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go and fill up three and a half </v>

1049
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.030
<v Speaker 3>tires and you going to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to happen.</v>

1050
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.310
<v Speaker 3>The synergy is in all the hormones that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have in our body,</v>

1051
00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:11.340
<v Speaker 3>all the chemistry together to give us a </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of benefit of function that one by</v>

1052
00:51:12.431 --> 00:51:17.431
<v Speaker 3>itself cannot do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you look at the failure reports </v>

1053
00:51:17.431 --> 00:51:19.030
<v Speaker 3>that are in traumatic brain injuries </v>
<v Speaker 3>since 1959,</v>

1054
00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:24.330
<v Speaker 3>it's called a futility failure where </v>
<v Speaker 3>these big pharmaceutical companies took </v>

1055
00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:29.221
<v Speaker 3>these great drugs and gave one product </v>
<v Speaker 3>to an individual which Madec brain </v>

1056
00:51:29.221 --> 00:51:31.420
<v Speaker 3>injury and they didn't get any benefit </v>
<v Speaker 3>greater than 10 percent.</v>

1057
00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.400
<v Speaker 3>That's called failure or futility </v>
<v Speaker 3>failure,</v>

1058
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:39.210
<v Speaker 3>and it's because in other people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing the because is because our </v>

1059
00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:43.280
<v Speaker 3>system is so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you expect one product to fix it?</v>

1060
00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:45.190
<v Speaker 3>It can't</v>

1061
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:49.380
<v Speaker 1>and everything's got to be balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all got to be balanced.</v>

1062
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:55.030
<v Speaker 1>There's such an issue in this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to mental health that </v>

1063
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:58.191
<v Speaker 1>mental health doesn't get looked at like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the health of a bone or the health of a </v>

1064
00:51:58.191 --> 00:51:58.191
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1065
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:03.200
<v Speaker 1>if you have a torn muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get an emergency operation </v>

1066
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:03.200
<v Speaker 1>to reattach it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1067
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.130
<v Speaker 1>But if your brain is fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1068
00:52:05.131 --> 00:52:06.480
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be a pussy.</v>

1069
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1070
00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:09.090
<v Speaker 1>toughen up or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1071
00:52:09.091 --> 00:52:11.280
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop being so down on yourself.</v>

1072
00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.200
<v Speaker 1>We're this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the sum of our chemistry.</v>

1073
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1074
00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that's affected,</v>

1075
00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.460
<v Speaker 1>that's when you have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1076
00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:18.870
<v Speaker 1>these different things that manifest</v>

1077
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:24.190
<v Speaker 3>why we're seeing so many of the vets </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming back and committing suicide </v>

1078
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:25.190
<v Speaker 3>because they've been instilled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what you say.</v>

1079
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Don't be a pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1080
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:28.930
<v Speaker 1>man up and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>

1081
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was then.</v>

1082
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it was easy for me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1083
00:52:31.921 --> 00:52:36.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can speak to my credibility that </v>

1084
00:52:36.921 --> 00:52:36.921
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's find,</v>

1085
00:52:36.921 --> 00:52:37.730
<v Speaker 1>let's find some damn answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1086
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Because we're flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling off the crazy train.</v>

1087
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1088
00:52:40.561 --> 00:52:41.010
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:52:41.011 --> 00:52:43.320
<v Speaker 1>For a guy like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it's so clear.</v>

1090
00:52:43.321 --> 00:52:43.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1091
00:52:43.861 --> 00:52:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you're not a pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what the hell's going on?</v>

1092
00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:47.850
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have self doubt.</v>

1093
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:52.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe they're right and maybe with </v>

1094
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:56.550
<v Speaker 1>that psychologist says is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should take this medication and </v>

1095
00:52:56.550 --> 00:53:00.200
<v Speaker 1>now that's compounding a problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>making it even bigger and that's why </v>

1096
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.200
<v Speaker 1>we're having these suicides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

1097
00:53:01.201 --> 00:53:06.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's been </v>

1098
00:53:06.201 --> 00:53:07.191
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me over the last couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years is finding out all the </v>

1099
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:08.910
<v Speaker 1>different things that we do that change </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hormone levels of our body.</v>

1100
00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Like all the different things you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>do during the day that up your </v>

1101
00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.511
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including like just drop what they </v>

1102
00:53:17.511 --> 00:53:20.271
<v Speaker 1>called peacocking driving a nice car </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a bunch of young ladies actually </v>

1103
00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.920
<v Speaker 1>rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raises your testosterone like,</v>

1104
00:53:22.921 --> 00:53:27.921
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on with our </v>

1105
00:53:27.921 --> 00:53:27.921
<v Speaker 1>bodies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like weird.</v>

1106
00:53:27.921 --> 00:53:27.921
<v Speaker 1>Is it</v>

1107
00:53:27.921 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 3>that there's like moods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the changing and mood,</v>

1108
00:53:28.591 --> 00:53:30.400
<v Speaker 3>like happy moments?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1109
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Like literally will change the chemical </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution,</v>

1110
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:34.130
<v Speaker 3>makeup</v>

1111
00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.750
<v Speaker 2>evolution of man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1112
00:53:35.751 --> 00:53:39.200
<v Speaker 2>And that was a natural selection that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when women were around,</v>

1113
00:53:39.201 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to perk up and down,</v>

1114
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:45.660
<v Speaker 3>got to get ready to party when a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>opulate said they,</v>

1115
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>14,</v>

1116
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16,</v>

1117
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.300
<v Speaker 3>there's a spike in testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she's oblating.</v>

1118
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 3>She has a spike in her testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does she want to do?</v>

1119
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Get Our party on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get up,</v>

1120
00:53:56.181 --> 00:53:58.950
<v Speaker 3>party on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants to get that fertilization,</v>

1121
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.220
<v Speaker 3>dance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to dance.</v>

1122
00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:03.570
<v Speaker 3>That's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens also to a lot of women that</v>

1123
00:54:03.571 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 3>get older when they put them on hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>replacement,</v>

1124
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:08.600
<v Speaker 3>once they experience menopause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1125
00:54:08.601 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 3>they have more testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get hornier correct.</v>

1126
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.760
<v Speaker 3>If you just follow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm aging,</v>

1127
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:19.761
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women as men who had </v>

1128
00:54:19.761 --> 00:54:21.921
<v Speaker 3>testosterone based age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they lose their testosterone and they </v>

1129
00:54:21.921 --> 00:54:25.581
<v Speaker 3>have more estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we become clear stages as we </v>

1130
00:54:25.581 --> 00:54:29.121
<v Speaker 3>get older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women on the other hand lose their </v>

1131
00:54:29.121 --> 00:54:33.020
<v Speaker 3>estrogen and gain more testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you start seeing facial hair </v>

1132
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.010
<v Speaker 3>and they start taking the command </v>
<v Speaker 3>position in the relationship as they get</v>

1133
00:54:35.011 --> 00:54:37.560
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's this flipping of the,</v>

1134
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.790
<v Speaker 2>the hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Doctor Gordon,</v>

1135
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:41.240
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to touch on the a and Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you asked about the,</v>

1136
00:54:41.241 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to regrow anything in the brain.</v>

1137
00:54:44.371 --> 00:54:46.090
<v Speaker 2>It's called neuroplasticity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1138
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:46.860
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doctor Gordon,</v>

1139
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:51.861
<v Speaker 2>and I wanted to dumb it down for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>listeners are guys that maybe are like </v>

1140
00:54:51.861 --> 00:54:51.880
<v Speaker 2>me that are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so are,</v>

1141
00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:54.780
<v Speaker 2>are we able to fix our brains?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Science has said yes.</v>

1142
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:59.781
<v Speaker 2>And I found this out before I met Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gordon and I was hearing about some of </v>

1143
00:54:59.781 --> 00:55:03.081
<v Speaker 2>these things and treatments I was at </v>
<v Speaker 2>about neuroplasticity and basically </v>

1144
00:55:03.081 --> 00:55:04.830
<v Speaker 2>being able to regenerate the neuronal </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways.</v>

1145
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have shearing a shearing of the </v>

1146
00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:10.830
<v Speaker 2>neurons and a traumatic brain injury </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1147
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.440
<v Speaker 2>and that's causing some of the issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have,</v>

1148
00:55:13.441 --> 00:55:18.441
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we now know is we can form new </v>

1149
00:55:18.441 --> 00:55:21.650
<v Speaker 2>neuronal pathways in the brain and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can stimulate stimulate that through a </v>

1150
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:26.121
<v Speaker 2>number of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learning something that you've never </v>

1151
00:55:26.121 --> 00:55:28.251
<v Speaker 2>learned will stimulate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm treating it with what you're </v>

1152
00:55:28.251 --> 00:55:29.940
<v Speaker 2>deficient in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new oral steroids steroid wise.</v>

1153
00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.160
<v Speaker 2>We'll fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we thought like,</v>

1154
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:33.700
<v Speaker 2>can't you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you treat a.</v>

1155
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.420
<v Speaker 2>can you teach a old dog new tricks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thought the answer was no,</v>

1156
00:55:36.421 --> 00:55:41.421
<v Speaker 2>but now we know that that's not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can regenerate neuronal pathways in </v>

1157
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:42.360
<v Speaker 2>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can do it,</v>

1158
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:47.390
<v Speaker 2>and you can keep yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can continue to get sharper as your </v>

1159
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.390
<v Speaker 2>age through these treatments.</v>

1160
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.110
<v Speaker 3>I think people get sharper to when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>try new things.</v>

1161
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1162
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.560
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the science behind.</v>

1163
00:55:54.561 --> 00:55:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that,</v>

1164
00:55:55.081 --> 00:55:58.160
<v Speaker 2>that builds new neural pathways and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't think that that was possible.</v>

1165
00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how long we just figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out,</v>

1166
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:03.230
<v Speaker 2>but when I heard that two years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were telling me,</v>

1167
00:56:03.231 --> 00:56:03.980
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the new.</v>

1168
00:56:03.981 --> 00:56:05.630
<v Speaker 2>You just accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1169
00:56:05.631 --> 00:56:08.360
<v Speaker 2>well this is the last class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not told me about neuroplasticity.</v>

1170
00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:12.200
<v Speaker 2>So which one is it can regenerate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>renew or you can't.</v>

1171
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:17.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Fort Collins and a doctor</v>
<v Speaker 3>twilley twilley who was doing just that.</v>

1172
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.860
<v Speaker 3>Introducing two vets who had traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain injury,</v>

1173
00:56:21.861 --> 00:56:26.861
<v Speaker 3>would nintendo with certain types of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gains to get the visual manual dexterity</v>

1174
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.700
<v Speaker 3>which would help to improve their </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive ability because of doing just </v>

1175
00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:34.060
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using learning something new.</v>

1176
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that thing called?</v>

1177
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:37.380
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Dakota.</v>

1178
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so do Duke,</v>

1179
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1180
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:44.910
<v Speaker 3>forces you to do a intense thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>which can help build a new pathways in </v>

1181
00:56:46.061 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 3>literature that I used to read in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alzheimer's.</v>

1182
00:56:48.701 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 3>I have a lecture on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1183
00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:56.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found that if you looked at the </v>

1184
00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:56.350
<v Speaker 3>academic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1185
00:56:56.350 --> 00:57:00.070
<v Speaker 3>the academic experience of an individual</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they get Alzheimer's,</v>

1186
00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:02.740
<v Speaker 3>the people have the highest academic </v>
<v Speaker 3>achievements,</v>

1187
00:57:02.741 --> 00:57:04.600
<v Speaker 3>meaning mds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>phds,</v>

1188
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:08.560
<v Speaker 3>and so forth compared to people who just</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a high school diploma,</v>

1189
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:13.920
<v Speaker 3>that those people with the higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>education have a slower progression of </v>

1190
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:18.571
<v Speaker 3>Alzheimer's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's because they've built </v>

1191
00:57:18.571 --> 00:57:18.571
<v Speaker 3>parallel pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of pathways.</v>

1192
00:57:18.571 --> 00:57:23.531
<v Speaker 3>So if you lose this pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got this one is an alternative </v>

1193
00:57:23.531 --> 00:57:24.040
<v Speaker 3>backdoor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>backdoor backup side of the door.</v>

1194
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:24.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1195
00:57:24.971 --> 00:57:25.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1196
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:30.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also makes sense in relation to </v>

1197
00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:30.690
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more exercise that when people don't</v>

1198
00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:30.740
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1199
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:32.180
<v Speaker 1>They experience atrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1200
00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:33.270
<v Speaker 1>When you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your,</v>

1201
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:35.900
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life has exact same path every day,</v>

1202
00:57:35.901 --> 00:57:39.320
<v Speaker 1>the exact same stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing varies when that,</v>

1203
00:57:39.321 --> 00:57:44.321
<v Speaker 1>when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very easy for your mind did just </v>

1204
00:57:44.321 --> 00:57:44.450
<v Speaker 1>atrophy your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're correct.</v>

1205
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Your process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't challenge yourself in life,</v>

1206
00:57:47.091 --> 00:57:52.091
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to atrophy in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>area so that that's the onus on the </v>

1207
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:52.091
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1208
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also by people that are sort of </v>

1209
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.670
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline junkies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1210
00:57:57.670 --> 00:58:01.610
<v Speaker 1>they kind of ramp it up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More and more and more to the other </v>

1211
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:01.610
<v Speaker 1>people around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1212
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:02.780
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking getting a little crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1213
00:58:02.781 --> 00:58:04.110
<v Speaker 1>buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's because it,</v>

1214
00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:07.400
<v Speaker 1>it takes more for them to get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>juice.</v>

1215
00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get it from the original.</v>

1216
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Their baseline is pushed higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1217
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:14.230
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1218
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:19.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have patients who get onto a program </v>

1219
00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.530
<v Speaker 3>and after for six months they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doc,</v>

1220
00:58:20.531 --> 00:58:23.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel the same as I did at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>

1221
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1222
00:58:24.281 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning you were at zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're at 100.</v>

1223
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:29.150
<v Speaker 3>We're at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What more?</v>

1224
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:32.650
<v Speaker 3>You've already had that contrast from </v>
<v Speaker 3>zero to 100 and the analogy I use is,</v>

1225
00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:38.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 100 degrees outside and you've got </v>

1226
00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:39.651
<v Speaker 3>to pull the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 86 degrees when you jump into the </v>

1227
00:58:39.651 --> 00:58:42.031
<v Speaker 3>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's initially cold and then your body </v>

1228
00:58:42.031 --> 00:58:42.031
<v Speaker 3>adapts and you don't feel that </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature difference.</v>

1229
00:58:42.031 --> 00:58:43.480
<v Speaker 3>Is the temperature any different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1230
00:58:43.481 --> 00:58:44.860
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've adapted.</v>

1231
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:50.220
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is we adapt to not </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling the contrast because there's no </v>

1232
00:58:51.071 --> 00:58:52.540
<v Speaker 3>contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're already at the top.</v>

1233
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Does that make any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1234
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 3>totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1235
00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:58.630
<v Speaker 3>So this is what people have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand and you know,</v>

1236
00:58:58.631 --> 00:59:01.420
<v Speaker 3>every week I get one or two patients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1237
00:59:01.421 --> 00:59:02.410
<v Speaker 3>call up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doc,</v>

1238
00:59:02.411 --> 00:59:04.300
<v Speaker 3>I just don't feel as good as I did in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning.</v>

1239
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Have you changed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you dropped in your functionality?</v>

1240
00:59:06.881 --> 00:59:07.630
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1241
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:09.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be running a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1242
00:59:09.071 --> 00:59:10.040
<v Speaker 3>a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1243
00:59:10.041 --> 00:59:11.560
<v Speaker 3>were you able to do that last time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1244
00:59:11.561 --> 00:59:16.561
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm in the gym six days a week </v>

1245
00:59:16.561 --> 00:59:16.570
<v Speaker 3>instead of once a week or once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1246
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:21.600
<v Speaker 3>your entire lifestyle is updated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not feeling as good and I </v>

1247
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.710
<v Speaker 3>just can't get a full understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their level of function is up here,</v>

1248
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:26.630
<v Speaker 3>but they are telling me that they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing as well.</v>

1249
00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:29.780
<v Speaker 3>And is it just because they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're used to it?</v>

1250
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive improvement.</v>

1251
00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:35.750
<v Speaker 3>They had in the beginning it was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this new state.</v>

1252
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.040
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like getting water in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>ear and it.</v>

1253
00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the water comes out.</v>

1254
00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:43.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hormones always give the body a contrast</v>

1255
00:59:43.581 --> 00:59:47.360
<v Speaker 3>beef between low level and that higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

1256
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.580
<v Speaker 3>not excessive but higher level.</v>

1257
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:54.970
<v Speaker 3>And you adapt to it and you think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what happens with heroin </v>

1258
00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:54.970
<v Speaker 3>addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a bad example,</v>

1259
00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:56.830
<v Speaker 3>but the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get what's called techie flax.</v>

1260
00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.460
<v Speaker 3>They don't feel the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>

1261
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:03.520
<v Speaker 3>everybody chases that first high and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to have that first </v>

1262
01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:08.021
<v Speaker 3>high because that was the first time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you just whacked all your neurons </v>

1263
01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.000
<v Speaker 3>in your brain with this new drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heroin or chasing the Dragon,</v>

1264
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 3>chasing the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1265
01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:13.350
<v Speaker 3>But it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1266
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:18.370
<v Speaker 3>when something is unique in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning and special and </v>

1267
01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:18.770
<v Speaker 3>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gives you this.</v>

1268
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.350
<v Speaker 3>But then when that's a normal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1269
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1270
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:25.210
<v Speaker 3>what worked for me in the beginning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it stopped working for them.</v>

1271
01:00:25.211 --> 01:00:27.710
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't changed and you'd show them </v>
<v Speaker 3>their blood levels,</v>

1272
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:29.450
<v Speaker 3>their blood levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at a,</v>

1273
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:31.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact it was a,</v>

1274
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Jordan who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1275
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.690
<v Speaker 3>was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very low in testosterone.</v>

1276
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:39.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like a two when it should</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a 14 and his total was like two,</v>

1277
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>220 and should be about 700 and he </v>

1278
01:00:45.081 --> 01:00:50.081
<v Speaker 3>complains that he's not feeling as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did his blood work and his free </v>

1279
01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:51.770
<v Speaker 3>testosterone was like 14,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 point nine,</v>

1280
01:00:51.771 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 3>nine in total was 801,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was like four times above where he</v>

1281
01:00:55.911 --> 01:01:00.911
<v Speaker 3>was before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's saying he doesn't feel any </v>

1282
01:01:00.911 --> 01:01:00.911
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1283
01:01:00.911 --> 01:01:00.911
<v Speaker 3>So he just got used to this elevated </v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

1284
01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 3>He's at functioning at a higher level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1285
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:05.030
<v Speaker 3>I've been on treat happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rich people too,</v>

1286
01:01:05.031 --> 01:01:05.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>

1287
01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say.</v>

1288
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Using a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1289
01:01:09.351 --> 01:01:12.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to crave different things,</v>

1290
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:12.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1291
01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:17.531
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that is we lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus and the clarity of the present </v>

1292
01:01:17.531 --> 01:01:18.020
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem,</v>

1293
01:01:18.021 --> 01:01:23.021
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I crave a different emotion when you </v>

1294
01:01:23.021 --> 01:01:23.120
<v Speaker 2>need to be experiencing the most that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having right now.</v>

1295
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in that part of it.</v>

1296
01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:30.410
<v Speaker 3>The problem of being a fucking person is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're always striving for the </v>

1297
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:31.710
<v Speaker 3>new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're always striving for improvement.</v>

1298
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:36.980
<v Speaker 3>We always want a better time at our run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We always want a better this better </v>

1299
01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.740
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The newest car,</v>

1300
01:01:37.741 --> 01:01:41.640
<v Speaker 3>the fucking uptight to the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that shit when we're constantly,</v>

1301
01:01:41.641 --> 01:01:43.170
<v Speaker 3>when no one has ever like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1302
01:01:43.171 --> 01:01:43.980
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1303
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that apathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's chasing certain emotions </v>

1304
01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.940
<v Speaker 2>and trying to run away from other ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1305
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:55.990
<v Speaker 2>when there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's opportunity for growth and </v>

1306
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:57.530
<v Speaker 2>development and ultimately contribution </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of them and they're all,</v>

1307
01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.560
<v Speaker 2>they all can produce that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're able to instead of run from </v>

1308
01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.621
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe look at it and see what that can </v>

1309
01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:07.241
<v Speaker 2>provide you and what can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can you do that to provide that to </v>

1310
01:02:07.241 --> 01:02:07.241
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>

1311
01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>

1312
01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just seems to me that,</v>

1313
01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:16.461
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you approach life and the </v>

1314
01:02:16.461 --> 01:02:19.191
<v Speaker 3>philosophy that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you take through life can either </v>

1315
01:02:19.191 --> 01:02:19.950
<v Speaker 3>they can even contribute</v>

1316
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>or take away from your happiness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

1317
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all these things.</v>

1318
01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the hormonal balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just the health of the physical</v>

1319
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the approach that you have</v>

1320
01:02:31.141 --> 01:02:36.141
<v Speaker 1>to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you look at things can sort of </v>

1321
01:02:36.141 --> 01:02:36.141
<v Speaker 1>affect and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1322
01:02:36.141 --> 01:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>and balance all that stuff out in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that you need everything.</v>

1323
01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>You need the big</v>

1324
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.360
<v Speaker 4>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1325
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:43.840
<v Speaker 4>I think if you wrap your happiness </v>
<v Speaker 4>around passion or our pleasure,</v>

1326
01:02:43.841 --> 01:02:45.190
<v Speaker 4>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are fleeting.</v>

1327
01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you could been instead wrapping </v>

1328
01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.441
<v Speaker 4>around purpose or meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to be a longterm </v>

1329
01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:52.441
<v Speaker 4>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1330
01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:53.440
<v Speaker 4>but pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>passion,</v>

1331
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:54.210
<v Speaker 4>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1332
01:02:54.211 --> 01:02:54.700
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1333
01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.280
<v Speaker 4>that short term people chasing pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1334
01:02:57.281 --> 01:02:58.870
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't make you happy in the end.</v>

1335
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1336
01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:02.420
<v Speaker 1>my friend Steve Reno has a really funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of.</v>

1337
01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>He talks about things that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun when you're doing them.</v>

1338
01:03:06.011 --> 01:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>And then things are that are really fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>after they're done,</v>

1339
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:14.090
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things are really fun while you're </v>

1340
01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:14.090
<v Speaker 1>doing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after they're done,</v>

1341
01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:17.161
<v Speaker 1>they don't give you any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a rollercoaster rollercoaster </v>

1342
01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:17.161
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give you anything after it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

1343
01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>But like there's some miserable trips </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you go on.</v>

1344
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Well afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just spend hours and hours laugh with </v>

1345
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1346
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sucks so hard.</v>

1347
01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be laughing about how fucking cold </v>

1348
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.530
<v Speaker 1>you were and you're camping and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing your dick off.</v>

1349
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>We want to blow my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1350
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:39.190
<v Speaker 4>remembering a perceived negative time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and putting a positive light on it.</v>

1351
01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:39.890
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1352
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>It's also understanding that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is good is very difficult to </v>

1353
01:03:45.531 --> 01:03:50.531
<v Speaker 1>do and it becomes like your goal setting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then achieving those goals becomes </v>

1354
01:03:51.321 --> 01:03:56.321
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feeling of of pleasure and a good </v>

1355
01:03:56.321 --> 01:03:59.021
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas opposed to so many people just </v>

1356
01:03:59.021 --> 01:04:01.511
<v Speaker 1>want comfort and quiet and peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with none of the hard work and that </v>

1357
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:06.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't appreciate it then absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like a spoiled child,</v>

1358
01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.820
<v Speaker 1>like spoiled kids don't appreciate what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have in their life.</v>

1359
01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Somebody works really hard and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone through hard times.</v>

1360
01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Then when things turned well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1361
01:04:16.611 --> 01:04:21.611
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so good to not have to worry </v>

1362
01:04:21.611 --> 01:04:21.611
<v Speaker 1>about money now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not have to worry about where my next</v>

1363
01:04:21.611 --> 01:04:26.081
<v Speaker 1>meal's coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a nice home and a nice bed to </v>

1364
01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:26.081
<v Speaker 1>sleep in.</v>

1365
01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:30.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the Richard Bransons and </v>

1366
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:31.810
<v Speaker 4>the job's and so forth that came from </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing and they built something.</v>

1367
01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:36.940
<v Speaker 4>They worked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were hungry and develop something </v>

1368
01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.080
<v Speaker 4>or had a world that was fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything that they could think of a </v>

1369
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.380
<v Speaker 4>they had the desire to achieve that goal</v>
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to people who are given </v>

1370
01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.870
<v Speaker 4>everything on a silver platter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have aspirations.</v>

1371
01:04:46.871 --> 01:04:50.020
<v Speaker 4>They don't have the drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you achieved that goal.</v>

1372
01:04:50.021 --> 01:04:52.000
<v Speaker 4>That is kind of pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about Joe,</v>

1373
01:04:52.001 --> 01:04:57.001
<v Speaker 4>but like the we look back and look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the journey that it took from where you </v>

1374
01:04:57.001 --> 01:04:58.850
<v Speaker 4>started to get to that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where you can feel purposeful and</v>

1375
01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:03.930
<v Speaker 4>proud of proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That last longer than the feeling of </v>

1376
01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:03.930
<v Speaker 4>accomplishing that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The journey.</v>

1377
01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what a weird world we live in,</v>

1378
01:05:06.771 --> 01:05:07.390
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1379
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>trying to manage all this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what,</v>

1380
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.040
<v Speaker 1>what's the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the optimum way to get through </v>

1381
01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.550
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to approach it,</v>

1382
01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>how much emphasis to put</v>

1383
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 4>on the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much emphasis to put on the body,</v>

1384
01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.540
<v Speaker 4>the relationships that you have with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in your life greatly affect how,</v>

1385
01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:30.010
<v Speaker 4>how you feel about life in the people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life could,</v>

1386
01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.750
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can affect your hormone levels.</v>

1387
01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:34.300
<v Speaker 4>They can affect your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your cortisol levels.</v>

1388
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:38.830
<v Speaker 4>They can affect all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has his daughter having a,</v>

1389
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:44.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone said that I talk a lot and I </v>

1390
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.220
<v Speaker 4>tell them that because of having four </v>
<v Speaker 4>women in home,</v>

1391
01:05:45.221 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 4>three daughters and a wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the uh,</v>

1392
01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.970
<v Speaker 4>Opportunity that I have to speak is </v>
<v Speaker 4>always outside because inside the house,</v>

1393
01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:53.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just listened.</v>

1394
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:58.560
<v Speaker 4>I just listened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just trying to sort out these aliens </v>

1395
01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.530
<v Speaker 4>that you live with and other especially </v>
<v Speaker 4>matched you.</v>

1396
01:05:59.531 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 4>I got three daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have two on the same package.</v>

1397
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:03.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also got two boys,</v>

1398
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:05.800
<v Speaker 4>so commiserate later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Full House.</v>

1399
01:06:05.801 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 4>You got chaos.</v>

1400
01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 4>That's how we live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1401
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:11.320
<v Speaker 4>in feces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>urine and nonstop,</v>

1402
01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:18.210
<v Speaker 4>but as they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they mature into this delight as my </v>

1403
01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:19.900
<v Speaker 4>daughter over there and the other two </v>
<v Speaker 4>daughters that are in here.</v>

1404
01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Just a delight and that journey you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about and the effect of the </v>

1405
01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 4>environment on your psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>wellbeing.</v>

1406
01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:28.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

1407
01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:31.420
<v Speaker 4>it's a rollercoaster that I've gone </v>
<v Speaker 4>through a rollercoaster with each one of</v>

1408
01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:34.150
<v Speaker 4>the daughters and I've come to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>landing.</v>

1409
01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:39.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you get off the rollercoaster </v>

1410
01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.640
<v Speaker 4>finally at this age and you look back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you start laughing on some of the </v>

1411
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.841
<v Speaker 4>silly things that happened and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>daughter came to me a couple of weeks </v>

1412
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.830
<v Speaker 4>ago and basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1413
01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:50.560
<v Speaker 4>we went through some silly time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's have some great time.</v>

1414
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:55.000
<v Speaker 4>And it was one of the most revelator ing</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of nights I could have had.</v>

1415
01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.760
<v Speaker 4>It was the best night and going out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>having a good,</v>

1416
01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:59.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 year old scotch or something.</v>

1417
01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.100
<v Speaker 4>But you owe me that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1418
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:06.180
<v Speaker 4>this last year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read a Victor Frankel's man's search </v>

1419
01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:09.361
<v Speaker 4>for meaning and it just changed my </v>
<v Speaker 4>outlook on everything and he went </v>

1420
01:07:09.361 --> 01:07:13.561
<v Speaker 4>through the Holocaust and that basically</v>
<v Speaker 4>the book was the premise of some people </v>

1421
01:07:13.561 --> 01:07:15.580
<v Speaker 4>survived the Holocaust and they like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holocaust.</v>

1422
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:21.610
<v Speaker 4>That's the text,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a text and then me Holocaust.</v>

1423
01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Some people survived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1424
01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:29.551
<v Speaker 4>and we're able able to to have meaning </v>
<v Speaker 4>while others just gave up and died and </v>

1425
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.580
<v Speaker 4>what was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the reasoning behind that?</v>

1426
01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:38.581
<v Speaker 4>Was kind of how the book looked at it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was the people who survived that </v>

1427
01:07:38.581 --> 01:07:41.080
<v Speaker 4>nine percent was the commonality was </v>
<v Speaker 4>his.</v>

1428
01:07:41.081 --> 01:07:43.210
<v Speaker 4>Everybody had some kind of a meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1429
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:48.240
<v Speaker 4>Some somebody has some kind of purpose </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of themselves that was wrapped </v>

1430
01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.740
<v Speaker 4>in a how they could better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>better somebody else's life in some form</v>

1431
01:07:50.741 --> 01:07:55.300
<v Speaker 4>or fashion and that purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that meaning to their life allow them to</v>

1432
01:07:55.301 --> 01:07:58.960
<v Speaker 4>be able to endure whatever came their </v>
<v Speaker 4>way because they had a purpose to endure</v>

1433
01:07:58.961 --> 01:08:03.961
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The person that didn't have a meaning a </v>

1434
01:08:03.961 --> 01:08:05.200
<v Speaker 4>put on their life for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just at the end,</v>

1435
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:06.760
<v Speaker 4>that was too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just gave in and said,</v>

1436
01:08:06.761 --> 01:08:09.730
<v Speaker 4>I give up and eventually died and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the difference.</v>

1437
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:14.820
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we can replicate that in our own </v>

1438
01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.711
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can wrap your life around </v>

1439
01:08:16.711 --> 01:08:16.711
<v Speaker 4>meaning and purpose and</v>

1440
01:08:16.711 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>tie that to how you can contribute to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put value into somebody else's life.</v>

1441
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I found that puts value into you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1442
01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>So I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1443
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:25.910
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of life is to live a life of</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

1444
01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good way of putting it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you feel better about your life</v>

1445
01:08:29.631 --> 01:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like cynical people will say,</v>

1446
01:08:31.251 --> 01:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no purpose in the end.</v>

1447
01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:37.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take a dirt nap and </v>

1448
01:08:37.991 --> 01:08:37.991
<v Speaker 1>that's all the time that you have here </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just bullshit.</v>

1449
01:08:37.991 --> 01:08:42.220
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is that bullshit is way </v>
<v Speaker 1>better when you believe that you have a </v>

1450
01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:46.721
<v Speaker 1>purpose and when you live for a purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you work hard and you achieve </v>

1451
01:08:46.721 --> 01:08:50.381
<v Speaker 1>things like goal setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that one of the most important </v>

1452
01:08:50.381 --> 01:08:53.290
<v Speaker 1>things for people to achieve happiness </v>
<v Speaker 1>is this setting and achieving of goals.</v>

1453
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:58.550
<v Speaker 1>It's setting and achieving of goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's simple like completing a </v>

1454
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.910
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to start a garden in my yard,</v>

1455
01:08:58.911 --> 01:09:03.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to put up posts and grow </v>

1456
01:09:03.911 --> 01:09:03.911
<v Speaker 1>plants and then when you eat a salad </v>
<v Speaker 1>from those plants you go,</v>

1457
01:09:03.911 --> 01:09:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I fucking did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you get a feeling,</v>

1458
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 1>a natural feeling of accomplishment from</v>
<v Speaker 1>an art project,</v>

1459
01:09:08.571 --> 01:09:10.840
<v Speaker 1>from anything you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing the shed,</v>

1460
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:11.720
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1461
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Like when you set a goal and you do your</v>
<v Speaker 1>best and you achieve.</v>

1462
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:19.970
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what made human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we are today in 2015.</v>

1463
01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:24.971
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those natural reward systems are in our </v>

1464
01:09:24.971 --> 01:09:27.461
<v Speaker 1>DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you follow those and you live by </v>

1465
01:09:27.461 --> 01:09:28.190
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will have a more fulfilled life,</v>

1466
01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:30.290
<v Speaker 1>a happier life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1467
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1468
01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:37.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a joy that you get that you don't </v>

1469
01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:41.321
<v Speaker 1>have need anybody else to say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good job [inaudible] because it's self </v>

1470
01:09:41.321 --> 01:09:41.321
<v Speaker 1>generated.</v>

1471
01:09:41.321 --> 01:09:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It's your own self reward as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's search for other ones.</v>

1472
01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Someone else to tap them on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1473
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:52.931
<v Speaker 1>people come up to me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sensitive about the fact that </v>

1474
01:09:52.931 --> 01:09:56.771
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a great job I'm doing whatever I'm </v>

1475
01:09:56.771 --> 01:09:59.141
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm doing a good job because </v>

1476
01:09:59.141 --> 01:09:59.141
<v Speaker 1>that's my purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my purpose.</v>

1477
01:09:59.141 --> 01:10:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to have someone to tell me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1478
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing a good job.</v>

1479
01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.540
<v Speaker 1>You're not a slack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you weren't doing your best,</v>

1480
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:07.060
<v Speaker 1>you'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be going against yourself.</v>

1481
01:10:07.061 --> 01:10:12.061
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't need anybody very </v>

1482
01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:12.061
<v Speaker 1>hypercritical about myself because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1483
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you look around the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people are putting in effort </v>

1484
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:21.461
<v Speaker 1>for helping other people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really truly helping without </v>

1485
01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:26.200
<v Speaker 1>helping them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I do 100 percent because I'm </v>

1486
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.881
<v Speaker 1>selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to have my couch in my car and </v>

1487
01:10:28.881 --> 01:10:28.881
<v Speaker 1>whatever else.</v>

1488
01:10:28.881 --> 01:10:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Trying to improve wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improved wellbeing across the board.</v>

1489
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really no good manual on how to </v>

1490
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.960
<v Speaker 1>live life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if there was,</v>

1491
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:41.180
<v Speaker 1>it might not apply to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1492
01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can tell you what's going to make</v>

1493
01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:48.761
<v Speaker 1>one person happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily gonna make another </v>

1494
01:10:48.761 --> 01:10:48.761
<v Speaker 1>person happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1495
01:10:48.761 --> 01:10:52.390
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here talking about goal setting </v>

1496
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.390
<v Speaker 1>and working hard and trying for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1497
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:55.490
<v Speaker 1>that's actually not it for some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some people,</v>

1498
01:10:55.610 --> 01:11:00.610
<v Speaker 1>what do they want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to have a good group of </v>

1499
01:11:00.610 --> 01:11:02.471
<v Speaker 1>friends and be around them and have nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>meals and good conversations and that's </v>

1500
01:11:02.471 --> 01:11:07.271
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally don't have a desire for </v>

1501
01:11:07.271 --> 01:11:09.941
<v Speaker 1>these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for people like you that have this </v>

1502
01:11:09.941 --> 01:11:12.701
<v Speaker 1>burning desire to know things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve upon things and to do good work </v>

1503
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.730
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

1504
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.000
<v Speaker 4>your path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1505
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.360
<v Speaker 4>I think some people just get so wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 4>up in the day to day rat race of life </v>

1506
01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.540
<v Speaker 4>that they don't put the pick their head </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and say,</v>

1507
01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:22.070
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1508
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:22.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1509
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally missing the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there,</v>

1510
01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:30.700
<v Speaker 4>there is no meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no purpose to how I'm doing </v>

1511
01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.141
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think people really thought </v>

1512
01:11:33.141 --> 01:11:33.141
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might not be do what I,</v>

1513
01:11:33.141 --> 01:11:37.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan Westview or Mark Gordon wants </v>

1514
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.490
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>

1515
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.490
<v Speaker 4>they're going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1516
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:38.160
<v Speaker 4>I want to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's not just tied around,</v>

1517
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.090
<v Speaker 4>totally doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1518
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:42.450
<v Speaker 4>I just want to hang out and not give </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything out to anybody.</v>

1519
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:47.630
<v Speaker 4>You're not gonna get anything in return.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody wants to do that </v>

1520
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.630
<v Speaker 4>and in their right mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1521
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:52.130
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard for people to find out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that they want to do and then how </v>

1522
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:56.991
<v Speaker 1>do I go about pursuing that and how do I</v>
<v Speaker 1>go about pursuing that while avoiding </v>

1523
01:11:56.991 --> 01:12:00.810
<v Speaker 1>the idea of choosing just a job that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to give you security,</v>

1524
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:02.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a job that you don't want to do,</v>

1525
01:12:02.641 --> 01:12:07.641
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's going to give me dental </v>

1526
01:12:07.641 --> 01:12:07.641
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

1527
01:12:07.641 --> 01:12:07.641
<v Speaker 1>that's a big factor in a lot of people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

1528
01:12:07.641 --> 01:12:11.790
<v Speaker 1>The non pursuing of dreams that somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you to go streams or danger,</v>

1529
01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.700
<v Speaker 4>you got to go after it with your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with no fear of failure.</v>

1530
01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:19.780
<v Speaker 4>If that didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even let failure enter into the </v>

1531
01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.801
<v Speaker 4>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you do if you knew you </v>

1532
01:12:21.801 --> 01:12:21.801
<v Speaker 4>couldn't fail at it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I would tell people to do.</v>

1533
01:12:21.801 --> 01:12:22.680
<v Speaker 4>That's what I tell my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever you're passionate about,</v>

1534
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.780
<v Speaker 4>that's where you need to start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1535
01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.640
<v Speaker 4>That's where you need to go and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>dental.</v>

1536
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But failure is important for growth and </v>

1537
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:32.000
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1538
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:32.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have it all the time.</v>

1539
01:12:32.761 --> 01:12:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1540
01:12:33.151 --> 01:12:34.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

1541
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:35.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like a vitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta take it,</v>

1542
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 1>fill fuel yourself with the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I always say,</v>

1543
01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:44.130
<v Speaker 4>talking about failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the stories I keep on repeating </v>

1544
01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:49.230
<v Speaker 4>and using as a goal for myself is it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a reporter that interviewed Thomas </v>

1545
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.480
<v Speaker 4>Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thomas Jefferson,</v>

1546
01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:54.040
<v Speaker 4>Thomas Edison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before he passed away.</v>

1547
01:12:54.041 --> 01:12:55.470
<v Speaker 4>And he said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1548
01:12:55.570 --> 01:13:00.570
<v Speaker 4>Mr Edison and your development of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>incandescent bulb was what revolution I </v>

1549
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:03.940
<v Speaker 4>took us from the stone ages to modern </v>
<v Speaker 4>living and you know,</v>

1550
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:06.820
<v Speaker 4>but how do you feel about these over </v>
<v Speaker 4>1,108</v>

1551
01:13:06.821 --> 01:13:09.610
<v Speaker 4>failures that they said that you had </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the bulbs?</v>

1552
01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.340
<v Speaker 4>And Thomas Edison says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1553
01:13:12.341 --> 01:13:15.070
<v Speaker 4>sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't look at them as being failures,</v>

1554
01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:16.720
<v Speaker 4>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that didn't work.</v>

1555
01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:22.230
<v Speaker 4>And it's by having that attitude of </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at what we do in our daily life </v>

1556
01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:24.190
<v Speaker 4>is not failures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meaning that you're worthless and you're</v>

1557
01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:26.530
<v Speaker 4>incapable and therefore you should stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing,</v>

1558
01:13:26.531 --> 01:13:28.540
<v Speaker 4>but look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just something that didn't work.</v>

1559
01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.190
<v Speaker 4>Find another pathway.</v>

1560
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:31.250
<v Speaker 1>The data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1561
01:13:31.251 --> 01:13:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Edison impression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1562
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:36.770
<v Speaker 1>you very much is a southern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did he become from Alabama?</v>

1563
01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Where was he called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ohio.</v>

1564
01:13:39.610 --> 01:13:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

1565
01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:41.780
<v Speaker 1>he ripped off Tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me know.</v>

1566
01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.700
<v Speaker 1>That was really how he got ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was just.</v>

1567
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.650
<v Speaker 1>He hated the alternate current lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting fucking elephants and shit.</v>

1568
01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.880
<v Speaker 1>DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

1569
01:13:49.881 --> 01:13:51.680
<v Speaker 1>He liked you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that Alpha is all about direct.</v>

1570
01:13:51.681 --> 01:13:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:54.710
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a dumb ass.</v>

1572
01:13:55.130 --> 01:14:00.130
<v Speaker 1>It was just lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a super genius around that he </v>

1573
01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:00.130
<v Speaker 1>could steal from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1574
01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1575
01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.830
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we kind of helped.</v>

1576
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Helped being around Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's that Michael Jordan </v>

1577
01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:09.190
<v Speaker 1>commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1578
01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:10.400
<v Speaker 1>like about how many times you've failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed over and over and over again,</v>

1579
01:14:10.401 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it's succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he said,</v>

1580
01:14:12.341 --> 01:14:13.130
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes that,</v>

1581
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:14.440
<v Speaker 1>that spurs growth.</v>

1582
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:16.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to fail.</v>

1583
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I look at it as data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1584
01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>That just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives me readings about where I was</v>

1585
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.110
<v Speaker 1>and how I need to self correct the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course I'm at.</v>

1586
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Without it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a good true measurement </v>

1587
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 1>and that feeling that you get from </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure is awesome.</v>

1588
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:33.870
<v Speaker 1>It sucks at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the like we were talking </v>

1589
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:37.711
<v Speaker 1>about things that are fun while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing them and then things that are </v>

1590
01:14:37.711 --> 01:14:39.610
<v Speaker 1>great years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you fail at something,</v>

1591
01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:42.820
<v Speaker 1>that feeling that you have afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking horrible,</v>

1592
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.120
<v Speaker 1>but that feeling will fuel you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That feeling will get you to avoid that,</v>

1593
01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:54.181
<v Speaker 1>so that's what it's there for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to rearrange the way you </v>

1594
01:14:54.181 --> 01:14:54.181
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People look at it like,</v>

1595
01:14:54.181 --> 01:14:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a failure.</v>

1596
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't define yourself by mistakes.</v>

1597
01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.360
<v Speaker 1>You what you who you are is you are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking thing.</v>

1598
01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:04.870
<v Speaker 1>You are the thing that can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the problem is,</v>

1599
01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:06.820
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to form a solution.</v>

1600
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000
<v Speaker 1>You're not the results like you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the failures and that's what a lot of </v>

1601
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.351
<v Speaker 1>people run into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They define themselves by failures and </v>

1602
01:15:16.351 --> 01:15:18.790
<v Speaker 1>people try to define you by failures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how many times you run into someone</v>

1603
01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:23.791
<v Speaker 1>from higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that time when you're in high </v>

1604
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:23.791
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did this.</v>

1605
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:23.791
<v Speaker 1>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Dickhead,</v>

1606
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:24.250
<v Speaker 1>that was 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still living there.</v>

1607
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned from that and I moved past it.</v>

1608
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 1>That happens with a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1609
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:32.350
<v Speaker 1>That people will try to drag you into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a friend of mine who,</v>

1610
01:15:32.351 --> 01:15:33.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to get up.</v>

1611
01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:36.460
<v Speaker 1>He had a breakup with this girl because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was dating her.</v>

1612
01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.640
<v Speaker 1>When they would talk about things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have a disagreement about </v>

1613
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.341
<v Speaker 1>something that she did and she would </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring up something that happened like </v>

1614
01:15:44.341 --> 01:15:44.860
<v Speaker 1>fucking two years ago that had nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with it.</v>

1615
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Like you did they give you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you said that he was like,</v>

1616
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.620
<v Speaker 1>it was too fucking years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

1617
01:15:49.621 --> 01:15:53.230
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has No bearing on who we are right now?</v>

1618
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:54.490
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

1619
01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.720
<v Speaker 1>She's not being rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

1620
01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:58.620
<v Speaker 1>She was trying to define him by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1621
01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:00.760
<v Speaker 1>an argument that they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1622
01:16:00.850 --> 01:16:05.850
<v Speaker 1>two years ago or whatever comments like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean when people are </v>

1623
01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:09.190
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to define them based on a</v>

1624
01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:11.020
<v Speaker 1>failure as a team guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1625
01:16:11.021 --> 01:16:15.460
<v Speaker 1>anybody on the guy I want on my team is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who's failed and failed and failed</v>

1626
01:16:15.461 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 1>and every time he got back up and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1627
01:16:17.231 --> 01:16:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>

1628
01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep going because I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1629
01:16:20.171 --> 01:16:23.050
<v Speaker 1>when the bullets start flying and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day gets tough,</v>

1630
01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:26.680
<v Speaker 1>we're going to keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me somebody who's never failed ours</v>

1631
01:16:26.681 --> 01:16:27.550
<v Speaker 1>one every time.</v>

1632
01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as they have a perceived </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversity or difficult situation,</v>

1633
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:34.720
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that guy on my team,</v>

1634
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:36.590
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1635
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a big issue with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1636
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.270
<v Speaker 1>with fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a giant issue.</v>

1637
01:16:40.271 --> 01:16:43.270
<v Speaker 1>It's called being a front runner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some guys that just,</v>

1638
01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't do well when they're the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nail.</v>

1639
01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:51.001
<v Speaker 1>They're great when they're the hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when then all of a sudden they're </v>

1640
01:16:51.001 --> 01:16:53.671
<v Speaker 1>the nail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what the fuck to do and </v>

1641
01:16:53.671 --> 01:16:55.201
<v Speaker 1>they fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain guys that if they're </v>

1642
01:16:55.201 --> 01:16:55.201
<v Speaker 1>dominating a fight to the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying fighter in the world,</v>

1643
01:16:55.201 --> 01:16:58.110
<v Speaker 1>but the moment things start going the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way you start seeing cracks in their arm</v>

1644
01:16:58.111 --> 01:17:03.111
<v Speaker 1>or you start seeing mental weaknesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they fold and they perform at a </v>

1645
01:17:03.111 --> 01:17:04.990
<v Speaker 1>drastically reduced level with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

1646
01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:08.080
<v Speaker 1>well the reason it's psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden they're confronting it.</v>

1647
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're confronted,</v>

1648
01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:14.670
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you see a fighter that's </v>

1649
01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:17.321
<v Speaker 1>able to cable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>able capable of being hurt and on the </v>

1650
01:17:17.321 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 1>brink of failure and then coming back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and winning a fight,</v>

1651
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:24.250
<v Speaker 1>then you see a person with character and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's other people that they're </v>

1652
01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:27.050
<v Speaker 1>great when everything's going their way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the moment things aren't going their</v>

1653
01:17:27.051 --> 01:17:29.480
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking pack up their bags and</v>

1654
01:17:29.481 --> 01:17:34.481
<v Speaker 1>go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love to watch is the guy </v>

1655
01:17:34.481 --> 01:17:35.210
<v Speaker 1>that those fights were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was down and he didn't.</v>

1656
01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:38.480
<v Speaker 1>He didn't stop pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn a lot about God.</v>

1657
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.210
<v Speaker 1>You said Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their character.</v>

1658
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:43.370
<v Speaker 1>That's where he learned about somebody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>character is this kid that fights in the</v>

1659
01:17:43.371 --> 01:17:45.670
<v Speaker 1>UFC right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is Thomas Almeda is very,</v>

1660
01:17:45.671 --> 01:17:50.671
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very highly hyped up fighter and he had </v>

1661
01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:51.740
<v Speaker 1>a real tough fight recently with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy named Brad picket.</v>

1662
01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Brad pickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tough veterans.</v>

1663
01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Been around for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kid I'll made has been beating </v>

1664
01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:01.031
<v Speaker 1>everybody up and then all of a sudden he</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets in this fight with his veteran and </v>

1665
01:18:01.031 --> 01:18:01.310
<v Speaker 1>he gets cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His nose gets broken.</v>

1666
01:18:01.311 --> 01:18:06.311
<v Speaker 1>He gets rocked really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back the next round and knocked </v>

1667
01:18:06.311 --> 01:18:06.311
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked pick it out.</v>

1668
01:18:06.311 --> 01:18:07.820
<v Speaker 1>It hit him with a flying knee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked him out.</v>

1669
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:10.820
<v Speaker 1>But the point being that this kid got </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed to the brink,</v>

1670
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:14.210
<v Speaker 1>never lost composure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go,</v>

1671
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypes real this kids a real deal,</v>

1672
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:21.880
<v Speaker 1>and you got to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to see that to know because </v>

1673
01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you don't know what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get in trouble.</v>

1674
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely getting in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being able to operate while under </v>

1675
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:29.180
<v Speaker 1>that kind of intense pressure of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>in trouble is what makes champions,</v>

1676
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.600
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you replicate that in the fight </v>

1677
01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.341
<v Speaker 1>world and and training for a guy to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to be in that situation to where,</v>

1678
01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:41.380
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's going to feel like and </v>

1679
01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:41.380
<v Speaker 1>this is how you need to respond or can </v>
<v Speaker 1>you replicate that?</v>

1680
01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:41.810
<v Speaker 1>You almost can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1681
01:18:41.811 --> 01:18:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that that kind of mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

1682
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1683
01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:46.580
<v Speaker 1>it's so difficult to try to replicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1684
01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.460
<v Speaker 1>There's certain drills you can do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1685
01:18:49.461 --> 01:18:54.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm a drill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take five fresh guys and you go in </v>

1686
01:18:54.461 --> 01:18:58.091
<v Speaker 1>and you spar one guy for one round and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then that guy goes out and you bring a </v>

1687
01:18:58.091 --> 01:18:59.040
<v Speaker 1>new fresh guy and you're tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guys,</v>

1688
01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:00.560
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to break you.</v>

1689
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:02.840
<v Speaker 1>They try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also people that don't agree</v>

1690
01:19:02.841 --> 01:19:07.841
<v Speaker 1>with that because they think that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like experiencing failure like </v>

1691
01:19:07.841 --> 01:19:11.300
<v Speaker 1>that in the gym is actually a bad thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you become comfortable with</v>

1692
01:19:11.301 --> 01:19:15.440
<v Speaker 1>failure and you understand it and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that it's just an attribute</v>

1693
01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:20.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a psychological attribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either you're in shape and you're </v>

1694
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.471
<v Speaker 1>prepared and you're ready and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversity comes you're going to be able </v>

1695
01:19:23.471 --> 01:19:23.471
<v Speaker 1>to handle it or you're not.</v>

1696
01:19:23.471 --> 01:19:23.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1697
01:19:23.811 --> 01:19:28.811
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really tough to put an answer to </v>

1698
01:19:28.811 --> 01:19:31.391
<v Speaker 1>that because it's really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like think about like buds training or </v>

1699
01:19:31.391 --> 01:19:34.220
<v Speaker 1>think about like how many people go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that,</v>

1700
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:39.280
<v Speaker 1>that kind of training and just get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where everybody's </v>

1701
01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.190
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's miserable,</v>

1702
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:42.920
<v Speaker 1>but they get up and they quit and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't quit?</v>

1703
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:44.820
<v Speaker 1>The people that don't quit at the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to count on,</v>

1704
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.980
<v Speaker 1>like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

1705
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:51.130
<v Speaker 1>why this is their first time doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they made the decision </v>

1706
01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:54.130
<v Speaker 1>beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you they made the decision </v>

1707
01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:56.030
<v Speaker 1>beforehand like I don't care what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and how much it's going to suck.</v>

1708
01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:01.180
<v Speaker 1>In my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have now embraced it and I've told </v>

1709
01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:01.180
<v Speaker 1>myself that I'm an enjoy it and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what,</v>

1710
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quitting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll lose a leg before I quit,</v>

1711
01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but if you have even the slightest </v>
<v Speaker 1>inkling of this sucks,</v>

1712
01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I have to do another 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles and hump 100 pounds.</v>

1713
01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Then you're thinking it's easy to step </v>
<v Speaker 1>off to the side over there and be done,</v>

1714
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.440
<v Speaker 1>but if you have a mental mind frame and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can train it,</v>

1715
01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:23.830
<v Speaker 1>if you had that mental mind frame of I </v>
<v Speaker 1>will not they they're,</v>

1716
01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:28.840
<v Speaker 1>they might not take me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it won't be because I didn't finish </v>

1717
01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.911
<v Speaker 1>this damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It won't be because I'm not physically </v>

1718
01:20:31.911 --> 01:20:32.400
<v Speaker 1>and mentally here doing everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's asked of me.</v>

1719
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say you can train it,</v>

1720
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:36.510
<v Speaker 1>they don't try to trade it in you though</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they prepare you?</v>

1721
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>

1722
01:20:37.501 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 1>They want the person who does it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

1723
01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Innate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same with fighters.</v>

1724
01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1725
01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Either you have it or you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1726
01:20:43.591 --> 01:20:48.591
<v Speaker 1>and that's why similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just a small percentage of </v>

1727
01:20:48.591 --> 01:20:50.070
<v Speaker 1>people that ever get through that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of training.</v>

1728
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:55.730
<v Speaker 1>There's similarly a small percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that ever get to the elite level </v>

1729
01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:55.730
<v Speaker 1>of competition.</v>

1730
01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I think in any form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any sport,</v>

1731
01:20:57.990 --> 01:21:00.240
<v Speaker 1>in anything where you're trying to push </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1732
01:21:00.241 --> 01:21:03.240
<v Speaker 1>anything that's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really difficult.</v>

1733
01:21:03.241 --> 01:21:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Endeavor reveals character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1734
01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:07.150
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful process is,</v>

1735
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.620
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing and it's amazing to see in </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and even,</v>

1736
01:21:10.621 --> 01:21:12.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that experience it would,</v>

1737
01:21:12.161 --> 01:21:15.350
<v Speaker 1>they quit even that can be a lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1738
01:21:15.351 --> 01:21:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you can learn from that lesson and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuild and,</v>

1739
01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.130
<v Speaker 1>and never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never experienced that.</v>

1740
01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a curiosity in your training.</v>

1741
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:25.560
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of people actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete the training?</v>

1742
01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so through our initial special forces </v>

1743
01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:32.540
<v Speaker 1>assessment and selection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only about 33 percent get through that.</v>

1744
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Then you go through the training </v>
<v Speaker 1>pipeline,</v>

1745
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.120
<v Speaker 1>which is anymore for about a year and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half to two,</v>

1746
01:21:36.121 --> 01:21:41.121
<v Speaker 1>two and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's about 50 percent of the </v>

1747
01:21:41.121 --> 01:21:41.121
<v Speaker 1>people I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1748
01:21:41.121 --> 01:21:41.690
<v Speaker 1>so you get 16 percent will get through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1749
01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:46.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very small percentage and that's </v>

1750
01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:46.700
<v Speaker 1>people that have the courage to join.</v>

1751
01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1752
01:21:47.391 --> 01:21:49.680
<v Speaker 1>you think about how many people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to sign up.</v>

1753
01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:54.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a small percentage to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a small percentage of a small </v>

1754
01:21:54.681 --> 01:21:58.131
<v Speaker 1>percentage of a small percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to be a cool guy and </v>

1755
01:21:58.131 --> 01:21:58.780
<v Speaker 1>until things go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1756
01:21:58.781 --> 01:22:03.781
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to be anymore what it is </v>

1757
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:03.781
<v Speaker 1>with the seals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

1758
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:04.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very similar.</v>

1759
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Similar to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1760
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:07.200
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost all very,</v>

1761
01:22:07.201 --> 01:22:11.070
<v Speaker 1>very small percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is if it's 16 percent in</v>

1762
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:13.980
<v Speaker 1>that arena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it in,</v>

1763
01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:15.580
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in boxing,</v>

1764
01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.900
<v Speaker 1>MMA or fighting mma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also,</v>

1765
01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:21.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of physical gifts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>come into play.</v>

1766
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Like we're talking about guys that quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's guys that quit that are at the </v>

1767
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:28.410
<v Speaker 1>elite level and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't run into anybody as good</v>

1768
01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:30.410
<v Speaker 1>as them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as long as they keep training,</v>

1769
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.890
<v Speaker 1>they keep pushing ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

1770
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.560
<v Speaker 1>they'll bulldoze and bum rush.</v>

1771
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.240
<v Speaker 1>All these guys that are in there with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1772
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:37.800
<v Speaker 1>But there's guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1773
01:22:37.801 --> 01:22:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to mention names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't wanna hurt anybody's feelings.</v>

1774
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:42.270
<v Speaker 1>This guys have won world titles that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>quitters.</v>

1775
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fact.</v>

1776
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:46.080
<v Speaker 1>They're just really good or they've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheating.</v>

1777
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:49.500
<v Speaker 1>It's been a lot of steroid use epo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different things.</v>

1778
01:22:49.501 --> 01:22:51.870
<v Speaker 1>But even then they have to fine tune </v>
<v Speaker 1>those skills.</v>

1779
01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any anybody can do,</v>

1780
01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:56.520
<v Speaker 1>do those drugs and they can't hit a home</v>
<v Speaker 1>run or they can't put somebody in a rear</v>

1781
01:22:56.521 --> 01:22:59.040
<v Speaker 1>naked choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not entirely week.</v>

1782
01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:00.480
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1783
01:23:00.481 --> 01:23:01.560
<v Speaker 1>they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might.</v>

1784
01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people can run a marathon,</v>

1785
01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:08.410
<v Speaker 1>can run an ultra marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do 100 miles in 24 hours?</v>

1786
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:11.140
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people can.</v>

1787
01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:13.630
<v Speaker 1>So the people that run that ultra </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon,</v>

1788
01:23:13.631 --> 01:23:15.490
<v Speaker 1>they'll look at other people that can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>run a marathon.</v>

1789
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Or the people that run a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon will look at people that can't </v>

1790
01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:23.281
<v Speaker 1>run a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will quit at Mile Sixteen or </v>

1791
01:23:23.281 --> 01:23:23.281
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll go,</v>

1792
01:23:23.281 --> 01:23:26.941
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just fucking don't have the mental </v>

1793
01:23:26.941 --> 01:23:28.561
<v Speaker 1>toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't have the mental </v>

1794
01:23:28.561 --> 01:23:30.511
<v Speaker 1>toughness to go 100 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's levels to everything in this </v>

1795
01:23:30.511 --> 01:23:34.030
<v Speaker 1>life and there's people that are at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite level of MMA that I know.</v>

1796
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.240
<v Speaker 1>I know that if they get in a bad spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to quit.</v>

1797
01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:40.390
<v Speaker 1>They're going to breaking point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that for a fact.</v>

1798
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

1799
01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:44.050
<v Speaker 1>every human has a breaking point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no.</v>

1800
01:23:44.051 --> 01:23:46.090
<v Speaker 1>There's no unbreakable dude walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around today.</v>

1801
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:47.680
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though he my thanks.</v>

1802
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:49.270
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think so.</v>

1803
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:53.140
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think so without ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>being tested and I don't even think they</v>

1804
01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:58.141
<v Speaker 1>think it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just saying it so that </v>

1805
01:23:58.141 --> 01:24:00.001
<v Speaker 1>they think that they can convince you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe somehow know that will </v>

1806
01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:00.200
<v Speaker 1>convince themselves if you believe it.</v>

1807
01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it nurture?</v>

1808
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Is it nature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just good question?</v>

1809
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:10.110
<v Speaker 1>What they want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a psychological decision to do it </v>

1810
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:12.310
<v Speaker 1>or is it their matrix of how they're put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>

1811
01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:16.300
<v Speaker 1>This is the limit of their capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this puppy,</v>

1812
01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:18.310
<v Speaker 1>and this is obviously a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another person,</v>

1813
01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.750
<v Speaker 1>but I had this dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was Frank Sinatra.</v>

1814
01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Craziest fucking dog I've ever had who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>

1815
01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.960
<v Speaker 1>His mother was a wild boar hunting dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Hawaii.</v>

1816
01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:28.900
<v Speaker 1>His dog was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was crazy.</v>

1817
01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:30.550
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was a puppy,</v>

1818
01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:32.380
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons I realized he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1819
01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:37.381
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would always like to play bite and </v>

1820
01:24:37.381 --> 01:24:37.381
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really little.</v>

1821
01:24:37.381 --> 01:24:37.570
<v Speaker 1>It was only two months old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1822
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:37.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1823
01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:42.900
<v Speaker 1>he would come up to me and bite my hands</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd push him away and he'd run up a </v>

1824
01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.510
<v Speaker 1>bite my hand again and I pushed him away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

1825
01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:44.800
<v Speaker 1>how many fucking times can I do this?</v>

1826
01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I pushed him away 80 times before I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired of doing it.</v>

1827
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.910
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1828
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:53.920
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

1829
01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:56.620
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking human.</v>

1830
01:24:56.621 --> 01:25:01.621
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a grown man and he's a baby dog and </v>

1831
01:25:01.621 --> 01:25:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm pushing him away from me and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>never got discouraged.</v>

1832
01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Not once at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at number 80.</v>

1833
01:25:05.591 --> 01:25:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right buddy,</v>

1834
01:25:06.371 --> 01:25:07.450
<v Speaker 1>bye my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just,</v>

1835
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:09.570
<v Speaker 1>let's just call this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1836
01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:14.630
<v Speaker 1>that was 100 percent nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not nurture and dog that I've taught </v>

1837
01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:18.090
<v Speaker 1>them to do is get pat and given dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

1838
01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:23.130
<v Speaker 1>give him kisses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in his hitting his makeup and </v>

1839
01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:24.640
<v Speaker 1>there's that question of epigenetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

1840
01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:28.690
<v Speaker 1>how much of your character do you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your parents?</v>

1841
01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Like just in your DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much can you mold on your own?</v>

1842
01:25:32.171 --> 01:25:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are.</v>

1843
01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.260
<v Speaker 1>There's an untold number of variables </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nature and nurture.</v>

1844
01:25:38.261 --> 01:25:40.780
<v Speaker 1>It's neither or it's all the above.</v>

1845
01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different things that </v>

1846
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:45.780
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1847
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really,</v>

1848
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put these people down for not being able</v>

1849
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:49.710
<v Speaker 1>to succeed at the level that you've like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1850
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:52.450
<v Speaker 1>You did with this super marathon or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon reimbursement.</v>

1851
01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:54.730
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I do a five k and I'm wasted.</v>

1852
01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a runner or a swimmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you decided you were a runner and</v>

1853
01:25:59.351 --> 01:26:04.351
<v Speaker 1>then put in the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be a runner given any mean </v>

1854
01:26:04.351 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 1>whether your knees hold up or ankle </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems or all that jazz.</v>

1855
01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:09.160
<v Speaker 1>If you decided to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do.</v>

1856
01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not outside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

1857
01:26:10.611 --> 01:26:12.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you can't fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1858
01:26:12.411 --> 01:26:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I can't fly either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1859
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't have wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1860
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Like we're talking about nonphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>

1861
01:26:17.751 --> 01:26:19.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a simple thing like running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not saying,</v>

1862
01:26:19.731 --> 01:26:24.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you beat Usain bolt in a hundred yard </v>

1863
01:26:24.731 --> 01:26:24.731
<v Speaker 1>dash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No you won't,</v>

1864
01:26:24.731 --> 01:26:27.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about some simple </v>

1865
01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.771
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the commitment to do it and keep </v>

1866
01:26:29.771 --> 01:26:31.860
<v Speaker 1>it and just keep them commitment and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the physical and mental capacity </v>

1867
01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:35.501
<v Speaker 1>and then just whether you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed and whether or not you're </v>

1868
01:26:35.501 --> 01:26:35.501
<v Speaker 1>going to embrace the suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been committed before.</v>

1869
01:26:35.501 --> 01:26:36.870
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1870
01:26:36.990 --> 01:26:38.880
<v Speaker 2>instead of turning from whatever you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

1871
01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:39.750
<v Speaker 2>embrace it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1872
01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:42.360
<v Speaker 2>You have to truly embrace it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Embrace the suck.</v>

1873
01:26:42.361 --> 01:26:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Then it's not something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get out of you.</v>

1874
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:45.610
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to live in that moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1875
01:26:45.611 --> 01:26:48.360
<v Speaker 2>and truly thrive in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the difference.</v>

1876
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:50.880
<v Speaker 2>But the elite performer and anomaly,</v>

1877
01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:54.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even like simple things like tell</v>

1878
01:26:54.061 --> 01:26:58.170
<v Speaker 1>yourself you're going to do an hour and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a half on an elliptical machine.</v>

1879
01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.250
<v Speaker 1>What seems real easy for five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then 10 minutes and you're like,</v>

1880
01:27:02.251 --> 01:27:07.251
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got an hour and 20 more minutes this </v>

1881
01:27:07.251 --> 01:27:09.730
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know as you're going and </v>

1882
01:27:09.730 --> 01:27:10.260
<v Speaker 1>not reduce the level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the level at the same.</v>

1883
01:27:10.261 --> 01:27:13.170
<v Speaker 1>And just force yourself to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not easy to do,</v>

1884
01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:15.810
<v Speaker 1>but that ain't shit compared to an ultra</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon.</v>

1885
01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:21.080
<v Speaker 1>So there's levels to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how about these crazy fucks </v>

1886
01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:25.080
<v Speaker 1>that do like there's people that do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra marathons in a row,</v>

1887
01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.200
<v Speaker 1>like they'll do an ultra marathon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do an ultra marathon back </v>

1888
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.470
<v Speaker 1>because a regular ultra marathon is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy enough for these people </v>

1889
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:35.700
<v Speaker 1>because they did want to find the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1890
01:27:35.701 --> 01:27:37.470
<v Speaker 1>When's the edge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I hit it.</v>

1891
01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can go further.</v>

1892
01:27:39.450 --> 01:27:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm building up more endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm building the goal more </v>

1893
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.450
<v Speaker 1>mental toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go further.</v>

1894
01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of Wynn Hoff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>

1895
01:27:47.521 --> 01:27:48.900
<v Speaker 1>What does the iceman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1896
01:27:48.901 --> 01:27:49.400
<v Speaker 1>That crazy.</v>

1897
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:51.860
<v Speaker 2>That good.</v>

1898
01:27:51.861 --> 01:27:54.920

1899
01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes and does his crease craziest </v>

1900
01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:02.071
<v Speaker 2>immersions and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like freezing temperatures and he </v>

1901
01:28:02.071 --> 01:28:02.570
<v Speaker 2>can keep his core temperature without </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing.</v>

1902
01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.280
<v Speaker 2>He holds the world record like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

<v Speaker 2>method that he can teach you how to </v>

1904
01:28:09.670 --> 01:28:11.300
<v Speaker 2>change your physiology to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapt to these things.</v>

1905
01:28:11.301 --> 01:28:13.750
<v Speaker 2>And it's with breathing techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1906
01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:17.200
<v Speaker 2>commitment and a cold water immersion.</v>

<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

1912
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:29.720
<v Speaker 2>My wife held it for two minutes and 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds after,</v>

1913
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:31.940
<v Speaker 2>after 15 minutes doing this breathing </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1914
01:28:31.941 --> 01:28:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And you held it for five minutes before </v>
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>

1915
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Because that guy is somebody who is a 41</v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1920
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:50.360
<v Speaker 2>they submitted it and they all had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancers or ailments or whatever,</v>

1921
01:28:50.361 --> 01:28:53.280
<v Speaker 2>trained them for three months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 of them submitted.</v>

1922
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:57.110
<v Speaker 2>They did it in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>36 hours and they did it in shorts.</v>

1923
01:28:57.470 --> 01:29:02.470
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His whole thing is I can train you to </v>

1924
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.470
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take over your and</v>

1925
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:03.600
<v Speaker 1>your autonomic nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1926
01:29:03.601 --> 01:29:05.250
<v Speaker 1>a guy like that seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1927
01:29:05.251 --> 01:29:09.610
<v Speaker 1>like people talk about mental training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cowboy cerrone on the other day and</v>

1928
01:29:09.611 --> 01:29:11.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked him if he's involved in,</v>

1929
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about like Mindfox and </v>

1930
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>things that go wrong and fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1931
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.470
<v Speaker 1>have you ever done any mentor training </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all?</v>

1932
01:29:16.471 --> 01:29:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And he's like never fucked with any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff,</v>

1933
01:29:18.690 --> 01:29:23.690
<v Speaker 1>but I think you get a guy who was as </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough as like a cowboy cerrone and you </v>

1934
01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:25.080
<v Speaker 1>teach him some shit like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1935
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>It's all next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the elite of the elite.</v>

1936
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.690
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can get your physical,</v>

1937
01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:33.870
<v Speaker 1>your physical performance up to the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

1938
01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:38.930
<v Speaker 1>then you're selling yourself short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not only also having a mental </v>

1939
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:40.370
<v Speaker 1>aspect to your game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a mental aspect to your</v>

1940
01:29:40.371 --> 01:29:40.530
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1941
01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:45.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to be mentally draining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think also like people get used to </v>

1942
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:49.071
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get used to stuff and you get used </v>

1943

1954
01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:10.260
<v Speaker 1>So the point is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I do it so often it's nothing but </v>

1955
01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the first time I did I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

1956
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.430
<v Speaker 1>now I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just stand there.</v>

1957
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Like I literally like the timer goes off</v>
<v Speaker 1>at three minutes online.</v>

1958
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I can keep going.</v>

1959
01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I could just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My body body's so.</v>

1960
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.850
<v Speaker 1>It's so normal to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get used to it.</v>

1961
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his wind Hoff guy too.</v>

1962
01:30:26.371 --> 01:30:31.371
<v Speaker 1>It's like his mind has a category for </v>
<v Speaker 1>these states and he puts himself in </v>

1963
01:30:31.441 --> 01:30:36.441
<v Speaker 1>these antique and slowly but surely </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase the duration of these states </v>

1964
01:30:36.441 --> 01:30:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and the suffering and the in his body </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands how to mitigate whatever </v>

1965
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:42.860
<v Speaker 1>issues might come up from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a documentary on Vice Joe,</v>

1966
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:44.610
<v Speaker 1>check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 39 slash 40 minutes.</v>

1967
01:30:44.630 --> 01:30:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I keep hearing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and I haven't looked into it enough.</v>

1968
01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:49.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to read the facts machine I </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought.</v>

1969
01:30:49.051 --> 01:30:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I bought the programs like a 10 week </v>
<v Speaker 1>program for 200 bucks.</v>

1970
01:30:52.081 --> 01:30:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>those outliers,</v>

1974
01:30:58.650 --> 01:30:59.820
<v Speaker 1>those are real outliers.</v>

1975
01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:01.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's people that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1976
01:31:01.441 --> 01:31:04.530
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about doing an ultra </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon or something along those lines,</v>

1977
01:31:04.531 --> 01:31:09.531
<v Speaker 1>like for most people like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the develop mental toughness is </v>

1978
01:31:09.531 --> 01:31:13.701
<v Speaker 1>involved in that is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you hear about this guy and </v>

1979
01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:13.701
<v Speaker 1>roller bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1980
01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Well there's always going to be someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's taking it to the next place.</v>

1981
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Next Guy's going to do it fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>barefoot,</v>

1982
01:31:17.491 --> 01:31:18.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

1983
01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:23.840
<v Speaker 1>he's cool because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hooks up with scientists and they </v>

1984
01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:24.270
<v Speaker 1>regulate everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take the blood before and during,</v>

1985
01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:26.240
<v Speaker 1>after he's looked up to the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

1986
01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.940
<v Speaker 1>he can prove now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1987
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it's proven evidence proven that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing,</v>

1988
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:31.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1989
01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.340

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1993
01:31:43.561 --> 01:31:48.561

<v Speaker 1>as like walking on coals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really just kind of a horseshit</v>

<v Speaker 2>We'll get it there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze the results they're seeing the </v>

2057
01:34:17.901 --> 01:34:17.901
<v Speaker 2>results to Dr Gordon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Gordon gets it,</v>

2058
01:34:17.901 --> 01:34:18.510
<v Speaker 2>he gets the results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a,</v>

2059
01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.560
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2060
01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:21.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they schedule an appointment with you to</v>

2061
01:34:21.901 --> 01:34:26.901
<v Speaker 2>do a one on one consultation and he'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>go over everything in complete detail </v>

2062
01:34:26.901 --> 01:34:30.610
<v Speaker 2>and answer all your questions there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then go over what your protocols,</v>

2063
01:34:31.050 --> 01:34:35.430
<v Speaker 2>what do thinks your protocol should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>before we actually do a skype,</v>

2064
01:34:35.431 --> 01:34:40.431
<v Speaker 2>I write a four page report which gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>sent by email to the patient and it has </v>

2065
01:34:40.431 --> 01:34:45.140
<v Speaker 2>English in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just medical leaves in an explains </v>

2066
01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:48.980
<v Speaker 2>some of the results and it gives them a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chart of what the suggested first group </v>

2067
01:34:50.371 --> 01:34:53.220
<v Speaker 2>of products or the first approach will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

2068
01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 2>And then through Fedex we send a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive patient that's a put </v>

2069
01:34:58.670 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 2>together</v>

2070
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:00.380
<v Speaker 3>specifically based upon their lab </v>
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>

2071
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:05.620
<v Speaker 3>It's about 80 pages in total and </v>
<v Speaker 3>explains why we did every single one of </v>

2072
01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:09.941
<v Speaker 3>the tests and how they interpret out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then supportive documentation from the </v>

2073
01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:12.530
<v Speaker 3>general medical literature that's out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2074
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then through the skype,</v>

2075
01:35:15.111 --> 01:35:20.111
<v Speaker 3>which is 45 minutes to an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go through every single one of the </v>

2076
01:35:20.111 --> 01:35:23.351
<v Speaker 3>lab tests and how it pertains to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>after we discuss their traumas or </v>

2077
01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:27.620
<v Speaker 3>whatever their accident that they had or</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're a civilian in the lack of any</v>

2078
01:35:27.621 --> 01:35:29.540
<v Speaker 3>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's what your results are.</v>

2079
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.080
<v Speaker 3>And then we make arrangements for either</v>
<v Speaker 3>their doctor to participate with us or </v>

2080
01:35:35.301 --> 01:35:36.990
<v Speaker 3>one of our doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2081
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:40.460
<v Speaker 3>since November twelfth when I saw you </v>
<v Speaker 3>last year,</v>

2082
01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:45.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my new book on traumatic brain injury </v>

2083
01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.780
<v Speaker 3>came out and I'm a new lecture series </v>
<v Speaker 3>came out and we did that in San Diego.</v>

2084
01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:51.740
<v Speaker 3>And part of the reason why there are now</v>
<v Speaker 3>more doctors aware of what we,</v>

2085
01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:57.040
<v Speaker 3>what we do is because we trained 45 docs</v>
<v Speaker 3>from five different countries in the </v>

2086
01:35:57.651 --> 01:36:00.260
<v Speaker 3>protocols that we've developed over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past 10 years.</v>

2087
01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:03.800
<v Speaker 3>And the results we had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrew was there and spoke to them.</v>

2088
01:36:03.801 --> 01:36:08.801
<v Speaker 3>We had a night of Friday night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was for military night since we </v>

2089
01:36:08.801 --> 01:36:12.641
<v Speaker 3>were so close to coordinate island and </v>
<v Speaker 3>invited the military.</v>

2090
01:36:13.371 --> 01:36:18.371
<v Speaker 3>Anyone active war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Presently I'm a veteran to come to the </v>

2091
01:36:18.371 --> 01:36:21.350
<v Speaker 3>meeting and to hear Andrew talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>his own life's experience.</v>

2092
01:36:21.630 --> 01:36:23.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be the egg head and tell you about</v>

2093
01:36:23.541 --> 01:36:28.541
<v Speaker 3>the science that's behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's really impacting on both the </v>

2094
01:36:28.541 --> 01:36:32.831
<v Speaker 3>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional level is listening to someone </v>

2095
01:36:32.831 --> 01:36:35.480
<v Speaker 3>as you did to Matthew Gazani when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the show and Andrew telling his story</v>

2096
01:36:35.481 --> 01:36:40.481
<v Speaker 3>of how he transitioned from this </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal life to this great military </v>

2097
01:36:40.481 --> 01:36:44.591
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that then the injuries and then what </v>

2098
01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:46.661
<v Speaker 3>happened after it and then having all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these standardized medical procedures </v>

2099
01:36:46.851 --> 01:36:51.851
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really didn't help to bring them </v>

2100
01:36:51.851 --> 01:36:52.370
<v Speaker 3>to the level that he's at right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is according to his mother,</v>

2101
01:36:52.371 --> 01:36:53.000
<v Speaker 3>father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sister,</v>

2102
01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:58.001
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your dog also said that you were acting </v>

2103
01:36:58.001 --> 01:36:58.001
<v Speaker 3>much better than you were in the past </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

2104
01:36:58.310 --> 01:37:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his life is transition.</v>

2105
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:04.440
<v Speaker 3>The emails he sends me about the quality</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's experienced,</v>

2106
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:07.670
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Regardless of what we do,</v>

2107
01:37:07.671 --> 01:37:12.671
<v Speaker 3>it's always about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately the end point of the </v>

2108
01:37:12.671 --> 01:37:15.820
<v Speaker 3>journey that we're taking right now is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bringing you back to a </v>

2109
01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:16.040
<v Speaker 3>functionality where you're enjoying </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2110
01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:16.700
<v Speaker 3>How's your life?</v>

2111
01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't be any better,</v>

2112
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2113
01:37:19.051 --> 01:37:20.690
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're saying.</v>

2114
01:37:20.691 --> 01:37:25.691
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to bring this to everybody out </v>

2115
01:37:25.691 --> 01:37:25.691
<v Speaker 1>there who's been told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was told,</v>

2116
01:37:25.691 --> 01:37:29.410
<v Speaker 1>this is the new you take a notebook </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with you because you're gonna </v>

2117
01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:29.600
<v Speaker 1>have to write stuff down because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to be able to remember it.</v>

2118
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:34.750
<v Speaker 1>And here's an important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a donate link and the donate </v>

2119
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:37.190
<v Speaker 1>link at a warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angels Foundation Dot Org.</v>

2120
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:42.550
<v Speaker 1>The donate link is really important </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of guys that just </v>

2121
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:45.941
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have funds for this kind of </v>

2122
01:37:45.941 --> 01:37:48.251
<v Speaker 1>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not covered by insurance </v>

2123
01:37:48.251 --> 01:37:48.251
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2124
01:37:48.251 --> 01:37:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's any insurance covering this all.</v>

2125
01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.620
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2126
01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:53.550
<v Speaker 3>let's see how Matthew Gosney got in as I</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a,</v>

2127
01:37:53.730 --> 01:37:54.790
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2128
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.440
<v Speaker 3>of my practice and put it into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate fund.</v>

2129
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:00.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2130
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:05.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started funding the military is through </v>

2131
01:38:05.690 --> 01:38:06.130
<v Speaker 3>our practice because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2132
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:09.060
<v Speaker 3>for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first year it's $5,000</v>

2133
01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:11.280
<v Speaker 3>all inclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

2134
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Because we've gotten donations from our </v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratory,</v>

2135
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:19.230
<v Speaker 3>the laboratory that we use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>access medical lab has given us a lot of</v>

2136
01:38:19.290 --> 01:38:24.290
<v Speaker 3>money to help offset the costs for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>labs are compounding pharmacy </v>

2137
01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:26.520
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Compounding pharmacy gave us $100,000</v>

2138
01:38:26.521 --> 01:38:31.521
<v Speaker 3>grant so that testosterone is for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any of the compounded products free.</v>

2139
01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Another pharmacy pharmacy gives us all </v>
<v Speaker 3>our clomid so that the first three </v>

2140
01:38:37.741 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 3>months of product for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less than 40 year old veterans,</v>

2141
01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:47.180
<v Speaker 3>they get clomid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which helps stimulate their own body to </v>

2142
01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:47.820
<v Speaker 3>make testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just got a $10,000</v>

2143
01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:52.821
<v Speaker 3>grant from a pure encapsulations for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>key antioxidants that we use for brain </v>

2144
01:38:53.281 --> 01:38:58.281
<v Speaker 3>health and a lot of help streamlining </v>
<v Speaker 3>those costs coming in and get this joe </v>

2145
01:38:58.531 --> 01:39:03.531
<v Speaker 3>the 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in year one is compared to what the va </v>

2146
01:39:03.531 --> 01:39:04.650
<v Speaker 3>spins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is $15,000</v>

2147
01:39:04.890 --> 01:39:09.810
<v Speaker 3>and the Congressional Budget Office </v>
<v Speaker 3>report in 2012 for Tbi and PTSD,</v>

2148
01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:15.230
<v Speaker 3>15 to $16,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to treat that and all they use is </v>

2149
01:39:15.230 --> 01:39:15.600
<v Speaker 3>medication and psychotherapy.</v>

2150
01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:20.600
<v Speaker 3>So it gets more as the years goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas we're fixing an underlying </v>

2151
01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:20.600
<v Speaker 3>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're fixing the problem,</v>

2152
01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.770
<v Speaker 3>$5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the first year,</v>

2153
01:39:22.771 --> 01:39:25.290
<v Speaker 3>about 3,500,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2,535</v>

2154
01:39:25.291 --> 01:39:30.291
<v Speaker 3>the second year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then every year thereafter the cost </v>

2155
01:39:30.291 --> 01:39:31.440
<v Speaker 3>is about $1,500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same cop was,</v>

2156
01:39:31.450 --> 01:39:36.450
<v Speaker 3>it had a $66 billion dollars is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're paying for all the medical care </v>

2157
01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:41.721
<v Speaker 3>in 2012 slash $66,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we're getting listened to </v>

2158
01:39:41.721 --> 01:39:44.040
<v Speaker 3>because we're were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the difference and variations of</v>

2159
01:39:44.041 --> 01:39:47.930
<v Speaker 3>these prices of what you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 3>spending and result and the end,</v>

2160
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:51.030
<v Speaker 3>the end result don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But nobody cared about the end result.</v>

2161
01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:52.740
<v Speaker 3>They cared about numbers from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

2162
01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let me just tell anybody who's </v>

2163
01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:57.800
<v Speaker 3>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I made.</v>

2164
01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:01.590
<v Speaker 3>My daughter has a jewelry company and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's volunteered to,</v>

2165
01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to gift to anyone who gives $5,000</v>

2166
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:11.790
<v Speaker 3>a coin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a 1800 years of age silver coin</v>

2167
01:40:12.271 --> 01:40:13.560
<v Speaker 3>from a roam.</v>

2168
01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.900
<v Speaker 3>All authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look brand new coins,</v>

2169
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:17.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a gift.</v>

2170

<v Speaker 3>Anyone who helps us with $5,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2171
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Eric coins or era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can say her website.</v>

2172
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2173
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:29.010
<v Speaker 3>It's e R A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>B Y R,</v>

2174
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:32.160
<v Speaker 3>g.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and on there you'll see giving,</v>

2175
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:37.430
<v Speaker 3>it actually shows what she's a producing</v>
<v Speaker 3>in her jewelry company and donating to a</v>

2176
01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:44.240
<v Speaker 3>warrior angels foundation so they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand it out to people who are donating </v>

2177
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:45.600
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2178
01:40:45.601 --> 01:40:47.970
<v Speaker 3>is there any resistance to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this type of training?</v>

2179
01:40:47.971 --> 01:40:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there any detractors,</v>

2180
01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:53.670
<v Speaker 3>a training insensitive over the seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>training treatment rather?</v>

2181
01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2182
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

2183
01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is FDA approved.</v>

2184
01:40:59.410 --> 01:41:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Everything is being used at </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiological levels.</v>

2185
01:41:02.831 --> 01:41:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I think I shared with you on past show </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we use a blended testosterone,</v>

2186
01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 3>a injectable that we developed about 14 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

2187
01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:16.080
<v Speaker 3>which gets into the brain a lot faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the cip yonatan the Atlantic that's</v>

2188
01:41:16.751 --> 01:41:21.751
<v Speaker 3>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different types of testosterone and we </v>

2189
01:41:21.751 --> 01:41:21.760
<v Speaker 3>use a very low dose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 milligrams,</v>

2190
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:26.790
<v Speaker 3>which is the amount that a healthy 25 to</v>
<v Speaker 3>35 year old makes in a week's time.</v>

2191
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:32.310
<v Speaker 3>So we're using everything physiologic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not just about hormone </v>

2192
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:34.170
<v Speaker 3>replenishment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about the micronutrients that we're</v>

2193
01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 3>using to help with the hormone so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they work.</v>

2194
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:42.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to have a well balanced </v>

2195
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:43.180
<v Speaker 3>machinery in the brain in order to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the benefits and you,</v>

2196
01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:48.480
<v Speaker 3>no one is addressing the inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect to brain trauma and without </v>

2197
01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.360
<v Speaker 3>addressing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get improvement.</v>

2198
01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Now I know there's sustained improvement</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're developing new testosterone</v>

2199
01:41:54.371 --> 01:41:57.730
<v Speaker 3>that's animal based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of using yams,</v>

2200
01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:02.780
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're using animals somehow or </v>

2201
01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:03.430
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're avoiding detection with,</v>

2202
01:42:03.431 --> 01:42:03.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2203
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:04.430
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2204
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:06.830
<v Speaker 3>drug testing when they're doing these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2205
01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 3>carbon isotope tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2206
01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:12.460
<v Speaker 3>This is new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the new thing that,</v>

2207
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:13.120
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2208
01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.640
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people on the fringe of the cheating</v>

2209
01:42:15.641 --> 01:42:16.550
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2210
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can get the testosterone more so </v>

2211
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.940
<v Speaker 3>into the brain because we're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone from really work.</v>

2212
01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does work to help build muscle,</v>

2213
01:42:23.891 --> 01:42:26.470
<v Speaker 3>but what controls the muscle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brain.</v>

2214
01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:32.020
<v Speaker 3>We were just talking about how people </v>
<v Speaker 3>succeed in freezing and Eisman and </v>

2215
01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Kilimanjaro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all the brain.</v>

2216
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.810
<v Speaker 3>So if you can increase the brain's </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to be resistant to failure,</v>

2217
01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:42.430
<v Speaker 3>meaning that you've got a mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do it regardless of hell</v>

2218
01:42:42.431 --> 01:42:43.510
<v Speaker 3>or high water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do it.</v>

2219
01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:48.960
<v Speaker 3>That's really where the benefits are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the testosterone increases those </v>

2220
01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:48.960
<v Speaker 3>benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct,</v>

2221
01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:52.450
<v Speaker 3>and low dose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very well absorbed,</v>

2222
01:42:52.451 --> 01:42:55.450
<v Speaker 3>both like two stops from appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets into the system,</v>

2223
01:42:55.451 --> 01:43:00.451
<v Speaker 3>into the cells and three to four hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's out of the blood so you don't </v>

2224
01:43:00.451 --> 01:43:02.980
<v Speaker 3>detect it appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about that?</v>

2225
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.170
<v Speaker 3>You were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You developed drops.</v>

2226
01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Little light bulbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>SOMOS Nana live too.</v>

2227
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:12.250
<v Speaker 3>So mit's a compounded product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We developed the vehicle that the </v>

2228
01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:16.981
<v Speaker 3>compounding pharmacies can legal legally</v>
<v Speaker 3>put testosterone into this liquid and </v>

2229
01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:18.790
<v Speaker 3>the liquid is put under.</v>

2230
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:23.790
<v Speaker 3>The tongue was put into the mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>washed around and gets absorbed because </v>

2231
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:26.950
<v Speaker 3>the particle size is so small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets absorbed rapidly,</v>

2232
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:32.070
<v Speaker 3>but there's a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something you have to do every </v>

2233
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.070
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2234
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.070
<v Speaker 3>This is one that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2235
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:34.060
<v Speaker 3>our testing showed that either once a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

2236
01:43:34.210 --> 01:43:36.820
<v Speaker 3>ideally once a day is the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2237
01:43:36.821 --> 01:43:41.320
<v Speaker 3>you get to regulate the responsiveness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have the response.</v>

2238
01:43:41.321 --> 01:43:45.700
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to have a nice easy day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take one squirt on the tongue.</v>

2239
01:43:45.701 --> 01:43:47.350
<v Speaker 3>If you want to have really energetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

2240
01:43:47.351 --> 01:43:50.370
<v Speaker 3>you'd take two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to have a fun night for many</v>

2241
01:43:50.370 --> 01:43:51.010
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take four.</v>

2242
01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

2243
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.200
<v Speaker 2>sounds like you're encouraging people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get fucking crazy.</v>

2244
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I educate everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's prescription only.</v>

2245
01:43:58.521 --> 01:44:00.590
<v Speaker 2>And with all the great doctors out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2246
01:44:00.591 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 2>they'll regulate it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>

2247
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:08.350
<v Speaker 2>it's not a magic pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what it'll do is it'll allow you to </v>

2248
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:11.870
<v Speaker 2>live life the way it was intended to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2249
01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:14.600
<v Speaker 2>So before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you couldn't react to something,</v>

2250
01:44:14.601 --> 01:44:16.670
<v Speaker 2>now you'll be able to react to things </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriately.</v>

2251
01:44:16.671 --> 01:44:18.810
<v Speaker 2>You'll be able to do things </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriately towards.</v>

2252
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:20.060
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're have a,</v>

2253
01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.750
<v Speaker 2>your neurochemistry is not in balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can't.</v>

2254
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:25.790
<v Speaker 2>So this will give you the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

2255
01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:31.780
<v Speaker 1>So in closing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything else you guys want to </v>

2256
01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:35.011
<v Speaker 1>say?</v>

2257
01:44:35.011 --> 01:44:35.011
<v Speaker 1>where you can go to learn more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2258
01:44:35.230 --> 01:44:35.460
<v Speaker 1>We got it</v>

2259
01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:38.380
<v Speaker 2>crowdfunding campaign that you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to through our website.</v>

2260
01:44:38.490 --> 01:44:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got awesome perks on there,</v>

2261
01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:43.360
<v Speaker 2>like a range day with me shooting at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>range.</v>

2262
01:44:43.361 --> 01:44:47.020
<v Speaker 2>You got videos on there for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool mugs or whatever.</v>

2263
01:44:47.290 --> 01:44:49.350
<v Speaker 2>So some incentives to give.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2264
01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:54.540
<v Speaker 2>and anything you want to find out about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Gordon or also his daughter will be </v>

2265
01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:54.540
<v Speaker 2>on our website as well.</v>

2266
01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:59.030
<v Speaker 3>I will say that a life extension </v>
<v Speaker 3>magazine that in 2012 did the article on</v>

2267
01:44:59.870 --> 01:45:04.010
<v Speaker 3>hormones to heal the brain in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military is doing a followup,</v>

2268
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:09.310
<v Speaker 3>a followup article where they've gone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>six or eight of our patients for I think</v>

2269
01:45:10.311 --> 01:45:15.311
<v Speaker 3>military and two are for non nonmilitary</v>
<v Speaker 3>and interviewed them to get their </v>

2270
01:45:15.311 --> 01:45:17.860
<v Speaker 3>experience over the past few years that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2271
01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:21.980
<v Speaker 3>since the 2012 article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it'll be important for those</v>

2272
01:45:21.981 --> 01:45:26.981
<v Speaker 3>people who are thinking about maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting involved in what we're doing to </v>

2273
01:45:26.981 --> 01:45:29.150
<v Speaker 3>read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's coming out a the end of the</v>

2274
01:45:29.150 --> 01:45:31.400
<v Speaker 3>year to read it and listen to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2275
01:45:31.401 --> 01:45:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Where else go back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2276
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Matthew Gazani Jason Hall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>November Twelfth of last year.</v>

2277
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:41.830
<v Speaker 3>And listen to the podcast that was done </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I get a lot of calls of how many</v>

2278
01:45:42.441 --> 01:45:44.690
<v Speaker 3>people exactly what he said was what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going through.</v>

2279
01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.680
<v Speaker 3>And I think listening to those that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>injured and get onto the program more </v>

2280
01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:51.500
<v Speaker 3>important than anything I can say.</v>

2281
