<v Speaker 1>Different races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an excellent point because I was </v>

16
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.341
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come there's no black ones because </v>

<v Speaker 1>the dude who started this whole deal,</v>

20
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>our friend Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like he's a mixed heritage,</v>

21
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean he seems like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a bunch of things going to say,</v>

23
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of black and white ones had</v>
<v Speaker 1>some black something somewhere along the</v>

24
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's represent.</v>

25
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:07.731
<v Speaker 1>He's a spiritual traveler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell by just talking to that </v>

26
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:10.420
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you guys doesn't have </v>

27
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>like Indian dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have him on the podcast </v>

28
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>if he'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

29
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I liked that makes the molds of girls' </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaginas,</v>

30
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>like porno stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd like,</v>

31
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>they literally mold their vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the outside of it.</v>

32
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Stick a flashlight it better and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>them off.</v>

33
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>But there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like put like,</v>

34
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put something on it,</v>

35
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they make an impression of it.</v>

36
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>But every one of those is an official </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina.</v>

37
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:34.971
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe there's just some fat chick </v>

38
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:34.971
<v Speaker 1>who's her vagina and she's like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>designer.</v>

39
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>She went to art school for three years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she goes,</v>

40
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>puts this stuff on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now everybody will get.</v>

41
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>My point about the flush side has always</v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

42
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>it does not have to look like a vagina </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not looking at it.</v>

43
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm just shoving it on my desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a free fake vagina.</v>

44
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>One time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stare at it while you're fucking.</v>

45
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're going to be turned</v>

47
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was a real vagina.</v>

48
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it by itself?</v>

49
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.760

<v Speaker 1>and I have no fear of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>altercation talking to them.</v>

236
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that bad,</v>

237
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't have no fear of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>altercation.</v>

238
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:50.690
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>

242
00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:57.741
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

247
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.380

<v Speaker 1>That was very funny though.</v>

252
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It was very funny though.</v>

253
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Real shit with video Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy the shit out of it.</v>

254
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.010
<v Speaker 1>May Have Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy the shit out of it now.</v>

255
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>We can't have you on without talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that strikeforce Bra.</v>

256
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the most ridiculous shit I've </v>

257
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.530
<v Speaker 1>ever seen on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the problems and we </v>

258
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.550
<v Speaker 1>talked about it on the show right after </v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened with uh,</v>

259
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 1>organizations that they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough experience yet.</v>

260
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.820
<v Speaker 1>There's little things they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered.</v>

261
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Little things like watching the doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't just let anybody in and </v>

262
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.390
<v Speaker 1>the UFC knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have people watching the doors </v>

263
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>trying to get into the cage feed man </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

264
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's just like a little hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing in their game.</v>

265
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 1>And the whole missing</v>

266
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 3>was you got to watch the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just let anybody in the cage.</v>

267
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 3>They just fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought it was an appropriate time</v>

268
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.850
<v Speaker 3>to get into case smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

269
00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the worst that could happen?</v>

270
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst thing happens so.</v>

271
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't have been bad.</v>

272
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.340
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't have been bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

273
00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 3>what happened was you came in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>interrupted in the middle of his speech.</v>

274
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how that went.</v>

275
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 3>He looked at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw what happened.</v>

276
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.170
<v Speaker 3>He looked at you guys made eye contact </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you just went with it because </v>

277
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.180
<v Speaker 3>it was like awkward at that point </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>

278
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean to step into his frame.</v>

279
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.310
<v Speaker 3>And then he looked back at me and me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and uh,</v>

280
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:36.450
<v Speaker 3>me and shields Kinda had made peace </v>
<v Speaker 3>already because we're both cutting </v>

281
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.130
<v Speaker 3>weight at the same time and we're in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same area.</v>

282
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 3>And we both were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

283
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 3>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kind of looked at each other like,</v>

284
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing it again.</v>

285
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up Dawg?</v>

286
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we were like,</v>

287
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>

288
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you beat me in the last five.</v>

289
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Give me another shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

290
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:48.910
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

291
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:50.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

292
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's mutual respect him.</v>

293
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.450
<v Speaker 3>He respects me and an ad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we kind of made our peace and that </v>

294
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 3>the way we still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're cool.</v>

295
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what up?</v>

296
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 3>Then I won my fight and knock the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

297
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 3>which this will make a lot more sense if</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the video.</v>

298
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the CBS broadcast,</v>

299
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 3>they showed my fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had five,</v>

300
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:11.570
<v Speaker 3>25 minute fights and went over their </v>
<v Speaker 3>time slot anyway when way,</v>

301
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.170
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

302
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 3>way over their time slot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went over by like over an hour.</v>

303
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

304
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.030
<v Speaker 3>In our planning again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

305
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just new at the MMA game.</v>

306
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a new thing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

307
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I go in there and I didn't mean to </v>

308
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 3>step into frame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stepped in the frame of,</v>

309
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh whoops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already had.</v>

310
00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 3>He noticed me at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

311
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to talk now Eddie,</v>

312

<v Speaker 3>well you want to rematch it out?</v>

313
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.300
<v Speaker 3>And he said that off the off the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went,</v>

316
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.970
<v Speaker 3>stockton dog piled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the funniest part is,</v>

317
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 3>is imagine if I just want to fight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>my camp was in there.</v>

318
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My crew,</v>

319
00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 3>if we jumped on somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would be fucking hurt.</v>

320
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.770
<v Speaker 3>I got up like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

321
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't even get hurt on that.</v>

322
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 3>How did I even get hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

323
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:08.540
<v Speaker 3>like I was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even have a scratch on me and,</v>

324
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:13.710
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the little scrub I shot a double </v>

325
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.710
<v Speaker 3>leg on somebody because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

326
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.061
<v Speaker 3>let me just take someone on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I can probably get my way out </v>

327
00:14:18.061 --> 00:14:18.061
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

328
00:14:18.061 --> 00:14:20.770
<v Speaker 3>and because I was thinking at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment you got when you fight,</v>

329
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.530
<v Speaker 3>and my adrenaline had already been </v>
<v Speaker 3>pumped up earlier that night.</v>

330
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.020
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't even hyped with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was happening.</v>

331
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

332
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:32.010
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'd get on the bottom of a dog pile </v>

333
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:32.010
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>even feel that.</v>

336
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.730
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as I'm thinking in my head,</v>

<v Speaker 5>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the strikeforce thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for the people who haven't seen it,</v>

<v Speaker 5>One guy wins.</v>

434
00:19:01.871 --> 00:19:06.871
<v Speaker 5>And this guy who want jake shields </v>
<v Speaker 5>mayhem and jake shields had fought in </v>

435
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:07.450
<v Speaker 5>the past very close decision as matter </v>
<v Speaker 5>of fact,</v>

436
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:12.510
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the second round was the </v>
<v Speaker 5>second or the third or the end of the </v>

437
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.651
<v Speaker 5>second and third,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had them locked up in a rear naked </v>

438
00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:16.651
<v Speaker 5>choke and homeboy was going asleep.</v>

439
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Hold him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After the bell was my last fight.</v>

440
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 3>I illegally kicked Jacques Rey in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>head and I was like,</v>

441
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get the.</v>

442
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Everybody hates me because I'm a dirty </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass fighter,</v>

443
00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I didn't even hold onto it and beyond</v>

444
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:31.560
<v Speaker 3>the bell because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get up.</v>

445
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:32.100
<v Speaker 3>He would have went to</v>

446
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:37.180
<v Speaker 5>sleep and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a couple of seconds away from </v>

447
00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:37.180
<v Speaker 5>going to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was woulda,</v>

448
00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:37.580
<v Speaker 5>Coulda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoulda deadlocked on.</v>

449
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:38.810
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the point is,</v>

450
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.280
<v Speaker 5>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a big,</v>

451
00:19:40.281 --> 00:19:41.660
<v Speaker 5>very close fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was very,</v>

452
00:19:41.661 --> 00:19:44.660
<v Speaker 5>it was exciting and a mayhem doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like he did his best,</v>

453
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:47.750
<v Speaker 5>which no fighter ever does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he wanted to have this rematch.</v>

454
00:19:47.751 --> 00:19:51.680
<v Speaker 5>So when Jake shields one and a big </v>
<v Speaker 5>victory over Dan Henderson may him says,</v>

455
00:19:51.681 --> 00:19:53.090
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a good way to hype the fight up.</v>

456
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.740
<v Speaker 5>This would be a big name fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

457
00:19:54.741 --> 00:19:59.180
<v Speaker 5>I may have Miller from MTV and bully </v>
<v Speaker 5>beat down and we're on fucking CBS right</v>

<v Speaker 3>A little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit like I said,</v>

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.460
<v Speaker 3>This reality</v>

479
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.080
<v Speaker 5>like the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

485
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.580

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.090

00:25:16.351 --> 00:25:16.351
<v Speaker 5>other's faces and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's this,</v>

586
00:25:16.351 --> 00:25:20.670
<v Speaker 5>especially with two guys that are about </v>
<v Speaker 5>to fight these little tiny battles are </v>

587
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.601
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These little tiny psychological battles </v>

588
00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:24.601
<v Speaker 5>like who gets to tell who to go fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves last,</v>

589
00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:26.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who gets to say the last word?</v>

590
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:27.310
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

591
00:25:27.311 --> 00:25:28.840
<v Speaker 5>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we might be here all day.</v>

592
00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:31.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going anywhere fucking on </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting that real man.</v>

593
00:25:31.621 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 5>I am so not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would you want to get yourself that?</v>

594
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:35.170
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

595
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:40.200
<v Speaker 5>But if you're a cage fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a different situation because </v>

596
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.620
<v Speaker 5>psychological warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very important.</v>

597
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:46.620
<v Speaker 5>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your mindset as opposed to where their </v>

598
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:46.620
<v Speaker 5>mindset is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>

599
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.811
<v Speaker 5>when the fight starts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can fuck someone's head up in the </v>

600
00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:53.251
<v Speaker 5>preflight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of fighters that are </v>

601
00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:53.251
<v Speaker 5>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe in,</v>

602
00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:53.260
<v Speaker 5>just like I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all nice and good,</v>

603
00:25:53.261 --> 00:25:54.570
<v Speaker 5>but everybody's got their own style,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

604
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.400
<v Speaker 5>You can't hate on someone's shit-talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop because it really works,</v>

605
00:25:57.401 --> 00:25:58.540
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some,</v>

606
00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.100
<v Speaker 5>there's some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

607
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:02.800
<v Speaker 5>when you get inside someone's head and </v>
<v Speaker 5>get them emotional.</v>

608
00:26:02.801 --> 00:26:06.850
<v Speaker 5>And I'll start talking shit about their </v>
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend talking shit about their kids</v>

609
00:26:06.851 --> 00:26:08.340
<v Speaker 5>talking shit about their life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

610
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.890
<v Speaker 5>you start fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And look,</v>

611
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.220
<v Speaker 5>some people can take it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people who talk shit,</v>

612
00:26:12.221 --> 00:26:14.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they think it's funny and it doesn't</v>

613
00:26:14.081 --> 00:26:16.270
<v Speaker 5>hurt them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some guys go crazy.</v>

614
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:21.540
<v Speaker 5>Look at fucking Frank Mir.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When Brock Lesnar Frank Mir his face </v>

615
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.810
<v Speaker 5>after he beat the fuck out of him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after he beat his fucking face into the </v>

616
00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.910
<v Speaker 5>ground to smashed him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then he gets in his face doc.</v>

617
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.940
<v Speaker 5>So fucking shit.</v>

618
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Use</v>

619
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.090
<v Speaker 5>that for motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

620
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.400
<v Speaker 5>that was real man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

621
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.100
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

622
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:35.950
<v Speaker 5>a real anger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

623
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.800
<v Speaker 5>that guy got fucking furious because </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

624
00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.910
<v Speaker 5>it backfired on him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it works on other girls.</v>

625
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.030
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you talking about?</v>

626
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 5>Backfired.</v>

627
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that people got sad that.</v>

628
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

629
00:26:48.111 --> 00:26:48.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

630
00:26:48.471 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

631
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean as far as his performance,</v>

632
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.590
<v Speaker 2>his performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the shit talking to backfire.</v>

633
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I just think that that had nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with property is going to be bigger and </v>

634
00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.400
<v Speaker 2>stronger and bigger groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying is it didn't do any </v>

635
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:04.410
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got it more of a beating,</v>

636
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.460
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

637
00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:10.970
<v Speaker 2>and he got really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got real anger behind shit out of me.</v>

638
00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Then they let me off easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I to,</v>

640
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.210
<v Speaker 2>if I lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had lost.</v>

641
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to like,</v>

642
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hugged me into the Damn Bat.</v>

643
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see the IFC,</v>

644
00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

645
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett Dranamo dose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see you like stoppage,</v>

646
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.300
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

647
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett was crushing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

648
00:27:27.841 --> 00:27:28.530
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong.</v>

649
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.560
<v Speaker 2>You mean it's definitely just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was thinking like,</v>

650
00:27:31.561 --> 00:27:32.430
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

651
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:37.431
<v Speaker 2>I think Brock Lester took more shots </v>
<v Speaker 2>than than this guy and the guy got up </v>

652
00:27:37.431 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 2>and he was really pissed and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>protested was like,</v>

653
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:40.530
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And granted Barnett was killing them.</v>

654
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barnett looked awesome.</v>

655
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean he been at fucking Barnett as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>loved the officiating and the Lesnar </v>

656
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:51.510
<v Speaker 2>fight listener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a supercar one fan.</v>

657
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I love him as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the best guy.</v>

658
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of anybody who can.</v>

659
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.830
<v Speaker 2>When Brock lesner showed his character </v>
<v Speaker 2>and coming back for that second round,</v>

660
00:27:58.831 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 2>but he took a lot of shots where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at big John,</v>

661
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:06.831
<v Speaker 2>who I think is the best of business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think big John and herb dean at the </v>

662
00:28:06.831 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 2>very best and big but big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John stopped that fight in Australia.</v>

663
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:12.620
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder who would have stopped the </v>

664
00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:12.620
<v Speaker 2>lesnar fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would have stopped it.</v>

665
00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

666
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Most of all is the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is one of the best.</v>

667
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Rosenthal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rosenthal is the shed.</v>

668
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:20.040
<v Speaker 2>He's a real fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He trains.</v>

669
00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:25.041
<v Speaker 2>He's a brown belt in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about understanding what her dean </v>

670
00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:25.890
<v Speaker 2>is the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's my dean is stellar,</v>

671
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.440
<v Speaker 2>outstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coolest motherfucker on the planet.</v>

672
00:28:28.441 --> 00:28:33.441
<v Speaker 2>You both guys are and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think either one of those </v>

673
00:28:33.441 --> 00:28:33.441
<v Speaker 2>guys could have stopped it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

674
00:28:33.441 --> 00:28:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Maybe herb herb might have stopped now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he would have.</v>

675
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Somebody might have no one from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>matrix is going to stop.</v>

676
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.740
<v Speaker 2>That is a great referee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he might've stopped it.</v>

677
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

678
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.720
<v Speaker 2>There's a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I'm trying to get at is that</v>

679
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.460
<v Speaker 2>moments like that you realize how </v>
<v Speaker 2>important the referee really is.</v>

680
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is that,</v>

681
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he should have been </v>

682
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:56.320
<v Speaker 2>stopped because he was taking a beating </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure,</v>

683
00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.220
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the athletes face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to like pay attention to their </v>

684
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.470
<v Speaker 2>facial expression and there if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't look like they want out of there,</v>

685
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.370
<v Speaker 2>why stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I never once can remember.</v>

686
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.560
<v Speaker 2>I remember getting my ass kicked a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of times.</v>

687
00:29:10.561 --> 00:29:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I like getting kicked and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking,</v>

688
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.210
<v Speaker 2>don't stop this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like don't stop it.</v>

689
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm still here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry.</v>

690
00:29:16.741 --> 00:29:21.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm still here and keeping my faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's an extra thing to think </v>

691
00:29:21.741 --> 00:29:21.741
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

692
00:29:21.741 --> 00:29:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

693
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just know in my head,</v>

694
00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:29.121
<v Speaker 2>don't stop the fight because I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell it a couple of bites I been and </v>

695
00:29:29.121 --> 00:29:29.450
<v Speaker 2>where I'm getting my ass whooped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could tell.</v>

696
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

697
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting kicked my ass kicked right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

698
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.560

<v Speaker 2>situation and I.</v>

699
00:29:34.561 --> 00:29:35.840
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>begin.</v>

700
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please don't stop the fight because I'm </v>

701
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.680

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's cool.</v>

705
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Like it would be an email that does been</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooled at buddies on and I was actually </v>

706
00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.390
<v Speaker 1>kind of friends with Nate Diaz despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>being nick never getting along because </v>

707
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.720
<v Speaker 1>you think you guys can all squash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

708
00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't get along with nick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Nick Diaz.</v>

709
00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long words.</v>

710
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I said it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your problem?</v>

711
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:04.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know what?</v>

712
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.210
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he was a driving factor in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole thing.</v>

713
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.240
<v Speaker 3>He's the first guy to throw a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started that whole thing and it,</v>

714
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.590
<v Speaker 3>it's almost not as fault because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>retarded,</v>

715
00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time and he embodies </v>
<v Speaker 3>this cultural shift that we had and,</v>

716
00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 3>and we really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really started with Dr Dre selling us </v>

717
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.501
<v Speaker 3>Nwa and it did add saunas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This culture of gangster is cool.</v>

718
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Gangster is cool in a way to watch a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

719
00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.370
<v Speaker 3>but being gangster is just being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little kid,</v>

720
00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.690
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

721
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.760
<v Speaker 3>and starting a big brawl because what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked some shit to your homie that is</v>

722
00:30:44.361 --> 00:30:46.480
<v Speaker 3>just ghetto and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

723
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.700
<v Speaker 3>that thing embodies what's wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the paragard right now.</v>

724
00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.130
<v Speaker 3>People don't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when they asked him about it,</v>

725
00:30:52.131 --> 00:30:53.820
<v Speaker 3>I came out and apologized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

726
00:30:53.821 --> 00:30:55.820
<v Speaker 3>right after that whole thing went down </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was wrong.</v>

727
00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I stepped into the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one stopped me.</v>

728
00:30:58.071 --> 00:31:00.920
<v Speaker 3>I figured that they won't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be cool.</v>

729
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.420
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a cool way to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amanda.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 3>proper response.</v>

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:52.660
<v Speaker 1>like he didn't get the joke though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem he was just fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a serious dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of him as a fighter.</v>

752
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.350
<v Speaker 1>I've always been cool with him person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was great.</v>

753
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Hey listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

754

<v Speaker 1>That whole no,</v>

755
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.320
<v Speaker 1>no fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fun and games.</v>

756
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:18.060
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird way to live because he </v>

757
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:18.060
<v Speaker 1>just is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

759
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.790
<v Speaker 1>he's just angry with himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he just,</v>

760
00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.860
<v Speaker 1>he takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rare that someone is so </v>

761
00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:25.010
<v Speaker 1>disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as disciplined his hands.</v>

762
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean Nick Diaz is in tremendous shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>just running and cardio guy works really</v>

763
00:32:31.311 --> 00:32:36.311
<v Speaker 1>hard obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so good now to man his last few </v>

764
00:32:36.311 --> 00:32:36.311
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

765
00:32:36.311 --> 00:32:36.311
<v Speaker 1>the fucking Scott Smith's fight.</v>

766
00:32:36.311 --> 00:32:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I was really impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank shamrock.</v>

767
00:32:38.481 --> 00:32:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

768
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking putting it together.</v>

769
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:43.390
<v Speaker 1>He's putting it on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

770
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.360
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as like a dude like that whole,</v>

771
00:32:46.361 --> 00:32:48.830
<v Speaker 1>like always angry and always fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

772
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate.</v>

773
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.430
<v Speaker 1>It's unfortunate way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

774
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the mentality of some people</v>

775
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:55.180
<v Speaker 1>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

776
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.710
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that in someone who's so good at</v>

777
00:32:57.711 --> 00:33:00.020
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

778
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 1>You just go to the gym every day at work</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be smart.</v>

779
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:04.790
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of,</v>

780
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of power over </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind and over your will.</v>

781
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount you have for </v>
<v Speaker 1>her to have a well man,</v>

782
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:12.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

783
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.640
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a will and discipline.</v>

784
00:33:14.641 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Speaker 1>You get back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who are dumb as shit,</v>

785
00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 1>who would just go to their construction </v>
<v Speaker 1>job and work hard as hell every day.</v>

786
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.940
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen.</v>

787
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz might not be like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not think he's socially most </v>

788
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 1>inept guy in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but physically,</v>

789
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:31.280
<v Speaker 1>that guy's very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how good as Jujitsu is.</v>

790
00:33:31.281 --> 00:33:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Look how good he fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That takes the intelligence.</v>

791
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:35.420
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's not,</v>

792
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:38.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing in other areas of his life,</v>

793
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>

794
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that guy when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>that good,</v>

795
00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 1>you're super intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

796
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

797
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I understand where it all comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

798
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:52.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a programming that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get when you're really young and you </v>

799
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.430
<v Speaker 1>think that that's the way to behave and </v>
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>

800
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.930
<v Speaker 1>but I think you've got a real good </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

801
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:56.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a real good point about the I</v>

802
00:33:56.061 --> 00:33:59.560
<v Speaker 1>don't want to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to have fun and I back wild.</v>

803
00:33:59.561 --> 00:34:01.810
<v Speaker 1>I do crazy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are always cool to be,</v>

804
00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but I've never seen you picking fights.</v>

805
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 1>What's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never seen you start arguments for no </v>

806
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've always been cool to people.</v>

807
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen you bully people or fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>with anybody,</v>

808
00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:13.310
<v Speaker 1>which is where it really funny that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up getting this anti bully show,</v>

809
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.490
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same job that I do in vow man.</v>

810
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I did the same thing all growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny that I got because I </v>

811
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:26.171
<v Speaker 1>played this role my entire life because </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time there's a big kid picking out</v>

812
00:34:26.371 --> 00:34:28.840
<v Speaker 1>a middle kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember like three incidents.</v>

813
00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.220
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be like,</v>

814
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:36.340
<v Speaker 1>because I like to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always liked to fight since I was </v>

815
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.161
<v Speaker 1>three years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just like my dad was in the army </v>

816

<v Speaker 1>Stop talking.</v>

850
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ legality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

851
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we're on that subject,</v>

852
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.590
<v Speaker 1>tell me mayhem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of your,</v>

853
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.750
<v Speaker 1>your assistant that did you wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

854
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.900
<v Speaker 1>which I think is 100 times worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's not because you do.</v>

855
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You gave a waste where someone lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where someone loves his thinking,</v>

856
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

857
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.690
<v Speaker 1>That's where someone sleeps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a phone number.</v>

858
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.330
<v Speaker 1>A phone number is not nearly as bad as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the place where you sleep.</v>

859
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:41.600
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the story was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was weird about it is that he was </v>

860
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.960
<v Speaker 1>arrested the same week that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened for a torture to an animal.</v>

861
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:47.961
<v Speaker 1>He left his dog in his house for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks at a time while he was out doing </v>

862
00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:50.700
<v Speaker 1>other bad stuff and so it just happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same week,</v>

863
00:36:50.701 --> 00:36:53.790
<v Speaker 1>which made it a million times better </v>
<v Speaker 1>without doing other bad stuff.</v>

864
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Bad stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way he speaks as well.</v>

865
00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying not to get the guy in trouble</v>

866
00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Speaker 1>or appointed Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

867
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 1>well we could move onto subject revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>was served so you don't have to worry.</v>

868
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

869
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.160
<v Speaker 1>So now we can all sleep knowing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't be.</v>

870
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.460
<v Speaker 1>No legally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird because actually he was </v>

871
00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:13.460
<v Speaker 1>abusing animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is funny.</v>

872
00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.540
<v Speaker 1>If someone trust into a scam and gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>busted,</v>

873
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting story is the guy who,</v>

874
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:18.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

875
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.680
<v Speaker 1>people always ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

876
00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:20.750
<v Speaker 1>can we take a picture?</v>

877
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Will you get me in a choke or I'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in a choke?</v>

878
00:37:23.161 --> 00:37:28.161
<v Speaker 1>And I say we can't because the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically tells us we can't because </v>

879
00:37:28.161 --> 00:37:28.780
<v Speaker 1>two guys were sued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

880
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.790
<v Speaker 1>chuck was sued and Matt Hughes were sued</v>
<v Speaker 1>for taking pictures with Duke.</v>

881
00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.060
<v Speaker 1>But then why did Jim Norton just get </v>
<v Speaker 1>choked out the other day on opb video?</v>

882
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Video is totally different because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

883
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

884
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:42.320
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to video is very obvious what's </v>

885
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:42.320
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

886
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:42.320
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Jim Norton.</v>

887
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Jim Norton's not going to sue randy </v>
<v Speaker 1>coture.</v>

888
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:48.021
<v Speaker 1>It's just random fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thought they could make some money </v>

889
00:37:48.021 --> 00:37:48.021
<v Speaker 1>and they pretended that chuck heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

890
00:37:48.021 --> 00:37:48.620
<v Speaker 1>They pretend that Matt Hughes heard him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

891
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.760
<v Speaker 1>the guy who they pretended Matt Hughes </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard them.</v>

892
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they investigated this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's always people that said </v>

893
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.000
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

894
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.000

<v Speaker 1>Who's taking a picture with you?</v>

896
00:37:57.091 --> 00:38:02.091
<v Speaker 1>You asked him to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy turned out he was a dirty cop </v>

897
00:38:02.091 --> 00:38:02.860
<v Speaker 1>and they started investigating and found</v>
<v Speaker 1>out some shit.</v>

898
00:38:02.861 --> 00:38:05.580
<v Speaker 1>And now he's in jail doing a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch.</v>

899
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Was doing like 10 years or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

900
00:38:07.471 --> 00:38:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Because he's a Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jesus did it.</v>

901
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

985
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I totally knew I was talking to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Dane Cook while you were talking </v>

986
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:43.950
<v Speaker 1>on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but twitter and of that guy's number </v>

987
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 1>that I thought I saw that I saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that,</v>

988
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I talked to him.</v>

992
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 1>So you thought you were making a direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>message to Dane Cook and you were really</v>

993
00:41:56.001 --> 00:42:01.001
<v Speaker 1>just twittering in public day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens because I can't figure out </v>

994
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:05.670
<v Speaker 1>how to delete the nice people on twitter</v>

995
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:11.450
<v Speaker 6>leaking your phone number.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So intensive because that's like </v>

996
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:14.560
<v Speaker 6>something that you have so many,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a hundred people that know your </v>

997
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.411
<v Speaker 6>phone number and once you leak that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Dana white just leaked it on </v>

998
00:42:17.411 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 6>twitter the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can lose that of did with his office</v>

999
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:20.000
<v Speaker 6>number,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they'll change is,</v>

1000
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:20.930
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not bad,</v>

1001
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.610
<v Speaker 6>but your cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's pretty huge.</v>

1002
00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:27.820
<v Speaker 6>You saw what was going on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't even turn it a number for a </v>

1003
00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.761
<v Speaker 6>long ass time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to forget how many people </v>

1004
00:42:30.761 --> 00:42:30.761
<v Speaker 6>have that number when somebody down the </v>
<v Speaker 6>line.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's all good.</v>

1006
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.800
<v Speaker 6>I think this is a great retreat setting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Re just reaching,</v>

1007
00:42:35.801 --> 00:42:35.810
<v Speaker 6>going</v>

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.980
<v Speaker 1>back and trying to grab a hold of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the past.</v>

1009
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Don't let that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fun letter.</v>

1010
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.840
<v Speaker 1>When you lose a number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like that to go.</v>

1011
00:42:42.841 --> 00:42:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can't even turn the phone on.</v>

1012
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I turned the phone on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

1013
00:42:45.991 --> 00:42:50.991
<v Speaker 1>it just reboots because it gets so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>texts because I turned it on like every </v>

<v Speaker 1>I try to make a call or I get calls in </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

1017
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I tried to answer the call and while I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>answering the call,</v>

1018
00:43:02.551 --> 00:43:04.950
<v Speaker 1>it's just constant buzz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buzz,</v>

1019
00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:10.070

<v Speaker 5>bad buju anymore.</v>

1163
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.650
<v Speaker 3>South Park episode without the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology thing.</v>

1164
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:49.410
<v Speaker 3>One of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1165
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:49.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1166
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.400
<v Speaker 3>When they went over the whole marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1167
00:48:52.401 --> 00:48:55.160
<v Speaker 3>It was genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>South parks are greatest photo history.</v>

1168
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Here's the way it is though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1169
00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:02.080
<v Speaker 3>The way it is is my friend has a grandpa</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Japan lifted Hawaii,</v>

1170
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.380
<v Speaker 3>but basically at for the last 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been in the house cleaning the house.</v>

1171
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:09.530
<v Speaker 3>She's the nicest lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got one of her friends from,</v>

1172
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:12.110
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever old Japanese ladies do.</v>

1173
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.380
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they go to a Japanese church,</v>

1174
00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.530
<v Speaker 3>a Christian church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they go,</v>

1175
00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:23.240
<v Speaker 3>they are telling the story of the virgin</v>
<v Speaker 3>birth and she suddenly has a freakout.</v>

1176
00:49:23.241 --> 00:49:26.030
<v Speaker 3>She's 80 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's kind of like an old lady like,</v>

1177
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.800
<v Speaker 3>you believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you in the middle of the sermon </v>

1178
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.640
<v Speaker 3>like you all believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one that really.</v>

1179
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Because that's the first time in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian church.</v>

1180
00:49:35.961 --> 00:49:37.700
<v Speaker 3>He didn't never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She never heard about it.</v>

1181
00:49:37.701 --> 00:49:39.020
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know the story.</v>

1182
00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1183
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she freaked out.</v>

1184
00:49:42.531 --> 00:49:47.531
<v Speaker 3>She was like the you guys believe it </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up the whole sermon and left in </v>

1185
00:49:47.531 --> 00:49:51.230
<v Speaker 3>the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you draw the parallel to the same</v>

1186
00:49:51.231 --> 00:49:53.690
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of hard to.</v>

1187
00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1188
00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:57.290
<v Speaker 3>I hate to use the same thing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>

1189
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.320
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the 2000 years younger.</v>

1190
00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:01.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

1191
00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 5>Anybody telling you they've got all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>answers.</v>

1192
00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.760
<v Speaker 5>They don't have this weird hunger</v>

1193
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:11.820
<v Speaker 3>to to figure it all out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know it's good because now we got </v>

1194
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 3>the scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1195
00:50:12.941 --> 00:50:13.930
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

1196
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 3>that scientologist scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real scientists,</v>

1197
00:50:17.201 --> 00:50:20.410
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scientologists put it in there to sound.</v>

1198
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.060
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1199
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:26.070
<v Speaker 3>That is kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of fun because their coat was </v>

1200
00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:26.230
<v Speaker 3>signed because people who don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go to church go,</v>

1201
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 3>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

1202
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.640
<v Speaker 1>sounds better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway.</v>

1203
00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Sites in psychology together meshed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1204
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:37.910
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1205
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:43.190
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have this need to know </v>

1206
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.190
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1207
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:44.540
<v Speaker 1>These smart scientists are figuring it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1208
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:49.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that the world around because </v>

1209
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.710
<v Speaker 1>they shot definitely shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the reality.</v>

1210
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's the reality there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out things about matter.</v>

1211
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 1>They're figuring out things about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of reality,</v>

1212
00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.920
<v Speaker 1>but there's way more to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real big question isn't like,</v>

1213
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 1>how does this work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes this explode?</v>

1214
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:05.360
<v Speaker 1>What makes an atom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes the big bang?</v>

1215
00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.990
<v Speaker 1>The real question is what the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 1>all know?</v>

1216
00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's impossible with just science.</v>

1217
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take evolution and </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

1218
00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:20.090
<v Speaker 1>They're the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going on is we have all this </v>

1219
00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:20.090
<v Speaker 1>incredible power right now as a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

1220
00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:25.090
<v Speaker 1>but we're still in this crazy adolescent</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage of figuring out how to behave and </v>

1221
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 1>think and raise children to be normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

1222
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:29.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1223
00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:34.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange time when you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the power that people have to to </v>

1224
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 1>change the fucking world that we live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1225
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:40.040
<v Speaker 1>like with explosions and all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit that people have invented and</v>

1226
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:42.920
<v Speaker 1>how dumb people are as well at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1227
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 1>So many yummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1228
00:51:45.021 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that's the way the world is.</v>

1229
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:52.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's smart people out there and at </v>

1230
00:51:52.271 --> 00:51:52.271
<v Speaker 1>those smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both idiots like be around,</v>

1231
00:51:52.271 --> 00:51:57.251
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't ever been as big a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disparity between people who are </v>

1232
00:51:57.251 --> 00:52:00.641
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved and the people who aren't all </v>

1233
00:52:00.641 --> 00:52:03.011
<v Speaker 1>living in the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a lot of the </v>

1234
00:52:03.011 --> 00:52:05.770
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists are talking about how things </v>

1235
00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:08.381
<v Speaker 1>are going to go in which direction are </v>
<v Speaker 1>they going to go and they're talking </v>

1236
00:52:08.381 --> 00:52:09.080
<v Speaker 1>about the elite class of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart people.</v>

1237
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Some scientists say that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve,</v>

1238
00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.320
<v Speaker 1>evolve just like the time machine.</v>

1239
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:18.740
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some goods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be the super smart,</v>

1240
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.250
<v Speaker 1>like crazy genetically enhanced robot </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1241
00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why people wouldn't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

1242
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to think somehow or another,</v>

1243
00:52:26.061 --> 00:52:27.830
<v Speaker 1>the human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we are right now is what?</v>

1244
00:52:27.831 --> 00:52:30.830
<v Speaker 1>We're going to stay open and we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to become something else.</v>

1245
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:31.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna.</v>

1246
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:33.110
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Move on to something else,</v>

1247
00:52:33.111 --> 00:52:34.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what the fuck it is,</v>

1248
00:52:34.491 --> 00:52:39.491
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to stop right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hope that I get robot arms and </v>

1249
00:52:39.491 --> 00:52:42.540
<v Speaker 1>the people look at like other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they all bunch of different kinds </v>

1250
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.330
<v Speaker 1>of subspecies were they branched off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the humans themselves.</v>

1251
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:49.480
<v Speaker 1>We at one point in time have related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other kind of primate primate that </v>

1252
00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.450
<v Speaker 1>the chimps were related to and they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>went in different directions.</v>

1253
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck are we to assume that we're</v>

1254
00:52:52.451 --> 00:52:53.570
<v Speaker 1>going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's going to stop.</v>

1255
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.040
<v Speaker 1>The branch is going to stop here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1256
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody is.</v>

1257
00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I think that though some piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about,</v>

1258
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:01.400
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people fake bid.</v>

1259
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 1>We're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how we're staffed,</v>

1260
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.350
<v Speaker 1>where they can't even see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese chick I dated,</v>

1261
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:09.060
<v Speaker 1>her parents are like super short and add</v>
<v Speaker 1>ad.</v>

1262
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.540
<v Speaker 1>She just sprung up to like five foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

1263
00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of nowhere.</v>

1264
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's eating this chemically processed </v>

1265
00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:20.530
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden she gets huge and </v>

1266
00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:20.530
<v Speaker 1>she had big boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1267
00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:20.530
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1268
00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Your Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mom,</v>

1269
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:23.500
<v Speaker 1>it's super flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your dad is like a scrawny.</v>

1270
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Talked to a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1271
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 1>having more babies</v>

1272
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.140
<v Speaker 6>now there's more twins,</v>

1273
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.530
<v Speaker 1>chemicals they pumped in or though like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some female steroids.</v>

1274
00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was on purpose for sure.</v>

1275
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Check did embryos and it happens all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that people are like,</v>

1276
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.920
<v Speaker 1>they can't have a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1277
00:53:37.921 --> 00:53:38.760
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1278
00:53:38.761 --> 00:53:43.761
<v Speaker 1>I just want to have a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they eject the leads with a bunch of </v>

1279
00:53:43.761 --> 00:53:43.940
<v Speaker 1>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she's super fertile baby.</v>

1280
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:49.190
<v Speaker 1>He drops his load inside of her and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden you pop out a litter of </v>

1281
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.300
<v Speaker 1>puppies and they even put embryos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm saying.</v>

1282
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:56.510
<v Speaker 1>The actual embryo center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like old women who no longer have any </v>

1283
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.510
<v Speaker 1>air</v>

1284
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:59.370
<v Speaker 6>and their bodies and bodies are starting</v>
<v Speaker 6>to get used to having 12 kids at once </v>

1285
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:01.000
<v Speaker 6>since now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would a body be able to have 12 kids,</v>

1286
00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:01.780
<v Speaker 6>10 years old?</v>

1287
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping to see the turtle woman who </v>

1288
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.170
<v Speaker 1>like has all their kids on the beach and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then covers them up with fans.</v>

1289
00:54:08.171 --> 00:54:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a disturbing idea for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to think that there's going to be</v>

1290
00:54:11.141 --> 00:54:16.141
<v Speaker 1>two groups of humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent ones and more on one's </v>

1291
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:17.830
<v Speaker 1>literally literally be two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>species because people were worried that</v>

1292
00:54:17.831 --> 00:54:20.650
<v Speaker 1>they would be in the moron group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

1293
00:54:20.651 --> 00:54:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to talk about this.</v>

1294
00:54:22.331 --> 00:54:24.280
<v Speaker 1>This is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No bullshit.</v>

1295
00:54:24.281 --> 00:54:25.960
<v Speaker 1>People are gonna evolve together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>

1296
00:54:25.961 --> 00:54:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Help each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop thinking like that.</v>

1297
00:54:27.821 --> 00:54:29.980
<v Speaker 1>You're a pessimist really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1298
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.960
<v Speaker 1>watch that fucking news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1299
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:35.890
<v Speaker 1>You don't pay attention to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit that you hear people do.</v>

1300
00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:41.090
<v Speaker 1>You hear about people fucking their kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and going into stores with machine guns </v>

1301
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:44.500
<v Speaker 1>and you don't think that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere it some how possible that that</v>

1302
00:54:44.501 --> 00:54:49.501
<v Speaker 1>might be a separate subspecies of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually completely unrelated to like </v>

1303
00:54:49.501 --> 00:54:53.350
<v Speaker 1>a bill gates like so totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of time,</v>

1304
00:54:53.351 --> 00:54:53.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1305
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.200
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm cool with being on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower end.</v>

1306
00:54:56.201 --> 00:54:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1307
00:54:56.891 --> 00:55:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like the smartest dumb guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be all acts.</v>

1308
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Weakened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Savage.</v>

1309
00:55:01.121 --> 00:55:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1310
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:03.980

<v Speaker 1>The food.</v>

1311
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:07.000
<v Speaker 1>You might have a more fun and you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be getting more chicks.</v>

1312
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Smart chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get them to commit to a </v>

1313
00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:12.140
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very wary of you.</v>

1314
00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:12.880
<v Speaker 1>They want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1315
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.730
<v Speaker 1>You seem like a guy who's gonna like </v>
<v Speaker 1>abused my emotions,</v>

1316
00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:17.170

1318
00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:26.730
<v Speaker 1>The dumb ones are sometimes it's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun if you want a party partying with </v>

1319
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:30.271
<v Speaker 1>dumb people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes there's a lot more fun </v>

1320
00:55:30.271 --> 00:55:30.271
<v Speaker 1>partying with smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want to fucking cry.</v>

1321
00:55:30.271 --> 00:55:31.600

<v Speaker 1>share with us.</v>

1322
00:55:31.601 --> 00:55:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Smoke a joint and then fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1323
00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.820

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1324
00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:40.860
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're just a guy trying to have a </v>

1325
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:40.860
<v Speaker 1>good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have two options.</v>

1326
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:42.220
<v Speaker 1>One is a girl who's 23,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got out of college.</v>

1327
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.860
<v Speaker 1>She's out with all of her best friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're all drinking.</v>

1328
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

1329
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Or She's 31.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's smoking cigarettes.</v>

1330
00:55:48.911 --> 00:55:51.910
<v Speaker 1>She just broke up with her boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She thinks she might be pregnant.</v>

1331
00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck are you going to talk to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you going to talk to?</v>

1332
00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:01.500
<v Speaker 1>You want to talk to the smart check who </v>
<v Speaker 1>just graduated from college and she's </v>

1333
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:01.500
<v Speaker 1>not exactly sure what she's going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with her life and like,</v>

1334
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.170
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1335
00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I just want to dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we just have a drink and have some </v>

1336
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:07.350
<v Speaker 1>fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1337
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:09.220
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to have some fun,</v>

1338
00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.320
<v Speaker 1>just fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Studies.</v>

1339
00:56:11.321 --> 00:56:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Studies disagree with rat at age 27 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>45.</v>

1340
00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like a woman's social priority for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1341
00:56:19.361 --> 00:56:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Sexual Prime telling me a 23 year old is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not blowing you.</v>

1342
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Bullet</v>

1343
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.320
<v Speaker 5>were we're talking about dumb and smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1344
00:56:26.321 --> 00:56:31.321
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not talking about necessarily the </v>

1345
00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:31.321
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the age.</v>

1346
00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:35.100
<v Speaker 5>I think the chicks are hottest when they</v>
<v Speaker 5>were in their thirties because they </v>

1347
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:35.680
<v Speaker 5>became women and to know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying in our theoretical world</v>

1348
00:56:35.681 --> 00:56:40.681
<v Speaker 5>of two different subspecies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might be better off being king of </v>

1349
00:56:40.681 --> 00:56:43.501
<v Speaker 5>the retards because you get a lot of hot</v>
<v Speaker 5>chicks that are just like really easy </v>

1350
00:56:43.501 --> 00:56:47.251
<v Speaker 5>and fun to hang out with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas opposed to hanging out with a </v>

1351
00:56:47.251 --> 00:56:50.401
<v Speaker 5>lot of smart checks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're going to want a lot of </v>

1352
00:56:50.401 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 5>commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to have to have a </v>

1353
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:52.720
<v Speaker 5>relationship with the president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have a black president.</v>

1354
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.510
<v Speaker 5>It is the future now and I am the kick </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the retards.</v>

1355
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:58.240

<v Speaker 5>Those pictures were the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the equivalent of dub magazine.</v>

1375
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 5>That was the equivalent of MTV cribs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They were showing their bling.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'll want to plow.</v>

1383
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.470
<v Speaker 5>So hood rats that were saying,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you'd fall into a world maybe.</v>

1386
00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.640
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the only reason that guys could </v>
<v Speaker 5>get fat chicks.</v>

1387
00:58:06.641 --> 00:58:10.360
<v Speaker 5>It's because they had the gay powdered </v>
<v Speaker 5>wigs zine and it only fat chicks was the</v>

1388
00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:11.770
<v Speaker 5>same era.</v>

01:00:26.411 --> 01:00:27.800
<v Speaker 2>sign to men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's whatever the fuck it is.</v>

<v Speaker 5>check and you smell her and she smells </v>

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:31.670
<v Speaker 5>awesome and you want to eat her pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That feels good for her too.</v>

1507
01:03:31.671 --> 01:03:34.640
<v Speaker 5>That's like extra excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're into it.</v>

1508
01:03:34.641 --> 01:03:39.641
<v Speaker 5>She loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And is this just a burst of positive </v>

1509
01:03:39.641 --> 01:03:39.641
<v Speaker 5>energy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all good stuff,</v>

1511
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:46.330
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the fact that somehow or another </v>

1512
01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:47.700
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to talk about this </v>

1514
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.190
<v Speaker 5>discussed behind closed doors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just because people are afraid.</v>

1515
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:51.540
<v Speaker 5>They're afraid of their feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are afraid of emotions.</v>

1564
01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:57.301
<v Speaker 1>nightmare to be in a relationship with,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

1568
01:06:06.131 --> 01:06:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Because she's already done all the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

01:06:21.021 --> 01:06:23.140
<v Speaker 1>understand she's got a kid with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be realistic.</v>

1574

1576
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Those kind of screams that </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker's been ramping up for </v>

1577
01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:32.760
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1578
01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:36.930
<v Speaker 1>That's years worth of buildup to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point where that kind of crazy is </v>

1579
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1580
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't release that cracking on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second day of the relationship.</v>

1581
01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get that kind of crazy,</v>

1582
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:49.830
<v Speaker 1>you got to get to know each other for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long ass time to the point where you </v>

1583
01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:53.020
<v Speaker 1>feel like you could just be completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane with our fucking whore.</v>

1584
01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Hope you get raped by a puck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>niggers.</v>

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:59.650
<v Speaker 1>He starts talking super crazy talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been building up.</v>

1586
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I always like a sex thing between them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they was like roleplaying and she </v>

1587
01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:04.800
<v Speaker 1>took the recordings of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1588
01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:09.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a good conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking bitch.</v>

1589
01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:14.011
<v Speaker 1>You and you can hold your breath going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he could say if he was </v>

1590
01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Queen Phoenix type dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could say this is all performance </v>

1591
01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:20.310
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

1592
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.690
<v Speaker 1>That's all he has to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can say it's say to.</v>

1593
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>He could have a public apology and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this was ever meant to get get </v>

1594
01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:34.171
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I definitely took it too far and I </v>

1595
01:07:34.171 --> 01:07:36.931
<v Speaker 1>definitely think I got two and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character and said some shit that was </v>

1596
01:07:36.931 --> 01:07:37.390
<v Speaker 1>offensive and I never wanted people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear it.</v>

1597
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:42.540
<v Speaker 1>And all I was doing was exploring this </v>
<v Speaker 1>character that I was creating for a new </v>

1598
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:46.051
<v Speaker 1>role about a guy who is very wealthy man</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a Russian bride who was trying to </v>

1599
01:07:46.051 --> 01:07:46.810
<v Speaker 1>kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was crazy.</v>

1600
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.760
<v Speaker 1>So I was exploring this character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apologize.</v>

1601
01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:52.360
<v Speaker 1>And she took it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>

1616
01:08:24.851 --> 01:08:27.150
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never say some shit like that.</v>

1617
01:08:27.151 --> 01:08:32.151
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get banana sandwich that I fucking </v>

1618
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:32.151
<v Speaker 3>flipped my lid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would never like.</v>

1619
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's just not in my character </v>

1620
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't lie,</v>

1621
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.550
<v Speaker 3>like I wouldn't say anything racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I would say some crazy shit,</v>

1622
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:40.210
<v Speaker 3>but I could never make it to that level </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1623
01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:41.280
<v Speaker 3>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1624
01:08:41.281 --> 01:08:46.281
<v Speaker 3>whore cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then again I don't have any kids so </v>

1625
01:08:46.281 --> 01:08:47.680
<v Speaker 3>maybe it made him crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when a dog has a baby,</v>

1626
01:08:47.681 --> 01:08:49.880
<v Speaker 3>it starts to get super protective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Drew</v>

1627
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if Dr.</v>

1628
01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:56.260
<v Speaker 1>drew's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Dr drew says that he thinks that </v>

1629
01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.541
<v Speaker 1>what it is is an imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that Mel Gibson is something </v>

1630
01:08:58.541 --> 01:08:58.541
<v Speaker 1>wrong with his brain for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bipolar,</v>

1631
01:08:58.541 --> 01:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>because if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1632
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>if he's getting hammered all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the yelling at the cops about.</v>

1633
01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:06.820
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>drew said he was talking about recovery </v>

1634
01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:10.091
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that mel was in recovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>for alcohol and then he might've like </v>

1635
01:09:10.091 --> 01:09:12.140
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and fell off the wagon so he </v>
<v Speaker 1>might legitimately be crazy.</v>

1636
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like it sounds like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1637
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's not normal guy psycho.</v>

1638
01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:19.040
<v Speaker 3>He went hog up after he said his piece.</v>

<v Speaker 6>shit like that,</v>

1642
01:09:22.801 --> 01:09:26.150
<v Speaker 6>but maybe he just got so stuck into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>lethal weapon.</v>

1711
01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:17.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the guys are taking it and going on ruck</v>

1713
01:12:20.371 --> 01:12:21.970
<v Speaker 1>marches for like two or three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1714
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I thought the Japanese invented it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they invented it for.</v>

1715
01:12:25.111 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And then they tested it out on kamikaze </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilots.</v>

1716
01:12:27.421 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what I had read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe I had seen a documentary,</v>

1717
01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't really remember totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was something on the,</v>

1718
01:12:33.231 --> 01:12:38.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation of methamphetamines and it </v>

1719
01:12:38.231 --> 01:12:39.951
<v Speaker 1>was connected to kamikaze pilots at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they talk those guys into </v>

1720
01:12:39.951 --> 01:12:41.370
<v Speaker 1>going crazy and slamming their plane </v>
<v Speaker 1>into boats is that they were all men out</v>

1721
01:12:41.371 --> 01:12:45.540
<v Speaker 1>of their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which totally makes sense being in war.</v>

1722
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:46.760
<v Speaker 1>He imagined being over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1723
01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:51.820
<v Speaker 1>a batch army being in war and being left</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your fucking mind surrounded by </v>

1724
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.480
<v Speaker 1>other dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meth out of your fucking mind.</v>

1728
01:12:59.941 --> 01:13:01.380
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on everything.</v>

1729
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Probably like warrior culture.</v>

<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

1740
01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I assimilated with the Japanese fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would just be be and you know,</v>

1741
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:39.060
<v Speaker 1>18 Japanese fighters eating at a sumo </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant like that.</v>

1742
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:44.060
<v Speaker 1>It would be a bunch of Japanese dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You become more and more popular.</v>

1756
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Look at Sakharova.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't matter how many times he'd </v>

1757
01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:17.520
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever gave up on him.</v>

1758
01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like de la Hoya gets knocked the fuck </v>

1759
01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:21.860
<v Speaker 1>out two times in a row.</v>

1760
01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was going to go see him fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to say hang it up to La</v>

1761
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Jolla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Sakharova dude,</v>

1762
01:14:24.911 --> 01:14:27.250
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter how many times he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>his egg scramble cap.</v>

1763
01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:30.550
<v Speaker 1>People showed up to watch them fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>again and they cheered him like you were</v>

1764
01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:35.551
<v Speaker 1>respected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bit of those like brock lesnar versus </v>

1765
01:14:35.551 --> 01:14:38.150
<v Speaker 1>where he's getting his ass kicked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut back at when I love Japan just for k</v>

1766
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:43.200
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just loved that they put on k one </v>

1767
01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:43.810
<v Speaker 1>because if it wasn't for Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like real high level kickboxing,</v>

1768
01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:47.080
<v Speaker 1>especially in big heavyweights and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'd be nothing man.</v>

1769
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.770
<v Speaker 1>We're the fucker anybody putting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows in America.</v>

1770
01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are more shows and shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1771
01:14:51.731 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing televised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1772
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:58.201
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve built like the UFC from their </v>

1773
01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:03.270
<v Speaker 1>negative side where no one had that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve built about kickbox that anybody </v>

1774
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:07.390
<v Speaker 1>care to like a stupid movie with high </v>
<v Speaker 1>level guys don't man.</v>

1775
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:12.390
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The PKA that PKA karate shit in the </v>

1776
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:15.470
<v Speaker 1>eighties ruined kickboxing in America </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody got the concept bad.</v>

1777
01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Brad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen and sheds flippy kicks and that's </v>

1778
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:20.480
<v Speaker 1>like a super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1779
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.870
<v Speaker 1>d level athletes do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a big difference between kickboxing</v>

1780
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.380
<v Speaker 1>above the waist and kickboxing with leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks you add those leg kicks.</v>

1781
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:31.930
<v Speaker 1>It changes the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be way stronger.</v>

1782
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to be like a strong tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1783
01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Mentally could take it because my legs </v>
<v Speaker 1>are sore right now for this board.</v>

1784
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:39.880
<v Speaker 1>It's trading and I only took like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1785
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:40.530
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1786
01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:45.740
<v Speaker 1>with Shin pads on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the shamrock fight last </v>

1787
01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:46.390
<v Speaker 1>weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pedro Noguera.</v>

1788
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Shamrock got smashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But come on,</v>

1789
01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.020
<v Speaker 1>he should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1790
01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:54.910
<v Speaker 1>he finished him with a leg kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Final leg kick.</v>

1791
01:15:54.911 --> 01:15:57.580
<v Speaker 1>He sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is so hard to watch,</v>

1792
01:15:57.581 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch,</v>

1793
01:15:58.211 --> 01:15:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1794
01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.650
<v Speaker 1>because you could feel pedro with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree trunk legs.</v>

1795
01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Just the bone just slams into Ken's leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look on camera like that for </v>

1796
01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:07.900
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>

1797
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So the fight randy had a rehab his legs </v>
<v Speaker 1>for six fucking months.</v>

1798
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1799
01:16:12.761 --> 01:16:17.761
<v Speaker 1>He has like a weird vein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sticking from that fight showed is </v>

1800
01:16:17.761 --> 01:16:18.070
<v Speaker 1>random and from Pedro Huizar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both guys from his own,</v>

1801
01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:20.800
<v Speaker 1>because his old wood chop at you so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>

1802
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:23.380
<v Speaker 1>which such good technique and he's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking big.</v>

1803
01:16:23.381 --> 01:16:28.381
<v Speaker 1>He would jack guys legs so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would literally never be the same </v>

1804
01:16:28.381 --> 01:16:28.381
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>

1805
01:16:28.381 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you as a fighter.</v>

1806
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:32.470
<v Speaker 1>One of the rare also things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen in my life,</v>

1807
01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.940
<v Speaker 1>like I just remember the first time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked somebody real good in the ribs.</v>

1808
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I kicked him hard with my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boat was one of the most amazing </v>

1809
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:45.580
<v Speaker 1>feelings because I never knew boy ty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved to California and trade boy type</v>

1810
01:16:45.581 --> 01:16:47.560
<v Speaker 1>for real and kick the pads real hard.</v>

1811
01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.870
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember the guy came and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>threw a left.</v>

1812
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:52.900
<v Speaker 1>He threw a jab and I turned it kicked </v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

1813
01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:56.470
<v Speaker 1>When my Shin went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it went into his ribs.</v>

1814
01:16:56.471 --> 01:17:01.471
<v Speaker 1>I could feel everything booth right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there than almost unreal feeling of my </v>

1815
01:17:02.141 --> 01:17:07.141
<v Speaker 1>life because I felt his body change </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what I was doing and I was like,</v>

1816
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:09.070
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was.</v>

1817
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.620
<v Speaker 1>He was after that point of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was of done like he was like,</v>

1818
01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:17.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he let me beat him up high </v>

1819
01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:20.010
<v Speaker 1>because I kicked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got him a good one in the ribs and he </v>

1820
01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:20.810
<v Speaker 1>was done after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know your body,</v>

1821
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:24.740
<v Speaker 1>your body is meant to go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way to go.</v>

1822
01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:28.310
<v Speaker 1>There's some kicks from from taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really effective.</v>

1823
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:30.300
<v Speaker 1>The guys are using now at Connolly's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing back the.</v>

1824
01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:35.550
<v Speaker 1>It would piss me off because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1825
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.320
<v Speaker 1>You learn how to kick where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a hard one,</v>

1826
01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:44.321
<v Speaker 1>but it's so fast and it's not the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a boy Thai kick where you digging </v>

1827
01:17:44.321 --> 01:17:45.240
<v Speaker 1>through with the whole body and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more time,</v>

1828
01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.970
<v Speaker 1>fast hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

1829
01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.940
<v Speaker 1>It guys will piss me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kick me across the face real quick.</v>

1830
01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Guys are the guys who have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of both types of styles that</v>

1831
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.820
<v Speaker 1>have the ability to throw like </v>
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo,</v>

1832
01:17:55.821 --> 01:17:57.230
<v Speaker 1>fast kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sidekicks,</v>

1833
01:17:57.231 --> 01:18:02.231
<v Speaker 1>and turning sockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also have the Moitai leg kicks </v>

1834
01:18:02.231 --> 01:18:02.231
<v Speaker 1>and the more tight defense is important </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

1835
01:18:02.231 --> 01:18:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1836
01:18:02.791 --> 01:18:05.660
<v Speaker 1>you got gotta know how to fucking deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with those shins slamming into your arms</v>

1837
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.970
<v Speaker 1>because those pka guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never got kicked back.</v>

1838
01:18:07.971 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 1>That very rarely did God get his arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken the PKA,</v>

1839
01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.440
<v Speaker 1>but in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey juan blah,</v>

1840
01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:15.160
<v Speaker 1>brandon broke his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean frank shamrock on his arm broken.</v>

1841
01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:17.300
<v Speaker 1>You have to be aware of the leg kicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:22.610

<v Speaker 1>where you're writing pride ranch for him</v>

1844
01:18:22.611 --> 01:18:25.400
<v Speaker 1>to kick your arm off at soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also the shin.</v>

1845
01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:27.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those other guys just did not understand</v>

1846
01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:29.320
<v Speaker 1>the power of the shin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was going instead of.</v>

1848
01:18:30.641 --> 01:18:35.641

<v Speaker 1>if you take away a boy tie guy's leg </v>

01:18:35.641 --> 01:18:35.641
<v Speaker 1>kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and make it five.</v>

1850
01:18:35.641 --> 01:18:40.500
<v Speaker 1>PK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that style of above the waist lends </v>

1851
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.010
<v Speaker 1>itself for like slap fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:46.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't turn into like a real kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing match where you got another huge </v>

1853
01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.130
<v Speaker 1>element when you add knees and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead.</v>

1854
01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

1855
01:18:48.051 --> 01:18:48.970
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge element that,</v>

1856
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I thought about a lot and I,</v>

1857
01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I visualized that a lot and I always </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in my fights I always feel that </v>

1858
01:18:55.770 --> 01:19:00.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the end of my rage with my </v>

1859
01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:00.700
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

1860
01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:00.700
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel about what my legs.</v>

1861
01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1862
01:19:01.011 --> 01:19:06.011
<v Speaker 1>that's the end of my range will buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks and I figured that out the first </v>

1863
01:19:06.011 --> 01:19:06.320
<v Speaker 1>minute or two and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1864
01:19:06.321 --> 01:19:08.360
<v Speaker 1>that's where I could play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1865
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:09.910
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1866
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:16.180
<v Speaker 1>with that kickboxing big you got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand so close to each other and that </v>

1867
01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you can't really get a good dig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1868
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you can't really get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't exciting back out.</v>

1869
01:19:21.011 --> 01:19:26.011
<v Speaker 1>So it was like a lot of times guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing like rock 'em sock 'em robots </v>

1870
01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:26.720
<v Speaker 1>just up kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were some exciting fighters</v>

1871
01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:28.590
<v Speaker 1>like Don the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson was really exciting.</v>

1872
01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.220
<v Speaker 1>It was like a little kid crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1873
01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Alexio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought a leg kick style that was.</v>

1874
01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:40.610
<v Speaker 1>That was like kickstarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that transition when they were </v>

1875
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:40.610
<v Speaker 1>trying to put a leg kick fights on TV.</v>

1876
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I remember Don Wilson fought Alexco on </v>
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>

1877
01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was back in the desert sun.</v>

1878
01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>But Don Don the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson fucked up.</v>

1879
01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexia with leg kicks.</v>

1880
01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:50.810
<v Speaker 1>That's how he won that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1881
01:19:50.811 --> 01:19:52.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you take that away,</v>

1882
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:57.850
<v Speaker 1>there's not a big like spot where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can set up to make a hard kick to the.</v>

1883
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Aren't you surprised though that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't figured out a way to do some sort</v>

1884
01:20:01.911 --> 01:20:03.320

<v Speaker 1>this thing in post fight thing with </v>

1957
01:23:03.141 --> 01:23:03.141
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert Melendez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1958
01:23:03.141 --> 01:23:03.141
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you would be challenging </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the title right now?</v>

1959
01:23:03.141 --> 01:23:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Because Jake just abandoned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toughest fight with them.</v>

1960
01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Your fight with him was way tougher than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henderson's fight.</v>

1961
01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess I shouldn't say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really fair because Dan came </v>

1962
01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:19.831
<v Speaker 1>really close to putting them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one he came closer to jake is </v>

1963
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:21.970
<v Speaker 1>such a damn good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

1964
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.530
<v Speaker 1>he left us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went,</v>

1965
01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:23.950
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

1966
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But from that point on it was a route j </v>

1967
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:29.020
<v Speaker 1>dilla clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1968
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like Dan was having a hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>time making weight.</v>

1969
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It didn't seem like the normal Dan think</v>
<v Speaker 1>you worked for him and he looked,</v>

1970
01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.070
<v Speaker 1>he looked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda run down like,</v>

1971
01:23:39.190 --> 01:23:44.190
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think him making 85 might disagree </v>

1972
01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:44.190
<v Speaker 1>with you and I know this because I try </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

1973
01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:48.840
<v Speaker 1>He like walks around like one 97,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't like cutting that weight </v>

1974
01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well of course [inaudible] duties,</v>

1975
01:23:50.531 --> 01:23:52.260
<v Speaker 1>fucking 40 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does that,</v>

1976
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:57.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that at that age I'll get </v>

1977
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.270
<v Speaker 1>over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you get over it.</v>

1978
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:58.580
<v Speaker 1>You know he's a big gut weights weights </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse what?</v>

1979
01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

1980
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:04.360
<v Speaker 1>He like eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1981
01:24:04.361 --> 01:24:06.630
<v Speaker 1>but when it gets to be 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard to do.</v>

1982
01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1983
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he catches you with that fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1986
01:24:14.230 --> 01:24:16.990
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out vanderbilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay was left.</v>

1987
01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought got a strong core and we </v>

1988
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.010
<v Speaker 1>twists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1989
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.010
<v Speaker 1>It's super hard punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1996
01:24:32.711 --> 01:24:37.711
<v Speaker 1>I brought some attention to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I gave strikeforce a black eye a </v>

1997
01:24:37.711 --> 01:24:38.740
<v Speaker 1>little bit by buying cars of that whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2011
01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:11.740
<v Speaker 1>these guys totally did not understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>why you were getting all the blame for </v>

2012
01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.371
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the people who should have got </v>

2013
01:25:14.371 --> 01:25:14.371
<v Speaker 1>the blame with the people who let you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2014
01:25:14.371 --> 01:25:14.830
<v Speaker 1>No one should have let you in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an oversight.</v>

2015
01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:16.870
<v Speaker 1>They know that now it'll never happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2016
01:25:16.871 --> 01:25:18.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running a business is all about.</v>

2017
01:25:18.941 --> 01:25:21.280
<v Speaker 1>No one's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once that said,</v>

2018
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:25.030
<v Speaker 1>you know what it was was there was too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many fucking people in the octagon.</v>

2019
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:30.210
<v Speaker 1>There was you who was an unwanted person</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the octagon and you were into </v>

2020
01:25:30.210 --> 01:25:32.120
<v Speaker 1>interfering with someone who is getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>their glory days.</v>

2021
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.870
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was just badly run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was chaos.</v>

2022
01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.670
<v Speaker 1>You get a bunch of fucking dogs </v>

<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fuck man.</v>

2027
01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions run high after victories.</v>

2028
01:25:47.261 --> 01:25:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get crazy and I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got fucking kicked in the head while</v>

2031

<v Speaker 1>you were on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got fined for it and it's suspended.</v>

2032
01:25:57.670 --> 01:26:02.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long they suspend you for three </v>

2033
01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:02.670
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three months.</v>

2034
01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:04.000
<v Speaker 1>But if I would have argued with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been like dive</v>

2035
01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:06.290
<v Speaker 2>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't win because win.</v>

2036
01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.730
<v Speaker 2>If you win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sets a precedent.</v>

2037
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When is the last time anybody ever tried</v>

2038
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:14.960
<v Speaker 2>to get a fight overturned or protested </v>
<v Speaker 2>something ever and it came through.</v>

2039
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:18.050
<v Speaker 2>So any steroid tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2040
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:22.790
<v Speaker 2>A protest is a stoppage or something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it worked.</v>

2041
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:25.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't know nobody.</v>

2042
01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Benji radic protested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Scott fire resident wasn't.</v>

2043
01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

2044
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:32.810
<v Speaker 2>You thought it was stopped too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what man,</v>

2045
01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:37.040
<v Speaker 2>that people fuck up and it's a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that people fuck up,</v>

2046
01:26:37.041 --> 01:26:42.041
<v Speaker 2>but once they fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very rare that anyone can look </v>

2047
01:26:42.041 --> 01:26:43.610
<v Speaker 2>straight into the future with a positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset have usually works out for me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but what it is,</v>

2126
01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:26.910
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't think that it was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>important but bad.</v>

2127
01:29:26.911 --> 01:29:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I feel as a market difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2128
01:29:28.981 --> 01:29:29.880
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is,</v>

2129
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:32.640
<v Speaker 1>it's marketed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's marked marketed.</v>

2130
01:29:32.641 --> 01:29:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Rather if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2131
01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to people,</v>

2132
01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:37.550
<v Speaker 1>like doctors should tell you all you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need is a multivitamin.</v>

2133
01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:42.560
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know why it's because it's not </v>

2134
01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:42.560
<v Speaker 1>FDA approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2135
01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2136
01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:45.600
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean just because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>approved doesn't mean it doesn't work.</v>

2137
01:29:45.850 --> 01:29:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Or there's a lot of anecdotal evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>from people that are taken in that are </v>

2138
01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:52.020
<v Speaker 1>having pretty positive results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like nootropics that I take that</v>

2139
01:29:52.021 --> 01:29:54.270
<v Speaker 1>make your brain work better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole bunch of.</v>

2140
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Now give me some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2141
01:29:56.041 --> 01:30:01.041

<v Speaker 1>I'll write you down a list of all the </v>

2142
01:30:01.041 --> 01:30:03.501
<v Speaker 1>different sharing what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of different things </v>

2143
01:30:03.571 --> 01:30:08.571
<v Speaker 1>that are designed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Jew nootropics designed just to </v>

2144
01:30:08.571 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 1>increase cerebral activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2145
01:30:09.031 --> 01:30:14.031
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that we live in a culture </v>

2146
01:30:14.031 --> 01:30:15.390
<v Speaker 1>where it's not about living better </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

2147
01:30:15.450 --> 01:30:20.220
<v Speaker 1>It's about just living above the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>line like nobody wants to.</v>

2148
01:30:20.370 --> 01:30:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to be famous.</v>

2149
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to reframe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2151
01:30:25.381 --> 01:30:26.100

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2152
01:30:26.101 --> 01:30:26.970

2153
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't feel fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bad and wrong.</v>

2154
01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're not allowed to smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot and anywhere,</v>

2155
01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:32.850
<v Speaker 1>but California.</v>

01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How much does it drive you crazy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes who don't work out,</v>

2159
01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:42.891
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk shit on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on exercise and the importance of </v>

2160
01:30:42.891 --> 01:30:45.561
<v Speaker 1>keeping your body healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conversation view where a lot of people </v>

2161
01:30:45.781 --> 01:30:48.480
<v Speaker 1>are ignorant and then they take pride in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ignorance.</v>

2162
01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.630
<v Speaker 1>When your body works better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain feels better.</v>

2163
01:30:51.631 --> 01:30:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It all works better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing flows better.</v>

2164
01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:58.970
<v Speaker 1>So to zoom in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants to admit that that's </v>

2165
01:30:58.970 --> 01:30:58.970
<v Speaker 1>their issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2166
01:30:58.970 --> 01:31:01.440
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to admit that their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lack of exercise and everything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nobody needs to work out to.</v>

2170
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Comics are fucking famous of right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comics are always bitching and whining </v>

2171
01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:13.700
<v Speaker 1>and they just want to sleep til three </v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't do anything constantly that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Did you get positive reinforcement from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people laughing at that?</v>

<v Speaker 2>the mind and the willpower have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control the body.</v>

2300
01:36:14.970 --> 01:36:19.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more difficult when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it in a competition like </v>

2301
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:22.611
<v Speaker 2>mma or anything like boxing or Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything where it's a dude is trying to </v>

2302
01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:24.240
<v Speaker 2>kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's much more difficult.</v>

2303
01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But shit man,</v>

2304
01:36:26.610 --> 01:36:30.010
<v Speaker 2>think about the kind of willpower that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in the Tour de France now.</v>

2305
01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are just peddling,</v>

2306
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.010
<v Speaker 2>pumping the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing the same movement.</v>

2307
01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2308
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I look at like Lance Armstrong,</v>

2309
01:36:38.761 --> 01:36:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that must be the most boring,</v>

2310
01:36:40.741 --> 01:36:45.741
<v Speaker 2>intense motherfucker alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does some boring ass shit is just </v>

2311
01:36:45.741 --> 01:36:47.760
<v Speaker 2>peddling semi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not boring.</v>

2312
01:36:47.761 --> 01:36:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously the racing and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome countryside and shit and there's</v>

2313
01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:56.420
<v Speaker 2>all this attention and all this energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing the same thing for </v>

2314
01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:56.420
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

2315
01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:00.890
<v Speaker 2>That shit takes days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like who's the most boring and </v>

2316
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.890
<v Speaker 2>test?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker on earth.</v>

2317
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody get together,</v>

2318
01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:03.510
<v Speaker 2>get on a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the favor?</v>

2319
01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Like a county or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking accounting Olympic.</v>

2320
01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:10.830
<v Speaker 2>The guys just adding fucking bills up </v>
<v Speaker 2>for fucking six days straight.</v>

2321
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that like sheer </v>

2322
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:17.601
<v Speaker 2>tests of discipline that are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable for me because as a </v>

2323
01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:19.530
<v Speaker 2>fighter I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2324
01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:24.180
<v Speaker 2>serious discipline to get inside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>room at fight with other guys for,</v>

2325
01:37:24.181 --> 01:37:25.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least an hour.</v>

2326
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm doing that for at least an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>a day and pretty much my entire life </v>

2327
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other side,</v>

2328
01:37:31.950 --> 01:37:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I can't fill out a form without getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>distracted.</v>

2329
01:37:34.891 --> 01:37:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Like I bike fitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's the application?</v>

2330
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Was the funniest thing I've ever done </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm sitting there like,</v>

2331
01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:42.630
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put one more paper by faith,</v>

2332
01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to slap your fucking notary </v>
<v Speaker 2>public faith.</v>

2333
01:37:46.090 --> 01:37:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I like God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all day just sitting there.</v>

2334
01:37:48.691 --> 01:37:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated it.</v>

2335
01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:51.060
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2336
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:54.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different because I'm,</v>

2337
01:37:54.230 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very like when I look at a lawyer</v>

2338
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:56.940
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2339
01:37:56.941 --> 01:38:01.941
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking look at papers that read </v>

2340
01:38:01.941 --> 01:38:01.941
<v Speaker 1>shit all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2341
01:38:01.941 --> 01:38:02.640
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the exact same way.</v>

2342
01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm a retard when it comes to filling </v>
<v Speaker 1>out forms and shit and I get onto page </v>

2343
01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:07.830
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like someone's hitting me.</v>

2344
01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Someone's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's drowning me like,</v>

2345
01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.510
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is boring,</v>

2346
01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:16.510
<v Speaker 1>and I think what it is is like you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see,</v>

2347
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to put your brain on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>low and rpm where you're reading this </v>

2348
01:38:21.631 --> 01:38:26.631
<v Speaker 1>and reading that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure this is okay and make sure </v>

2349
01:38:26.631 --> 01:38:30.081
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And tell that to every teacher that I </v>

2350
01:38:30.081 --> 01:38:30.300
<v Speaker 1>have worked with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>square pegs in round holes,</v>

2351
01:38:30.301 --> 01:38:31.350
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

2352
01:38:31.351 --> 01:38:33.480
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big fucking problem with teachers is</v>

2353
01:38:33.481 --> 01:38:38.481
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to turn everybody into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>robot that assumes a job out there in </v>

2354
01:38:38.481 --> 01:38:42.651
<v Speaker 1>the world and there's people with unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities that could be artists and </v>

2355
01:38:42.651 --> 01:38:42.651
<v Speaker 1>no one recognized that.</v>

2356
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a martial artist or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>singer or a comedian,</v>

2357
01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:50.100
<v Speaker 1>no one looks at that as a viable path </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a job.</v>

2358
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:52.140
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So teachers want you to be able to get a</v>

2359
01:38:52.141 --> 01:38:54.560
<v Speaker 1>job they want you to do to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2360
01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.530
<v Speaker 1>what it takes to get a job at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>company and,</v>

2361
01:38:57.531 --> 01:38:58.440
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and move on.</v>

2362
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.920
<v Speaker 1>But let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I both people that you have to do,</v>

2363
01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you can't cater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't cater most schoolwork to </v>

2364
01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.631
<v Speaker 1>anyone who's an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there should be some way to </v>

2365
01:39:11.631 --> 01:39:13.941
<v Speaker 1>recognize when someone's unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There should be some way to recognize </v>

2366
01:39:13.941 --> 01:39:17.090
<v Speaker 1>and part of is that the kids don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any discipline and that's why they're </v>

2367
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:19.281
<v Speaker 1>fucking going squirrely and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't read and probably their home </v>

2368
01:39:19.281 --> 01:39:19.281
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to fix that.</v>

2369
01:39:19.281 --> 01:39:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could try to square out that fucking</v>

2370
01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:23.730
<v Speaker 1>round peg and and shoved me into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

2371
01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:26.290
<v Speaker 1>You're only gonna get so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're.</v>

2372
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:28.290
<v Speaker 1>But then you're trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2373
01:39:28.291 --> 01:39:33.291
<v Speaker 1>let's take all the wacky kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put them in a special class and take </v>

2374
01:39:33.291 --> 01:39:33.650
<v Speaker 1>all these kids who are definitely going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be construction workers.</v>

2375
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Put them in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2376
01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be other </v>

2377
01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.331
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be like some people don't want to be </v>

2378
01:39:41.331 --> 01:39:41.331
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2379
01:39:41.331 --> 01:39:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't want to be singers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there should be some sort of like an</v>

2380
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:48.570
<v Speaker 1>avenue that you find is interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go towards it in school.</v>

2381
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:49.610
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2382
01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:52.530
<v Speaker 1>but there's no viable option for class </v>
<v Speaker 1>clowns.</v>

2383
01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:56.970
<v Speaker 1>No viable options for disruptive kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but disruptive kids have something.</v>

2384
01:39:56.971 --> 01:39:58.350
<v Speaker 1>There's something there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2385
01:39:58.351 --> 01:40:00.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's undisciplined.</v>

2386
01:40:00.271 --> 01:40:02.160
<v Speaker 1>It fucks up the school for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

2387
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:07.270
<v Speaker 1>It may be and it's because one kid is </v>
<v Speaker 1>imbalanced because one can probably </v>

2388
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:10.911
<v Speaker 1>didn't get enough attention at home or </v>
<v Speaker 1>one kid had an abusive family and this </v>

2389
01:40:10.911 --> 01:40:14.181
<v Speaker 1>is the way he learned how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention by lashing out and focusing </v>

2390
01:40:14.181 --> 01:40:14.181
<v Speaker 1>attention on himself.</v>

2391
01:40:14.181 --> 01:40:18.530
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a kid who's willing to do some </v>

2392
01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:18.530
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit that other kids aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to do now.</v>

2393
01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

2394
01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:20.880
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to fix them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

2395
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:22.290
<v Speaker 1>You can teach him about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2396
01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:27.360
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of him doing that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how he's fucking it up for everybody </v>

2397
01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:30.591
<v Speaker 1>else in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That creates bad energy and this is </v>

2398
01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:32.181
<v Speaker 1>where we're going to focus your energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to take away that </v>

2399
01:40:32.181 --> 01:40:32.181
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that crazy energy that some people have.</v>

2400
01:40:32.181 --> 01:40:33.750
<v Speaker 1>It just needs to be filled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really bad.</v>

2401
01:40:33.751 --> 01:40:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I was the kid in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

2402
01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:38.780
<v Speaker 1>if you just applied yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>

2403
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:39.750
<v Speaker 1>you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2404
01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I did that completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

2405
01:40:42.450 --> 01:40:45.750
<v Speaker 1>I did fighting I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what people don't understand that</v>

2406
01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:49.050
<v Speaker 1>you apply yourself in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another that's not valid.</v>

2407
01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Like because some aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2408
01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:53.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it was art.</v>

2409
01:40:53.261 --> 01:40:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I used to draw a lot and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in martial arts.</v>

2410
01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.960
<v Speaker 1>So those were the two things and neither</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them seemed like any sort of a </v>

2411
01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:00.960

<v Speaker 2>Just look him in the eyes and eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2641
01:50:05.490 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 2>two face do to get a jolly read through </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Ip.</v>

2642
01:50:08.171 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Fucking stung.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He missed.</v>

2643
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:11.370
<v Speaker 2>He totally overthrew it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit me right in.</v>

2644
01:50:11.410 --> 01:50:14.420
<v Speaker 2>He was throwing it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God has stored is even worse.</v>

2645
01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Even abusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This store,</v>

2646
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:21.210
<v Speaker 2>his dad's going to get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So vicious wrist action.</v>

2647
01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Like softball in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2648
01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen those chicks that throw a </v>

2649
01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:32.240
<v Speaker 2>softball on the rubber band thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that big step throw harder on late night</v>

2650
01:50:34.121 --> 01:50:36.250
<v Speaker 2>tv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who the hell?</v>

2651
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Why are softball players watching espn </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how fast I throw that under hand.</v>

2652
01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably like 60 miles an hour,</v>

2653
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:44.380
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is they could do it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

2654
01:50:44.650 --> 01:50:47.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like a way more natural movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>than like a regular picture,</v>

2655
01:50:47.411 --> 01:50:49.660
<v Speaker 2>like a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit blows your shoulder,</v>

2656
01:50:50.970 --> 01:50:55.970
<v Speaker 2>your shoulder out at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's that they're </v>

2657
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:56.170
<v Speaker 2>throwing it harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the mechanism.</v>

2658
01:50:56.190 --> 01:51:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Are you waiting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you saying that there will be some </v>

2659
01:51:01.190 --> 01:51:03.361
<v Speaker 2>kid from little league up who's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught under head and think about this </v>

2660
01:51:03.361 --> 01:51:06.610
<v Speaker 2>with a big juiced out arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could throw that shit super hard.</v>

2661
01:51:06.611 --> 01:51:11.611
<v Speaker 2>Wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder because it doesn't seem like </v>

2662
01:51:11.611 --> 01:51:11.611
<v Speaker 2>girls can do that shit all day and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't blow their arm out,</v>

2663
01:51:11.611 --> 01:51:13.900
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing like that.</v>

2664
01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:15.970
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can get more velocity,</v>

2665
01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:21.320
<v Speaker 2>especially naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have like flexible tendency shit,</v>

2666
01:51:21.970 --> 01:51:26.970
<v Speaker 2>like a real flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I throw a fucking baseball by our </v>

2667
01:51:26.970 --> 01:51:27.910
<v Speaker 2>building's gonna blow out of it's side </v>
<v Speaker 2>like dad,</v>

2668
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:30.610
<v Speaker 2>the same thing he got out of ranger </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

2669
01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:33.280
<v Speaker 2>He didn't make it through ranger school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't throw the fucking grenade.</v>

2670
01:51:33.281 --> 01:51:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same Shit.</v>

2671

2672
01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:41.180

<v Speaker 2>You could see that shit online if you </v>

2673
01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:41.730
<v Speaker 2>watch his fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was it super raw bytes,</v>

2674

<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to break it off and I just </v>

2677
01:51:51.150 --> 01:51:51.970
<v Speaker 2>toughed it out and then I and I and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got up and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that same head that he was twisted.</v>

<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I go up to and I bet you they'll try</v>

2755
01:54:58.901 --> 01:54:59.240
<v Speaker 3>to gut.</v>

2756
01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you talk to Bj Penn,</v>

2757
01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:03.080
<v Speaker 5>Bj Penn talks about growing up in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>wire.</v>

2758
01:55:03.190 --> 01:55:05.040
<v Speaker 5>It's always says there's nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody just fights.</v>

2759
01:55:05.070 --> 01:55:07.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying if you're in that road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely more,</v>

2760
01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:12.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your face then you like if most </v>

2761
01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:13.270
<v Speaker 5>people going to the store and a suburban</v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood in Hawaii's,</v>

2762
01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:14.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>

2763
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:16.870
<v Speaker 5>No one's saying that Hawaii people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>douchebags.</v>

2764
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:18.650
<v Speaker 5>No one's saying that there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this a bad thing?</v>

2765
01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:19.250
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2766
01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:20.060
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2767
01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:22.760
<v Speaker 3>I can explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to find it there too.</v>

2768
01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:27.940
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of the culture that you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to throw down and there's a mutual like,</v>

2769
01:55:28.011 --> 01:55:29.900
<v Speaker 3>let's fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody shoots each other.</v>

2770
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's fight,</v>

2771
01:55:31.670 --> 01:55:33.260
<v Speaker 3>we'll fight and then we'll end it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2772
01:55:33.261 --> 01:55:36.350
<v Speaker 3>he kicked his ass and then you get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut wireless.</v>

2773
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kicked his ass.</v>

2774
01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:40.100
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2775
01:55:40.110 --> 01:55:41.540
<v Speaker 3>that it's just the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2776
01:55:41.690 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>and I think that pen came</v>

2777
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.680
<v Speaker 1>out of Bj Penn came out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of,</v>

2778
01:55:46.710 --> 01:55:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of competition is what started</v>

2779
01:55:49.381 --> 01:55:54.381
<v Speaker 1>as mma career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he was this bad motherfucker that </v>

2780
01:55:54.381 --> 01:55:56.421
<v Speaker 1>would step to anybody to fight anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took pride in that and that's why he </v>

2781
01:55:56.421 --> 01:55:58.410
<v Speaker 1>became an MMA champion when you're stuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a fucking island,</v>

2782
01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:03.860
<v Speaker 1>the big island and they ain't that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and everyone's just jammed in </v>

2783
01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:03.860
<v Speaker 1>together on this rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2784
01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:04.950
<v Speaker 1>tensions run high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

2785
01:56:04.951 --> 01:56:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I lived there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange,</v>

2786
01:56:06.811 --> 01:56:08.620
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different place because you're,</v>

2787
01:56:08.630 --> 01:56:12.300
<v Speaker 1>you're on this tiny island and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>small because even though it's a billion</v>

2788
01:56:12.301 --> 01:56:12.810
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2789
01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:17.130
<v Speaker 1>whatever circles you run in our tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit because everybody knows everybody,</v>

2790
01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:22.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be a lot of bullshit between </v>

2791
01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:23.991
<v Speaker 1>like dudes and girls and God pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined because everybody knows </v>

2792
01:56:24.031 --> 01:56:25.530
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that dude's faulconer.</v>

2793
01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone breaks up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes out with someone you know,</v>

2794
01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:30.930
<v Speaker 1>went to high school with that other guy.</v>

2795
01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2796
01:56:33.301 --> 01:56:34.920
<v Speaker 1>That causes tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's painful.</v>

2797
01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.000
<v Speaker 1>And you lived on the big island of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii who was like the main island.</v>

2798
01:56:39.001 --> 01:56:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smaller.</v>

2799
01:56:40.471 --> 01:56:42.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not a big island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big.</v>

2800
01:56:42.850 --> 01:56:45.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it's the.</v>

2801
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:47.940
<v Speaker 1>It was the biggest one that developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickest.</v>

2802
01:56:47.970 --> 01:56:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the times when I've gone to </v>

2803
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the big island,</v>

2804
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I went to Maui,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a why,</v>

2805
01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.430
<v Speaker 1>but when I went to a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2806
01:56:56.431 --> 01:56:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2807
01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:58.950
<v Speaker 1>what's the other one is a little small </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2808
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I forget what you look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2809
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:05.490
<v Speaker 1>but when I went to Honolulu I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

2810
01:57:05.491 --> 01:57:06.600
<v Speaker 1>this is like a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

2811
01:57:06.650 --> 01:57:07.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's America.</v>

2812
01:57:07.561 --> 01:57:09.360
<v Speaker 1>It's America on wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's America,</v>

2813
01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:12.690
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest city ever.</v>

2814
01:57:12.691 --> 01:57:14.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking blade runner movie.</v>

2815
01:57:14.490 --> 01:57:19.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you are in this city with this </v>

2816
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:19.500
<v Speaker 1>incredibly beautiful weather with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing ocean.</v>

2817
01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you are right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the city somehow or another,</v>

2818
01:57:22.021 --> 01:57:24.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that polluted the ocean's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that politically.</v>

2819
01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Just wash it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say is the best why park?</v>

2820
01:57:30.421 --> 01:57:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all like,</v>

2821
01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2822
01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.270
<v Speaker 1>like Lanai was gorgeous to the NIH is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really small.</v>

2823
01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I imagine it's even less developed.</v>

2824
01:57:39.481 --> 01:57:40.610
<v Speaker 1>The quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet.</v>

2825
01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:46.240
<v Speaker 1>There's one road I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only have like 3000 people that live </v>

2826
01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:46.490
<v Speaker 1>on 30 days or something tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

2827
01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:48.810
<v Speaker 1>and it's all like the staff throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

2828
01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:53.730
<v Speaker 1>they tend to look a little fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaced out.</v>

2829
01:57:53.731 --> 01:57:56.020
<v Speaker 1>When I was asking for directions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking three roads.</v>

2830
01:57:56.050 --> 01:57:57.720
<v Speaker 1>This bitch couldn't tell me how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the hotel.</v>

2831
01:57:57.950 --> 01:58:00.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what's.</v>

2833
01:58:02.050 --> 01:58:03.630

<v Speaker 1>is that about that.</v>

2834
01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:04.880
<v Speaker 1>When I lived in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

2835
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you what street to turn on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you to get to the Waikiki,</v>

2836

<v Speaker 1>you got to go down A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a seven,</v>

2837
01:58:11.110 --> 01:58:12.780
<v Speaker 1>11 at the end of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Road?</v>

2838
01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:14.700
<v Speaker 1>You take a right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep going down,</v>

2839
01:58:14.701 --> 01:58:16.590
<v Speaker 1>it turns into a one way and you take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2840
01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:19.400
<v Speaker 1>zippy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then use.</v>

2841
01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:24.660
<v Speaker 1>So you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows the world babes because </v>

2842
01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:25.150
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of bad leaky Makkah and</v>
<v Speaker 1>condom.</v>

2843
01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

2844
01:58:25.881 --> 01:58:30.881
<v Speaker 1>I like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fucking nobody even knows the name </v>

2845
01:58:30.881 --> 01:58:30.881
<v Speaker 1>of this road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>

2846
01:58:30.881 --> 01:58:35.151
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii is a part of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's five hours away on a fucking </v>

2847
01:58:35.151 --> 01:58:35.151
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska,</v>

2848
01:58:35.151 --> 01:58:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Alaska is not as crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least its landmass.</v>

2849
01:58:37.530 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 1>You can drive to Alaska in the middle of</v>

2850
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:42.490
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just like,</v>

2851
01:58:42.491 --> 01:58:44.530
<v Speaker 2>there's land in the middle of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

2852
01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Totally ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to have our ass covered on all</v>

2853
01:58:48.551 --> 01:58:50.510
<v Speaker 2>sides for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's,</v>

2854
01:58:50.511 --> 01:58:52.110
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible that we can call that </v>
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>

2855
01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:57.120
<v Speaker 2>It's five hours away on a fucking plane </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Guam is like sort of America </v>

2856
01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:58.060
<v Speaker 2>where a pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Puerto Rico.</v>

2857
01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico is like sort of Puerto Rico </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like considered America though taxes.</v>

2858
01:59:04.961 --> 01:59:09.961
<v Speaker 2>So they don't want to be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you allowed to be from Puerto Rico </v>

2859
01:59:09.961 --> 01:59:10.960
<v Speaker 2>and just immigrate to America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think so too.</v>

2860
01:59:11.590 --> 01:59:12.790
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's so many Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ricans,</v>

2861
01:59:13.050 --> 01:59:14.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you go to New York.</v>

2862
01:59:14.690 --> 01:59:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh for sure.</v>

2863
01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Don Gavin's is fucking comedian from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston old legend.</v>

2864
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:20.460
<v Speaker 2>He used to have this joke about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

<v Speaker 2>real fast talking [inaudible] posten </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

2866
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:22.710

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2867
01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I went to Puerto Rican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That didn't.</v>

2868

2954
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2955
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the Deepak Chopra?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris,</v>

2956
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:30.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>debates with them.</v>

2957
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I forget the dude's name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Deepak Chopra had this crazy cat </v>

2958
02:03:36.010 --> 02:03:38.180
<v Speaker 1>lady with them and they're debating God </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's some brilliant shit,</v>

2959
02:03:38.181 --> 02:03:39.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris is a brilliant,</v>

2960
02:03:39.741 --> 02:03:44.741
<v Speaker 1>brilliant motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote that really good book letters </v>

2961
02:03:44.741 --> 02:03:45.590
<v Speaker 1>to a Christian nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a skeptic atheist character,</v>

2962
02:03:45.591 --> 02:03:49.400
<v Speaker 1>but a really reasonable dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen Dawkins versus A.</v>

2963
02:03:49.401 --> 02:03:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a.</v>

2964
02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>He did a few where he was kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap buck show,</v>

2965
02:03:53.610 --> 02:03:58.610
<v Speaker 1>oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't like his arguments against </v>

2966
02:03:58.610 --> 02:03:58.610
<v Speaker 1>deep pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very short.</v>

2967
02:03:58.610 --> 02:03:59.870
<v Speaker 1>The clip that he used online or in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary is very short.</v>

2968
02:03:59.870 --> 02:04:02.960
<v Speaker 1>It was just mostly mocking depok,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when Deepak talked to them,</v>

2969
02:04:02.961 --> 02:04:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Deepak was actually pretty reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what he was saying.</v>

2970
02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:10.871
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about states of mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mood and the ability to help </v>

2971
02:04:10.871 --> 02:04:11.780
<v Speaker 1>diseases and cause diseases like bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>states of mind court,</v>

2972
02:04:11.781 --> 02:04:14.720
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think I agree with negative</v>

2973
02:04:14.721 --> 02:04:19.721
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like negative energy is manifested </v>

2974
02:04:19.721 --> 02:04:19.940
<v Speaker 1>itself in stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stress manifests itself in misfiring.</v>

2975
02:04:19.941 --> 02:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>So I've had injuries before where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury keeps.</v>

2976
02:04:23.630 --> 02:04:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't even notice because like I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>got caveman brain where I get hurt and I</v>

2977
02:04:27.741 --> 02:04:29.450
<v Speaker 1>just ignore that part of my body right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2978
02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll step on something and have a bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot and just keep ignoring it until I </v>

2979
02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:34.580
<v Speaker 1>have to go to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2980
02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>So I kept doing that but I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize the puts stress on your</v>

2981

<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're best friends after that.</v>

3045
02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Like it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was sometimes a bark at you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They just want to get close to you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure you're okay.</v>

3047
02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:18.740

<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

3048
02:07:18.750 --> 02:07:21.640
<v Speaker 3>I barked at him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he barked at me and then I went,</v>

<v Speaker 5>dogs as pets.</v>

3051
02:07:26.581 --> 02:07:30.110
<v Speaker 5>But it's such a pain in the ass because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they just want to fight other dogs.</v>

3052
02:07:30.111 --> 02:07:32.580
<v Speaker 5>So they're always.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make sense.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can.</v>

3058
02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:42.670
<v Speaker 6>It's like smelling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They asked if a dog,</v>

3059
02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:46.420
<v Speaker 6>if you let them smell this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>smell your asshole.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You totally respect ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see a big dog.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Cool.</v>

3062

<v Speaker 6>your hand never happened.</v>

3063
02:07:56.290 --> 02:07:59.200
<v Speaker 6>So they go into smell mode.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

3064
02:07:59.201 --> 02:08:00.110
<v Speaker 6>they're not going to bite it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3065
02:08:00.111 --> 02:08:02.240
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you're being honest.</v>

3066
02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:03.820
<v Speaker 6>It was actually advise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally,</v>

<v Speaker 6>let it smell it.</v>

3070
02:08:09.911 --> 02:08:14.911
<v Speaker 6>Make sure it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your theory is faulting you to try it </v>

3071
02:08:14.911 --> 02:08:14.911

3072
02:08:14.911 --> 02:08:16.210
<v Speaker 6>When they see other dogs and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 6>attack you,</v>

3073
02:08:16.211 --> 02:08:18.170
