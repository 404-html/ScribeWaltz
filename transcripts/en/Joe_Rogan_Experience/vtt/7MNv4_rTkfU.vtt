37
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.000

42
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>camp just for camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camp outside once fights over and</v>

44
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>you were the first guy that I ever used</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an example of a to break that old</v>

45
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>myth that you can't have sex before</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

46
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's out the window for sure.</v>

47
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would talk about it all the time.</v>

48
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

49
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty much yet</v>

50
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>your logic made sense to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to think about it.</v>

51
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be thinking about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get it out of the way.</v>

52
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's over what do,</v>

53
00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have fuel for the next six weeks and</v>

54
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>it's going to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that was a myth that it</v>

55
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>made you weak?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

56
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems odd.</v>

58
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then whenever the spy you more so</v>

59
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.340

65
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out.</v>

77
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 2>that error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was a big part of my youth.</v>

80
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a change of things because when</v>

81
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Larry Holmes was the champ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a boxing fan,</v>

82
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>I loved Larry Holmes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's that cover.</v>

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.750
<v Speaker 2>You were 19 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

84
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Larry Holmes was the champ as a</v>

85
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 2>boxing fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you still got that stuff,</v>

86
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can still get those sports</v>

87
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 2>illustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the Internet.</v>

88
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 2>You can find it on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how Jamie got it.</v>

89
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had that sports illustrated,</v>

90
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>but when Larry Holmes was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a champ,</v>

91
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 2>as a boxing fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciated him.</v>

92
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I knew he was a great fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

93
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.601
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:51.840
<v Speaker 2>we would get together with friends and</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch like the,</v>

95
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Michael spinks fight with Larry</v>

96
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Holmes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When spinks beat him for the title.</v>

97
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 2>It was a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't a big deal.</v>

98
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Culturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 2>People didn't care as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you came around and when you</v>

100
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 2>came around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this sudden everybody's watching</v>

101
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heavyweight boxing wasn't,</v>

102
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't boring again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the,</v>

103
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 2>the most crazy exciting thing in sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When your fights would go on,</v>

104
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 2>it would be about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I pay for this cause how long is</v>

105
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 2>this going to last?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like dad never.</v>

106
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.300
<v Speaker 2>We had people telling me about that</v>

107
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.340
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all chipped in and took a fight on</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

109
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 3>Think about it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

110
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.723
<v Speaker 3>sometimes</v>

111
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.203
<v Speaker 1>when it comes from out</v>

112
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 3>realization of the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget that I'm that guy.</v>

113
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 3>I forget that train that hard and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>became a fighter and stuff.</v>

114

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.200

116
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much like a blur</v>

117
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.050
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine what it would be like</v>

118

<v Speaker 2>to be 19 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years old at that fucking famous.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but it was just what to mind,</v>

<v Speaker 3>issue from there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>themselves under that kind of pressure.</v>

134
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.253

<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now,</v>

154
00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:20.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand this is just what it is.</v>

155
00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:22.350
<v Speaker 3>It is what it is and you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to stop it.</v>

156
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen you at the UFC before.</v>

157
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.160
<v Speaker 2>You're very calm around people on people</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbing at,</v>

158
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 2>you want to take pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

159
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.610
<v Speaker 2>just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to see is awesome cause</v>

160
00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 2>everybody's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

162
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:39.100
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a wild environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of beeps going to do</v>

163
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:41.320
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think who could be,</v>

164
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he does whatever the fuck he wants</v>

165
00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:44.980
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I think,</v>

166
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I think that goes probably the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>lightweight of all time.</v>

167
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.290
<v Speaker 2>He's a monster credible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

168
00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:52.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's probably gonna have some</v>

169
00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Speaker 2>fights at 170 pounds eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'd imagine at 155.</v>

170
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:57.820
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:00.490
<v Speaker 2>there's good fights for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Ferguson's a great fight for him.</v>

172
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

173
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.920
<v Speaker 2>really interested in seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

174
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm really interested in seeing him</v>
<v Speaker 2>going up a really interesting to see him</v>

175
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:08.980
<v Speaker 2>fight at 170 pounds from the fight.</v>

176
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

177
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.410
<v Speaker 2>tyron Woodley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the champ at 170 that that would</v>

178
00:07:14.411 --> 00:07:16.210
<v Speaker 2>be an insane fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George St Pierre.</v>

179
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 2>If he decided to come back and make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big super fight,</v>

180
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:21.760
<v Speaker 2>that would be an insane fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 170 has a lot of opportunities</v>

181
00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:23.980
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think 155 does too.</v>

182
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 2>They just have to figure out who's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight him.</v>

183
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.810
<v Speaker 2>He's an international superstar now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

184
00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:30.790
<v Speaker 2>could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the way he smashed connor</v>

185
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.910
<v Speaker 2>connor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a superstar ready that the way it</v>

186
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:37.450
<v Speaker 2>could be one and did it so dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's,</v>

187
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I think he's through the roof now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when people,</v>

188
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.880
<v Speaker 2>when he comes back and people see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper view numbers of his fights are</v>

189
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:46.720
<v Speaker 2>going to realize how huge this guy is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's so interesting.</v>

190
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.330
<v Speaker 2>He's very humble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

191
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.430
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very polite,</v>

192
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.220
<v Speaker 2>very well spoken and very religious guy.</v>

193
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Lives with his family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives with his parents,</v>

194
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.570
<v Speaker 2>lives with his parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his family,</v>

195
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm not speaking out of school.</v>

196
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously it doesn't have to for</v>

197
00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:06.730
<v Speaker 2>money and he's rich as shit now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's just a monster.</v>

198
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:08.650
<v Speaker 2>The best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best grappler I've ever seen inside the</v>

199
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:11.020
<v Speaker 2>155 pound division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just smashes people.</v>

200
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.510
<v Speaker 2>He's thinking about Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

201
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.970
<v Speaker 2>W in what way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was still his skill.</v>

202
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.740
<v Speaker 2>He's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

203
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.280
<v Speaker 2>The best ever it using distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows distance better than anybody.</v>

204
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:25.120
<v Speaker 2>He's a master at knowing when he can hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you can't hit him with watching</v>

205
00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:26.110
<v Speaker 2>them fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

206
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:28.030
<v Speaker 2>He's been fighting as much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's back.</v>

207
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.650
<v Speaker 2>He just one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one the title again,</v>

208
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.930

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of weeks ago.</v>

210
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Bacon Peyto it was Daniel Cormier,</v>

211
00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Aka relinquish his title and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

212
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.530
<v Speaker 2>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

213
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Like call me a is the champ because Jon</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones tested positive for something.</v>

214
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:48.430
<v Speaker 2>So they stripped him and then call me a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>became the champ.</v>

216
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.420

<v Speaker 2>I think they'll probably fight again</v>

217
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.280
<v Speaker 2>whether they fight again and heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 2>or light heavy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

219
00:08:54.971 --> 00:08:56.120
<v Speaker 2>I core main Jon Jones</v>

220
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 1>and Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to keep going,</v>

221
00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 1>but he says he wants to retire soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 40,</v>

222
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

223
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>It feel looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks great.</v>

224
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Especially at heavyweight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight.</v>

225
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have to cut weight.</v>

226
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>He's got so much strength and s two so</v>
<v Speaker 1>agile,</v>

227
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>he's such a unbelievable wrestler too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean his wrestling skill,</v>

228
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 1>his skill level and understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling so high,</v>

229
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>so above most p anybody find out finally</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing John Jones?</v>

230
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:21.700
<v Speaker 1>He dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

231
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how good John Is.</v>

232
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 1>John's dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

233
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 1>He's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

234
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 1>it just sucks that he's had so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversies in his life,</v>

235
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'm hoping he puts all that shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind him.</v>

236
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever spoken with him about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

237
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Never been his personal life and live</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we met before and talk.</v>

238
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 1>But you're a guy who's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

239
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 1>when you went through legal problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

240
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.240
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you overcame,</v>

241
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you came out of it.</v>

242
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think would think a guy like him could</v>

243
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 1>benefit a lot from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just so difficult and you're</v>

244
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>throwing fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they have to go through something</v>

245
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

246
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.600
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause sometimes people,</v>

248
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will survive situations like that</v>

249
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>because they're so wild and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a good time too much in the party</v>

250
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 1>and the champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to have to come to an end.</v>

251
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.620
<v Speaker 1>That stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't bring it to the next club,</v>

252
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 1>bring it could come to his own and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might not like that way then.</v>

253
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think for a guy like him,</v>

254
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe getting in trouble was a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing if only if you learn from</v>

255
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.880
<v Speaker 1>experiences like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

256
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I think I was just a wild guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really a wild guy.</v>

257
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I look at myself now and I feel myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I spent those trips and those psych</v>

258
00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:31.830
<v Speaker 1>wards and thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that all about?</v>

259
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with me back then,</v>

260
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

261
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And I must say I was really disturbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

262
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.660
<v Speaker 4>But you're somebody who got to the point</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you got like,</v>

263
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 4>it's really fascinating because I know</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>

264
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.040
<v Speaker 4>you're a public figure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

265
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:47.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been able to watch you my whole</v>

266
00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:49.750
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You went through all that stuff and then</v>

267
00:10:49.751 --> 00:10:53.530
<v Speaker 4>you got to this point where you are very</v>
<v Speaker 4>self reflective and you look at,</v>

268
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.200
<v Speaker 4>you are able to comment on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think most,</v>

269
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean most people regardless of whether</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're famous or not,</v>

270
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.210
<v Speaker 4>just still don't get to that point where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're able to look back and examine</v>

271
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 4>who they were and doing wild shit and</v>
<v Speaker 4>with ruth</v>

272
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.840
<v Speaker 1>honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what's so great reflecting itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to discover who you really are.</v>

274
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're 20 years old and all of a</v>

275
00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:18.020
<v Speaker 1>sudden you're the heavyweight champion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world and just a few years ago</v>

276
00:11:18.021 --> 00:11:21.170
<v Speaker 1>you were poor and now all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the king of the world.</v>

277
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.220
<v Speaker 1>That's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not so really crave that.</v>

278
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was unable to handle it.</v>

279
00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't expecting that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a really sucker punch right</v>

280
00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:32.180
<v Speaker 1>there and the real sucker punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

281
00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:33.920

<v Speaker 1>animated.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I didn't see him arrive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we go back to the green after the</v>

412
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I walk offstage and he grabs me and he</v>

418
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:05.630

419
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:07.970
<v Speaker 4>like if at the time had passed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I opened the door,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the entire staff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire staff is lined up at the door to</v>

421
00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:15.320

422
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:16.130
<v Speaker 4>the group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked about boxing about life.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was fascinating.</v>

426
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.390
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I really appreciated</v>
<v Speaker 4>about you as a fighter was like,</v>

427
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:32.570
<v Speaker 4>that you really knew that you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting on a show.</v>

483
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:25.290

<v Speaker 3>Cause the guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:22:44.691 --> 00:22:48.290
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Michael Irvin once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was explaining it to me that when</v>

571
00:22:48.291 --> 00:22:52.460
<v Speaker 1>children grow up in high stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments that their genes are wired</v>

572
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.530
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a propensity towards violence,</v>

573
00:22:54.531 --> 00:22:56.300
<v Speaker 1>that if they're normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's normal,</v>

574
00:22:56.301 --> 00:22:57.960
<v Speaker 1>if it's around them all the time when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

575
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.750
<v Speaker 1>when they're growing up and when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the womb.</v>

576
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

577
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.740
<v Speaker 1>When their mothers under extreme stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they live in a bad neighborhood and</v>

578
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for some people like yourself</v>

579
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:12.080
<v Speaker 1>that did grow up in an environment like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to ever reached where you're at</v>

580
00:23:12.081 --> 00:23:13.820
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a place of peace.</v>

581
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.120
<v Speaker 1>And if you can do that through marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is,</v>

582
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation,</v>

583
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do to get there,</v>

584
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.310
<v Speaker 1>like we should be happy that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>get there.</v>

617
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.300

621
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:06.910
<v Speaker 2>molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that subtle change for some reason</v>

622
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.190
<v Speaker 2>takes away the visuals you've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular dmt to,</v>

623
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:11.030
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

624
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Regular DMT is rich with visuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very strained,</v>

625
00:25:14.181 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 2>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>colorful,</v>

626
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Described visuals.</v>

627
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

628
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if inconceivable,</v>

629
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.300
<v Speaker 1>inconceivable is best with here</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewable.</v>

630
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.160
<v Speaker 1>But I tried to explain it to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

631
00:25:24.161 --> 00:25:25.660
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

632
00:25:25.661 --> 00:25:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the words to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I would say.</v>

633
00:25:28.181 --> 00:25:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I've done a terrible job explaining it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to everybody.</v>

634
00:25:30.611 --> 00:25:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Every time I've tried it just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

635
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.121
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

636
00:25:34.121 --> 00:25:35.470
<v Speaker 1>all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

637
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.230
<v Speaker 1>they give you perspective almost like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dying.</v>

638
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.600
<v Speaker 1>You have your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your submissive,</v>

639
00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.920
<v Speaker 1>you're humble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

640
00:25:41.921 --> 00:25:45.310
<v Speaker 1>You're vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're invincible still in awe,</v>

641
00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.110
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that weird feeling,</v>

642
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.990
<v Speaker 1>but you feel like you're part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe when you're,</v>

643
00:25:49.991 --> 00:25:52.870
<v Speaker 1>you're separate from your ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize this whole thing.</v>

644
00:25:52.871 --> 00:25:55.590
<v Speaker 1>You're a part of this whole thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing is unstoppable.</v>

645
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a gigantic,</v>

646
00:25:57.641 --> 00:26:00.160
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all encompassing,</v>

647
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.220
<v Speaker 1>almost like a living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

648
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:04.960
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where I also realize too,</v>

649
00:26:04.961 --> 00:26:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I have to go into that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize how insignificant you are</v>

650
00:26:08.061 --> 00:26:10.000
<v Speaker 1>sometimes without your ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

651
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.460
<v Speaker 1>You know you made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you not really much that you</v>

652
00:26:12.461 --> 00:26:14.440
<v Speaker 1>really thought you were?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

653
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:15.760
<v Speaker 1>you are and you aren't.</v>

654
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you are in everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

655
00:26:18.101 --> 00:26:20.500
<v Speaker 2>you go places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a dramatic effect on people.</v>

656
00:26:20.501 --> 00:26:22.750
<v Speaker 2>You mean a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He mean a lot to those people that you</v>

657
00:26:22.751 --> 00:26:24.520
<v Speaker 2>run into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean a lot to the people that you</v>

658
00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:29.030
<v Speaker 2>love and that love you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we all do and when the no one,</v>

659
00:26:29.031 --> 00:26:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

660
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.660
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all relative.</v>

661
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.080
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one has a replaceable,</v>

662
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:39.280
<v Speaker 2>but everyone is special to someone or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and at least to themselves,</v>

663
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.760
<v Speaker 2>but we're all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all part of this weird,</v>

664
00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic organism.</v>

665
00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the human race,</v>

666
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought that you said it.</v>

667
00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.330
<v Speaker 3>My mental cus d'amato hit objective with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the think of nothing.</v>

668
00:26:50.331 --> 00:26:52.510
<v Speaker 3>You're nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing is nothing but the objective,</v>

669
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.370
<v Speaker 3>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the psychological warfare.</v>

670
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:56.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing matters.</v>

671
00:26:56.691 --> 00:26:57.471
<v Speaker 3>You're nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

672
00:26:57.471 --> 00:27:00.620
<v Speaker 3>My only thing that matters is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>objective and getting to accomplishing</v>

673
00:27:00.621 --> 00:27:03.140
<v Speaker 3>that objective by going to these methods</v>
<v Speaker 3>of boxing.</v>

674
00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever stop and think about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>fortunate was you ran into that guy?</v>

675
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>till this day,</v>

676
00:27:09.531 --> 00:27:11.900
<v Speaker 3>I really don't understand that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did this happen?</v>

677
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Because so many lives and by the time I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was born,</v>

678
00:27:14.571 --> 00:27:16.880
<v Speaker 3>he was 66 years old by the time I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>born.</v>

679
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:17.803
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

680
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people could,</v>

681
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't even explain it.</v>

682
00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a magnificent individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an amazing guy,</v>

683
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:30.840
<v Speaker 2>amazing part of boxing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

684
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:35.340
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented grasp of the mindset</v>

685
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:37.960
<v Speaker 2>required for combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing that,</v>

686
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.390
<v Speaker 2>that always really stood out about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was a guy that was so,</v>

687
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.260
<v Speaker 2>he was so well versed in the mindset</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would listen to his,</v>

688
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 2>his speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he would talk when he would talk</v>

689
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 2>about you and he would talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing.</v>

690
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 2>We talk about fear and about fear can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fire can cook your food,</v>

691
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 2>your food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it can burn your house down and you</v>

692
00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:58.500
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to control it.</v>

693
00:27:58.501 --> 00:27:59.760
<v Speaker 2>And when he would describe it like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

694
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:03.360
<v Speaker 2>it would be so enlightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was such a man of wisdom that when he</v>

695
00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:05.310
<v Speaker 2>would describe things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would sink in.</v>

696
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 2>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

697
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.400
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody could say the same thing,</v>

698
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.390
<v Speaker 2>but the w w with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had so much</v>

<v Speaker 2>all this when you're 20 years old,</v>

747
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a lot of classic rock for</v>

748
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

749
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I've been listening to a lot of Kanye</v>
<v Speaker 1>West over the last few weeks.</v>

750
00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what he talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye.</v>

751
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's talking about a lot of crazy</v>

752
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:11.140
<v Speaker 1>shit he's taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually talked about dmt in one of</v>

753
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:13.150
<v Speaker 1>his recent songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think he did that before.</v>

754
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

755
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Well I know he's friends with kid cuddie</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid cut.</v>

756
00:30:17.661 --> 00:30:21.010
<v Speaker 1>He'd been in here and kid cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's had some psychedelic experiences.</v>

757
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you go to is just,</v>

758
00:30:22.651 --> 00:30:24.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't want to do nothing else</v>

759
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:25.564
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

760
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it puts it all in the perspective.</v>

761
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.250
<v Speaker 1>It lets you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

762
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:35.110
<v Speaker 1>as much as this thing seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>important is all temporary and you're a</v>

763
00:30:35.111 --> 00:30:39.880
<v Speaker 1>part of forever and it also allows you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become comfortable with death.</v>

764
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

765
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:46.470
<v Speaker 1>You know who said that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Hagman remember that Guy Dallas Jr</v>

766
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Salad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did an interview with CNN and I dream</v>

767
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:49.930
<v Speaker 1>of Jeannie as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

768
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:52.390
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sprung it on him on CNN.</v>

769
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Once he was talking about how he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>acid,</v>

770
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.910
<v Speaker 1>he took a big dose acid and he's never</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about death ever again.</v>

771
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:03.030
<v Speaker 1>That it just alleviated his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his worry about passing on as,</v>

772
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:04.300
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This if that could,</v>

773
00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I felt the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel I haven't doesn't matter anymore.</v>

774
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think dnt even more specifically</v>

775
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:10.860
<v Speaker 1>because they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

776
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.820
<v Speaker 1>what that does fake the mine that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What causes the effect of mine that way</v>

777
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.070
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>

778
00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 1>They didn't mean Gig visioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visualize everything.</v>

779
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't totally know.</v>

780
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.550
<v Speaker 1>They know that your brain makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that your body makes it,</v>

781
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:27.220
<v Speaker 1>they should say and they know that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced in your liver and their lungs</v>

782
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 1>and there's some evidence now cause they</v>
<v Speaker 1>found it in rats,</v>

783
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that the pineal gland produces it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

784
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:36.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the third eye of eastern</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysticism that Glenn actually in rats,</v>

785
00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Speaker 1>they've proven produces dmt and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it does so on people too.</v>

786
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:40.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I did,</v>

787
00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do it again and again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

788
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And if they shouldn't do too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife with me,</v>

789
00:31:45.341 --> 00:31:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

790
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.370
<v Speaker 1>grasp what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I feeling,</v>

791
00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:50.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did this in a weird way,</v>

792
00:31:50.651 --> 00:31:53.260
<v Speaker 1>like humbled you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should listen to the</v>

793
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 1>people say you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know too much.</v>

794
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I think you should do it as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

795
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought I agree with too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

796
00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could handle it.</v>

797
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.910
<v Speaker 1>If you can handle being like Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can handle doing dmt issues,</v>

798
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.790
<v Speaker 1>emt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

799
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

800
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

801
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not something you just do</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day everyday,</v>

802
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:10.710
<v Speaker 1>but you can learn a lot from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

803
00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:13.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very beneficial and very strange</v>

804
00:32:13.091 --> 00:32:15.580
<v Speaker 1>that it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that it's illegal.</v>

805
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that Terence Mckenna had a joke</v>

806
00:32:18.821 --> 00:32:21.670
<v Speaker 1>about it because your body's making it</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everybody's holding,</v>

807
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.030
<v Speaker 1>we all have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

808
00:32:25.031 --> 00:32:27.130
<v Speaker 1>it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like making blooded legal.</v>

809
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then why would he go to scenario</v>

810
00:32:29.561 --> 00:32:31.810
<v Speaker 1>deadly when they find these tolls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

811
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced it from the toad</v>

812
00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:39.631
<v Speaker 1>of owning a television where the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>they extracted grab them and they buses</v>

813
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.030
<v Speaker 3>pimples and the busing on the class a</v>
<v Speaker 3>marrow and then take it off and he let</v>

814
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:44.864
<v Speaker 3>it harden.</v>

815
00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

816
00:32:45.251 --> 00:32:47.050
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let it dry in the summer,</v>

817
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:51.200
<v Speaker 2>scrape it off with the razor blade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only had it synthetically made in a</v>

818
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:53.480
<v Speaker 2>laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You smelled a buy it online.</v>

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Used to be able to buy like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>can of it,</v>

820
00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.120
<v Speaker 2>like this big enough to get like a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>state high.</v>

821
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.270
<v Speaker 3>She's just buy it online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was totally legal.</v>

822
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Credible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

823
00:33:03.141 --> 00:33:04.340
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre.</v>

824
00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:06.470
<v Speaker 3>That is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

825
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 3>they would say not for human consumption</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

826
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you doing with it if</v>

827
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 3>you're not using it for human</v>
<v Speaker 3>consumption,</v>

828
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.210
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you used to be able to buy it.</v>

829
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.140
<v Speaker 3>I've never felt anything like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

830
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.120
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing like that makes me not want to</v>

831
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 3>do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing else can supersede that.</v>

832
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.540
<v Speaker 3>How long ago did it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

833
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Around two months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:34:36.571 --> 00:34:37.404
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping</v>

872
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.960
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start with psilocybin because a,</v>

873
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I know maps there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing some great work with that.</v>

874
00:34:45.001 --> 00:34:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get these things legalize</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially they're doing mtma studies</v>

875
00:34:48.421 --> 00:34:51.810
<v Speaker 2>with veterans and people with Ptsd and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having great results.</v>

876
00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.230
<v Speaker 2>They're moving in the civil side bend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would love to get silicide been</v>

877
00:34:55.231 --> 00:34:57.450
<v Speaker 2>legal and it's up for ballot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in Oregon.</v>

878
00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Is that where it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's up for,</v>

879
00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I think Oregon is up for legalization</v>
<v Speaker 2>this year and it may be eventually in</v>

880
00:35:02.611 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 2>California as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may hate him.</v>

881
00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be legal.</v>

882
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.550
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't kill anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be,</v>

883
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.590
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad thing if they regulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

884
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:14.340
<v Speaker 2>if they make it for therapeutic use and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just set up centers where experts can</v>

885
00:35:14.341 --> 00:35:16.110
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they shouldn't make it prohibitive</v>

886
00:35:16.111 --> 00:35:17.880
<v Speaker 2>for people to own it or even grow their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

887
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bad idea to set up places</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people can do it.</v>

888
00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Under a professionals care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a showman's care.</v>

889
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Physicians Care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good idea,</v>

890
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.270
<v Speaker 2>but making it illegal is a bad idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it helps a lot of people,</v>

891
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think of it as a party drug.</v>

892
00:35:32.431 --> 00:35:35.490
<v Speaker 2>They think you're going to do mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>and freak out and go fucking run around</v>

893
00:35:35.491 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 2>naked and La was do mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love mushrooms.</v>

<v Speaker 2>well psilocybin and DMT or very closely</v>

895
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:47.040
<v Speaker 2>related chemically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those really potent psychedelic</v>

896
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 2>drugs are very closely related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all break down in,</v>

897
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.220
<v Speaker 2>in some similar path inside your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

898
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.230
<v Speaker 2>and give you</v>

<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>how difficult any of your life must've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been for you.</v>

938
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.690
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be one of the harder things</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

939
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.310
<v Speaker 2>when you did that documentary to amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

940
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.720
<v Speaker 2>when you're very honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're very honest and you're very open</v>

941
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:47.820
<v Speaker 2>about all your experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing I took away after</v>

942
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:49.230
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no one can understand.</v>

943
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.330
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could hear a guy talk like this.</v>

944
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.690
<v Speaker 2>I could hear you say these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see the videos of your fights to</v>

945
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:55.890
<v Speaker 2>see the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your experience,</v>

946
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.650
<v Speaker 2>but to understand the life that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived,</v>

947
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a guess.</v>

948
00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:04.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For someone like me from the outside,</v>

949
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:07.040
<v Speaker 1>it's just really interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

950
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I think about this young kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn,</v>

951
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:12.560
<v Speaker 1>and you come to the cuff though tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 1312 you know,</v>

952
00:38:12.561 --> 00:38:15.860
<v Speaker 1>and I'll something all of a sudden have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a low self esteem.</v>

953
00:38:15.861 --> 00:38:19.310
<v Speaker 1>This guy gives me this big fucking ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

954
00:38:19.311 --> 00:38:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I live by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

955
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I live by the rules of that ego and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

956
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:25.100
<v Speaker 1>and I have accomplished so much in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominator ego.</v>

957
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.210
<v Speaker 1>about destroying people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

961
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.860

<v Speaker 1>200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm staring you down.</v>

963
00:38:32.811 --> 00:38:35.950

964
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause we have people,</v>

965

<v Speaker 3>we try to avoid fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

966
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From my instincts,</v>

967
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 3>we avoid fights for all our lives and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to be able to see what you do.</v>

968
00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Like you UFC guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fighter.</v>

969
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.000

<v Speaker 3>a lifestyle.</v>

970
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were getting positive reinforcement</v>

971
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 3>from thinking like that for the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>time in your life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

995
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he give you any advice on how to</v>

996
00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:51.160
<v Speaker 3>shut it off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

997
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.250
<v Speaker 5>He's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any time.</v>

998
00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.690
<v Speaker 5>Let me time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The kid is 13.</v>

999
00:39:58.691 --> 00:40:03.010
<v Speaker 5>How old is because there's no time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no time.</v>

1000
00:40:03.011 --> 00:40:04.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to teach them the off</v>
<v Speaker 5>switch.</v>

1001
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:05.620
<v Speaker 5>Just hit the gas.</v>

1002
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Therefore the word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gas destroyed,</v>

1003
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:09.940
<v Speaker 3>he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got in our way of,</v>

1004
00:40:09.941 --> 00:40:11.140
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greatness.</v>

1005
00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:11.840
<v Speaker 3>Glory.</v>

1006
00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.650
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the hardest things that many</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters I've,</v>

1007
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.430
<v Speaker 2>that I've watched over the years have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem of shutting it off.</v>

1008
00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Like turning it on and living like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just wanting to be a dominator.</v>

1009
00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.770
<v Speaker 2>But then learning how to be a father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learning how to be</v>

1010
00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.470
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend and my first lifetime with</v>

1011
00:40:30.471 --> 00:40:32.150
<v Speaker 3>children and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do this stuff.</v>

1012
00:40:32.151 --> 00:40:33.170
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel filled.</v>

1013
00:40:33.171 --> 00:40:34.790
<v Speaker 3>The disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1014
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1015
00:40:35.781 --> 00:40:38.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea what I was doing too.</v>

1016
00:40:38.901 --> 00:40:41.870
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what arena was stepping into.</v>

1017
00:40:41.871 --> 00:40:44.220
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a disaster.</v>

1018
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.620
<v Speaker 3>I find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1019
00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.210
<v Speaker 3>I spend most of my adult life now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>apologizing to my kids.</v>

1020
00:40:50.211 --> 00:40:51.070
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1021
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.260
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can imagine me a horrible father.</v>

1022
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they understand the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were going through?</v>

1023
00:40:58.151 --> 00:40:58.820
<v Speaker 2>They understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.950
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1025
00:41:00.951 --> 00:41:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to basically make sure that part</v>

1026
00:41:05.181 --> 00:41:08.600
<v Speaker 3>of my life is empty now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The different life for my kids and</v>

1027
00:41:08.601 --> 00:41:10.100
<v Speaker 3>family now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Well that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful that you,</v>

1029
00:41:12.441 --> 00:41:13.250
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1030
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.040
<v Speaker 2>like Tom was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of self reflection.</v>

1031
00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:17.940
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've managed to look at your life and,</v>

1032
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.990
<v Speaker 2>and find out what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what has value to you and what helps</v>

1033
00:41:20.991 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1034
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.790
<v Speaker 3>You always have to do self evaluation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1035
00:41:23.791 --> 00:41:26.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a strong believer in that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody has to check you,</v>

1036
00:41:26.931 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 3>you have to check yourself.</v>

1037
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1038
00:41:29.151 --> 00:41:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a guy like you who's,</v>

1039
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:31.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1040
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.650
<v Speaker 2>you've been checked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ego's checked,</v>

1041
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 2>your life</v>

1042
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.760
<v Speaker 1>has been checked if it's so many down</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments as well as up moments.</v>

1043
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:40.910
<v Speaker 1>You've had the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the full ride of experiences.</v>

1044
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Never with Avaya with my ego being</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken and no idea that that wasn't</v>

1045
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 1>what it was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you thought if your ego checked,</v>

1046
00:41:47.481 --> 00:41:49.760
<v Speaker 1>you would go and be nothing when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ego.</v>

1047
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes sense when you're going</v>

1049
00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 1>through all that hypnosis when you're 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 13 years old.</v>

1050
00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.560
<v Speaker 1>But that's a crazy thing to do to a kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was sand.</v>

1051
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.670
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted to do it so bad.</v>

1052
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't succeed so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell,</v>

1053
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a video of you a real</v>

1054
00:42:07.521 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were about 16,</v>

1055
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.930
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 years old and you were sparring with</v>

1056
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:15.950
<v Speaker 1>some big guy who was a professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight and you were,</v>

1057
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:17.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was what was fascinating to me about,</v>

1058
00:42:17.711 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just watching move around when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were young and still learning,</v>

1059
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 1>but it was also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were upset at yourself after it was</v>

1060
00:42:23.721 --> 00:42:24.110
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

1061
00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:26.070
<v Speaker 1>You didn't think it went well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1062
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:26.790
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1063
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 1>remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't remember.</v>

1064
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.120
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an interesting video,</v>

1065
00:42:29.121 --> 00:42:29.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were like,</v>

1066
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell it didn't go well.</v>

1067
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I was a thick perfectionists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was going to say and it</v>

1068
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:37.400
<v Speaker 1>seemed like it like you were obsessed as</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole life.</v>

1069
00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:39.350
<v Speaker 1>That's all I did was look at Bucklin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch Bach,</v>

1070
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.220
<v Speaker 1>the read about fighters and it was all</v>
<v Speaker 1>about fighting the fight of the,</v>

1071
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.370
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fido,</v>

1072
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.010
<v Speaker 1>you know that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight after I want to be around them and</v>

1073
00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:49.550
<v Speaker 1>be their groupie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another amazing imagine that you</v>

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 1>How great would it be if you taught like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a boxing class?</v>

1118
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I know about that stuff though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to hang out there and work out.</v>

1119
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Just a fun box in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hitting the heavy bag.</v>

1120
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Just something fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get people beating</v>

1121
00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:41.520
<v Speaker 1>each other up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how much people would pay to</v>

1122
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:44.930
<v Speaker 1>smoke weed and come where had a box from</v>
<v Speaker 1>you smoke weed.</v>

1123
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you smoke weed with people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just regular folks.</v>

1124
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1125
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.700
<v Speaker 1>look we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1126
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get my wife to smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

1127
00:44:52.411 --> 00:44:53.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't smoke.</v>

1128
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:56.250
<v Speaker 1>She smoked only at nighttime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't function during the daytime.</v>

1129
00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:56.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1130
00:44:56.781 --> 00:44:57.840
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the day.</v>

1131
00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine if I was a mother it</v>

1132
00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:03.510
<v Speaker 1>would be very hard to get high because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>get paranoid.</v>

1133
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.900
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a lot fun.</v>

1134
00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.820
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't do it during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At night.</v>

1135
00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.440
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smoke,</v>

1136
00:45:09.441 --> 00:45:10.370
<v Speaker 2>a little weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed.</v>

1137
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:13.400
<v Speaker 2>How did you ever do any fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did kickboxing and how many</v>

1138
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.500
<v Speaker 2>tournaments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1139
00:45:15.501 --> 00:45:18.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty good at taekwondo.</v>

1140
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I won a bunch of state championships and</v>
<v Speaker 2>won a few national.</v>

1141
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:23.581
<v Speaker 1>What did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1142
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to get physical in another</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being and do this stuff.</v>

1143
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you can't be in the right frame of mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and want to do this stuff.</v>

1145
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Got To realize that I was this stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the right frame of mind and half</v>

1146
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.200
<v Speaker 1>dealing with fear drives you insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deal with that.</v>

1147
00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Drives people insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was insane during my career.</v>

1148
00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madly and staying from fear.</v>

1149
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1150
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I never went through anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the level that you went through,</v>

1151
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:47.880
<v Speaker 2>but for these full contact taekwondo</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>

1152
00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:51.510
<v Speaker 2>I was always scared and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was scared before that I was</v>

1153
00:45:51.511 --> 00:45:53.190
<v Speaker 2>bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved around a lot.</v>

1154
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:57.210
<v Speaker 2>I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never very big and we moved from</v>

1155
00:45:57.211 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey to San Francisco when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

1156
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:04.410
<v Speaker 2>from San Francisco to Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was 11 Florida to Boston when I</v>

1157
00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:09.411
<v Speaker 2>was 14 or 13 so it's just always moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new schools always deal with new kids</v>

1158
00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't big and I didn't know how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight and I got picked on and I</v>

1159
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:14.640
<v Speaker 2>didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

1160
00:46:14.641 --> 00:46:16.710
<v Speaker 2>I wanna I want to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1161
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:20.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I started getting into martial</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts and I just became obsessed with it.</v>

1162
00:46:20.101 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I did it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started teaching.</v>

1163
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.660
<v Speaker 2>I was teaching at Boston University is</v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching a taekwondo course.</v>

1164
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:29.280
<v Speaker 2>When I was 19 I was competing from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time I was 15 I just threw myself into</v>

1165
00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all I did every day I worked at the</v>

1166
00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:32.130
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there every day.</v>

1167
00:46:32.131 --> 00:46:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I had the keys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I closed up,</v>

1168
00:46:33.301 --> 00:46:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I opened up where I am because of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of hearing about you.</v>

1169
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.330
<v Speaker 2>When you were running in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you knew that everybody else was</v>

1170
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 2>asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gave you an edge.</v>

1171
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.960
<v Speaker 2>I go there in the middle of the night</v>
<v Speaker 2>and open up and work out.</v>

1172
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to just have an edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1173
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:47.280
<v Speaker 2>And I've listened to what you said and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1174
00:46:47.281 --> 00:46:49.800
<v Speaker 2>that's a great way to have an edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became obsessed with it,</v>

1175
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.180
<v Speaker 2>but there was no future in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happened was I went from</v>

1176
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.330
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo to kickboxing and when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>started kickboxing,</v>

1177
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:01.050
<v Speaker 2>I started getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do's are beating the shit out of me</v>

1178
00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:04.140
<v Speaker 2>because I was realizing like I can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep people at the same distance anymore</v>

1179
00:47:04.141 --> 00:47:05.880
<v Speaker 2>cause I didn't know how to use my hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

1180
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I knew how to throw some punches a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit from taekwondo,</v>

1181
00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:11.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's not nearly sophisticated as</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing or kickboxing.</v>

1182
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.090
<v Speaker 2>And so then I started kickboxing</v>
<v Speaker 2>training and then I started realizing</v>

1183
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:16.860
<v Speaker 2>like there's no future in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1184
00:47:16.861 --> 00:47:18.990
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just getting my brains beat in,</v>

1185
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm hard sparring.</v>

1186
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Two of the sparring was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Boston style.</v>

1187
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Put the gloves on and beat the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of each other.</v>

1188
00:47:27.181 --> 00:47:28.014
<v Speaker 2>Figure it out as you</v>

1189
00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:29.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ain't going shit.</v>

1190
00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of headaches and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

1191
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:36.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was hard for me to,</v>

1192
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.460
<v Speaker 2>to shut that part of me off the part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1193
00:47:39.461 --> 00:47:42.100
<v Speaker 2>they just wanted to conquer the part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me just wanting to win all the time to</v>

1194
00:47:42.101 --> 00:47:44.320
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to be more intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more driven,</v>

1195
00:47:44.321 --> 00:47:46.720
<v Speaker 2>more focused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I did stop fighting,</v>

1196
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:51.750
<v Speaker 2>it was a huge relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the relief part was worth the extra</v>

1197
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:55.300
<v Speaker 2>anxiety that I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was worth it just for the relief of</v>

1198
00:47:55.301 --> 00:47:58.060
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not thinking about fighting all the</v>

1199
00:47:58.061 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not thinking about when's the next</v>

1200
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:02.230
<v Speaker 2>tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when's the next event?</v>

1201
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.750
<v Speaker 2>When's the next thing I'm doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

1202
00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:06.570
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1203
00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.550
<v Speaker 2>for you it had to be way crazy because</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only is it the weight,</v>

1204
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 2>it's the heavyweight championship of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1205
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to make my mentor happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1206
00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.740
<v Speaker 2>That was my goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make him happy when he died.</v>

1207
00:48:17.741 --> 00:48:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Was it weird not having a person like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1208
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.210
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was so,</v>

1209
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.640
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just emptiness.</v>

1210
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:25.890
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people who we go with our</v>

1211
00:48:25.891 --> 00:48:27.670
<v Speaker 3>friends and that we say we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be good too.</v>

1212
00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.450
<v Speaker 3>They started when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started going in for the kill.</v>

1213
00:48:30.451 --> 00:48:32.970
<v Speaker 3>You just want to grab me for means.</v>

1214
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Well it seemed like you and Kevin Rooney</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a good combination at the beginning</v>

1215
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:37.880
<v Speaker 2>when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1216
00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.773
<v Speaker 2>when customers,</v>

1217
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.020
<v Speaker 3>we didn't know what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're thinking about getting rid of</v>

1218
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:45.820
<v Speaker 3>Kevin and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was saying I didn't want to be</v>

1219
00:48:45.821 --> 00:48:48.880
<v Speaker 3>with nobody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was comfortable with Kevin and the</v>

1220
00:48:48.881 --> 00:48:50.700
<v Speaker 3>style and the way we were going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to be in oil.</v>

1221
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:51.191
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1222
00:48:51.191 --> 00:48:52.210
<v Speaker 3>let's just keep Kevin.</v>

1223
00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Kevin was a great training for me.</v>

1224
00:48:54.571 --> 00:48:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Very well respected trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:00.240
<v Speaker 2>It was a good relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the way it worked in the beginning</v>

1226
00:49:00.241 --> 00:49:02.970
<v Speaker 2>it looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then like all things,</v>

1227
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin used to train me and then fighting</v>

1228

1360
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:27.600

<v Speaker 3>They don't have,</v>

1361
00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.390
<v Speaker 3>they weren't at their prime then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1362
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:32.180
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to see those two guys in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>prime is go at it.</v>

1363
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sugar Ray Leonard.</v>

1364
00:54:33.781 --> 00:54:37.050
<v Speaker 2>When especially when he fought Hagel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fought hygge or smart stay the fuck</v>

1365
00:54:37.051 --> 00:54:39.540
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard the craziest rumor.</v>

1366
00:54:39.541 --> 00:54:44.541
<v Speaker 2>Tell me if this is the craziest rumor</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Marvin Hagler like decided to bet</v>

1367
00:54:45.841 --> 00:54:50.841
<v Speaker 2>on himself for that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't knew that he was going to lose.</v>

1368
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Like they had it set up and then retired</v>
<v Speaker 2>and went to Italy</v>

1369
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:55.510
<v Speaker 3>as a ridiculous rumor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1370
00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.190
<v Speaker 3>And know what anybody did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the,</v>

1371
00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.220
<v Speaker 3>I never heard anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never heard that one?</v>

1372
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.113
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1373
00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:04.300
<v Speaker 2>but he's the more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most interesting end of</v>

1374
00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:04.970
<v Speaker 2>careers.</v>

1375
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:07.070
<v Speaker 3>I heard a rumor that he didn't fight the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

1376
00:55:07.071 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 3>that he should have fight that and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>should have fought.</v>

1377
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:10.483
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1378
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rumor was he went to Italy because</v>

1379
00:55:12.291 --> 00:55:13.370
<v Speaker 2>the mob said everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1380
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Something to that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went to Italy and became a giant</v>

1381
00:55:16.431 --> 00:55:19.040
<v Speaker 2>movie star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's the only guy that I can think</v>

1382
00:55:19.041 --> 00:55:23.030
<v Speaker 2>of in recent memory that literally went</v>
<v Speaker 2>out on top,</v>

1383
00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.390
<v Speaker 2>had unbelievably close fight with sugar</v>
<v Speaker 2>ray Leonard,</v>

1384
00:55:26.391 --> 00:55:28.010
<v Speaker 2>who a lot of people think he could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>won that fight.</v>

1385
00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Very close decision and then says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1386
00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.550
<v Speaker 2>See Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

1387
00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Everybody comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come back.</v>

1388
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:39.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm at one time.</v>

1389
00:55:39.021 --> 00:55:40.510
<v Speaker 3>That's your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think of my,</v>

1390
00:55:40.511 --> 00:55:42.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm for prior then never came back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just my whole life.</v>

1391
00:55:42.951 --> 00:55:44.520
<v Speaker 3>That was my whole identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1392
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:45.523
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1393
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.600
<v Speaker 2>But when you did retire and when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>retired in the ring,</v>

1394
00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:52.470
<v Speaker 2>that was the most honest retirement</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech I've ever heard of box give ever.</v>

1395
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:53.820
<v Speaker 2>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1396
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't have this in medium</v>

1397
00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:57.680
<v Speaker 3>and once with him in the air anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1398
00:55:57.790 --> 00:56:00.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked pretty bizarre for myself even,</v>

1399
00:56:00.441 --> 00:56:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Ya know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause this is what I base my life on</v>

1400
00:56:02.231 --> 00:56:05.920
<v Speaker 3>doing when I first started doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm a dedicate my life to this stuff.</v>

1401
00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:07.110
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm no longer happened was pretty weird.</v>

1403
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.840
<v Speaker 2>When did you know that you didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it anymore?</v>

1404
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm known years before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was still being very successful.</v>

<v Speaker 2>started thinking it?</v>

1407
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did,</v>

1415
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 1>what did you have in mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the hardest thing,</v>

1416
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:47.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To to swing from that to the next thing.</v>

1417
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you take this crazy exciting</v>

1418
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:51.940
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1419
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I thought I lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me if get high for a while and</v>

1420
00:56:55.991 --> 00:56:57.700
<v Speaker 1>figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the plan.</v>

1421
00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me party for a while to figure this</v>

1422
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:03.580
<v Speaker 1>stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you figure out?</v>

1423
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1424
00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started,</v>

1425
00:57:07.181 --> 00:57:12.181
<v Speaker 1>my wife arranged for me to be the death</v>
<v Speaker 1>being on stage that she created the</v>

1426
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Maya.</v>

1427
00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a brilliant idea because you're</v>

1428
00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:19.750
<v Speaker 1>also the first fighter that ever did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1429
00:57:19.751 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Cause many fighters have great stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very few of them we've ever,</v>

1430
00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody besides you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was ever put into it.</v>

1431
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:27.910
<v Speaker 1>And we went all over the ct do that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing.</v>

1432
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 1>We did in Monaco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't own,</v>

1433
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:31.790
<v Speaker 1>we did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1434
00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1435
00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 1>amount of various places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now my eighth can't believe that</v>

1436
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:37.930
<v Speaker 1>people want to see this though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1437
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the documentary was amazing.</v>

1438
00:57:39.701 --> 00:57:43.480
<v Speaker 1>So people want to hear the live version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you talking about it and to see you</v>

1439
00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:46.360
<v Speaker 1>live in person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the first time we did it,</v>

1440
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.800
<v Speaker 1>the first time we did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Broadway dated,</v>

1441
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:51.703
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were really</v>

1442
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:56.830
<v Speaker 1>sure about how it's gonna turn out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we invited all of our friends.</v>

1443
00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:59.320
<v Speaker 1>We had taken the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave all to our friends and people we</v>

1444
00:57:59.321 --> 00:58:00.940
<v Speaker 1>love like names and we pulled them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

1445
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.630
<v Speaker 1>And so when we started they started</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

1446
00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.650
<v Speaker 1>But if I left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran in my right wife,</v>

1447
00:58:05.651 --> 00:58:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still got the baby.</v>

1448
00:58:06.521 --> 00:58:07.780
<v Speaker 1>What's going on and listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1449
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Can you I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want the show to be a comedy.</v>

1450
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:13.810
<v Speaker 1>It turned out to be a common with hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gritty show about a tough guy.</v>

1451
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made it through his toughness and he</v>

1452
00:58:15.581 --> 00:58:17.200
<v Speaker 1>just came up on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's talking about myself,</v>

1453
00:58:17.201 --> 00:58:18.440
<v Speaker 1>how much his stomach I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1454
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.830
<v Speaker 1>and they loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1455
00:58:23.831 --> 00:58:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I think that was part of it is cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they all,</v>

1456
00:58:26.081 --> 00:58:30.280
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew you were this tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know that you can be so</v>

1457
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:33.220
<v Speaker 1>self deprecating and have so much fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it all.</v>

1458
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people loved it because</v>

1459
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:38.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing the writing for my,</v>

1460
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.640
<v Speaker 1>my moving and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it anywhere.</v>

1461
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:43.000
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be pretty wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's playing you in a movie?</v>

1462
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know various people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know most likely when Jv Brown</v>

1463
00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:49.510
<v Speaker 1>and Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Foxx to do it,</v>

1464
00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.700
<v Speaker 1>he could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can do anything.</v>

1465
00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:53.120
<v Speaker 1>He could do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1466
00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 1>That guy could be the fucking president</v>
<v Speaker 1>of United States.</v>

1467
00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:57.760
<v Speaker 1>He could be a pilot that goes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>

1468
00:58:57.790 --> 00:58:59.710
<v Speaker 1>He could do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want him to do it.</v>

1469
00:58:59.711 --> 00:59:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could do whatever he wants.</v>

1470
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:04.000
<v Speaker 1>He'll probably bulk up like crazy too to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1471
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1472
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie could pull it off.</v>

1473
00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jai white pulled it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jai white and do it like Jamie.</v>

1475
00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:18.340
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people didn't like what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought he did a good job.</v>

1476
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.270
<v Speaker 1>You did a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So there really is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1517
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Well do you know that movie Fox Catcher?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that movie?</v>

1518
01:00:52.851 --> 01:00:55.820
<v Speaker 2>They had a roughly movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that story of the young guy.</v>

1519
01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1520
01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:01.220
<v Speaker 2>That Guy Mark Schultz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Dave Schultz in March lesson.</v>

1521
01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Dave Schultz who got murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Schultz is the guy who fought in</v>

1522
01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 2>the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's crazy about that movie.</v>

1523
01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much of that movie's</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate.</v>

1524
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't there,</v>

1525
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:14.510
<v Speaker 2>but what I do know is the one thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I for sure know happened,</v>

1526
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:19.040
<v Speaker 2>they changed when he fought in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark only fought in UFC wants.</v>

1527
01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>He fought a guy named big daddy</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodrich.</v>

1528
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Gary big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big black guy were karate,</v>

1529
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:27.710
<v Speaker 2>gi and then eventually got rid of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay later in his career,</v>

1530
01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:29.300
<v Speaker 2>but he's a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Daddy's.</v>

1531
01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you didn't have it in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not big daddy and the movie's</v>

1532
01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:34.850
<v Speaker 2>fighting some white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1533
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.940
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they changed who he's fighting for.</v>

1534
01:01:37.941 --> 01:01:39.560
<v Speaker 2>No reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a historical event.</v>

1535
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

1536
01:01:42.051 --> 01:01:45.860
<v Speaker 2>they decided to not have you fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trevor Berbick you fought someone else</v>

1537
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:47.300
<v Speaker 2>like you fought Gerry Cooney for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>title.</v>

1538
01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:48.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

1539
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.810
<v Speaker 2>why would you change history?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I hope they don't do nothing.</v>

1540
01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't want to do that.</v>

1541
01:01:52.131 --> 01:01:54.050
<v Speaker 2>They do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has to be,</v>

1542
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 2>they did it with the UFC and when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it with foxcatcher can be by,</v>

1543
01:01:57.621 --> 01:01:59.630
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make it any better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's crazy.</v>

1544
01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make the movie any better to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have him fight a Russian guy.</v>

1545
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:06.960
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make him a bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I could be known right in the UFC,</v>

1546
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:09.640
<v Speaker 2>especially for people like me that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the audience and go,</v>

1547
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:11.760
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look who's playing big daddy high.</v>

1548
01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.990
<v Speaker 2>They do a big daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big daddy.</v>

1549
01:02:12.991 --> 01:02:16.160
<v Speaker 2>He's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took big daddy down at where they do</v>

1550
01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:20.430
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's Mark Schultz who was a fucker of a</v>

1551
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:23.280
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean him and his brother was savages.</v>

1552
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>They were savages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just made out a down</v>

1553
01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.730
<v Speaker 3>the deal with they guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did they hook up with that guy?</v>

1554
01:02:28.731 --> 01:02:30.320
<v Speaker 3>What did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was really daily</v>

1555
01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.830
<v Speaker 2>rich and there's no money in amateur</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and these guys,</v>

1556
01:02:33.831 --> 01:02:36.380
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them were really struggling</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're trying to make the Olympics</v>

1557
01:02:36.381 --> 01:02:37.201
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>

1558
01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:39.530
<v Speaker 2>they're getting by barely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They barely have enough money for</v>

1559
01:02:39.531 --> 01:02:42.530
<v Speaker 2>healthy food and they need sponsors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it gets sponsors,</v>

1560
01:02:42.531 --> 01:02:45.190
<v Speaker 2>like a rich guy who owns a business or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1561
01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.790
<v Speaker 2>he loves the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he loves wrestling.</v>

1562
01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:49.460
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he wrestled in college and he'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of them.</v>

1563
01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Get maybe get them some vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe sponsoring with the Indian,</v>

1564
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have various people that help them</v>

1565
01:02:54.411 --> 01:02:57.140
<v Speaker 2>with their training and their food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this guy came along and said,</v>

1566
01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:59.150
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to build a gigantic facility</v>

1567
01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:03.680
<v Speaker 2>to create the best wrestling program and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay you guys all money to come and train</v>

1568
01:03:03.681 --> 01:03:04.910
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they couldn't help it.</v>

1569
01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like they were poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what to do,</v>

1570
01:03:07.101 --> 01:03:08.060
<v Speaker 2>but I understand that.</v>

1571
01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was a guy who is like a trust</v>

1572
01:03:10.251 --> 01:03:12.560
<v Speaker 2>fund guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got all his money from his family and</v>

1573
01:03:12.561 --> 01:03:16.190
<v Speaker 2>he was just some crazy rich asshole and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wound up shooting one of them.</v>

1574
01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what it is.</v>

1575
01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:20.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the store,</v>

1576
01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.940
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story itself is fucking crazy</v>

1577
01:03:22.941 --> 01:03:24.170
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The actual store,</v>

1578
01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.640
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have to change anything of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1579
01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.570
<v Speaker 2>So I know they changed that part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who knows what else in the movie the</v>

1580
01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:33.320
<v Speaker 2>added or changed or fucked with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucked with something they didn't</v>

1581
01:03:33.321 --> 01:03:35.810
<v Speaker 2>have to fuck with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went Hollywood with it in a way</v>

1582
01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:38.130
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it makes you,</v>

1583
01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.160
<v Speaker 2>you question all the other things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in the movie and it's pretty,</v>

1584
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.200
<v Speaker 2>so for you they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

1585
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Your life was crazy</v>

1586
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:49.010
<v Speaker 3>in thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm no way I was saying I'm with,</v>

1587
01:03:49.011 --> 01:03:49.670
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

1588
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:51.320
<v Speaker 3>I really want to do this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1589
01:03:51.321 --> 01:03:54.290

<v Speaker 3>my life and be fulfilled.</v>

1590
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.600
<v Speaker 3>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that really need that.</v>

1591
01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1592
01:03:57.070 --> 01:04:00.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about that recently.</v>

1595
01:04:04.381 --> 01:04:05.450
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really,</v>

1596
01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.150
<v Speaker 3>they're really needs this money that</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt you.</v>

1597
01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:09.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to help you.</v>

1598
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Anything helps you at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're so honest that anything that</v>

1599
01:04:13.231 --> 01:04:16.020

<v Speaker 2>embarrassed about or shameful of,</v>

1600
01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.240
<v Speaker 2>it just makes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just better.</v>

1601
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:21.270
<v Speaker 2>It's just better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you made mistakes is people</v>

1602
01:04:21.271 --> 01:04:22.950
<v Speaker 2>can learn from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are beneficial.</v>

1603
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.580
<v Speaker 2>So watching someone like you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life is beneficial for people</v>

1604
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:30.300
<v Speaker 2>because you learn how you can overcome</v>
<v Speaker 2>these experiences.</v>

1605
01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:32.520
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bad things can be for you.</v>

1606
01:04:32.521 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 2>You learn how bad you can fuck up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to see shit like that.</v>

1607
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:38.820
<v Speaker 2>It's good for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good for civilizations,</v>

1608
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:43.650
<v Speaker 2>good for our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so at plastic guy like you who</v>

1609
01:04:43.651 --> 01:04:47.760
<v Speaker 2>was like I said when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the fucking man.</v>

1610
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:53.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean you were the fucking man to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy like you be self deprecating</v>

1611
01:04:53.551 --> 01:04:55.080
<v Speaker 2>explaining and laughing about things.</v>

1612
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.150
<v Speaker 2>It makes it even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sinks in more.</v>

1613
01:04:57.330 --> 01:05:00.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were saying about custom model that</v>

1614
01:05:00.181 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 2>his wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sunk in like he was the gravel in</v>

1615
01:05:04.411 --> 01:05:08.160
<v Speaker 2>his voice and the intensity in his eyes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the wisdom in his words,</v>

1616
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.360
<v Speaker 2>it's sunk in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remembered his quotes for years</v>

1617
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.270
<v Speaker 2>afterwards because he lived so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he had so much,</v>

1618
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 2>and that's the same thing with you man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

1619
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.090
<v Speaker 2>when you were talking about your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

1620
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>like people listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take it in because they know you</v>

1621
01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:26.440
<v Speaker 2>lived an extraordinary life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they better not fuck this movie out</v>

1622
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:29.140
<v Speaker 2>and it really extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's extreme as it gets.</v>

1623
01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:34.990
<v Speaker 2>What's Mark Stream other than a soldier</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are the only people that live</v>

1624
01:05:34.991 --> 01:05:37.420
<v Speaker 2>a more extreme life first responder</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers,</v>

1625
01:05:37.421 --> 01:05:39.070
<v Speaker 2>firemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>police officers.</v>

1626
01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:40.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1627
01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing death and violence every</v>

1628
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:43.263
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than them.</v>

1629
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:45.460
<v Speaker 2>You probably lived the most extreme life</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1630
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck can relate to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever get together with other like</v>

1637
01:06:00.141 --> 01:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>deployed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so probably they don't take themselves</v>

1638
01:06:02.301 --> 01:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

1640
01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Well a lot of those guys are finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>some relief in the same things that you</v>

1641
01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:10.420
<v Speaker 1>found it.</v>

1642
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Family farm or leave and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and DMT and other psychedelics,</v>

1643
01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:15.640
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that could be a great</v>

1644
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 2>benefit to a lot of our veterans.</v>

1645
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I believe that 100% too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they don't want to</v>

1646
01:06:20.681 --> 01:06:22.270

<v Speaker 1>you if you got ahold of that stuff?</v>

1648
01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:28.270

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1649
01:06:28.271 --> 01:06:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think maybe I want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter then.</v>

1650
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I won't want to be a fighter.</v>

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D tmt might have derailed it.</v>

1658
01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:54.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one day people will be able to see</v>

1691
01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.030
<v Speaker 1>you don't follow any of the tail with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1692
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of my life.</v>

1693
01:08:16.071 --> 01:08:16.881
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1694
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:20.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got mixed feelings with that part</v>

1695
01:08:20.361 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1696
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 1>And I stuffed up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like about myself and stuff.</v>

1697
01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>That is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to forget that stuff cause I'm</v>

1698
01:08:28.851 --> 01:08:30.400
<v Speaker 1>on a whole different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I tried to stay away much as possible.</v>

1703
01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.220
<v Speaker 2>So watching other people box makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about yourself when you were</v>

1704
01:08:41.221 --> 01:08:43.550
<v Speaker 2>fighting reminds you of it kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1736
01:09:52.991 --> 01:09:55.690
<v Speaker 2>that past like that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge it.</v>

1737
01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:56.980
<v Speaker 2>You don't even acknowledge it anymore.</v>

1738
01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For that,</v>

1739
01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost a little bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be involved.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You brought people this,</v>

1764
01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.910

<v Speaker 2>views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got at your popcorn and you</v>

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:01.653
<v Speaker 1>Okay then.</v>

1769
01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.830
<v Speaker 2>I hate to keep bringing your head back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that,</v>

1770
01:11:03.831 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 2>but just for me as a kid growing up</v>
<v Speaker 2>during that time,</v>

1771
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:10.070
<v Speaker 2>it was a big part of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1772
01:11:10.071 --> 01:11:13.680
<v Speaker 2>my becoming an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was during your era,</v>

1773
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 2>you're</v>

1774
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.890
<v Speaker 1>ever of dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How we'd look at my kids and I think,</v>

1775
01:11:16.891 --> 01:11:17.660
<v Speaker 1>why did you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1776
01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.400
<v Speaker 1>pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1777
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:23.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class kid,</v>

1778
01:11:23.401 --> 01:11:25.890
<v Speaker 1>they live their life to do what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go to college and everything.</v>

1779
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I W I w I would never want to put that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on my son.</v>

1780
01:11:28.601 --> 01:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>That you have to be the total best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to dominate everybody.</v>

1781
01:11:30.841 --> 01:11:32.310
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be the best that ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>live at this.</v>

1782
01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.820
<v Speaker 1>He's put that kind of pressure on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

1783
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Would never do that to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.670
<v Speaker 1>It would never work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

1785
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a kid that grows up in a</v>

1786
01:11:40.441 --> 01:11:45.441
<v Speaker 1>loving household would supportive boxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>for when you have nothing to boxing.</v>

1787
01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:48.470
<v Speaker 1>When you did it had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's a lot of,</v>

1788
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:50.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of dedication.</v>

1789
01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:53.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of aggravation.</v>

1790
01:11:53.641 --> 01:11:54.474
<v Speaker 1>Louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1791
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.351
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1792
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm discovering who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you must be able to take pride in</v>

1793
01:11:58.711 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 1>the fact that your children don't ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do that.</v>

1794
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I took the punches for,</v>

1795
01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:06.390
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't have to do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my first might have to send a 16.</v>

1796
01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:07.010
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be</v>

1797
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:09.080
<v Speaker 5>box of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw you working with</v>

1798

<v Speaker 5>private school boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] European trips.</v>

1799
01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:25.230
<v Speaker 5>He did trips and us to vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be a fight and kid how to</v>

1800
01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:30.231
<v Speaker 5>hear the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's really soon.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to deal with that kind</v>

1814
01:13:01.241 --> 01:13:02.090
<v Speaker 1>of shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

1837
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:55.710
<v Speaker 1>that you're more than what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was also those feelings of</v>

1839
01:13:58.231 --> 01:14:01.410
<v Speaker 1>good feelings of your life and the fact</v>

1840
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I don't think a</v>

01:14:03.031 --> 01:14:04.500
<v Speaker 1>lot of people are aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the hypnotism to hypnotism and the</v>

1843
01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 1>putting those thoughts into your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were hugely beneficial that you</v>

1844
01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:15.490

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1993
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure it out,</v>

1994
01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.710
<v Speaker 1>but I've changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're still figuring out,</v>

1995
01:20:13.711 --> 01:20:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I still know how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1996
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I describe it for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like resetting a computer and you</v>

1997
01:20:20.761 --> 01:20:23.250
<v Speaker 2>reset a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a fresh new desktop and there's</v>

1998
01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:25.590
<v Speaker 2>only one folder on the desktop and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>folder says,</v>

1999
01:20:25.591 --> 01:20:26.700
<v Speaker 2>my old bullshit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>do my third way.</v>

2001
01:20:30.161 --> 01:20:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes I'm wondering this new</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that I'm possessing right now,</v>

2002
01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:35.920
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a real feeling this stuff really</v>

2003
01:20:35.921 --> 01:20:39.130
<v Speaker 1>help I am I lying to myself again till</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next moment,</v>

2004
01:20:39.131 --> 01:20:42.640
<v Speaker 1>the neck feeling come to do some drills</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be with somebody else and what's</v>

2005
01:20:42.641 --> 01:20:44.740
<v Speaker 1>really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has that feeling going to come back</v>

2006
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.650
<v Speaker 1>there this moment they feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like it never coming back</v>

2007
01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.610
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can never come back if you decide</v>

2008
01:20:50.611 --> 01:20:53.130
<v Speaker 2>that it's never coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to make that decision</v>

2009
01:20:53.131 --> 01:20:55.230
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>

2010
01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.040
<v Speaker 2>you can never come back if you want or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could slip into the old ways.</v>

2011
01:20:59.041 --> 01:21:00.540
<v Speaker 2>That's what a lot of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

2012
01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:02.820
<v Speaker 2>when a lot of people fall into drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>additions,</v>

2013
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.950
<v Speaker 2>relapsing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they relapse,</v>

2014
01:21:04.951 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 2>they're not physically addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they're relapsed,</v>

2015
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:09.690
<v Speaker 2>obviously they're clean and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to go back in.</v>

2016
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:14.160
<v Speaker 2>It's cause there's comfort in those old</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns because this new way of life is</v>

2017
01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:15.690
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get anxiety.</v>

2018
01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.390
<v Speaker 2>They feel like it's a lot of pressure to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay clean.</v>

2019
01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's explained it.</v>

2020
01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always hated that.</v>

2021
01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never wanted to do,</v>

2022
01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:25.090
<v Speaker 1>but then I do him again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never wanted,</v>

2023
01:21:25.091 --> 01:21:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I hate a thousand now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2024
01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:31.871
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

2025
01:21:31.871 --> 01:21:33.220
<v Speaker 1>You understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2026
01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>

2027
01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.420
<v Speaker 1>And then once you do that and once you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

2028
01:21:37.421 --> 01:21:40.030
<v Speaker 1>then he's going all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you haven't gone to liquor there.</v>

2029
01:21:40.031 --> 01:21:41.470
<v Speaker 1>The girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

2030
01:21:41.471 --> 01:21:43.480
<v Speaker 1>this is just a dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

2031
01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:45.310
<v Speaker 1>vicious cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real dark.</v>

2032
01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It's self destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about ego inflating and self</v>

2033
01:21:50.650 --> 01:21:52.510
<v Speaker 1>deprecating to stroke.</v>

2034
01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:57.860
<v Speaker 2>It also alleviates you from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility of improving the hundred</v>

2035
01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.720
<v Speaker 2>percent that pressure of like keeping it</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

2036
01:22:00.721 --> 01:22:03.240
<v Speaker 2>staying sober,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being disciplined,</v>

2037
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:05.100
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once it's gone,</v>

2038
01:22:05.101 --> 01:22:06.060
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Ah,</v>

2039
01:22:06.061 --> 01:22:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm crazy.</v>

2040
01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:08.940
<v Speaker 2>This is just what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm crazy.</v>

2041
01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's easy to fall into that trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens to a lot of</v>

2042
01:22:11.971 --> 01:22:13.140
<v Speaker 2>people who relapse with drugs.</v>

2043
01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I never want to go back to that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a no win situation.</v>

2044
01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:23.020
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the great things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana that people don't understand.</v>

2045
01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.390
<v Speaker 2>They think that a drug is a drug as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>

2046
01:22:25.391 --> 01:22:27.250
<v Speaker 2>They're all falling under the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>category,</v>

2047
01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:32.640
<v Speaker 2>but you can use marijuana and just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful and not chaotic and the</v>

2048
01:22:33.431 --> 01:22:37.270
<v Speaker 2>opposite of make you think more about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the consequences of ruining your</v>

2049
01:22:37.271 --> 01:22:38.104
<v Speaker 2>life</v>

2050
01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:41.800
<v Speaker 1>because they sound ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got um,</v>

2066
01:23:27.791 --> 01:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know at this stage in my life,</v>

2067
01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:32.170
