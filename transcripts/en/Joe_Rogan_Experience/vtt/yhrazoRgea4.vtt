00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.120
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience or jail?</v>

2
00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I was in the New York during the,</v>

4
00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:04.141
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>the hurricane sandy and we were talking to us a little bit before the show,</v>

7
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>but like you got a doomsday prep.</v>

8
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean like unfortunately I prepped for the wrong doomsday but a which one did</v>

9
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.414
<v Speaker 1>you prep for?</v>

10
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

11
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>a invasion of clowns.</v>

12
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I prefer a good one.</v>

13
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.031
<v Speaker 1>Good one.</v>

14
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:21.661
<v Speaker 1>But annoying.</v>

15
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Like clowns will be everywhere and we have to fight them off with like water</v>

16
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>guns and stuff like that and wrappers.</v>

17
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

19
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>But in this was like just fucking,</v>

20
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>it was like apocalyptic.</v>

21
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>It really was.</v>

22
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

23
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.573
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>did you expect it to be like that?</v>

25
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>It was a way crazier than you expect it.</v>

26
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>the thing about New York though is since nine 11,</v>

28
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>like our first responders are like top notch.</v>

29
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>They really like step up.</v>

30
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.331
<v Speaker 1>They know what they do,</v>

31
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>they got plants and all that kind of stuff.</v>

32
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.461
<v Speaker 1>But nobody,</v>

33
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I guess expected like New York City,</v>

34
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>a tsunami wave hitting us,</v>

35
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>knocking out power for like two weeks.</v>

36
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>And then there's like Staten Island Jersey where they got it even harder.</v>

37
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:58.344
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

38
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>you take the power out of New York City and you got Somalia basically.</v>

39
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just a freaky,</v>

40
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:03.001
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

41
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>scary town,</v>

42
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

43
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 1>It's really strange when you see how easy the,</v>

45
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

46
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>the film that covers civilization can be removed and peak power savage,</v>

47
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>it's just becomes absolutely rival real.</v>

48
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>So you really have to worry about survival because the first responders are</v>

49
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.131
<v Speaker 1>excellent.</v>

50
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

51
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>they're great,</v>

52
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>they're overwhelmed,</v>

53
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>there's just sheer numbers,</v>

54
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>impossible to deal with.</v>

55
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>There was parts of the city where like I was just walking around and it was just</v>

56
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>dark and like guys would roll up on you,</v>

57
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:31.861
<v Speaker 1>like you can't see him.</v>

58
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>And I'm pretty good.</v>

59
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Like nick,</v>

60
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>no one what's happening?</v>

61
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It got to roll up on me and I'm like,</v>

62
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:35.581
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

63
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>this is like a Chuck Norris,</v>

64
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:36.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>that scene and every chuck Norris movie we still like in the factory in a box in</v>

66
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>

67
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It was like that kind of thing.</v>

68
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:42.661
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

69
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>just weird,</v>

70
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:48.501
<v Speaker 1>scary faces and just sounds like to walk around a street at night with no gun,</v>

71
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.083
<v Speaker 1>no gun.</v>

72
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

73
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

74
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to find him with sarcasm?</v>

75
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.183
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

76
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Who were walking like to where you had to go to and fro in your neighborhood and</v>

77
00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>there was no lights on for days.</v>

78
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>No lights.</v>

79
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>It I where I lived there was lights,</v>

80
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>but when you like we did shows at the comedy cellar,</v>

81
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:08.101
<v Speaker 1>which is in the village.</v>

82
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>They had no lights up until almost the last day.</v>

83
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>And we're doing shows to generators,</v>

84
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of cool in a way but bad cause it went out when I was on,</v>

85
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

86
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>and went out and all of these flashlights and candles started popping out of the</v>

87
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:20.011
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>

88
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>It was like that scene in requiem for a dream,</v>

89
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>you know that saying like whether like asked to ask the flashlights on the check</v>

90
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:26.364
<v Speaker 1>and all that kinda stuff.</v>

91
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So it was really,</v>

92
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 1>it was really a freaky show,</v>

93
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:29.284
<v Speaker 1>but it was a good show.</v>

94
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>But when you're walking around the streets you're like,</v>

95
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.161
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

96
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:32.851
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

97
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:33.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>what do I,</v>

99
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>what can I fight?</v>

100
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Whoever comes at me with,</v>

101
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>with a weapon and there's a lot of like homeless people coming off of their meds</v>

102
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.831
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

103
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>So there's like they have like the extra evil in them,</v>

104
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

105
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's right because they can't get their meds cause there's no power.</v>

106
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>So it was like Zombie Style Zombie.</v>

107
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I was walking dead kind of shit.</v>

108
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>That's scary as fuck.</v>

109
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Now whizzer a lot of that.</v>

110
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Like was there a lot of muggings was there?</v>

111
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.353
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

112
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>there was some looting,</v>

113
00:02:58.741 --> 00:02:59.411
<v Speaker 1>there was whatever.</v>

114
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't like Katrina,</v>

115
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>cause I talked to guys who were in Katrina and they're like,</v>

116
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:05.711
<v Speaker 1>It's like fuck no,</v>

120
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>this is like Katrina was like the end of the earth.</v>

121
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>That was the end of the world there.</v>

122
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>That was like weeks and weeks and weeks,</v>

123
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:11.880
<v Speaker 1>no help,</v>

124
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and no power and it was hot and all that stuff.</v>

126
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>In New York it was a little bit better than that.</v>

127
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:17.321
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

128
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:17.371
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

129
00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:18.204
<v Speaker 1>So I can't,</v>

130
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.421
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>

131
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:19.901
<v Speaker 1>it was bad.</v>

132
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>She lets you know what can go wrong in the biggest city in the world.</v>

133
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:24.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

134
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

135
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.931
<v Speaker 1>When that happens,</v>

136
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>when the biggest city in the world gets essentially shut down for two weeks,</v>

137
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a real eyeopener.</v>

138
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.401
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

139
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:30.860
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

141
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>like people trying to get into the city and they had to do,</v>

143
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:34.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>like buses and all the trains were like,</v>

145
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>exactly like somebody should a kayak through these tunnels.</v>

146
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:39.911
<v Speaker 1>Just do it.</v>

147
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Like let's say like I did it,</v>

148
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about what it must be like at night with no power.</v>

149
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.980
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about it.</v>

150
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Parents stayed inside.</v>

151
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

152
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Not have left.</v>

153
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.343
<v Speaker 1>Well you kind of,</v>

154
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like,</v>

155
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>how do you see where you're going?</v>

156
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.071
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>

157
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>So unless it's a full moon,</v>

158
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:56.060
<v Speaker 1>how do you see where you go?</v>

159
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.063
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

160
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

161
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>the scariest thing I saw was when I was like driving around,</v>

162
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>like I was in a cab and uh,</v>

163
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>calves by the way were like incredibly hard to get at that point.</v>

164
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

165
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

166
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>there was like a candle in a window of a project and I'm like,</v>

167
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>this is what it's gonna look like after a nuclear winter.</v>

168
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Like just like one holdout guy in a,</v>

169
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>in a project somewhere like,</v>

170
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

171
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.540
<v Speaker 1>like Charlton Heston in the light,</v>

173
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>in the Omega man kind of thing.</v>

175
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.321
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

176
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.191
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

178
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:21.761
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

179
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>This is what it looks like.</v>

180
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

181
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

182
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

183

184
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>But then I think the guests thank freak them out even more.</v>

185
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>The fact they couldn't get gas for their generators in cars and shit.</v>

186
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>They're online for like 12,</v>

187
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:33.724
<v Speaker 1>15 hours.</v>

188
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Talked to a friend who said he was online.</v>

189
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It was two 30 in the afternoon.</v>

190
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>He had been there since six in the morning.</v>

191
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>And you still haven't gotten gas easily.</v>

192
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.101
<v Speaker 1>Easily.</v>

193

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194

195
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.661
<v Speaker 1>We never,</v>

196
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:44.141
<v Speaker 1>we never,</v>

197
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think even the,</v>

198
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

199

<v Speaker 1>whatever state thought like there's going to be a gas problem,</v>

202
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203

206
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>So Jesus Christ,</v>

207
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>especially in bringing everyone down,</v>

208
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>but it was getting the material from it at all.</v>

236
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Those shows were important.</v>

237
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>They have a generators that work on waterflow.</v>

238
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

239
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>they take a generator,</v>

240
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>they set it up at their camp.</v>

241
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 1>They have a fish camp and they put this generator,</v>

242
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>they set it up and then they attach these tubes to it and they stick to tubes in</v>

243
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 1>the creek and the water coming down the creek goes through the tubes.</v>

244
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:49.570
<v Speaker 1>And by the time it,</v>

245
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>it focuses in this one area,</v>

247
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it's spins this thing around and start to generate.</v>

248
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I want that,</v>

249
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I want to get that crazy.</v>

252
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Got Electricity 100% from the creek spinning this generator.</v>

253
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 2>So as long as this generator keeps working,</v>

254
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 2>he had his lights on the whole,</v>

255
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.191
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

256

<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

257
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.680
<v Speaker 1>That really is the one thing that you need is like power.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

259
00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:13.230
<v Speaker 1>it really is the one thing that separates us from animals.</v>

260
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Well we've somehow or another just accepted that that's going to be around even</v>

261
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 2>though it's only been here for 150 years or whatever the hell it's been.</v>

262
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 2>We were so used to it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

292
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.490
<v Speaker 2>I was already out of there but that was like a one two punch of like sad fuck</v>

293
00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

294
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.570
<v Speaker 2>A blizzard.</v>

295
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.210
<v Speaker 2>And the really scary things that they're saying.</v>

296
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:28.901
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

297
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:30.250
<v Speaker 2>who's the governor Cuomo?</v>

298
00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Cuomo.</v>

299
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

300
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

301
00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:32.224
<v Speaker 2>He's a good guy though.</v>

302
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.160
<v Speaker 2>He seems like a good guy.</v>

303
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.390
<v Speaker 2>He said something really interesting.</v>

304
00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:34.661
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

305
00:07:34.661 --> 00:07:36.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to use the term climate change.</v>

306
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting,</v>

307
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing him because it's such a loaded topic.</v>

308
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.361
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

309
00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:41.260
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

310
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.900
<v Speaker 2>his father had to deal with in 12 years,</v>

311
00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:46.270
<v Speaker 2>he had to deal with two major storm events.</v>

312
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.020
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

313
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I've been here for 12 months and I've had to deal with three.</v>

314
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

315
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:50.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

316
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.820
<v Speaker 2>so he's saying like,</v>

317
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:52.510
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

318
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.440
<v Speaker 2>it's very possible.</v>

319
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Something's going on</v>

320
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

321
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely something going on that's never happened in New York</v>

322
00:07:57.781 --> 00:07:58.350
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

323
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.621
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

324
00:07:58.621 --> 00:07:59.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

325
00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

326
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.270
<v Speaker 1>a buddy of mine,</v>

327
00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I assume you know him too,</v>

328
00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:02.880
<v Speaker 1>a big Jay Oakerson.</v>

329
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

330
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.560
<v Speaker 1>He's a great of him.</v>

331
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.221
<v Speaker 1>Do you know of him?</v>

332
00:08:05.221 --> 00:08:05.461
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

333
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

334
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.720
<v Speaker 1>You probably haven't worked with them yet,</v>

335
00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but really funny guys toured with me a couple of times.</v>

336
00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:10.200
<v Speaker 1>His house was wiped out.</v>

337
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 1>He was like in the flood is flood zones zone A,</v>

338
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:13.443
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

339
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.720
<v Speaker 1>it really is weird.</v>

341
00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Like when a flood comes at your house.</v>

342
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:18.331
<v Speaker 1>So I'm lucky.</v>

343
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I like lift up,</v>

344
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.360
<v Speaker 1>up in that is skyscrapers.</v>

346
00:08:21.361 --> 00:08:24.390
<v Speaker 1>But the scary part about that is like if the power goes out then you're like</v>

347
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:26.970
<v Speaker 1>trying to kind of stuck up there until like,</v>

348
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

349
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens.</v>

350
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.570
<v Speaker 1>So you're stuck up there until the water drains out.</v>

351
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.261
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

352
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:31.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

353
00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:33.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like a skeleton,</v>

354
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.050
<v Speaker 1>basically born.</v>

356
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the theory that it was a terrorist attack and I think all the</v>

357
00:08:40.051 --> 00:08:40.990
<v Speaker 1>terrorists are now high.</v>

358
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Whether ladies with beards,</v>

359
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.210
<v Speaker 1>a Neptune,</v>

360
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.043
<v Speaker 1>Lawton.</v>

361
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Well your first part made sense.</v>

362
00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:49.830
<v Speaker 1>The second part just like your Hitler cat with a fucking dynamite strapped to</v>

363
00:08:49.831 --> 00:08:50.281
<v Speaker 1>his chest.</v>

364
00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:51.114
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're trying.</v>

365
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people were just basically milling around a lot like fires,</v>

366
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:56.911
<v Speaker 1>you know on the street.</v>

367
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Like people making fires and quicken out on the street,</v>

368
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.210
<v Speaker 1>which I think they should allow them to do that.</v>

369
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Well why not?</v>

370
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

371
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 1>you keep a sense of a social,</v>

372
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 1>the exact connectedness.</v>

373
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.233
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

374
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.670
<v Speaker 1>it was bad with their food shortages.</v>

375
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 1>A supermarket or a question like the first night,</v>

376
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>like everybody prepped in terms of like,</v>

377
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>you better buy milk and bread.</v>

378
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>They always say that milk and bread,</v>

379
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:20.431
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

380
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:20.671
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

381
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:21.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

382
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

383
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.070
<v Speaker 1>which we're it French toast that we make.</v>

384
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>And then like the next day,</v>

385
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:27.001
<v Speaker 1>you know that you're like,</v>

386
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:27.271
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

387
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:28.104
<v Speaker 1>there'll be more,</v>

388
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:28.771
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

389
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing left.</v>

390
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>All the people from downtown who didn't have access to food came uptown like a</v>

391
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>horde and like,</v>

392
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

393
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:35.601
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

394
00:09:35.601 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 1>A watchman call it,</v>

395
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>it was good that they did it because they had no food and they kind of swept</v>

396
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>through all the Bodega's and stuff like that.</v>

397
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 1>So it was like wiped out,</v>

398
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

399
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.523
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

400
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.980
<v Speaker 1>That must have been strange.</v>

401
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

403
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 1>like you always assume in America there's going to be food.</v>

404
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

405
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is the cell phone towers were down,</v>

406
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:51.684
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

407
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Even if you had a cell phone,</v>

408
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't call anybody.</v>

409
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 1>My friend Tommy said he drove,</v>

410
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 1>he drove six hours to make a cell phone call.</v>

411
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>You got to just drive around until he could find service.</v>

412
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 1>But it was six hours before.</v>

413
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.170
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

414
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

415
